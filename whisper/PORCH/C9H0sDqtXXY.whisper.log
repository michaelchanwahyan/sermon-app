[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:18.600]   All right, let's go, let's go, let's go.
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.200]   How we doing tonight, Porch?
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.320]   Hey, I wanna give a quick welcome to those
[00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.100]   tuning in live with us, some of our locations.
[00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.760]   We have Philly, Phoenix, Fayetteville,
[00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.000]   and of course, hello to my friends here in the room
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.820]   at the Porch on this beautiful Tuesday night.
[00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.880]   If we haven't met, my name is JD.
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.240]   I'm on staff here at Watermark Community Church,
[00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.520]   and I get to serve every single Tuesday night
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.800]   here at the Porch, and I absolutely love it.
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.720]   However, I'm usually in that chair producing the services,
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.560]   but this is my first time teaching the Word,
[00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.160]   and I could not be more excited.
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.000]   Okay, let's go.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.120]   But here's the deal.
[00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.000]   I thought, man, how am I gonna start this night?
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.440]   And I don't know you guys, you don't know me,
[00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.480]   and so I thought I'd go ahead and just start from the bottom
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:02.960]   and maybe we'll get here.
[00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.800]   So I think we all have that moment in life
[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.280]   that we can all resonate with where we say,
[00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.560]   yeah, that probably wasn't my best moment.
[00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.040]   And for me, it was the start of my college years.
[00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.080]   Here I was, small town kid, big dreams, wide eyes,
[00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.160]   heading to the notorious Stephen F. Austin State University.
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.600]   And really?
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.520]   Okay, ax 'em, baby.
[00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.960]   And I go there and I'm a music major my whole life.
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.480]   I was a band nerd and yeah, band people.
[00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:38.200]   And oh my gosh, too early, wait, bring it down.
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.160]   Not there yet.
[00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.400]   Okay, they're already messing with me.
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.880]   I work on a production team, these are my friends.
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.880]   But hey, so what happened was is I get to the university
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.080]   and I have these kind of like, okay, I think I'm the guy.
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.440]   And I quickly realized, dude, you're in the band.
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.560]   You're not the guy.
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.640]   And one of those memories in band
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.920]   where we were sitting there, I'm in my uniform,
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.200]   picture me about 25 pounds heavier, curly hair.
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.800]   And I'm at the front, I'm at the end of the field
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.720]   and this guy walks up, he's a sports photographer,
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.240]   one of those big lenses, you know what I'm talking about?
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.440]   And he gets over there and he's like,
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.160]   "Hey you, throw up the ax and smile."
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.000]   And I was like, I'm gonna give you way more
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.080]   than a smile, pal.
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.400]   And I grabbed this cute girl and I'm like,
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.600]   "On the count of three, jump, throw the ax."
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.960]   And so I'm like, one, two, three, jump in the air,
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.280]   the picture you just saw.
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.880]   And okay, you can take it down.
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.320]   And I'm like, yeah, yeah, when I say.
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.520]   And so I'm sitting there and I jump up in the air
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.440]   and the guy takes the photo and leaves.
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.360]   And I'm like, but I guess I'll never see that again.
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.160]   Well, quickly I go through the year,
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.120]   kind of recognize, okay, I'm not much of a band guy.
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.960]   It just wasn't me.
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.040]   I tried, I tried to force it, just wasn't happening.
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.200]   So I got rid of the major, changed my wardrobe,
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.440]   fixed my haircut, started working out a little bit.
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:48.400]   I know you're like, really?
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.440]   But I did, and I'm heading into sophomore year
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:52.680]   kind of feeling myself.
[00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.760]   And I'm like walking in, I'm like, okay, new year, new me,
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.680]   a new rendition of the JD.
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.080]   And I walk up and I remember it was a day like any other.
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.080]   And I get tagged in all these photos on Facebook.
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.920]   And the photo that you see now was that photo.
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.520]   It came back to haunt me.
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.600]   And here's how it was told.
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.600]   This cute girl comes up to me and she's like,
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.320]   hey, you know, and I'm a freshman.
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.680]   I'm like, yeah, she's like, and I'm like,
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.520]   I'm like, cool, like, you know, how you doing?
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.280]   And she says, you know, I think I know you.
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.280]   I was like, oh, you don't.
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.760]   But I mean, obviously there's a connection we cannot deny.
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.080]   And she says, no, no, I definitely know you.
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.800]   Wait, you're that band guy on that photo.
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.240]   And what you don't realize is that photo
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.160]   is actually the acceptance letter to let people know
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.240]   that they were coming to SFA.
[00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:42.720]   And not only was it a photo of me jumping in the air,
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.480]   looking like a weirdo, what it also was,
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.480]   was when you opened it, it was like, congrats,
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.200]   and confetti popped out.
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.480]   And so I was literally sent all over the world.
[00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.240]   And no matter how much I try to change,
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.560]   no matter how much I worked out,
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.560]   no matter what I did, every single semester
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.120]   for the entirety of my college years,
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.360]   freshmen would come up to me like, you're the guy.
[00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.320]   And I'm like, I'm not that guy anymore.
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:10.520]   And deep down though, I mean, here I am 26,
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.800]   in this moment, I've had a few job experiences,
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.800]   and I still can't deny somewhere deep, deep down,
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.520]   I'm still that guy.
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:21.960]   I'm still living kind of like, man,
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:23.440]   I think in the back of my mind,
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.280]   that best moment is still kind of now,
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.880]   it's still somewhere in me.
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.680]   And that's kind of, I think, how we all feel at times,
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.920]   like, man, they're all coming in here with a time
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.920]   that, man, we could describe it as that moment
[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.360]   wasn't my best moment.
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.200]   And when I was writing this,
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.800]   I couldn't help but think of a few celebrities
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.640]   that could probably say the same thing.
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.600]   Some I put down here, we have Miley Cyrus,
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.920]   from Hannah Montana to that.
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.080]   We have Britney Spears, from Blondie to Baldie.
[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.440]   We have another low moment, I believe is, what is it?
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:59.280]   David Marvin, I mean, talk about, I mean, who is that guy?
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.120]   Talk about a low moment.
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.640]   Okay, God restores.
[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:08.360]   And then what I also put here, I have Kanye West.
[00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.040]   You know, now you know him as Jesus King,
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.880]   but don't forget at one time, he'd had not his best moment,
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.680]   where he went and stole the award show
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.200]   and made fun of Taylor Swift and his drunken self.
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.280]   And then last but not least, I have Tiger Woods,
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.440]   who just won the massive, but at one time
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.760]   was known for his mugshot for getting a DUI.
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.600]   And I know that we're laughing,
[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.200]   and I kind of come in with kind of this example,
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.560]   innocent, silly example, but reality is,
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.680]   we all, like I said, have a defining moment
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.960]   that we go, man, I don't wanna be reminded of that.
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.840]   That wasn't my best moment.
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.720]   That was definitely, I took an L.
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.180]   Like that was a season of intense failure.
[00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:48.320]   Some of you all walk into this place tonight
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.300]   and you're going, that's me now.
[00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:51.560]   I'm in that season.
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.660]   You're coming in here tonight and you're going, man,
[00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:59.240]   if only the people in this place knew how bad it is,
[00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.080]   they'd go running.
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.040]   They'd be like, get out of here.
[00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.920]   Some of you are coming here tonight,
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.520]   having made huge mistakes that you've never told anyone,
[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.480]   that you're thinking right now, I swear to you,
[00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.920]   I am taking that to the grave.
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.600]   No one's ever gonna know,
[00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.520]   'cause that will redefine me for the rest of my life.
[00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.600]   If my parents knew, if my friends knew,
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:20.760]   if you knew, you wouldn't want anything to do with me.
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:21.800]   And it's heavy.
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.840]   And I don't want you to think,
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.900]   just 'cause I'm up here speaking on a stage
[00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:28.160]   and talking to you about the Bible,
[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.680]   that I haven't been where you are
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:34.000]   and that I'm not where you are, 'cause that's all of us.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.040]   If there's anything that we have in this room more common
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.600]   than the fact that we are loved by God,
[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:41.700]   it's that we all make mistakes.
[00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:42.760]   We all fail.
[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:45.560]   And so tonight, I wanna talk about,
[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:47.440]   what do you do with that?
[00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.760]   What do you do when you can't seem to define your failures
[00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:53.200]   so they start to define you?
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.320]   What do you do in the midst of hardship and pain
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:59.280]   and mistake after mistake?
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:04.280]   Because honestly, how you respond to failure in your life
[00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:07.200]   really defines your life.
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:08.600]   And if you don't know how to,
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:12.660]   your life is gonna be just full of anxiety,
[00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:16.580]   confusion, a weight, a pressure.
[00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:17.940]   And some of you might be experiencing that
[00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:19.440]   and you don't even realize it.
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:23.220]   So tonight, I wanna talk about some truths about failure.
[00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:24.760]   And if you're joining us for the first time,
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:25.900]   we're in a series called "Bloodline."
[00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:27.980]   We've been kind of highlighting key figures
[00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:30.820]   through the Old Testament that kind of made the bloodline
[00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:32.460]   that led to the example of Jesus.
[00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:35.580]   We hit Adam, a man that literally walked with God
[00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:37.900]   on the earth, lived in perfect harmony with God.
[00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:40.080]   There at the very beginning, God looked at him and said,
[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:41.160]   "Man, you're my child.
[00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.640]   "We have this perfect thing going."
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:46.760]   And then boom, major failure, not his best moment,
[00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:49.520]   changed the trajectory for all of mankind.
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:53.120]   Abraham, a man known by faith, remarkable faith,
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:56.120]   but at the same time, didn't even believe
[00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:58.620]   that God would give him a son like he said he would.
[00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:01.000]   So he sleeps with his wife's servant.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.840]   At one time, he does this weird thing
[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:04.480]   where he disguises his wife as his sister
[00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:05.320]   to save his own back.
[00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:06.840]   He actually does it twice.
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:09.260]   And we see him also lack faith in moments,
[00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:10.960]   not his best moment.
[00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:13.960]   And tonight, we're gonna talk about my favorite character
[00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:16.200]   in the Bible, someone that I would say is probably,
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:20.000]   if not one of, if not the most famous character
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.280]   in the Old Testament, and his name is David.
[00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:25.460]   And David, a lot of you come in here and you go,
[00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:26.560]   "I think I've heard of David."
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:27.720]   Maybe like if you've heard of him,
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:30.040]   you've probably heard of David and Goliath.
[00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:32.640]   The David that conquered the giant,
[00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:34.380]   came up the little shepherd boy,
[00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:37.780]   was anointed to be King of Israel, the righteous King,
[00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:39.300]   the one they'd all been waiting for.
[00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:41.240]   He goes up to the nine foot Philistine,
[00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:42.900]   says, "In the name of the Lord, I'm gonna conquer you."
[00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:44.380]   Goes over, chops off his head
[00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:46.160]   after he does the slingshot thing.
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.540]   And all of this amazing moment,
[00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:50.020]   Israel, after his courage, follows pursuit,
[00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:53.540]   charges after the Philistines, conquers them.
[00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:55.180]   They follow his example.
[00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:57.740]   He's a ruling king, a righteous king.
[00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:00.580]   That's the David that we tend to know.
[00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:02.260]   But there's actually a part of David's life tonight
[00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.860]   that I wanna talk about that is a David
[00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:06.260]   that relates to a lot more of us.
[00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.460]   It's a David, it's a part of David's life
[00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:11.180]   that was defined by failure.
[00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:14.820]   And so tonight, I wanna talk about
[00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:18.460]   two things that are always true about failure.
[00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:22.940]   Two things that are always true about failure.
[00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:24.900]   And I wanna do that by looking specifically
[00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:25.740]   at the life of David.
[00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:26.700]   So if you have your Bibles,
[00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:30.540]   turn with me to 2 Samuel chapter 11.
[00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:33.900]   2 Samuel chapter 11.
[00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:37.340]   So like I said, David at this point is crushing it.
[00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:39.180]   Everything's going his way.
[00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:42.100]   And now Samuel, the plot thickens.
[00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:43.540]   He comes in on this moment
[00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:45.440]   that is a lot like a soap opera, you'll see.
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:50.180]   So in the spring of the year,
[00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:53.260]   the time when kings go out to battle,
[00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.340]   David sent Joab and his servants with him
[00:09:56.340 --> 00:10:00.020]   and all Israel, and they ravaged the Ammonites
[00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:05.020]   and besieged Rabbah, but David remained in Jerusalem.
[00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:08.660]   So pause, real quick, I hope you see it.
[00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:11.620]   He's writing here, Samuel's saying,
[00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:14.420]   "A time when the kings," David,
[00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:16.620]   "are supposed to go out to battle,
[00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:19.340]   "but David remained in Jerusalem."
[00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:21.220]   It's kind of like when we are supposed to go to work
[00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:22.780]   and we call in sick, that's what David's doing.
[00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:23.800]   He's like, "I know I'm the king.
[00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:26.620]   "Don't feel like going to war today, you guys got it."
[00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:30.180]   Verse two, "It happened late one afternoon."
[00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:31.700]   I love that, I love that imagery.
[00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:34.340]   It's like, "It happened late one afternoon."
[00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:36.340]   There he was.
[00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:39.020]   "When David arose from his couch."
[00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:41.100]   And so if this was David in 2019,
[00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:41.940]   he's probably sitting there,
[00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:43.620]   he's probably hit a jewel a couple of times.
[00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:45.740]   Ladies, he's probably like on his fourth white claw,
[00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:49.480]   and he's sitting there, I don't know, drinking wine,
[00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:51.480]   watching "The Bachelor," whatever it is.
[00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:56.020]   And then he goes walking on the roof,
[00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:58.420]   and he's walking on the roof of the king's house,
[00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:02.460]   and there he saw from the roof a woman bathing.
[00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:03.740]   It's getting steamy.
[00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:07.140]   And the woman was very beautiful.
[00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:08.100]   I love that emphasis.
[00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:10.060]   And the woman, she wasn't just pretty,
[00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:12.220]   she was very beautiful.
[00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:13.300]   She was smoking.
[00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:14.980]   This is the moment where David's walking around,
[00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:16.220]   he's chilling on the roof like,
[00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:19.340]   do, do, do, do, do, and he's like, "Aruga!"
[00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:20.940]   That's that moment for him, okay?
[00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:24.300]   I mean, he sees this woman bathing on the roof,
[00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:28.220]   and he's like, "Okay, who is this?
[00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:29.420]   "Let's keep on reading."
[00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:30.620]   Ooh, it's getting good.
[00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:33.660]   And David sent and inquired about the woman.
[00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:35.980]   Clearly the man had no game, had to send a wingman,
[00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:39.620]   and he says, "Hey."
[00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:42.000]   The wingman comes back and says,
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.060]   "I don't need to go down there.
[00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:46.340]   "Is not this Bathsheba, the daughter of Elion,
[00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:48.020]   "the wife of Uriah, the Hittite?"
[00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:48.920]   Basically what he's saying is,
[00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:50.980]   "Yo, man, remember the bro code.
[00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:53.620]   "This is someone else's woman."
[00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:55.100]   And David said, don't care, he said,
[00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:56.700]   "So David sent messengers.
[00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:57.920]   "He took," what wasn't his,
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:01.480]   "He took her, and she came to him, and he lay with her.
[00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:03.800]   "Then she returned to her house, and the woman conceived,
[00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:07.260]   "and she sent and told David, 'I'm pregnant.'"
[00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.780]   Awkward.
[00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:12.780]   She comes to him, imagine, she's like, "Hey, David."
[00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:15.180]   He's like, "Oh, you back for round two?"
[00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:18.040]   And she's like, "Actually, no, I'm pregnant."
[00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:20.620]   So David immediately, can you imagine the heat
[00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:22.240]   he must have felt in that moment?
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:23.380]   Just sweating.
[00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:26.540]   So he's like, "I have to cover this up.
[00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:29.980]   "This is my, I don't fail, I'm the righteous king.
[00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:32.420]   "That's not who the Lord made me to be."
[00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:34.680]   So immediately he calls Uriah, her husband,
[00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:36.580]   off the battlegrounds and says,
[00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:38.500]   "Hey, I'm gonna get you really drunk,
[00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:40.260]   "have you go sleep with your wife,
[00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.680]   "so that way you wake up, she conceives,
[00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:44.540]   "and you think that's your baby."
[00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:46.260]   Perfect plan.
[00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.580]   But Uriah, being the man of character that he was,
[00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:51.100]   he comes, dines with the king,
[00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:52.580]   and when the king sends him to go have sex
[00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:53.680]   with his own wife, he says,
[00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:56.280]   "I can't go do that when my brothers are out at war.
[00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:58.680]   "You expect me to go sleep with my wife
[00:12:58.680 --> 00:12:59.900]   "while they're all out there fighting
[00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:02.080]   "on behalf of our nation?"
[00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:03.700]   It's like, that's crazy.
[00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:08.700]   So David will do anything to shut him up,
[00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:11.840]   to not expose himself, and so he tells the commander
[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:14.320]   to put Uriah on the front lines back in the war,
[00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:16.320]   and we all know what happens on the front lines,
[00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:17.300]   he was killed.
[00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:21.260]   I mean, can you imagine this moment?
[00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.840]   The man just committed murder,
[00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:27.700]   and it all began because he was at home
[00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:30.020]   when he should have been at war.
[00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:31.660]   Which leads me to my first point.
[00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:35.020]   The first thing that's always true about our failure
[00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:38.860]   is we fail when we don't go to war.
[00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:42.780]   We fail when we don't go to war.
[00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:46.260]   Here's the reality, just like David physically
[00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:49.180]   was not where he was supposed to be in the action,
[00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:52.280]   in the war zone, being the king that he was called to be,
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:55.020]   so you and I have to wake up every day,
[00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:57.460]   and we have to walk in what we're called to be.
[00:13:57.460 --> 00:14:00.180]   We have to understand that we are stepping into a war,
[00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:02.080]   and the moment that you get up and you don't realize
[00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:05.660]   that you are in a war, you're going to fail.
[00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:07.700]   It happens every single time.
[00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:09.820]   So the first thing I want you to recognize
[00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:12.740]   is that you are in a war.
[00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:15.940]   And you have to ask yourself,
[00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:19.300]   what, come on, David, why all of this?
[00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:22.120]   And clearly he's having an internal struggle,
[00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:24.820]   a war going on inside of him first and foremost,
[00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:27.400]   and that war is called the need to feed
[00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:29.760]   what we call a sinful nature.
[00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:33.500]   A sinful nature, you and I both have it.
[00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:35.460]   It's the thing that wars inside of you.
[00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:37.480]   You didn't have to get this thing,
[00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:38.860]   you didn't have to create this thing,
[00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:41.640]   it was just born in you ever since the garden.
[00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:44.300]   Here's a really simple way to talk about a sinful nature.
[00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:45.760]   When you leave here today, you're gonna be like,
[00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:47.220]   that was so awesome, go God,
[00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:49.020]   and you're gonna get in your car,
[00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:50.060]   and you're gonna get in the parking lot,
[00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:52.260]   and you're gonna wait in a line,
[00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:56.020]   and at first you're like, kind of all joy, okay?
[00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:58.020]   And you're gonna play your worship music,
[00:14:58.020 --> 00:14:59.080]   and suddenly you're gonna be like,
[00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:03.060]   all right, it's been 15 minutes, I'm hungry,
[00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:04.780]   and you're gonna immediately start getting angry,
[00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:06.600]   and the parking guy is just like, yeah,
[00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:09.660]   and you're like, man, go away!
[00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:10.940]   That anger right there,
[00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:13.260]   no one did anything to make you have that,
[00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.300]   you literally just have a sinful nature.
[00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:18.860]   You have it, I have it, David had it.
[00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:23.880]   And so, the reason why that is,
[00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:26.360]   is because there are three things in your whole life
[00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:28.940]   that you're gonna be searching to feed.
[00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:31.760]   You're gonna be wanting to feed the desire
[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:35.900]   to have security, significance, and satisfaction.
[00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:38.240]   I remind myself of that often.
[00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:41.360]   JD, remember, every day you are searching for security,
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:43.120]   significance, and satisfaction,
[00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:44.740]   and what are you gonna find it in?
[00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:48.180]   What are you gonna choose today to find those things in?
[00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:51.260]   For some of us, we're looking for security
[00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:54.340]   in our finances and how much money we can make,
[00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:56.700]   the job position that we have so we keep climbing
[00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:58.580]   because, man, that's gonna provide for me,
[00:15:58.580 --> 00:15:59.660]   that's gonna provide for my family,
[00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:01.700]   we're gonna have the house and the kodosack.
[00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:03.900]   Some of you are gonna look for significance
[00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:05.380]   in that dating relationship.
[00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:07.620]   Man, think about all the comments, the goals,
[00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:08.700]   relationship goals that we're gonna get
[00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:10.020]   when we post that picture,
[00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:11.840]   and then one day it's gonna lead to marriage,
[00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:15.740]   and I'm gonna have a constant just source of significance.
[00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:19.140]   And some of you are looking to feed satisfaction
[00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:20.140]   through quick fixes,
[00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:22.060]   anything to make you feel something in the moment,
[00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:23.860]   whether it's going out, getting high,
[00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:26.500]   having a one-night stand for the adrenaline rush,
[00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:29.260]   looking at porn, whatever it is,
[00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:30.280]   we're all searching for it.
[00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:32.220]   I know for me right now in this season,
[00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:35.580]   I feed those things in the form of anxiety.
[00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:37.420]   I feed anxiety.
[00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:38.420]   And here's why.
[00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:40.020]   I want God to be proud of me.
[00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:41.320]   There's some void in me often
[00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:43.840]   when I am not getting up and going to war
[00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:45.960]   that I think God isn't proud of me,
[00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:46.980]   so I need to do more.
[00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:48.820]   I need to climb a ladder and achieve more
[00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:50.160]   so God will be proud of me.
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:53.440]   And when I don't feel like God is proud of me,
[00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:55.400]   when I'm not going to war,
[00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:57.320]   here's what I do.
[00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:59.320]   I turn to others,
[00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:02.440]   and I do things to get their attention, to get a laugh.
[00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:05.480]   I look for affirmation from flirting with girls.
[00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:07.640]   I go and I work out.
[00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:09.100]   I push myself pretty hard.
[00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:10.440]   I know you probably can't tell,
[00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:12.360]   but I do try.
[00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:14.220]   And it's also I can feel good about my body
[00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:16.520]   and the way I can walk into a room
[00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:20.480]   and not have to constantly compare myself to everyone else.
[00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:22.920]   I go to leaders and I do things in front of them
[00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:25.200]   so I get an attaboy.
[00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:26.520]   And it's so short-lived.
[00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:28.200]   And I've just realized,
[00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:29.520]   no matter what it's been in my life,
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:32.640]   every time I go to war to feed myself,
[00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:35.960]   it's never enough.
[00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:37.360]   And for you,
[00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:38.920]   you might be looking to feed yourself
[00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:41.500]   in that sinful nature through porn, sex,
[00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:43.500]   the things that I've said, one night stands,
[00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:46.300]   that dating app, that marriage, I don't know,
[00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:48.100]   but it's never going to be enough.
[00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:49.640]   And you need to ask yourself,
[00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:53.380]   when am I prone to fall to this?
[00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:55.060]   When is my rooftop moment?
[00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:58.560]   When am I like David strolling around
[00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:01.700]   looking to feed this hunger?
[00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:06.120]   When am I on the couch, bored, watching sports, home alone,
[00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:08.500]   looking over my computer, knowing where it will lead me
[00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:09.860]   and sitting there and contemplating?
[00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:12.020]   Like, when am I doing that?
[00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:13.340]   And ask yourself,
[00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:17.180]   what is the rooftop moment?
[00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:18.980]   What is the couch moment in your life
[00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:21.700]   that you are sitting there apathetic
[00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:23.620]   and you're not getting up and you're not fighting
[00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:26.680]   and going to war against your sinful nature?
[00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:29.220]   A lot of times, the reason why we do that,
[00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:30.500]   we think we have to feed ourselves
[00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:34.060]   because we don't think that God has enough to feed us.
[00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:39.000]   We don't think that God wants to give us all we need.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.800]   We think oftentimes that God
[00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:42.460]   is withholding something from us.
[00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:45.740]   Like, he's just like, "Mm-mm, not today."
[00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:47.840]   And that's just not who he is.
[00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:50.240]   But I'll tell you this,
[00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:54.380]   there's also someone else going to war every day,
[00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:55.480]   and it's the devil.
[00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:59.080]   And he's going to war, whether you realize it or not,
[00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:01.640]   whether you're ready or not, here he comes.
[00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:03.320]   And when he's watching you and he's going,
[00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:04.880]   look at him feeding their sinful nature,
[00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:06.720]   they must think that God's withholding from them.
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:08.520]   They must think that God's not enough.
[00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:10.720]   Man, I bet right now they have open hands
[00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:12.560]   looking for anything to feed that desire.
[00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:16.920]   He will always put something in your hands
[00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:18.600]   because that's what he does.
[00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:22.960]   The devil is going to war, whether you're ready or not.
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:24.560]   First Peter 5, 8 through 9 says,
[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:27.300]   "Be sober-minded, be watchful.
[00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:29.780]   "Your adversary, the devil, he prowls around
[00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:33.560]   "like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour.
[00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:35.200]   "Resist him firm in your faith,
[00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:36.800]   "knowing that the same kinds of suffering
[00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:38.660]   "are being experienced by your brotherhood
[00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:40.560]   "throughout the world."
[00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:44.280]   John 10, 10 says, "The thief, the devil,
[00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:47.940]   "he comes only to steal and kill and destroy,
[00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:51.660]   "but I came that you may have life and have it abundantly."
[00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:55.760]   That is God saying, "Hello, I have enough for you.
[00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:58.100]   "I'm not withholding for you.
[00:19:58.100 --> 00:19:59.700]   "And what sometimes you think you want,
[00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:01.040]   "if I gave that to you,
[00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:03.960]   "it would actually lead to you killing a guy, David.
[00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:05.500]   "So why don't you trust that I'm gonna give you
[00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:09.020]   "what you need in the time that you need it."
[00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:11.660]   And in that waiting though, the devil is watching
[00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:14.100]   and he's prowling and he's creeping.
[00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:17.500]   And he's in a war and he's looking for those
[00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:19.660]   who aren't fighting, who are vulnerable,
[00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:22.200]   like a lion sitting there watching.
[00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:25.300]   He's looking for the weak gazelle, the baby.
[00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:28.300]   And that's the one he attacks.
[00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:30.540]   He's looking for people who aren't getting up
[00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:32.400]   and going into the war.
[00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:36.620]   And so you need to get up and you need to wake up.
[00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:38.180]   He's looking to take from you.
[00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:40.820]   He'll make it seem like he wants to give you something,
[00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:42.340]   something that will satisfy,
[00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:45.940]   but I promise slowly but surely it's only taking.
[00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:47.020]   And here's how he does it.
[00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:50.340]   The enemy will minimize your sin before you commit it,
[00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:53.360]   and he will maximize it after you've done it.
[00:20:55.420 --> 00:21:00.020]   The enemy, hear me, the enemy will minimize your sin
[00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:03.780]   before you commit it and maximize it after you've done it.
[00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:06.180]   That's why you're afraid to tell people.
[00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:08.500]   That's why you're walking around in a facade,
[00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:09.840]   faking it all the time,
[00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:13.820]   because you know you listened to him again.
[00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:15.860]   You believe the whisper.
[00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:16.900]   He's sitting there and he's like,
[00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:20.440]   "Man, if you just, you know, I know that,"
[00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:24.660]   or you know that every time you text that ex
[00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:26.640]   who only wanted something from you,
[00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:29.060]   that that only leads to him
[00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:31.700]   taking something from you physically,
[00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:34.580]   but the enemy's gonna sit there and go, "Come on.
[00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:36.540]   It's just, he just texted you.
[00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:37.660]   Just text him back.
[00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:38.780]   He just wants to hang out.
[00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:41.100]   Maybe this time he'll actually listen.
[00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:43.180]   Maybe this time he'll actually want a real relationship
[00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:44.620]   and not just sex."
[00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:48.580]   And then every time you find yourself,
[00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:53.220]   you give in and on that drive home, he's screaming at you.
[00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:55.060]   Look at what you did.
[00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:56.860]   You worthless, pathetic.
[00:21:56.860 --> 00:21:57.940]   Here you go again.
[00:21:57.940 --> 00:21:59.660]   You're not worthy of a good love life.
[00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:01.380]   You're not worthy of a happy marriage
[00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:04.300]   because you just keep going back to this.
[00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:06.500]   And that's why you're afraid,
[00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:10.140]   because you're listening to that roar of the lion
[00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:11.420]   that is our enemy.
[00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:13.660]   And it is time that our generation,
[00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:15.620]   it is time that we as young adults
[00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:19.880]   stop letting the Satan have a voice in our life
[00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:22.620]   and in our culture and in our society.
[00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:25.300]   And it's time that we stop giving him opportunities
[00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:27.860]   to come and feed us nothing but lies.
[00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:30.020]   But he's going to every time.
[00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:32.180]   So you have to get up and you have to go to war.
[00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:34.260]   And here's how you do that.
[00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:37.780]   First, we do that with taking hold of our weapons
[00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:40.340]   and God's given us weapons 'cause he's a good God
[00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:42.620]   who wants good things for us, life and life to the full.
[00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:46.260]   The first weapon he gives us is God's word.
[00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:50.300]   I have wanted to say this for a long time to people my age.
[00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:57.140]   It is time that we bring the Bible back.
[00:22:57.140 --> 00:23:02.660]   It is time that we start turning back to the word of God.
[00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:06.180]   Because what I see right now is a generation
[00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:08.220]   that does not know truth.
[00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:10.420]   And they are falling every day to lies
[00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:12.240]   because they don't know truth.
[00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:15.540]   Right now, some of you, you are believing a lie
[00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:17.640]   simply because you don't know truth.
[00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:18.760]   You're walking in darkness
[00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:20.860]   and you think you're walking in the light.
[00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:23.080]   But you're being deceived.
[00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:25.460]   And so I want you to know that this right here
[00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:27.420]   is not just some rule book.
[00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:29.460]   This isn't something God gave for people
[00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:31.900]   who wanna become Christians to just follow some law
[00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:33.700]   and be like, "Bad, how dare you?"
[00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:35.740]   That's not what this is.
[00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:38.780]   I'll tell you, I just recently
[00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:41.740]   started taking the word of God seriously in my life.
[00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:43.980]   And it's changed everything.
[00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:48.360]   This is how you have life and have it abundantly.
[00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:53.880]   I always say, you don't know a line is crooked
[00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:56.200]   until you see a straight line.
[00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:58.260]   Until you see a straight line,
[00:23:58.260 --> 00:24:00.040]   you don't know the line's crooked.
[00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:00.960]   It's the same.
[00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:04.040]   Until you see the truth, I mean, really see it
[00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:05.520]   the way God intended for you to,
[00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:07.560]   until you become a steward of the word,
[00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:08.700]   you get around people, some of you are going,
[00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:10.520]   "Man, I wouldn't even know where to start."
[00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:12.560]   Just start.
[00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:13.880]   Open up the book of John.
[00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:15.360]   Just read the life of Jesus.
[00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:17.520]   Get around people in this building right here.
[00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:19.600]   Come up to the front, find someone in a port shirt
[00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:21.480]   and just say, "I don't know how to read my Bible."
[00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:23.720]   I promise they will put you on the right direction,
[00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:26.260]   but just start.
[00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:27.720]   This is a weapon.
[00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:31.280]   Ephesians 6 says, "Put on the whole armor of God
[00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:32.680]   "that you may be able to stand
[00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:34.400]   "against the schemes of the devil."
[00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:36.760]   He goes on to say more specifically in verse 17,
[00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:38.440]   "And take the helmet of salvation
[00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:41.400]   "and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God."
[00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:43.080]   If you're gonna go to battle, you better have a weapon.
[00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:44.380]   You better have your sword.
[00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:46.180]   And that sword is the word of God.
[00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:49.200]   It is enough and it will go before you
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:50.900]   and fight for you on your behalf
[00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:53.720]   because this right here is God.
[00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:57.480]   And so start using it.
[00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:59.200]   Start knowing it.
[00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:00.300]   Start reading it.
[00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:04.200]   The second thing that we can use as a weapon in the battle
[00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:05.800]   is God's people.
[00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:07.320]   I love this part of the story.
[00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:11.480]   We see that David just murdered Uriah,
[00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:13.140]   had him killed and all these different things.
[00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:15.640]   And then God sends a prophet by the name of Nathan
[00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:19.920]   to come and basically wake up David
[00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:22.040]   and say, "Hey, you've gotten out of the war."
[00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:25.480]   And here's what he says in 2 Samuel 12, verse one.
[00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:28.000]   "And the Lord sent Nathan to David.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.560]   "He came to him and said to him,
[00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:31.840]   "there were two men in a certain city."
[00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:34.200]   Man, he totally finesses David right here.
[00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:35.040]   Here we go.
[00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:36.080]   "There were two men in a certain city,
[00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:38.340]   "the one rich and the other poor.
[00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:40.900]   "The rich man had very many flocks and herds,
[00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:44.760]   "but the poor man had nothing but one little ewe lamb,
[00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:46.240]   "which he had bought.
[00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:48.480]   "And he brought it up and he grew up with him
[00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:50.180]   "and with his children.
[00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:52.580]   "He used to eat of his morsel and drink from his cup
[00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:53.680]   "and lie in his arms.
[00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:56.340]   "And it was like a daughter to him.
[00:25:56.340 --> 00:25:59.640]   "Now there came a traveler to the rich man.
[00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:01.440]   "And he was unwilling to take one of his own flock
[00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:04.360]   "or herd to prepare for the guests who had come to him.
[00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:06.560]   "But he took the poor man's one lamb
[00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:09.200]   "and prepared it for the man who had come to him.
[00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:10.840]   "And then David, boiling with anger,
[00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:12.300]   "was greatly kindled against the man.
[00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:14.800]   "And he said to Nathan, 'As the Lord lives,
[00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:17.300]   "'the man who has done this deserves to die.
[00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:19.160]   "'And he shall restore the lamb fourfold
[00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:20.420]   "'because he had done this thing
[00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:21.900]   "'and because he had no pity.'
[00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:24.800]   "And Nathan looked at David like a good brother in Christ.
[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:27.500]   "And he said, 'You are the man.'"
[00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:32.040]   When's the last time that you had someone in your life
[00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:35.000]   look at you and say, "Hey, wake up.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.780]   "You are the man."
[00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:39.040]   And not in a good way.
[00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:43.700]   When's the last time you had someone actually tell you
[00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:45.140]   what you needed to hear?
[00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:46.440]   I bet this wasn't comfortable.
[00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:48.440]   Imagine Nathan in this moment going up to the king
[00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:50.400]   that just killed a guy to go tell him
[00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:51.680]   that he's got food in his teeth, essentially.
[00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:53.520]   Like, "Hey, you're doing something wrong.
[00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:55.420]   "This isn't who you're called to be."
[00:26:55.420 --> 00:26:58.460]   But he does it.
[00:26:58.460 --> 00:27:01.480]   And in that moment, David could have taken the easy way out.
[00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:04.160]   He could have hushed him, pushed him away.
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:05.780]   Sometimes when people come and tell us truth,
[00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:06.620]   we're so quick to be like,
[00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:08.480]   "Man, you don't know what's good for me.
[00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:09.760]   "I can love whoever I want.
[00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:11.580]   "Love is love.
[00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:13.460]   "You just want me to be happy.
[00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:16.000]   "You don't really know what's good for me."
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.400]   And we're so quick to push away people
[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:20.080]   who just want what's best for us.
[00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:22.800]   Not what's good for us, what's best for us.
[00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:23.640]   Why?
[00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:27.960]   It's because we don't realize that we're in the war.
[00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:30.680]   And I love what David does here.
[00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:33.260]   He doesn't let this just stew in him with anger,
[00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:35.080]   but he does actually,
[00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:39.200]   as he lets it change the trajectory of his life.
[00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:40.640]   Which leads to my second thing
[00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:43.380]   that's always true about your failure.
[00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:48.380]   When we fail, we can always run to God, not from him.
[00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:53.620]   When we fail, we can always run to God, not from him.
[00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:55.620]   Here's where we see this take place.
[00:27:55.620 --> 00:27:57.940]   David's sitting there, Nathan just came to him,
[00:27:57.940 --> 00:27:59.780]   and Nathan says all this to him, calls him out,
[00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:01.620]   and David goes, and there's this book called Psalms
[00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:03.140]   that we see, it's the biggest book of the Bible.
[00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:05.040]   And David goes, and he kind of writes in his diary
[00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:07.300]   the thoughts of this moment and his brokenness.
[00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:09.920]   And he comes before God, and he has this exchange with God,
[00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:11.460]   and here's what he says.
[00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:13.260]   Right after all of this goes down,
[00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:16.220]   have mercy on me, O God, according to your steadfast love,
[00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:17.820]   according to your abundant mercy,
[00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:19.500]   blot out my transgressions.
[00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:21.200]   Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity
[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:24.580]   and cleanse me from my sin, for I know my transgressions.
[00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:28.420]   I know what I did, God, and my sin is ever before me.
[00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:30.700]   Verse 10, created me a clean heart, O God,
[00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:32.820]   and renew of my spirit within me.
[00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:34.580]   Come and change me from the inside out.
[00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:38.140]   Verse 16, for you will not delight in sacrifice,
[00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:38.980]   or I will give it.
[00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:39.800]   You don't want my works.
[00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:40.640]   You don't want my church attendance.
[00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:42.140]   You don't want my money.
[00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:44.700]   You will not be pleased with a burnt offering.
[00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:48.260]   The sacrifices of God, what he wants are a broken spirit,
[00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:51.140]   a broken and contrite heart, a God you will not,
[00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:53.660]   O God, you will not despise.
[00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:55.640]   How you respond to God in your sin
[00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:57.700]   reveals what you think about your God.
[00:28:57.700 --> 00:29:01.860]   How you respond to sin, if you run from God in your sin,
[00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:06.860]   that tells me that you think something wrongly of God.
[00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:10.460]   Because my God, our God, the God of the Bible
[00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:13.040]   is a God that you can run right to in your failure.
[00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:14.580]   You don't have to run from him.
[00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:18.800]   And I bet David in this moment,
[00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:22.300]   I mean, I bet he's feeling it.
[00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:25.100]   It's probably hard, but he pushes through
[00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:29.300]   and he runs to God and it changes him from the inside out.
[00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:31.320]   And why can we do that?
[00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:33.000]   Why can we run to God?
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.360]   It's because he loves us.
[00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:37.660]   God loves you.
[00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:41.300]   If you take away anything from this talk, let it be this,
[00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:44.100]   God loves you.
[00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:47.980]   That's crazy.
[00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:51.820]   David, you just slept with another man's woman
[00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:53.580]   and then you killed him.
[00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:55.340]   And guess what?
[00:29:55.340 --> 00:29:58.020]   Here you are broken, a sinner, nothing.
[00:29:58.020 --> 00:30:01.500]   And all he does is say, David, I love you.
[00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:03.420]   Not because of anything that you are,
[00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:04.800]   not because of anything you are,
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:07.220]   because of all that I am.
[00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:10.020]   And all that I am is a God that loves his children
[00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:11.180]   no matter what.
[00:30:11.180 --> 00:30:14.260]   And the reason why you can run to God,
[00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:16.060]   the reason why you can talk about your sin
[00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:18.900]   and your mistakes is because he loves you.
[00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:20.860]   Romans 8, one says, "There is now no condemnation
[00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:22.420]   "for those who are in Christ Jesus,
[00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:25.820]   "for those who do not walk in the flesh, but in the spirit."
[00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:27.300]   How, JD?
[00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:28.820]   How is there no condemnation?
[00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:30.660]   I deserve this.
[00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:33.180]   If only you knew what I did.
[00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:35.380]   And I would tell you this, and I'll wrap up.
[00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:41.680]   There was a time in my life, hardest season of my life.
[00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:45.380]   I lost my dad in his forties to cancer.
[00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:46.340]   Life sucked.
[00:30:46.340 --> 00:30:49.780]   It was really bad, I was in college.
[00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:52.700]   And I ran from God,
[00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:56.860]   and I just pretty much gave the bird to God.
[00:30:56.860 --> 00:31:01.500]   I knew who he was, but I just chased partying and alcohol
[00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:03.540]   and anything that could make me feel something
[00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:07.020]   to feel satisfied, and I could take control of my life.
[00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:08.540]   And I did it for six months.
[00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:10.460]   And I'll never forget the night, like David,
[00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:13.740]   I was just laying there, New Year's Eve, all alone.
[00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:15.900]   I had pushed everything and everyone that I loved
[00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:16.940]   out of my life.
[00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:20.420]   And I just laid there in the dark,
[00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:22.100]   drunk in an empty house.
[00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:24.580]   If you're alone on New Year's Eve, it's pretty bad.
[00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:28.080]   And I'm going, I don't wanna bring in a new year.
[00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:31.140]   And I just cried out to God.
[00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:35.160]   And I said, God, why?
[00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:38.420]   Why is it like this?
[00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:40.220]   Why is this so hard?
[00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:42.220]   Why do I keep making these mistakes?
[00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:45.140]   I get it, you're probably gone.
[00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:49.140]   And he just stopped me and he said, JD, I love you.
[00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:52.180]   And I just wept.
[00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:56.860]   I laid there drunk in the dark and I wept.
[00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:03.020]   And what was true of that moment in my life,
[00:32:03.020 --> 00:32:05.820]   and what was true of David's moment, and this moment,
[00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:08.540]   and what's true of your moments, your mistakes,
[00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:11.100]   and your failures that you're walking in here with tonight,
[00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:13.260]   is that there is a God that you can run to.
[00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:16.180]   And say, God, blot out my transgressions,
[00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:18.420]   make me whiter than snow.
[00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:19.780]   All I have to bring you is nothing.
[00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:21.220]   And he says, that's everything.
[00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:24.800]   That's all I need is nothing, because I am everything.
[00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:29.620]   And I bet if you don't know,
[00:32:29.620 --> 00:32:33.180]   next week we're talking about Jesus and the bloodline,
[00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:35.620]   and God makes a promise.
[00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:36.820]   God makes a promise to David
[00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:39.040]   right before he messes up with Bathsheba.
[00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:40.380]   God comes down to David and says,
[00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:41.700]   hey, David, I'm gonna use you
[00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:44.120]   to bring the line of Jesus to the world.
[00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:45.500]   The savior of the world, David,
[00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:47.160]   is gonna come through your blood.
[00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:51.340]   And I bet David in that moment is going, but,
[00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:54.260]   but God, me?
[00:32:55.420 --> 00:32:56.820]   He's here writing Psalm 51.
[00:32:56.820 --> 00:33:01.020]   He's like, man, God, please blot out what I did with Bathsheba
[00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:02.140]   and how I murdered Uriah,
[00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:04.180]   because I still wanna be used by you.
[00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:05.940]   I still wanna have promises with you.
[00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:07.220]   I still want you to trust me.
[00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:08.720]   I still want you to love me.
[00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:12.660]   And I bet as he's writing out Psalm 51,
[00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:15.840]   he's wondering, is God still gonna do it?
[00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:20.380]   Is God still gonna use my blood, my line,
[00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:23.220]   my offsprings to bring Jesus to the world?
[00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:24.700]   Would he do something that crazy
[00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:26.100]   through someone so broken?
[00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:31.080]   And the best part of this whole thing,
[00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:33.940]   the first sentence of the New Testament,
[00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:36.380]   the greatest story ever told,
[00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:39.540]   the beginning scene of the story of Jesus,
[00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:43.060]   the God-man on earth, opens up with this.
[00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:49.140]   Matthew 1:1, the book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ,
[00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:51.940]   the son of David.
[00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:56.540]   Do you know what that means?
[00:33:56.540 --> 00:34:00.260]   The son of David, God was faithful.
[00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:07.340]   God actually took a future child of David and Bathsheba,
[00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:10.100]   a woman that he had an affair with
[00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:12.620]   and produced an offspring that failed,
[00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:13.780]   an offspring that failed,
[00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:16.420]   and an offspring that failed time and time again.
[00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:20.900]   And he still brought Jesus, he still used David.
[00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:21.740]   And why?
[00:34:21.740 --> 00:34:23.460]   Because Jesus had to come
[00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:25.100]   because he would be different.
[00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:30.380]   He would redirect the story and he would make a way.
[00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:32.220]   He would come and die a sinner's death.
[00:34:32.220 --> 00:34:35.060]   David's sin, your sin, my sin,
[00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:37.120]   he would pay for it on the cross.
[00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:41.980]   All of wrath from all of mankind would be thrown on him
[00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:45.340]   and he would die and he would bury sin and shame
[00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:46.180]   once and for all.
[00:34:46.180 --> 00:34:49.100]   On the third day, he would rise again
[00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:53.700]   and change our lives forever and make a way.
[00:34:53.700 --> 00:34:57.460]   God's saying, "Yeah, on your own, you can't come to me
[00:34:57.460 --> 00:35:00.740]   'cause you do have nothing.
[00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:04.580]   But through my son, because of my faithfulness,
[00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:06.420]   you can run to me now.
[00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:09.340]   Because all I see when I look at you
[00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:11.820]   is the blood of my son."
[00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:15.540]   And that is the best news.
[00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:18.140]   And if you haven't been honest with yourself,
[00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:20.260]   if you haven't gone to war,
[00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:22.700]   if you haven't told someone
[00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:23.860]   about the things that you've been carrying
[00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:26.700]   because you haven't seen yourself worthy of being redeemed,
[00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:28.500]   tonight is the night.
[00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:30.600]   Don't walk out of here without a weapon.
[00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:34.500]   Don't go back into the war zone on your own.
[00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:36.380]   Deal with it tonight.
[00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:40.460]   Because that's what he died for
[00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:42.740]   so you could run to God, not from him.
[00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:48.860]   Father, I ask that if there is anyone here
[00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:51.340]   who is walking in going,
[00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:53.660]   "JD, you don't know my story, man.
[00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:55.420]   It's bad.
[00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:57.120]   The drugs were bad.
[00:35:57.120 --> 00:35:58.620]   The addiction is bad.
[00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:01.220]   The abortion, I can't get it out of my mind."
[00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:06.640]   That right now, they would hear the truth
[00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:10.660]   that they are known and loved by a God
[00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:13.260]   who sent his son for that very reason,
[00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:16.240]   that even when they're not faithful,
[00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:18.540]   they could run to the faithfulness of our Father
[00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:22.660]   who fulfilled his promise and brought his son to the earth.
[00:36:22.660 --> 00:36:26.820]   Maybe wake up every day
[00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:29.820]   recognizing that we are in a war,
[00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:31.100]   we are being attacked.
[00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:35.820]   But through you, through others, and through the word,
[00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:41.420]   we have the power to say no to the enemy
[00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:44.380]   and yes to the everlasting good
[00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:47.180]   and gracious love of our Father.
[00:36:47.180 --> 00:36:48.020]   Amen.
