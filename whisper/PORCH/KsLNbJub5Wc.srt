00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 [MUSIC]

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 [APPLAUSE]

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:32,480
 >> What's up, Porch?

4
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,480
 How we doing tonight?

5
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,640
 >> [APPLAUSE]

6
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,480
 >> Hey, it's so good to see you.

7
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,640
 I hope that all is well.

8
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,520
 My name is Timothy Ateeb, people call me T.A., and

9
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,640
 I'm one of the teaching pastors here at Watermark.

10
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,000
 And it's so great to see the couple thousand people that are right here in

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,040
 Dallas, but I know that people are watching all over the nation.

12
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:57,520
 So just want to say hello to those at Porch Life Tulsa, Porch Life Austin,

13
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,840
 Porch Life Midland, and then Porch Live Indianapolis.

14
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:08,000
 Hope that all is well wherever you are, and so glad that you are jumping in with us.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,040
 This is gonna feel like a major swerve real quick.

16
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,480
 But before we jump in, here's what I want to ask you to do.

17
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,160
 I want to ask you to take a moment, close your eyes, and pray.

18
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:25,080
 Because here at the porch, we believe God is here, and he wants to meet with us.

19
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,040
 And so I just want to give you a second, in the quietness of your own heart,

20
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,480
 just pray and say, God, would you speak to me tonight?

21
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,040
 Just pray that real quick, God, speak to me tonight.

22
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:41,040
 And then would you pray for me?

23
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,240
 Just say, God, would you speak through TA to me?

24
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:57,680
 Lord, we give tonight to you.

25
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:04,720
 My hope and prayer, Lord God, is that you would give people eyes to see you.

26
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:10,080
 Lord, that you, Jesus, would be famous in this room, and in this city, and

27
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,960
 in this nation, and in this world.

28
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:16,120
 And that for every person in the room tonight, for

29
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:21,240
 those who don't know you, God, I pray that they would sense you introducing

30
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:24,240
 yourself to them, and for those who have known you for a long time,

31
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,800
 I pray that they would get a fresh touch from you.

32
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:33,400
 We need you, we love you, we give this time to you, in Jesus' name, amen.

33
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,600
 Well, we're in a series that we're calling The Return,

34
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,680
 Living Like Jesus is Coming Back.

35
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,960
 This is week four, and so the idea behind the series, if this is your first time

36
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:48,320
 here, is if Jesus were to walk through those doors tonight, and

37
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,280
 we were to hand him a microphone, and he would just simply say, hey,

38
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,000
 mark the calendar, I am returning one year from today, what would change?

39
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,920
 What would we begin to do?

40
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,680
 What would we stop doing?

41
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,720
 How would life change?

42
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:08,200
 And so we've just talked about specific things that would change along the way.

43
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:12,320
 And when we started the series, once we had launched it,

44
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,760
 we posted on our Insta story, and we just asked, hey,

45
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,720
 Porch Nation, what would change?

46
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,000
 And you know what the most common response was?

47
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,440
 The most common response was, I would share my faith more.

48
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,840
 I would share my faith more with those who I love.

49
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,600
 And so I wanna talk about that tonight.

50
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,320
 I wanna talk about us sharing our faith.

51
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:36,200
 Now, if you're here tonight and you're not a Christian,

52
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:40,680
 like someone tricked you into being here, if that's you, I'm so glad that you came.

53
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,800
 Tonight might feel like a family conversation among the Christians that

54
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,720
 are in the room, but this is actually a great night for you to be here.

55
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,480
 Because in some ways, this is gonna be an infomercial for Jesus and

56
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,440
 for Christianity.

57
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:59,720
 Like what you're going to hear tonight is what we believe in and

58
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:04,200
 why we feel so strongly about leaving this building and

59
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,640
 going and telling others about Jesus.

60
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,760
 But as I think about the idea of sharing my faith,

61
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,320
 I think about the moment when Cat and

62
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,560
 I were in the delivery room for our third son, Jake.

63
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:24,400
 We have three boys, our oldest is 13, our middle is 11.

64
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,960
 And then we took a six year pause on having children because

65
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,160
 we needed a break.

66
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,920
 And then we have Jake, who is now five years old.

67
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:37,400
 And I will never forget being in the delivery room,

68
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,120
 we were living in College Station at the time.

69
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,240
 And we were in this very large hospital room.

70
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,600
 My wife was in a bed over there, and then there was a bed over here.

71
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,520
 And then there was this massive, just dead space in the middle of the room.

72
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:57,960
 And I remember standing in the dead space of the room,

73
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,280
 not knowing what to do.

74
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,000
 Like my wife is in bed over there, in labor.

75
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,600
 There are doctors and nurses moving all around.

76
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,320
 And I don't know if you've seen Talladega Nights where Ricky Bobby is like,

77
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,520
 I don't know what to do with my hands.

78
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,920
 I was like, I don't know what to do with anything.

79
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:18,600
 Like I'm stranded in this space where I don't wanna get too close to my wife to

80
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,040
 where she's like, we should trade places.

81
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,080
 And I didn't wanna get in the way of the doctors and the nurses.

82
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,520
 And so I just stood there awkwardly, not knowing what to do.

83
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,400
 Like if there was a camera in that room and we could roll the tape,

84
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,600
 you'd be like, that's a man who doesn't know what he's doing.

85
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:42,480
 And then it was so sweet and so kind, this nurse noticed that I was six years

86
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:46,280
 out of practice on what to do when your wife goes into labor.

87
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:50,000
 And so this nurse came, she came by and she's like, okay,

88
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,960
 dad, if you wanna come right over here and you can just, she like,

89
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,800
 you can stand right next to your wife and you can help her along the way.

90
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,880
 I was like, thank you very much.

91
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,600
 Thank you for telling me what to do.

92
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,760
 You're like, what does that have to do with sharing your faith?

93
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,720
 Well, here's the deal.

94
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,560
 When someone puts their trust in Jesus Christ, the Bible,

95
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,480
 the Holy Scriptures would say that a birth has taken place.

96
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,400
 It's called being born again.

97
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,680
 New life spiritually has taken place.

98
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:23,720
 And we believe here at Watermark that anytime someone is born again spiritually,

99
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,240
 a miracle has taken place.

100
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:30,560
 Like that miracle is only possible because God has done something miraculous

101
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,360
 by the power of the Holy Spirit.

102
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,280
 Like God gets all of the credit.

103
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,080
 So if you're here tonight and you have put your trust in Jesus Christ,

104
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,400
 it is because the Spirit of God has moved and worked in your life and

105
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,080
 God has done a miracle.

106
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,440
 God gets all the credit for it.

107
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:53,680
 And at the same time, God gives us parts to play in people being born again.

108
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:59,880
 Like he actually uses us to share the good news of Jesus Christ with other people.

109
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,560
 And as the Spirit of God is working and people hear the good news,

110
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,840
 they put their trust in Christ and they are born again.

111
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,960
 And so God gives us a part to play.

112
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:15,160
 He invites us into the family business of sharing the good news of Jesus Christ

113
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:15,800
 with others.

114
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,160
 And yet, I just wonder if some of you will hear that and you're like,

115
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:23,440
 "Oh my gosh, I don't want to talk about sharing my faith because I don't do it."

116
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,160
 And it feels awkward and you feel like a failure,

117
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,800
 you feel like you're not doing what you're supposed to be doing.

118
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,760
 And now here comes a message which is going to beat you over the head and

119
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,920
 just remind you of how you're not doing what you're supposed to be doing.

120
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,160
 That's not what tonight's about.

121
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:44,680
 My hope in some way is to kind of be that kind medical worker that just came

122
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,480
 alongside me, I was like, "Okay, so here's what you're going to do.

123
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,120
 You're going to come over here and you're going to...

124
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,280
 Here's what it's going to look like to share your faith."

125
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:56,680
 Like maybe you're like, "I just...I want to share my faith but

126
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,920
 I just need a little direction on how to do it."

127
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,560
 That is what tonight is about.

128
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,840
 Because if Jesus was coming back in a year, what would we want to do?

129
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,800
 We would want to tell the people we love about Jesus.

130
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:14,480
 And so if you have a Bible, would you turn with me tonight to 2 Corinthians

131
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,120
 chapter 5 is where we're going to be.

132
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,760
 And if you don't own a Bible, we'd love to give you one.

133
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:23,360
 Like that's our gift to you tonight, okay?

134
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,840
 We have Bibles here that we would love to give you.

135
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,360
 And if you don't have a Bible to look on with now,

136
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,520
 we're going to have it on the screen.

137
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:33,320
 But 2 Corinthians chapter 5, let me read you.

138
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:39,440
 Verses 16 through chapter 6, verse 2, here's what it says.

139
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 Starting in verse 16, it says, "From now on, therefore,

140
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,560
 we regard no one according to the flesh.

141
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,560
 Even though we once regarded Christ according to the flesh,

142
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,160
 we regard him thus no longer.

143
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:01,960
 Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he's a new creation.

144
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:05,040
 The old has passed away, behold, the new has come.

145
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:11,520
 All this is from God, who through Christ reconciled us to himself and

146
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,000
 gave us the ministry of reconciliation."

147
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,080
 That is, in Christ, God was reconciling the world to himself,

148
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:25,400
 not counting their trespasses against them, and entrusting to us

149
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,600
 the message of reconciliation.

150
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,520
 Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ.

151
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:36,200
 God making his appeal through us.

152
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:40,520
 We implore you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God.

153
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:46,160
 For our sake, he made him to be sin, who knew no sin, so

154
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,880
 that in him we might become the righteousness of God.

155
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:55,040
 Working together with him then, we appeal to you not to receive the grace of God in

156
00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:00,240
 vain, for he says, "In a favorable time, I listened to you, and in a day of salvation,

157
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,000
 I have helped you.

158
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,400
 Behold, now is the favorable time.

159
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:08,560
 Behold, now is the day of salvation."

160
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,880
 We're talking about sharing our faith, and what the Apostle Paul is going to do

161
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:18,720
 right here as he writes to his friends in the city of Corinth is we are going to talk

162
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,280
 about five things that we just need clarity on when it comes to sharing our faith.

163
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,480
 Here's what those five things are.

164
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,120
 We're going to talk about our mentality.

165
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,520
 We're going to talk about our message.

166
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,400
 We're going to identify our mission.

167
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,480
 We're going to be clear on our motivation.

168
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:39,920
 And then we're going to talk about our methods when it comes to sharing our faith.

169
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:45,600
 The first thing that we see in this text is just the right mentality when it comes

170
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,800
 to sharing our faith.

171
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,000
 Look back at what Paul says in verse 16.

172
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,040
 He says, "From now on, therefore, we regard no one according to the flesh.

173
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:58,400
 Even though we once regarded Christ according to the flesh, we regard him thus

174
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,680
 no longer."

175
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:06,120
 Prior to becoming a Christian, Paul was a very devout Jew.

176
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:11,600
 And in religious law, like it would have been very frowned upon for Paul to have any

177
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,920
 type of interaction with Gentiles or non-Jews.

178
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:21,280
 And so what Paul is identifying here is he's reaching back into the time of his life

179
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:26,880
 where he didn't know Christ and he saw people for their ethnicity.

180
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:33,080
 And because of their ethnicity, he removed himself from them and he created a barrier

181
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,720
 between him and them.

182
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,560
 And now he's saying, "I don't see people for their ethnicity,

183
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,360
 I see them for their spirituality."

184
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,440
 And there's a shift that's happened in his mind.

185
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:49,240
 And here's the deal, if we are going to be people who live like Jesus is coming back

186
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:53,960
 and if we want to share the gospel with others, we might have to have a shift in our

187
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:58,120
 mentality so that we begin to see people differently.

188
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:02,960
 Let me just identify a few different shifts in our mentality that might have

189
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,600
 to take place.

190
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,880
 Number one, this is for some people in the room but not everyone.

191
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:14,880
 Some of you need to understand that cocooning yourself in a Christian bubble

192
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,080
 is not healthy.

193
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,720
 It's just not healthy.

194
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,560
 Like it is very possible when you come to Christ that you just want to surround

195
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,720
 yourself with godly people.

196
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,840
 And that's a good thing.

197
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:31,880
 You do...your primary playmates in life need to be strong Christians.

198
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:36,160
 And yet, every Christian needs to have meaningful interaction with people who

199
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,000
 don't know Jesus.

200
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,920
 And yet, it's possible to move yourself to a place where you have no meaningful

201
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,760
 interaction with those who don't know the Lord.

202
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,480
 And so, here's what you become.

203
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:54,920
 You become a sponge that is always soaking up but never being wrung out, right?

204
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,400
 And so, here's what you do.

205
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:01,720
 You come with your community group to church on Sundays and then you come

206
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:06,440
 with your Christian friends on Tuesdays and then you get breakfast at Cindy's

207
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:10,960
 with your Christian friends on Wednesday or Thursday and then you meet for coffee

208
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,040
 with your Christian friends at some other time.

209
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,240
 And then during the weekend, you go to the dog park with your

210
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,160
 Christian friends.

211
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,200
 You go to happy hour with your Christian friends.

212
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:24,560
 You go on vacation with your Christian friends.

213
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,760
 You do holidays with your Christian friends.

214
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:34,320
 And what happens...what is a sponge that never gets wrung out?

215
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,040
 It's a block of bacteria, right?

216
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:37,840
 That's all it is.

217
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:42,520
 It is a block of bacteria.

218
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:46,880
 You have been made to be wrung out.

219
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,280
 We come here and we soak up the word of God.

220
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:53,200
 We remind ourselves of the gospel.

221
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,760
 We surround ourselves with godly people.

222
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:00,880
 But then we go out and we invest in meaningful interactions with people who

223
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:08,520
 don't know the Lord and we wring...we get wrung out with the gospel so that people

224
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:12,680
 can know Jesus through us.

225
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:16,120
 And so, some of you all just need to hear, "Hey, if you don't have any Christian

226
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,480
 friends, you need to get some."

227
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,400
 What's another way that our mentality might need to shift?

228
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:29,520
 Some people, not everyone, but some of you who are kind of more rule followers,

229
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,520
 lean towards legalism, here's what you need to know.

230
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:38,280
 For you, your shift might need to be that you begin to see people for their need,

231
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:41,720
 not their sin.

232
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,720
 Sometimes we see people for their sin and you know what we do?

233
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,640
 We withdraw from them and judge them.

234
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:53,040
 Don't be surprised when people who don't know Jesus don't live like Jesus.

235
00:14:53,040 --> 00:15:00,080
 We can never expect sinners to live lives that look like they have been freed from

236
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:03,480
 the power of sin.

237
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,880
 And so, you know what?

238
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:10,160
 When you see people for their sin, you're going to withdraw from them and judge them.

239
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,080
 But when you see them for their need, you're going to move toward them,

240
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:16,720
 you're going to pursue them, you're going to love them.

241
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:22,680
 Another shift in our mentality that might have to take place is that it is never us

242
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,960
 versus them.

243
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:30,120
 Like there are people in this world who share different beliefs and values that

244
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:33,560
 are so contrary to yours.

245
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,440
 Their life looks so different than yours.

246
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:40,680
 What they stand for, what they believe in, what they think is right,

247
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:45,600
 how they choose to live their life is so vastly different than yours.

248
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,560
 And it's possible because they live a different life, they vote a different way,

249
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:53,200
 they believe different things, that you can create this us versus

250
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:53,960
 them mentality.

251
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,600
 Let's just be clear.

252
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:02,960
 We only have one enemy and it's Satan.

253
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:09,000
 And if someone is so contrary to your life, they're not your enemy,

254
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,080
 they are a captive of the one true enemy.

255
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,880
 And so we move toward them in love.

256
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:20,840
 For some of you, you might just need to hear that you're seeing people in only a

257
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,000
 material way, not in a spiritual way.

258
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:29,120
 And so you're around unbelievers all the time, you just haven't dug below the

259
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,880
 surface to realize that they're unbelievers.

260
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:37,600
 So you're living like they're just your coworkers, they're just your neighbors,

261
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,720
 they're just the people that you go play pickleball with, they're just the people

262
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:47,200
 that you go to the bar with, they're just the people that you're in a running group

263
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:53,800
 with, they're just the people that you do CrossFit with, that's all they are to you.

264
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:58,760
 And yet if Jesus was coming back, if we knew he was coming back,

265
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:03,040
 what I would hope is that we would begin to dig below the surface to realize,

266
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,800
 hey, do they know Jesus or not?

267
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:10,080
 And then the final shift that might need to take place in our mentality is simply

268
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:16,320
 this, with God, the impossible is always possible and no one is ever too far gone

269
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,160
 from knowing Jesus.

270
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:20,360
 Like I would imagine that there are people that you work with and you're like,

271
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:24,200
 "That guy, he will probably never know Jesus.

272
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:31,720
 Like he is so lost, there is no way for him to be found."

273
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:36,880
 And I'll just say that Jesus does his best work in the most impossible

274
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,760
 of situations.

275
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:45,000
 I mean, a week ago from today, I was sitting in a group with friends and

276
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:51,320
 we were praying specifically for one of my friend's sisters who has been running

277
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,960
 from God for 15 years.

278
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:59,120
 She has lived in rebellion, she has wanted to have nothing to do

279
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,320
 with Jesus and we were praying for her.

280
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,200
 Wanted nothing to do with Jesus.

281
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,320
 And here's the text that I got from my friend.

282
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:12,480
 I was sitting right up there in that balcony this past Sunday morning.

283
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:19,360
 In all caps, "Magnify the Lord with me," three exclamation points.

284
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:24,680
 "My sister surrendered her life to the Lordship of Jesus Christ yesterday

285
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:29,640
 at 4.27 PM," two exclamation points.

286
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:34,640
 In all caps again, "She's been born again by the power of the Holy Spirit,"

287
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,880
 two exclamation points.

288
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,920
 No, three, I got bad eyesight.

289
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:43,280
 "To God be all the glory and thank you for praying with me throughout the years.

290
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,680
 I can't wait to tell you the story next time we see each other."

291
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:49,720
 In all caps again, "God is faithful."

292
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:53,320
 Prayer hands.

293
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:58,800
 And so this morning when I saw him, man, it's just celebration because that's

294
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,680
 what God does.

295
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:05,360
 He's in the business of doing the impossible, do not rule anyone out.

296
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,680
 And we need to just be clear on our mentality.

297
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:12,720
 We might need to begin to see people for their need and we move

298
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,480
 toward them in love.

299
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,280
 Second, we need clarity on our message.

300
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,200
 What is our message?

301
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,200
 So, hey, all eyes on me.

302
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,000
 If you're here tonight and you don't know Jesus Christ, you are not a Christian,

303
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,120
 you really haven't wanted to have anything to do with Christianity,

304
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,640
 this is a great moment for you to just hear what Christianity is all about.

305
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,200
 Because right now, I'm just going to share with you what we really believe

306
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:41,160
 because we don't believe that Christianity is about just trying to be a good person

307
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:44,400
 or attending church more or voting a certain way.

308
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,960
 That is not Christianity.

309
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,520
 Christianity is not about realizing all the things we need to do,

310
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:55,040
 it's about us getting our hearts around what has been done for us by God,

311
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:59,480
 through Jesus, by the power of the Spirit.

312
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,560
 So, here's our message.

313
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,360
 Look at the text.

314
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:06,000
 I don't need to tell you my opinions, it's just in the text.

315
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,680
 What does it say?

316
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:10,320
 Verse 17, here's our message.

317
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:18,040
 "Therefore," I wonder if anyone needs to hear this tonight, "if anyone is in Christ,

318
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:21,360
 he is a new creation.

319
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:26,920
 The old has passed away, behold, the new has come."

320
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,880
 You want to know what Christianity is about?

321
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,920
 It's about being made new.

322
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:36,200
 It's about getting a new start in life, getting a clean start.

323
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:41,120
 Christianity is not being a bad person and trying to become better.

324
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:47,160
 Christianity is about dead people being made alive spiritually.

325
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,640
 That's what Christianity is about.

326
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,960
 So, here's what that means.

327
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,720
 You don't have to be defined by your past.

328
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,120
 You are not the sum of all your failures.

329
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,320
 Jesus Christ is able to step into your life and make you new.

330
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:07,240
 He's able to take all of your failures, no matter what it is.

331
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:15,520
 He can take that weekend, that abortion, that season with that guy or that girl or that

332
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:20,160
 whatever you went on, whatever binge you went on, whatever it is, whatever that season is

333
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,760
 of your life.

334
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:26,640
 Whatever that thing is, your greatest regret, whatever it is, Jesus is able to take your

335
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:33,360
 failure, all of it, and trade it for his forgiveness and his favor.

336
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,600
 But not only that, watch this.

337
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,000
 Verses 18 and 19.

338
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,280
 It says, "All this is from God."

339
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:49,160
 So, if you want to know if God is good, here is what is from God.

340
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:58,360
 All this is from God, making people new, who through Christ reconciled us to himself and

341
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:02,800
 gave us the ministry of reconciliation.

342
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:09,420
 That is, in Christ, God was reconciling the world to himself, not counting their trespasses

343
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:14,440
 against them and entrusting to us the message of reconciliation.

344
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,440
 Okay.

345
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:20,480
 So, track with me on this.

346
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:26,600
 What speakers will do is speakers will often repeat what they want emphasized.

347
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,280
 Let me say that one more time.

348
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:33,920
 Speakers will often repeat what they want emphasized.

349
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:39,800
 What is the word that we see Paul repeating all throughout those two verses?

350
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,440
 Reconciliation.

351
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:45,280
 That's a really important word in the Bible.

352
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:51,040
 In fact, I would say if you want to know what the message of the Bible is, reconciliation.

353
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:57,040
 That word reconciliation in the original language of the New Testament Greek, it has two facets

354
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,760
 to it.

355
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:06,560
 It means that there has been a distinct change, and then it also means to be brought into

356
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,880
 favor.

357
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:12,740
 So, what's the distinct change and what does it mean to be brought into favor?

358
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:14,960
 What is the reality of Christianity?

359
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,360
 Here's the reality.

360
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:22,000
 We were children of wrath, and then through Jesus' death on the cross, his burial in a

361
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,600
 tomb, a resurrection from the dead through faith in him, we who were children of wrath

362
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:32,040
 through faith have been made children of God.

363
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,560
 That's the reality.

364
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:38,000
 We were enemies of God, and now we are children of God.

365
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,960
 Here's why this is so important, because I think a lot of people in this world are at

366
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,920
 war with God and they don't even know it.

367
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,040
 Like, I remember when I was in college.

368
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:53,480
 So ladies, you just need to know that in college the way that guys express care for one another

369
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,960
 is by beating each other up.

370
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:59,640
 You guys show care to one another by like leaving notes on the mirror.

371
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,000
 We hit each other.

372
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,280
 And so there would just be times where I would walk into guys' rooms, I'd just open the door,

373
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:11,360
 wouldn't say hi, and she'd be like, and then we'd go at it for five minutes and I'd be

374
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,680
 like, "OK, dude, see you later."

375
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,240
 And that was what we did.

376
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:19,120
 So this one time I walked into this guy's room, he was like 220, in college I was about

377
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:23,520
 a buck fifty, so it was kind of a David and Goliath type situation, but I just went for

378
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:27,280
 it and went on the offensive.

379
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:34,320
 So we're wrestling and I remember this moment so vividly, and it was a long time ago, where

380
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:42,120
 this 220 guy, he just lets out this loud, like, "Aaah!" and he pile-drove me into the

381
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,240
 closet.

382
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:53,640
 And so I find myself like on my back in his dirty clothes with him on top of me, and I'm

383
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:57,960
 not good at fighting, so I panicked, all I needed to do was to give him a wedgie, and

384
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:02,760
 so I just started wedging him in that moment.

385
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:17,160
 And as I am pulling this guy's underwear halfway up his back, I have a realization.

386
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,600
 Here's the realization.

387
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,760
 We're in a fight and I didn't even realize it.

388
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:30,240
 Like I thought we were just joking around, messing around, like fun wrestling between

389
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,680
 two dudes.

390
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:41,440
 And this guy, we were in a fight and I didn't even realize it.

391
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:47,160
 And I just wonder how many people are in that same place with God, that you're at war with

392
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,760
 him, you don't even know it.

393
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:53,360
 I remember talking to this guy who was in his college years at Tex A&M and he just said,

394
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:59,760
 you know what, he just said, "Yeah, I see you."

395
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:04,400
 He just said, "You know what, I'll think about religion, I'll think about spirituality later

396
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,480
 in life, but right now I just want to enjoy myself."

397
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:12,240
 And maybe that's where you're at, but you need to think about that mentality.

398
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,840
 Do you know what you're assuming?

399
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:19,840
 You're assuming that you're just in neutral standing with God.

400
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:26,160
 Like you're just kind of in the middle.

401
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,480
 You and God are good.

402
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,800
 Just circle back to him later on in life.

403
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:38,920
 What the scriptures would say is you're either with God or you're against God.

404
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:42,080
 There's no in between, there's no neutral standing.

405
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:47,920
 You're either a child of wrath or you're a child of God.

406
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:53,440
 And the beautiful news is that Jesus Christ has come and he has given his life and he

407
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,800
 has conquered death through his resurrection.

408
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,800
 Why?

409
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,440
 Reconciliation.

410
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:07,240
 So that when you put your faith in Jesus, a distinct change happens where you are brought

411
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:15,200
 into favor and the God of the universe looks at you and calls you his child.

412
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:22,800
 And he pours out his love, his desire, his approval, his grace upon you.

413
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:29,840
 And so you're at peace with the everlasting God for all of eternity.

414
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:30,840
 That's good news.

415
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:33,900
 Do you know Jesus?

416
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:36,360
 But that's not the full extent of our message.

417
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,440
 How is this possible?

418
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,720
 Look at verse 21.

419
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:46,440
 This might be the most beautiful verse in the entire Bible.

420
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:54,000
 Like if you only know one verse in the Bible, no 2 Corinthians chapter 5 verse 21.

421
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,840
 Here is the message of Christianity.

422
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,240
 Here's what it says.

423
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:02,660
 It says, "For our sake," for our sake.

424
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:06,840
 If you want to know if God cares, everything he's done has been for our sake.

425
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:09,160
 Him sending Jesus, it was for our sake.

426
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,960
 Jesus Christ going to the cross, it was for our sake.

427
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:15,920
 Jesus Christ conquering death, it was for our sake.

428
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:22,880
 For our sake, he, that's God, made him, that's Jesus, to be sin.

429
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,800
 He made Jesus to be sin.

430
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:29,040
 So here's what we're talking about.

431
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:35,480
 A friend Dan Neumann, he said, "We're talking about a God crushing his sinless son so that

432
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:39,520
 sinful enemies could become sanctified sons and daughters."

433
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,200
 John MacArthur puts it this way.

434
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:48,560
 God treated Jesus on the cross as if he had personally committed every sin ever committed

435
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:53,600
 by every person who would ever believe.

436
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:59,160
 For our sake, God made Jesus to be sin.

437
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:05,680
 Jesus didn't sin, and yet he took all of your sin.

438
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,480
 What's sin?

439
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:13,880
 It's any way that you have lived contrary to God's ways.

440
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:21,180
 He made him to be sin who knew no sin so that in him, in Jesus, this isn't you just finding

441
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:26,680
 your spirituality and finding what works for you, you finding your own path in life.

442
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:32,280
 No, if you want what we're talking about, reconciliation with God, it comes through.

443
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:40,560
 It is in Jesus Christ so that in him, what might happen, don't miss this, we might become,

444
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:46,160
 this is amazing, we might become the righteousness of God.

445
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,720
 What's righteousness?

446
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:54,360
 It's a judicial term, it means to be declared right standing before God the judge, that

447
00:29:54,360 --> 00:30:00,400
 God would look at us who are guilty, and Jesus Christ has stepped in our place, he has taken

448
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:03,720
 our guilty sentence so that we can go free.

449
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:07,960
 So I want everyone to repeat after me, this is what's known, don't repeat this, but this

450
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:10,840
 is known as the great exchange.

451
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:16,940
 This is the great exchange, his righteousness to us, our sin to him.

452
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:17,940
 Repeat that.

453
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:21,360
 His righteousness to us, our sin to him.

454
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,480
 One more time.

455
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:27,800
 His righteousness to us, our sin to him.

456
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:35,080
 This Christianity, that when there was no way for you to be right with God, Jesus made

457
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:45,720
 a way, that he has given us his righteousness and he has taken our sin so that a perfect

458
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:55,400
 God could look at imperfect people and see the perfection of Jesus in us.

459
00:30:55,400 --> 00:31:03,380
 Even while we continue to live imperfect lives, that is how a perfect God can spend eternity

460
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:06,360
 with imperfect people.

461
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:16,520
 It's because the perfect son of God went to the cross and dealt with all of our imperfections.

462
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:22,960
 He took them and gave us his righteousness.

463
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,760
 That's Christianity.

464
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:27,320
 This is our message.

465
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:32,280
 So I just want you to think, is there anyone in your life right now that could benefit

466
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:35,160
 from hearing that news?

467
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:39,940
 And maybe God brought you here tonight so that you could hear that news.

468
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:44,680
 So we have clarity on our mentality, we have clarity on our message, now we need clarity

469
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,860
 on our mission.

470
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:48,840
 What is our mission?

471
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,880
 Francis Shannon in his book Crazy Love, here's what he said.

472
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,720
 So if you're a Christian, listen to this.

473
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:58,640
 He said, "The point of your life is to point to Christ."

474
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,440
 So if you want to know what your mission is in life, if you want to know what the point

475
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:05,520
 of your existence is, if you know Christ, that's the point of your existence.

476
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:08,200
 It is to point others to Christ.

477
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:12,440
 Sharing your faith, that's not a pastor thing or a missionary thing, that's a Christian

478
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,640
 thing.

479
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,960
 And so what does Paul say in verse 20?

480
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:18,960
 This is our mission.

481
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:25,600
 He says, "Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, God making his appeal through us.

482
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,160
 We implore you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God."

483
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,800
 So do you want to know what your mission is?

484
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:36,640
 Your mission as a Christian is to be an ambassador for Christ.

485
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:41,160
 Now when we think of that word ambassador, we think representative, like it's someone

486
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:45,880
 from one country being a representative to another country.

487
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:51,400
 But when the scriptures use the word ambassador, it has a different meaning.

488
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,680
 Here it is.

489
00:32:53,680 --> 00:33:00,320
 Ambassadors were messengers that were sent from an overpowering army to one that was

490
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,700
 about to be destroyed.

491
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:11,460
 As was military custom, the messengers brought terms of surrender and thus peace to the army

492
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:13,300
 that was about to be overwhelmed.

493
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:17,820
 It was a final offer before utter destruction.

494
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:23,200
 That's what's in view when Paul says that we're ambassadors.

495
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:31,860
 We are the messengers that go out into the world and offer people terms of peace before

496
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:39,420
 destruction because if Jesus is coming back, and he is, we don't know when, but he is coming

497
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:46,160
 back and so we get to be those messengers that go and give a final offer before utter

498
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,160
 destruction.

499
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:53,480
 So I just want you to think, when God calls us ambassadors, he's inviting us into something

500
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,960
 bigger than ourselves.

501
00:33:54,960 --> 00:34:00,140
 It scratches that itch inside of you for that need for significance.

502
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:05,300
 If you're looking for significance, here it is, you're an ambassador of Jesus Christ.

503
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:11,020
 And tell me some job title that you can put on LinkedIn or wherever you put it that would

504
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:19,240
 make you more significant than being an ambassador of the King of Kings and Lord of Lords.

505
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,240
 You know what it means?

506
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:23,180
 It means that we get to be agents of rescue.

507
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:28,060
 Do you all remember that movie Taken?

508
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:31,100
 Came out a long time ago, a guy named Liam Neeson.

509
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:38,540
 If you haven't seen the movie Taken, it's about this dad who has a daughter who goes

510
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:41,700
 to Europe and she gets taken.

511
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:48,300
 And unfortunately for the guys who took her, that girl's dad is in the business of jacking

512
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,660
 people up.

513
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:56,140
 So he burns down Europe to get his daughter back.

514
00:34:56,140 --> 00:35:00,820
 Now, years ago I was looking for a sermon illustration so I asked my creative director

515
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:02,620
 at the time, I said, "Here's what I want you to do.

516
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:07,700
 I want you to go through the movie Taken and I want you to remove every scene that deals

517
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:10,300
 with wrath or rescue."

518
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:15,020
 Do you know what the final product was?

519
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:16,780
 Here was the movie Taken.

520
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:23,460
 A guy has a daughter, that daughter wants to go to Europe to see some concerts, that

521
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:29,940
 daughter gets on a plane and goes to Europe, that daughter gets on a plane and comes home.

522
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:32,580
 That was the movie.

523
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:38,860
 That's the movie when you take out all of the wrath of this dad and all of the need

524
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:40,420
 for rescue.

525
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:46,060
 The reason I tell you that is because God has invited us into the family and business

526
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:50,620
 to be ambassadors, to be agents of rescue, but often we wake up and you know what we

527
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:51,620
 do?

528
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:57,780
 We go to work, we go to work out, we go to hang out and we remove people's need for rescue.

529
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:05,240
 We remove the impending wrath that is coming towards them and we remove their need for

530
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,780
 rescue from their lives.

531
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:11,500
 And so we go and we work out next to them and we work next to them and we hang out next

532
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:19,580
 to them and we forget the reality that for that individual right now, wrath is waiting

533
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:25,380
 for them and they're in desperate need of rescue.

534
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:30,460
 What makes it so great when Brian Mills in Taken is reunited with his daughter?

535
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:36,560
 Why do we resonate in Captain Phillips when those seals drop those Somali pirates?

536
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,340
 It's the rescue.

537
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:41,580
 That's our story.

538
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:46,100
 We have been rescued from captivity.

539
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:51,740
 And now our rescue is for others to be rescued.

540
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:53,740
 We are agents of rescue.

541
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:58,260
 That is our mission.

542
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:01,080
 It's our mission.

543
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:04,060
 So what's our motivation?

544
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:06,820
 Here's our motivation.

545
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:08,100
 Look with me.

546
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,260
 Verse 11, go back to verse 11.

547
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,260
 What does it say?

548
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:16,260
 It says, "Therefore, knowing the fear of the Lord, we persuade others."

549
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:17,260
 We fear God.

550
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:18,340
 What does it mean to fear God?

551
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:20,180
 It doesn't mean to be scared of God.

552
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:29,620
 It means for us to see God for who He is and to realize His greatness and to respond accordingly.

553
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:37,780
 Verses 14 and 15 say this, "For the love of Christ controls us because we have concluded

554
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:40,860
 this, that one has died for all, therefore all have died.

555
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:45,900
 He died for all that those who live might no longer live for themselves but for Him

556
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:48,780
 who for their sake died and was raised."

557
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:50,420
 What's our motivation?

558
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:52,900
 It's not obligation.

559
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:53,900
 It's love.

560
00:37:53,900 --> 00:38:01,540
 When we experience the love of Christ, it is right to extend the love of Christ.

561
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:04,260
 And now look at chapter 6, verses 1 and 2.

562
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:05,980
 Here's our motivation.

563
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:12,380
 "Working together with Him then, we appeal to you not to receive the grace of God in

564
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:18,260
 vain for He says, 'In a favorable time I listen to you and in a day of salvation I have helped

565
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:19,260
 you.'"

566
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:21,540
 Watch this, "Behold, now is the favorable time.

567
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:24,900
 Behold, now is the day of salvation."

568
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:25,900
 What is Paul saying?

569
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:28,740
 He's saying the gospel is winning now.

570
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:32,460
 The Spirit of God is working and moving people's lives.

571
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:35,740
 Now, today is the day of salvation.

572
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:41,260
 You have no clue if tomorrow 20 people at your workplace would put their trust in Christ,

573
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:44,080
 if someone would simply share the gospel with them.

574
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:48,880
 Not because you share it, but because the Spirit of God is moving and working and you

575
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:57,180
 sharing is just the final, the final straw that brings that person to know the Lord.

576
00:38:57,180 --> 00:39:00,120
 Today is the day of salvation.

577
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:03,740
 Let me just open your eyes to what God is doing all over the world.

578
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:05,060
 I want to show you a map.

579
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:09,280
 It's published by a ministry called Global Media Outreach.

580
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:15,140
 They share the gospel online through different ads and through apps and websites.

581
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:21,980
 And so here is, if you put it up there, you're going to see pins kind of popping around the

582
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:22,980
 map.

583
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:25,300
 And so this is just today.

584
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:32,980
 So if you look at the bottom, what, I can't even, my eyesight is bad so I can't even see

585
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:34,820
 what that number is.

586
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:36,900
 Is that two billion?

587
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:39,220
 Is that what that is?

588
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:45,180
 Over two billion people have interacted with the gospel today.

589
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:48,600
 Interacted with it, that's what the blue pin means.

590
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:54,560
 So they've either clicked on a banner or they've downloaded an app.

591
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,140
 Two billion people.

592
00:39:57,140 --> 00:40:06,860
 274 million people have indicated some type of decision and so they've interacted with

593
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:10,700
 somebody and they've made a decision whether they're going to go to church or they want

594
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:14,060
 to get discipled or they want to take a next step with Jesus or they want to put their

595
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:15,060
 faith in Jesus Christ.

596
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:19,700
 Now I want you to see where are all those pins popping around?

597
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:25,060
 I mean you see them popping around all over the world.

598
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:26,860
 The gospel is on the move.

599
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:30,780
 The gospel is, it's winning.

600
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:31,780
 You can pull the map down.

601
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:36,740
 Let me just share some of these stats with you.

602
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:39,940
 But I just want you to get your mind around this.

603
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:48,180
 In 1979 there were an estimated 500 Christians from a Muslim background in Iran.

604
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:52,620
 Today there are hundreds of thousands and some say more than one million Christians

605
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:55,260
 in Iran.

606
00:40:55,260 --> 00:41:02,820
 And Iran is considered one of if not the fastest growing church in the world today where you

607
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:08,060
 can be killed for believing in Jesus.

608
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:15,260
 Nepal is one of the only Hindu majority countries in the world.

609
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:19,020
 In 1950 there were no reported Christians.

610
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:24,440
 Today people estimate that there are between one and three million Christians and some

611
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:29,380
 have considered Nepal one of the fastest growing churches.

612
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:37,740
 In 1975 there were an estimated 2.7 million evangelical Christians in China.

613
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:44,260
 People estimate that there are somewhere between 80 and 100 million Christians in China today,

614
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:46,820
 a country where the gospel is not welcome.

615
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:55,260
 The Houston Chronicle published an article about three years ago estimating that by 2030

616
00:41:55,260 --> 00:42:02,140
 there will be more Christians in China than in the United States.

617
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:06,420
 Today more Christians live in Africa.

618
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:12,220
 Like if you think that the United States is the epicenter of Christianity, you're wrong.

619
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:17,180
 More Christians live in Africa than any other continent.

620
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:25,820
 By 2050 Africa will be home to almost 1.3 billion Christians.

621
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:28,060
 The gospel is winning.

622
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:29,060
 It's winning.

623
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:36,020
 And at the same time there is so much left to be done so I need you to get this.

624
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:37,940
 I need you to understand it.

625
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:47,740
 There are 7.6 million people living in DFW and if every church in the metroplex that

626
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:52,940
 teaches the Bible and proclaims the gospel, if every single one of them had their record

627
00:42:52,940 --> 00:43:00,540
 Sunday and were packed to the brim, there would still be millions of people in DFW not

628
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:04,060
 reached yet with the gospel.

629
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:12,940
 And now you step outside of the United States and there are approximately 3.3 billion people

630
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:21,180
 in our world today who either have limited exposure to the gospel or virtually no exposure

631
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:22,740
 to the gospel at all.

632
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:29,100
 Like there are actually billions who have never heard the name of Jesus and there is

633
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:35,020
 no organized effort at this moment to reach them.

634
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:37,780
 And so there is work to be done.

635
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:39,420
 So the question is what can we do?

636
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:41,500
 So here that brings me to our final point.

637
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:43,540
 What's our methods?

638
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:44,860
 What's our methods?

639
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:49,140
 This is where I just come alongside you and just say hey, here's what it looks like to

640
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:50,140
 share your faith.

641
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:51,960
 Here's what I want to encourage you to do.

642
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:58,800
 This week let me just encourage you to start a conversation and try and turn it spiritual.

643
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,660
 So let me just break that down real quick.

644
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:04,380
 If you come to Watermark on Sundays, I talked about this back in January.

645
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:09,140
 I'm going to replay it because it's so important that we get our hearts around this.

646
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:10,140
 Start a conversation.

647
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:13,060
 I'm just talking about starting a conversation.

648
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:14,060
 Hey what's your name?

649
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:15,100
 I'm TA.

650
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:16,100
 What's your name?

651
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:18,060
 Have you been working out here long?

652
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:19,060
 Where do you live?

653
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:20,060
 What do you do?

654
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:24,780
 Just whatever it is, start a conversation and in the midst of that conversation look

655
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:30,440
 for an opportunity to turn it spiritual.

656
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:31,500
 So here's what this means.

657
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:37,300
 It means going to work tomorrow and just looking at someone in the eyes that you don't normally

658
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:41,840
 talk to or you introducing yourself to that guy that you always ride up with on the elevator

659
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:45,360
 but it's been too long now for you to not know his name.

660
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:46,360
 You know what?

661
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:47,360
 You can do it.

662
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:48,360
 You know what?

663
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:51,380
 We've ridden this elevator together so many times I feel like now I should finally ask

664
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:54,580
 you your name.

665
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:58,800
 Start a conversation and turn it spiritual.

666
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:03,700
 And I'm going to give you the words to say so you can't be like, "Well yeah but I just

667
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:04,700
 I don't know how to do it."

668
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:11,380
 Okay let me just, you like you can write it on your hand and be like, "Hey, my name is

669
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:14,900
 TA and like here it is."

670
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:18,060
 Okay, just look for opportunities to turn it spiritual.

671
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:28,420
 So for example, when you're at a restaurant or at a coffee shop this is so simple but

672
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:30,020
 it's effective.

673
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:32,420
 And I'll put them on the screen.

674
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:35,700
 You can just look at your waiter or waitress and just say, "Hey, you know what?

675
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:36,940
 I'm a follower of Jesus.

676
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:39,360
 I'm about to pray for our meal.

677
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:42,040
 Is there anything that we can pray for you for?"

678
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:43,040
 Just to ask them.

679
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:46,260
 "Hey, is there, I do this most of the times now when I'm in a restaurant.

680
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:47,980
 Hey, we're about to pray for a meal.

681
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:49,380
 Is there anything I can pray for you for?"

682
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:53,100
 And that gives you a quick window into their lives.

683
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:55,860
 And they're going to share with you some of their greatest needs.

684
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:59,980
 I'm so encouraged when I meet waiters or waitresses that are like, "You know what?

685
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:02,180
 Someone asked me that just the other day."

686
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:03,660
 I'm like, "Man, we're getting out there.

687
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:04,660
 We're doing it.

688
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:07,800
 We're really doing it, people."

689
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:10,820
 Or like this tomorrow when someone's like, "Hey, what'd you do last night?"

690
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:14,060
 "Hey, I went to my church and it was meaningful."

691
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:15,620
 Do you go to church anywhere?

692
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:17,200
 You're in the conversation.

693
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,460
 You just turned it spiritual.

694
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:19,460
 "What'd you do last night?"

695
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:21,860
 "I was at church last night and it was really meaningful."

696
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:23,340
 Do you go to church anywhere?

697
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:28,260
 "Hey, we never talk about this, but faith is something that's important to me."

698
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:30,540
 Do you have a faith?

699
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:34,180
 You're in the conversation.

700
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:36,980
 Here's a question that a friend gave me a while back.

701
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:38,700
 And I've used it at gas stations.

702
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:41,460
 I've used it, you know, on the beach.

703
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:45,140
 I've used it in a bunch of different places.

704
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:51,920
 I just say, "Hey, is there anything you or your family needs that I can ask God to help

705
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:52,920
 you with?"

706
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:53,920
 That's it.

707
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:56,480
 "Is there anything you or your family needs that I can ask God to help you with?"

708
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:00,560
 It gives them an opportunity to open up.

709
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:03,440
 If someone you know is going through a really tough time, ask them this.

710
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:08,240
 "Hey, where do you usually look for help or hope when life is tough or stressful?"

711
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:13,640
 I know for me, when life is tough, I don't know what I would do without my faith in Jesus.

712
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:15,600
 Do you have a faith?

713
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:18,200
 You're in the conversation.

714
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:22,520
 Or what if you just went out to lunch with someone you've been working with for a while,

715
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:24,560
 and in the midst of that lunch, you just said, "Hey, you know what?

716
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:29,120
 We haven't talked about this before, but my faith has become increasingly important to

717
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:30,120
 me."

718
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:31,480
 Do you have a faith?

719
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:33,680
 You're in the conversation.

720
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,120
 So how do we respond?

721
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:38,960
 My encouragement, start a conversation and turn it spiritual.

722
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:46,300
 And then my only other application point is this.

723
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:49,120
 Consider going.

724
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:53,960
 Consider going to the nations that have never heard the name of Jesus before.

725
00:47:53,960 --> 00:48:00,160
 And I know that that feels like a massive jump from start a conversation, turn it spiritual,

726
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,320
 and then I'm like, "Hey, pack it up and move."

727
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:05,040
 You're like, "Where's the in-between?"

728
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:08,120
 I don't know.

729
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:10,920
 But here's the reality.

730
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:20,920
 Like I just believe that young adults are who God is going to use to take the gospel

731
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:23,760
 to the nations.

732
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:29,640
 And so I don't know what God's doing in your life, but something in some of you tonight

733
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:34,680
 might just be resonating with the reality that there are people in this world that have

734
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:38,920
 never heard the name of Jesus and you're like, "I can do something about that."

735
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:44,680
 You don't know what it looks like, but you wouldn't mind giving a year or two years or

736
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:51,840
 a few years of your young adult years to taking the gospel to those who have never heard.

737
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:55,840
 And if that's you, we would love to help you do that.

738
00:48:55,840 --> 00:49:03,000
 Our hope is that from the porch we would send out hundreds of young adults every year to

739
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:09,440
 reach those who have never heard the name of Jesus.

740
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:12,480
 And if you don't know where else to start, here's my encouragement.

741
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:15,960
 You start with prayer.

742
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:20,880
 Just praying two simple words, "Use me."

743
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:24,080
 That's it.

744
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:25,080
 Use me.

745
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:29,360
 I want to invite us to pray those words right now.

746
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:35,720
 So like here's, this is going to be super awkward and a major swerve, but I just want

747
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:39,840
 to ask us to be a people that gets on our knees right now as much as you're comfortable

748
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:40,840
 with it.

749
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:44,040
 If you don't know Jesus, this is going to be the weirdest thing that you've ever experienced.

750
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:46,320
 So you don't have to get on your knees.

751
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:49,040
 There was no way I'd ask you to do something like this.

752
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:50,560
 You can just stay seated.

753
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:52,080
 And you know what?

754
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:56,280
 If you're more comfortable sitting, that's fine too, but I just want to ask us to take

755
00:49:56,280 --> 00:50:00,400
 a moment and to pray.

756
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:03,800
 All revivals, I don't know if you've seen what's been happening at Asbury over the last

757
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:05,480
 two weeks.

758
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:08,400
 All revivals start with prayer.

759
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:15,920
 We want to see a revival in our workplaces, in our gyms, in our apartment complexes.

760
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:17,880
 So let's just pray.

761
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:23,120
 I just want to ask you to close your eyes and I want to encourage you to just ask God

762
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:35,600
 right now to bring to mind the people in your life that do not yet know Him.

763
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:41,800
 And then I want to encourage you to just ask God to use you in their lives.

764
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:43,640
 Just say, "God, use me."

765
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:50,440
 Whatever that looks like, use me.

766
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:55,200
 Think about your spheres of influence, your work, the place where you live, the place

767
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:58,800
 where you work out, places you go to hang out.

768
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:08,000
 Just ask God, "Use me in those places."

769
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:20,520
 Ask God to give you opportunities to share your faith this week.

770
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:26,800
 And now pray for those in our world who have never heard the name of Jesus.

771
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:27,800
 Would you just pray?

772
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:35,240
 Say, "God, would you raise up young adults from right here in this room to take the gospel

773
00:51:35,240 --> 00:52:02,980
 to those who need it?"

774
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:07,740
 And maybe you're here tonight, before you can share this message, you first need to

775
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:08,960
 receive this message.

776
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:13,280
 If you're here tonight and you don't have a relationship with Jesus Christ, just with

777
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:16,380
 all eyes closed, I want to ask you to, if you'll just slip up your hand real quick so

778
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:19,480
 I know who I'm even talking to in this place.

779
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:24,340
 If that's you, if you want to begin a relationship with Jesus, just let me know who I'm talking

780
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:25,340
 to in this place.

781
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:27,380
 You can just pray with me.

782
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:36,340
 Say, "Lord Jesus, thank you that you died for me.

783
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:42,620
 Thank you that you rose from the dead for me.

784
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:45,580
 Would you come into my life?

785
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:57,460
 Would you forgive me of my sins and would you begin to lead me in a new life?

786
00:52:57,460 --> 00:52:59,600
 Lord Jesus, we need you.

787
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:03,180
 We ask you to use us for your glory.

788
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:09,340
 Would you give us opportunities this week to share our faith with those who desperately

789
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:10,700
 need you?

790
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:13,020
 In Jesus' name, amen.
