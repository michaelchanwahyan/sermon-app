[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.160]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.740]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.980]   - All right, well, hey, welcome everybody in the room.
[00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:36.960]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.520]   Everybody tuning in online at Porch Live locations,
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.840]   and especially Porch North Houston,
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.800]   Porch Midland, Porch Boise, Porch Des Moines,
[00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.200]   Porch Scottsdale, all the different live locations.
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.180]   Everybody joining us, we're continuing the series POV,
[00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.720]   looking at interactions that particular men and women had
[00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.840]   with the Son of God when He was on the planet.
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.840]   Let me start with a story, an illustration
[00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.280]   that'll kind of set up where we're gonna go.
[00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.280]   In the spring of 2012, I made the decision
[00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.560]   that I wanted to ask the girl I was dating to marry me.
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.240]   Yeah, thank you very much.
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.800]   Yeah, thanks guys.
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.960]   And I came up with a plan, I had it all thought through.
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.080]   I was going to ask her,
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.480]   and I planned to ask her on her birthday.
[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:28.320]   Why?
[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.880]   Because I assume that she knew that asking on her birthday
[00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.760]   is one of those almost goes without saying cliche.
[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.000]   Everyone would think to do that,
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.960]   so I'm gonna reverse psychology this and do it then.
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.480]   And I came up with a plan.
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.560]   It also allowed me to fly under the radar
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.300]   of putting a birthday celebration together,
[00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.320]   because that's just what you do,
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.480]   you're doing a birthday thing.
[00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.100]   And then at the end of that celebration,
[00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.540]   I'd be able to pop the question.
[00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.320]   So the plan was to pick her up in the morning,
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.360]   we were gonna go out to the lake and kayak
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.840]   at White Rock here in Dallas.
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.240]   We were then gonna go, and I set up like a spa day,
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.720]   this is your birthday gift, go to the spa,
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.360]   I'll pick you up at four o'clock,
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.240]   we're gonna go to the Arboretum,
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.400]   and then we'll go to dinner.
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.920]   Now, I called the Arboretum that day
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.880]   to make sure, like this is how thought through it was,
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.600]   or Inception-esque it was,
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.040]   I wanted to make sure that at any point
[00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.680]   if she was on the trail, I was gonna throw her off the trail,
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.600]   and so I called the Arboretum to confirm
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.320]   it was closed that day.
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.120]   I wanted to make sure that in case she suspected anything,
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.760]   like man, this seems like a lot of things,
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.720]   I would put in little breadcrumb trails, so to speak,
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.120]   to throw her off, and so we'd show up at the Arboretum,
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.640]   and it'd be like, oh, this is closed,
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.400]   and so she'd be like, oh, he would've for sure
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.280]   thought through this if he was gonna ask me to marry me.
[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.840]   So we go to the lake, we kayak, she goes to the spa,
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.200]   pick her up, take her to the Arboretum.
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.520]   Little did I know that while I'm thinking,
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:47.660]   we're gonna show up at the Arboretum,
[00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.120]   and I called multiple times, like hey,
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.760]   I need to make sure for sure it is closed.
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.480]   I need to show up, you're gonna tell us it's closed, sir.
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.840]   Yes, sir, we're gonna be closed.
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.040]   'Cause I had planned that I'd be like,
[00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.840]   oh, well, we got still time before dinner,
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.040]   so let's go to this park down the road,
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.640]   and we'll just kinda hang out,
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.120]   where I had two of my boys hiding in the bushes
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.160]   to take pictures.
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.460]   So the day comes, we go kayaking, it's great,
[00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.380]   she goes, does the spa thing, I pick her up,
[00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.280]   we go to the Arboretum, we show up,
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.080]   and I pull up to the gate, and it's closed.
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.360]   And I'm going, man, this is going right according to plan.
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.480]   She's thinking, we're getting engaged,
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.420]   and he did not even think to call ahead
[00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.000]   to see if this place was open.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.760]   She, for whatever reason, had still been on the trail,
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.520]   and I'm like, oh, man, well, it's closed, oh, no.
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:33.560]   And I can visibly tell,
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.920]   she is, there's a change in what's going on.
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.480]   Her expectations, I'm going, oh, no, she, oh, no.
[00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:41.920]   So I'm like, oh, no, this will be great,
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:42.760]   we're gonna go to dinner,
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.280]   and let's go to this park over here,
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.520]   and, you know, I just happen to have some bread,
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:47.440]   we'll feed the ducks.
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.600]   And I pull out the bread, we go to feed the ducks.
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.120]   And then Mother Nature strikes, and it starts raining.
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.720]   And I'm like, oh, man, this is not going according to plan,
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.480]   but I brought an umbrella.
[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.320]   And so I pull out the umbrella,
[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.320]   but there's no, thank you very much, thank you.
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.120]   There's no casual way to show,
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.760]   without throwing off, like, this is just bizarre,
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.880]   to go out with an umbrella, and it's raining,
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.320]   and she's like, no, we're not gonna feed the ducks.
[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.260]   No, I got an umbrella, where it doesn't look weird,
[00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.640]   like, no, no, these ducks, they're very hungry.
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.920]   We need to go feed them.
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.560]   And she's like, okay, and so I'm like over there
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.280]   with the umbrella, and I'm like walking.
[00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.360]   It was so muddy that I had to pick her up.
[00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.240]   She had a piggyback ride over to the lake by the umbrella.
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.800]   I get over there, and I'm just trying to play it cool,
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.240]   and of course, I'm on the inside, just freaking out.
[00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.880]   And I start to rip the bread apart,
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.080]   and I'm throwing it to these ducks.
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.360]   It's over here in Highland Park.
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.700]   Throwing the bread in the water,
[00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.360]   and the ducks come up to it, and then just swim right off.
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.600]   Like, even the ducks in Highland Park are stuck up.
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.320]   What is this, birds?
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.240]   And I'm kidding, don't email me, it's a joke, people.
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.280]   Okay, anyway, so we're doing the bread thing.
[00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.040]   Eventually, I say, you know what, we're just done with this,
[00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:02.320]   and I get to the place after reading some things
[00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.480]   and telling her some things, and I hit one knee
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:08.520]   and ask her the most important question
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:13.520]   I'll ever ask another person, and she says, yes.
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.760]   Yeah, thank you.
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:23.040]   Now, what does that have to do with tonight?
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:28.880]   Well, in that scenario, it was asking
[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.520]   the most important earthly question, if you will,
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.280]   that I'll probably ever ask.
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:39.280]   And her answer to that question would dramatically shape
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:44.840]   the future she would have and the future I would have.
[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.920]   And tonight, we're gonna look at a conversation
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:52.160]   that involves a man coming to Jesus with specific questions,
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.080]   and Jesus' answers to those questions
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:59.080]   are going to dramatically shape the future
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:03.440]   this man will have and the eternal life this man will have,
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:08.440]   and they are the same answers to the same question
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.560]   that if you don't get right,
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.040]   or depending on how you answer them,
[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:15.000]   is going to dramatically shape the future
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.100]   you're gonna have for now and for all of eternity.
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.840]   And I think there are some people in the room
[00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:28.880]   who have been asking and wondering this question
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.760]   and the questions that Jesus is going to answer
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:35.040]   as it relates to who will spend eternity with God,
[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:37.440]   how you can have a relationship with God,
[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.600]   and what the heart of God is really like.
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:44.700]   And I think God has you here tonight
[00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:46.600]   so that for the rest of the rest
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:49.600]   of however many days ahead God has for you,
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:53.720]   you can have certainty that you have the answers
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.640]   to the most important questions,
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:58.040]   not you're gonna ask to another person,
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.120]   but you'll ever ask, period,
[00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:04.400]   and that God has given you the correct answers.
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.000]   So we're gonna be in John chapter three.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.440]   John chapter three is an exchange between a teacher
[00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:13.860]   and a famous teacher at the time and Jesus.
[00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:16.720]   And it's a man who had questions about who this new rabbi,
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:19.280]   I mean, this is super early in Jesus' ministry.
[00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:22.080]   He just started, basically just appeared on the scene.
[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:23.600]   Chapter two, he does his first miracle,
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.240]   changes water into wine, word's starting to spread,
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:30.800]   and this well-known religious leader shows up
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:34.080]   and he says, man, I've just got some questions.
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:36.880]   And Jesus walks through and gives us really two things
[00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:37.740]   that I wanna highlight.
[00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:38.800]   There's a lot we could unpack,
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.600]   but I just wanna quickly unpack two things
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:42.560]   that give us the answers
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:43.680]   to some of the most important questions
[00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.240]   you're ever gonna ask,
[00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:46.200]   answers that will determine
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:49.920]   whether you're gonna spend eternity with God or not,
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:51.720]   and answers that sadly most of our world
[00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:55.360]   and many people who even think that they're Christians
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:57.480]   have gotten and are getting wrong.
[00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:00.680]   So we're gonna be in verse one of chapter three,
[00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:04.040]   and the book of John is unique
[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:06.720]   in that it is 90% different from the other gospels.
[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:08.960]   So the four gospel accounts, Matthew, Mark, Luke,
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:11.200]   have striking similarities.
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:12.680]   And years after they were written,
[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:13.960]   it's like the apostle John,
[00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:17.320]   who has this really intimate relationship with Jesus,
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:19.700]   decides, man, there were just some stories
[00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:22.080]   that I have got to write,
[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:24.240]   and so the Holy Spirit leads him to write the book of John,
[00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:26.400]   and it gives us the interactions
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:30.180]   and the account of this man named Nicodemus,
[00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:32.440]   a man who would show up at the beginning of John
[00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:34.040]   and eventually show up at the end of John.
[00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:35.120]   So I'm gonna start in verse one,
[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:37.600]   and we'll get started from there.
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:41.800]   Now, there was a Pharisee, a man named Nicodemus.
[00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:43.040]   Now, a Pharisee, you probably,
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:44.560]   I'll unpack a little bit more in a second,
[00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:46.200]   but Pharisees, here's also you get a note,
[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:48.920]   they were of an incredibly exclusive club.
[00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:50.200]   In a city of a million people,
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:53.020]   there were 6,000 Pharisees, that was it.
[00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:55.280]   They were professional religious leaders.
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:58.040]   In other words, they had made their devotion to God
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:00.880]   so abundant that they did it for a living.
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:03.760]   And this was one of them, one of the exclusive 6,000.
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:08.240]   He was also a member of the Jewish ruling council.
[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:10.440]   Now, in a city that large,
[00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:14.720]   there's unique to be 6,000 or one of the 6,000 Pharisees,
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:17.520]   but now we're told he's a member of the ruling council,
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:20.400]   which would be equivalent in some ways
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:22.000]   to the United States Senate.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.040]   It was the ruling, there was 70 men
[00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:27.200]   who made up the ruling council.
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:30.580]   So we know Nicodemus is very religious,
[00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:34.020]   and he's also very respected and connected
[00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:36.580]   to have that high of a level of authority.
[00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:42.880]   And he came at night to see Jesus.
[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:47.560]   And he said to him, "Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher
[00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:49.640]   "who has come from God,
[00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:52.640]   "for no one could perform these signs that you were doing
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:54.880]   "if God were not with him."
[00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:56.000]   And we're told another interesting thing.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.540]   So Zacchaeus is religious, he's respected.
[00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:01.940]   In the Talmud, basically a historical book at the time,
[00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:03.920]   we're told he's one of the three richest men
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:05.320]   in the city of Jerusalem.
[00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:09.100]   So he's got riches, he's got respect, he's got religion,
[00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:10.740]   and yet he's curious about Jesus.
[00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:12.700]   And so he doesn't wanna show all of his cards,
[00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:13.700]   so he comes at night.
[00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:14.860]   Why is that significant?
[00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:16.440]   If you were a rabbi going to another rabbi,
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:17.560]   you'd come in the day.
[00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:20.820]   But Nicodemus is a little insecure
[00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:22.340]   about being seen in the daylight,
[00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:25.520]   and so he goes and he shows up to Jesus,
[00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:29.960]   and he begins to say, "I don't know quite who you are,
[00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:31.040]   "but no one could do what you're doing
[00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:32.020]   "if you weren't from God."
[00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:33.700]   And without even getting to his question,
[00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:36.940]   Jesus answers it and says this, verse four.
[00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:37.780]   Or verse three.
[00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:41.940]   "Very truly, I tell you,
[00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:47.740]   "no one can see the kingdom of God
[00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:50.660]   "unless they are born again."
[00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:56.540]   And Jesus, before he ever asks anything,
[00:10:56.540 --> 00:11:01.540]   he says, "You will never see the kingdom of God."
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:07.380]   The way he's at work in this life and in eternal life.
[00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:10.600]   "Unless you have another birth."
[00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:13.540]   And Nicodemus is, understandably, he's confused.
[00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:15.340]   What does that even mean?
[00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:18.580]   "How can someone be born when they're old?"
[00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:20.360]   Nicodemus asks.
[00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:23.080]   "Surely they cannot enter a second time
[00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:26.140]   "into their mother's womb to be born."
[00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:28.780]   Which is a mental image nobody wants to have.
[00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:30.620]   Verse five, "Jesus answered."
[00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:33.840]   Jesus is thinking it's a metaphor.
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:35.380]   It's a metaphor.
[00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:36.460]   "Very truly, I tell you,
[00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:39.220]   "no one can enter the kingdom of God
[00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:41.620]   "unless they are born of water," physical birth,
[00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:45.100]   "and the spirit," a spiritual birth.
[00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:47.180]   "Flesh gives birth to flesh,
[00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:49.160]   "but the spirit gives birth to spirit."
[00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:51.100]   In other words, humans give birth to humans,
[00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:54.300]   dogs give birth to dogs, cats to cats,
[00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:56.920]   and the spirit to spirit.
[00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:01.460]   And he highlights, and Nicodemus is hearing
[00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:03.860]   for the very first time,
[00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:06.180]   that maybe where he stands with God
[00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:10.220]   and the kingdom of God is not where he thought.
[00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:14.220]   Because Jesus is confronting him with the truth
[00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:19.260]   that Nicodemus, and it's a truth
[00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:23.180]   that maybe you at somewhere would say
[00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:27.080]   you kinda know but don't fully believe.
[00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:31.220]   Being good doesn't make you good enough for heaven.
[00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:34.820]   Being good doesn't make you good with God.
[00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:36.140]   I mean, I want you to think about this man.
[00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:37.860]   I mean, he's sitting across the table,
[00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:39.420]   and he thinks, you know, there's this one teacher,
[00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:40.860]   and I'm a teacher, and I got a lot of authority,
[00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:43.860]   and this new guy, and maybe we'll share some ideas together.
[00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:48.340]   And Nicodemus has spent his entire life devoted to God.
[00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:49.180]   We think of the Pharisees,
[00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:51.060]   and we kinda think of like the Klingons,
[00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:52.460]   or like the arch-nemesises,
[00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:54.740]   and the bad guys in Star Wars, whoever that is.
[00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:57.240]   But we think of them as like these bad guys,
[00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:59.700]   but they were men who, if you met 'em today,
[00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:01.100]   they'd be at church every week.
[00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:02.340]   They were generous with their money.
[00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:04.660]   They had memorized, the Pharisees,
[00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:06.940]   the first five books of the Old Testament.
[00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:09.900]   That's Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy.
[00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:12.820]   And your journey through the Bible,
[00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:14.380]   if you do that, and you're reading each year,
[00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:15.700]   and you're going through,
[00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:18.140]   most of us struggle to get through
[00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:19.780]   those five books of the Bible.
[00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:22.700]   I mean, we hit Leviticus sometime in April,
[00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:24.980]   and we're like, oh, I'm just gonna go to Luke again.
[00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:29.280]   And these men had memorized.
[00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:30.560]   And in other words, we think of them as like,
[00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:31.840]   oh, those bad guys.
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:34.200]   At the time, they weren't thought of as bad guys.
[00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:35.720]   If your son grew up to be a Pharisee,
[00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:38.880]   it was like, man, you were winning,
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:39.860]   because you had raised someone
[00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:41.720]   that had devoted their life to God.
[00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:45.080]   And Nicodemus is being told,
[00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:49.040]   "You think God accepts you
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:51.660]   "because of what you've done.
[00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:57.520]   "No, no, no, you see the kingdom of God by birth, not work.
[00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:02.340]   "You will see the kingdom of God by a new spiritual birth,
[00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:06.860]   "not religious works."
[00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:10.120]   And he's sitting there, and he's trying to compute it.
[00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:12.560]   But Jesus is in the most loving way possible.
[00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:16.100]   He's trying to define the relationship
[00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:18.660]   and bring clarity to Nicodemus.
[00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:20.920]   Like, you've spent your whole life,
[00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:23.300]   and you've missed it.
[00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:25.700]   What do I mean by define the relationship?
[00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:28.020]   I mean, if you think in terms of dating relationships,
[00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:30.820]   there's that moment in every dating relationship
[00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:33.220]   where eventually you get to a place where you have the DTR,
[00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:34.700]   the define the relationship.
[00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:35.640]   What does this look like?
[00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:38.420]   It's when that stage where you've gone on a few dates,
[00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:41.260]   maybe four, maybe three, maybe five, wherever you're at.
[00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:43.280]   I'm not talking to you specifically, or maybe I am,
[00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:46.140]   but point being, you're in that dating stage,
[00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:48.980]   and you finish up that date.
[00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:51.420]   And almost always, for whatever reason,
[00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:53.340]   this happens in the car.
[00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:55.220]   You pull up to their apartment or their house,
[00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:56.340]   and the two of you are sitting there,
[00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:57.820]   and you're just kind of making chit-chat
[00:14:57.820 --> 00:14:58.840]   before you wrap up and just say,
[00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:00.580]   "Man, this was great, and it's so good to see you."
[00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:01.900]   And you're talking, and, you know,
[00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:03.780]   "I got this big presentation tomorrow at work,"
[00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:04.620]   and blah, blah, blah.
[00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:07.340]   Inevitably, you kind of stumble into this conversation.
[00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:08.940]   It may happen like, you know,
[00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:10.260]   one of your phone gets a text,
[00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:11.940]   and it's one of your girls texting you,
[00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:13.420]   and she's like, "How did it go with Kevin?
[00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:14.260]   "Was it good?
[00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:15.080]   "I just wanted to know."
[00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:16.500]   And Kevin's like, "Oh, I just saw my name
[00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:17.340]   "mentioned on there.
[00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:18.620]   "I'm just saying, I'm nothing."
[00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:19.460]   And they're just always like,
[00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:20.460]   "What's going on with you guys?
[00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:21.300]   "Are you all like a thing?
[00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:22.140]   "Are you talking?
[00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:22.960]   "Are you dating?
[00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:23.800]   "Was it just like nice?"
[00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:27.120]   And he's like, "Oh, man, my guys are always like that too.
[00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:30.020]   "They're like, 'You and Kelly, like, what is that?'"
[00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:31.860]   And you're talking, you're backing forth,
[00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:33.840]   and inevitably, one of you will go,
[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:35.100]   "What'd he say?"
[00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:38.100]   (audience laughing)
[00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:42.360]   And based on how you answer that question,
[00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:46.980]   it's gonna have some serious ramifications
[00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:49.300]   for where you two are headed.
[00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:51.000]   You are either gonna go,
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:51.840]   "What do you mean, what'd I say?
[00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:53.060]   "I say you're Kelly."
[00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:56.140]   And the friend zone begins,
[00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:58.640]   or you're gonna say,
[00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:01.940]   "You know, I say, like, you know, we're just dating,
[00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:04.480]   "but I'd like you to be my girlfriend."
[00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:10.460]   And you're in, and you have defined the relationship.
[00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:13.900]   And Jesus, in the most loving way possible,
[00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:15.140]   is trying to bring clarity
[00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:19.020]   to define the relationship, Nicodemus.
[00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:22.020]   You spent your whole life trying to be good for God,
[00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:24.900]   thinking being good will make you good with him,
[00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:26.820]   and you've bought a lie,
[00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:29.260]   because you will never see heaven
[00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:30.600]   by how good of a person that you are.
[00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:32.640]   It comes from a spiritual birth,
[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:35.420]   and the analogy of a spiritual birth is pretty brilliant,
[00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:37.980]   because being a father of three,
[00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:40.700]   I haven't seen my own kids go through three,
[00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:44.980]   there's some striking and fascinating similarities
[00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:47.620]   to the spiritual birth and how it takes place.
[00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:49.820]   Perhaps one of the more perplexing things
[00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:53.040]   when I think about physical, actual having kids birth,
[00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:56.500]   is the disproportionate load God has distributed
[00:16:56.500 --> 00:17:00.540]   to the father and the mother in terms of carrying the child.
[00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:01.380]   What do I mean?
[00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:02.780]   I mean, the mom has to have,
[00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:04.220]   she goes through morning sickness,
[00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:06.860]   she gets uncomfortable, she's getting pregnancy pillows,
[00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:10.140]   she goes through all of, like, the body changing,
[00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:12.060]   and this is all before even the delivery
[00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:14.260]   of all that takes place there,
[00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:16.900]   and all of the ways that she is carrying the load
[00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:19.100]   of bringing this child into the world,
[00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:21.140]   and then there's the dad's contribution,
[00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:24.000]   which is the thing he wants to do
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.580]   and thinks about all the time anyways.
[00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:30.580]   And yet, perhaps most perplexing of all,
[00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:37.160]   is the contribution that is even less,
[00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:39.100]   and that's of the baby.
[00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:41.860]   In other words, in your birth, in my birth,
[00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:44.060]   physical birth of any child,
[00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:48.680]   the child has nothing to do with deciding and willing
[00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:53.680]   and being the one who is responsible for that birth.
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:56.100]   It's his parents.
[00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:59.980]   And in a spiritual sense, that's what Jesus is saying.
[00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:03.740]   Flesh gives birth to flesh.
[00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:06.440]   Being able to see the kingdom of God
[00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:11.440]   is an act only the spirit of God can produce.
[00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:15.380]   And he's talking about the miracle of, you know,
[00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:18.900]   theology or seminaries and basically masters
[00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:22.160]   in Bible schools we'll call regeneration,
[00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:25.220]   of being made this new life that God births.
[00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:28.820]   And Nicodemus is realizing every category
[00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:32.140]   and understanding of who God is is being exploded,
[00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:34.620]   and realizing, man, being good
[00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:35.900]   doesn't make you good with God.
[00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:37.780]   And here's where this hits home, I think, in the room.
[00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:39.400]   There's certain of us that think, man,
[00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:42.580]   God's love for me or my relationship with him
[00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:45.180]   or my ability to show up and feel like I'm good with God
[00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:47.780]   is dependent on how well I've been doing recently.
[00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:50.580]   How much my church attendance,
[00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:52.280]   whether or not I'm still looking at pornography
[00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:55.980]   or whether or not I'm still messing up sexually,
[00:18:55.980 --> 00:19:00.060]   all of which are commands that God gives,
[00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:02.380]   not for you to earn his love,
[00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:04.920]   but to experience his love.
[00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:07.420]   But those are not the reason or basis
[00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:08.560]   we can have a relationship with God.
[00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:10.340]   So there's that camp that think, man,
[00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:12.360]   if I'm good, then I'm good with God.
[00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:13.300]   And then there's the other camp,
[00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:15.900]   and I think this is more common in my experience,
[00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:21.460]   of people who think, oh, man, that sounds so good.
[00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:23.420]   Oh, you just don't know what I've done.
[00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:27.580]   And you're still believing the same lie.
[00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:31.340]   It's your behavior that determines your ability
[00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:34.140]   to have a relationship with God
[00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:36.540]   or to have eternal life.
[00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:39.080]   And Jesus, he's just getting started,
[00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:41.040]   but he's just blowing the categories, Nicodemus.
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:42.480]   You've been wrong.
[00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:44.200]   And then in verse 70, he says,
[00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:45.680]   you shouldn't be surprised at my saying
[00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:46.820]   you must be born again.
[00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:49.140]   The wind blows wherever it pleases.
[00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:50.180]   You hear its sound,
[00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:52.920]   but you cannot tell where it comes from
[00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:53.760]   or where it's going.
[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:55.040]   So it is with everyone born of the Spirit.
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:57.760]   He says, just like you feel the wind blowing
[00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:01.320]   against the trees or against yourself,
[00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:03.060]   there's things you don't fully understand,
[00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:05.480]   and they're undeniably real.
[00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:06.880]   So it is when the Spirit of God
[00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:10.000]   begins to impact someone's life.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.320]   And then verse nine,
[00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:13.840]   and he's gonna tell us the evidence
[00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:15.900]   of that new birth in someone's life.
[00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:20.680]   How can this be, Nicodemus asked.
[00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:25.360]   Jesus said, you are Israel's teacher,
[00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:29.780]   and do you not understand these things?
[00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:32.820]   This is the ultimate, do you even lift, bro?
[00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:35.680]   You are Israel's teacher?
[00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:37.280]   Like, you're not just a teacher,
[00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:39.840]   you are the teacher of Israel.
[00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:41.800]   You're the guy everyone wants to listen to your podcast,
[00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:43.440]   your TED Talk explodes.
[00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:45.720]   People wanna know your advice on things.
[00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:47.240]   They wanna know some people's advice on different things.
[00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:48.680]   Everyone wants to know your advice
[00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:51.080]   when it comes to anything spiritual.
[00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:55.100]   And you don't understand this.
[00:20:55.100 --> 00:21:00.280]   And Nicodemus is realizing his understanding of God
[00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:01.720]   is not what he thought.
[00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:03.900]   Very truly, I tell you, verse 11, Jesus says,
[00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:07.080]   we speak of what we know and testify to what we've seen,
[00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:09.080]   but you don't accept it.
[00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:10.540]   I've spoken to you of earthly things,
[00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:12.120]   and you do not believe.
[00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:14.760]   How will you believe if I speak of heavenly things?
[00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:17.060]   No one has ever gone into heaven
[00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:21.140]   except the one who came from heaven, the Son of Man.
[00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:22.980]   Basically, you don't understand this.
[00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:27.100]   There's not a lot more deep I can go with you.
[00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:30.180]   And then he gives the hinge point.
[00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:32.420]   Basically says, Nicodemus,
[00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:35.080]   let me break it down a step further.
[00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:39.140]   Just as Moses, verse 14,
[00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:41.940]   lifted up a snake in the wilderness.
[00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:43.460]   Okay, let me hit pause here.
[00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:45.180]   He just said, just, Jesus is sitting across,
[00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:46.820]   Nicodemus is sitting there going,
[00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:48.820]   okay, I'm trying to follow.
[00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:51.100]   He says, all right, let me give you an illustration.
[00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:54.980]   And Jesus references a story he would have known all about.
[00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:56.580]   It's a story in the book of Numbers
[00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:59.180]   that Nicodemus had memorized.
[00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:02.260]   And he references this random kind of obscure story
[00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:04.460]   that if you're not familiar with a lot of the Old Testament,
[00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:06.580]   you probably, maybe you've never even heard of.
[00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:09.260]   And he references this time in Israel's history.
[00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:11.220]   Israel's the people of God in the Old Testament.
[00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:12.780]   And they were out in the desert,
[00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:14.500]   and there were these serpents that showed up,
[00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:16.060]   and this nation was being attacked
[00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:17.820]   by this huge horde of serpents.
[00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:19.460]   And they were getting bit, and they were dying,
[00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:21.180]   and they cried out to Moses.
[00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:23.540]   And they said, do something.
[00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:25.260]   And Moses, we're told in the story,
[00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:27.120]   this is what Jesus is referencing.
[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:30.500]   Moses goes, and he pleads to God, what should I do?
[00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:32.340]   And God says, I want you to take a staff
[00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:34.740]   and put a rod on it, and I want you to put a serpent
[00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:37.060]   made out of bronze on the rod,
[00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:38.740]   and I want you to put that in the middle of the camp.
[00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:42.260]   And anyone who's been bit that looks at that will be healed,
[00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:43.920]   and their life will be spared.
[00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:47.620]   And Nicodemus is hearing this story,
[00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:48.780]   and he would be very familiar.
[00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:50.640]   To you, you read past that, and it's like,
[00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:51.980]   did he just mention serpents?
[00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:54.420]   I knew this was not the church for us, okay?
[00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:56.140]   That's not really the point.
[00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:59.200]   The point is, just like in that scenario
[00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:02.180]   where this staff and rod was lifted up,
[00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:04.420]   and anyone who looked was healed.
[00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:06.620]   He's about to tell us, so it will be with him,
[00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:09.320]   but I want you to see a picture
[00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:10.400]   of what it would have looked like,
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:15.400]   of that cross being on a rod with a snake.
[00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:19.600]   This is an actual picture from 2,000 years ago.
[00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:22.800]   And that's not, (audience laughing)
[00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:23.720]   this is a joke, guys.
[00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:26.560]   Okay, tough crowd.
[00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:31.400]   And Jesus says, just like in that moment,
[00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:37.760]   verse 15, "So the Son of Man must be lifted up
[00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:45.120]   "that everyone who believes or trusts in him
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:50.780]   "may have eternal life in him."
[00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:55.760]   Now, Nicodemus, he's still confused.
[00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:57.720]   We kinda see the foreshadowing and know what's coming.
[00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:59.600]   He's sitting there going,
[00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:01.620]   I don't know what you're talking about.
[00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:03.920]   Just like a serpent was lifted up in the desert,
[00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:06.200]   so the Son of Man, what does that even mean?
[00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:08.120]   And then Jesus dropped these two bombs
[00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:10.560]   that would have gone, what?
[00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:15.120]   He said that everyone who believes.
[00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:16.240]   Everyone?
[00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:17.800]   In other words, Nicodemus,
[00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:19.920]   you're so all about the Jewish nation,
[00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:22.400]   and you're so focused on God's heart,
[00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:24.120]   you've bought the idea that God's heart
[00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:25.360]   is really just for the Jewish people,
[00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:26.840]   that he loves kinda all people generally,
[00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:29.100]   but really God's in heaven, like, yes, let's go Jews.
[00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:30.920]   Give me a J, give me an E, give me a W.
[00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:33.120]   Jews, those are my people, I'm all about it.
[00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:36.240]   And Jesus just said, no, no, no, no.
[00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:42.740]   God's heart is for everyone who believes
[00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:47.720]   in the Son of Man lifted up.
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:53.800]   Not who behaves for the Son of Man who was lifted up.
[00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:59.040]   Are you saying it comes down to belief or to trusting?
[00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:05.040]   And John, who wrote the book of John, I love this,
[00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:06.400]   he's telling the narrative,
[00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:07.720]   and he's writing it to his audience,
[00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:10.400]   who would later read it and walk through it.
[00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:15.240]   And John knows that Nicodemus may not fully understand,
[00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:17.000]   but John sees the big, full picture,
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.200]   so John wants to step out of the dialogue and the narrative
[00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:22.800]   to punctuate what's happening.
[00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:24.560]   And he writes this sentence,
[00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:29.600]   and it's arguably the most famous sentence in human history.
[00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:32.780]   And John pens 26 words that would reverberate
[00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:35.300]   through the halls of time ever since they were written.
[00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:38.000]   They would be placed on the eye block of NFL players,
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.720]   on the bottom of In-N-Out cups,
[00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:42.240]   on the bottom of Forever 21 bags,
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:45.000]   shown in Super Bowl commercials.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.720]   And he says, "Man, let me punctuate for the reader."
[00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:49.880]   This is what God is saying.
[00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:51.580]   This is what Jesus is pointing to.
[00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:57.680]   For God so loved the world,
[00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:02.320]   He was so moved by love
[00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:07.160]   that He gave His one and only Son,
[00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:09.440]   the one who would be lifted up,
[00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:12.480]   that whoever believes in Him
[00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:14.600]   shall not perish but have eternal life.
[00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:19.880]   For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn it,
[00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:23.040]   but to save the world through Him.
[00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:26.760]   And John says, "You're gonna get to the end of the story.
[00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:27.920]   "Nicodemus doesn't understand.
[00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:29.360]   "The Son lifted up like a serpent."
[00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:30.200]   What does that mean?
[00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:32.760]   And John goes, "God so loved the world
[00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:37.860]   "that He was sending His Son to be the payment and Savior
[00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:40.900]   "through His payment of His life on the cross
[00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:44.460]   "for anyone who would accept His payment for their sin."
[00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:50.060]   And Nicodemus is exposed to the second truth,
[00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:53.020]   that trusting in Jesus as your Savior
[00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:55.000]   is the only way to get to heaven.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.700]   In other words, how do you know if you've been reborn?
[00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:00.120]   Because the Bible says,
[00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:02.540]   "Only those who are reborn will have eternal life."
[00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:04.620]   And then it says, "And only those who believe in Jesus
[00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:06.200]   "as the payment and Savior for them,
[00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:08.880]   "a payment of their sin and resurrection from the dead
[00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:10.140]   "will have eternal life."
[00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:13.140]   As in, you know you're reborn
[00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:16.300]   if you have put your faith, your trust in Jesus
[00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:19.380]   as your Savior and the payment for your sin.
[00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:20.940]   Trusting in Jesus as your Savior
[00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:22.260]   is the only way to get to heaven.
[00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:23.360]   And I'm gonna move quick through this,
[00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:25.860]   but he introduces a Greek phrase, believes in.
[00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:27.000]   You know what's interesting?
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.820]   Prior to this expression or this verse,
[00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:32.280]   there is no record in Greek literature,
[00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:33.540]   which is what the New Testament was written in,
[00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:34.940]   if that phrase had been used.
[00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:38.780]   In other words, prior to that, they had believed that.
[00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:41.220]   "Hey, I believe that."
[00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:43.740]   And John says, "No, no, no, it's stronger than that."
[00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:45.940]   It's not just they believe that Jesus died
[00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:47.140]   on the cross for them.
[00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:48.560]   They believe that Jesus is alive.
[00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:50.780]   They believe that God is real.
[00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:51.780]   They have believed,
[00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:53.900]   or the same Greek word for believe is trust.
[00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:58.900]   They have trusted in Jesus as their Savior,
[00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:02.740]   as the payment for their sin.
[00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:06.780]   Those are the ones who will have eternal life.
[00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:09.100]   The Bible over and over and over teaches
[00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:11.260]   it's not good people in heaven and bad people in hell.
[00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:12.760]   It is forgiven people in heaven.
[00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:15.100]   And the only way you can have eternal life
[00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:17.860]   or be forgiven is to trust in Jesus
[00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:19.260]   as the payment for your sin.
[00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:25.500]   Which means if I think my sin is too big of a deal
[00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:28.060]   for God to have paid for on the cross,
[00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:30.340]   I'm believing my sin is stronger
[00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:32.860]   than the Savior of the world.
[00:28:32.860 --> 00:28:37.640]   If I think because of a past abortion, past sexual sin,
[00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:40.260]   past pornography, past things that make up your story,
[00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:45.260]   my story are gonna be beyond what God paid for in Jesus.
[00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:46.500]   Like that's too much.
[00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:47.320]   I gotta earn my way.
[00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:49.220]   I gotta do some good things if I'm gonna get back with God.
[00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:51.180]   I'm believing that the sin in my life
[00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:53.340]   is more powerful than the Savior God sent.
[00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:56.020]   And Nicodemus is being exposed.
[00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:57.800]   Man, you're playing a different game.
[00:28:57.800 --> 00:28:59.500]   God sent me to be a Savior.
[00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:01.060]   You know what it takes to receive a Savior?
[00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:01.900]   And this is why some of you
[00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:03.340]   will not spend eternity with God.
[00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:06.180]   You have to believe I am incapable on my own
[00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:08.960]   of doing what is required to have eternal life,
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:11.340]   which is to have a perfect life.
[00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:12.440]   And I believe that,
[00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:14.220]   and there's no amount of good things I could do
[00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:16.300]   that can make up for the mistakes that I've had.
[00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:18.420]   But the good news is you don't have to,
[00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:20.460]   which is why Jesus came into the world,
[00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:24.080]   to be your Savior, not your homeboy,
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:27.040]   not a teacher, the Savior.
[00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:28.120]   But for you to get to that place,
[00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:30.580]   you gotta go, man, I am incapable,
[00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:31.920]   and I wanna earn my way to God.
[00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:33.740]   I wanna try and I wanna work harder.
[00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:35.660]   That is not how you can have a relationship with God.
[00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:38.420]   It starts by accepting the free gift He paid on the cross.
[00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:40.940]   Everything you've ever done, past, present, sin,
[00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:42.760]   three decades from now,
[00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:44.080]   you don't even know you're gonna commit
[00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:45.680]   when you're a crotchety old man.
[00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:47.500]   All of it paid for.
[00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:51.300]   And you can golf clap for that, that's great.
[00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:54.860]   And Nicodemus is seeing what,
[00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:58.020]   a lot of people spend their whole life and don't realize.
[00:29:58.020 --> 00:30:00.500]   You'll never have eternal life apart from Him.
[00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:02.420]   And the only reason any of us ever get access
[00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:05.100]   to eternal life is not 'cause we deserve it.
[00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:08.580]   Because it's in spite of the fact that we don't deserve it.
[00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:13.480]   Honestly, it's similar to,
[00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:16.660]   like my son, he loves sporting events.
[00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:17.500]   And I've noticed something.
[00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:19.020]   When you go to a Dallas Stars game,
[00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:22.660]   or Mavs game, or Rangers game, or anything,
[00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:26.320]   they all require the same thing at the door to get in.
[00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:28.340]   A ticket.
[00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:30.820]   It's really bizarre.
[00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:32.700]   Show up, like, oh, we're gonna go to this game,
[00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:34.580]   and they're like, where's your tickets?
[00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:36.140]   You know, it's never worked.
[00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:38.540]   I've never been able to say,
[00:30:38.540 --> 00:30:40.020]   oh, sorry, we don't have tickets.
[00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:41.140]   But here's what you gotta know.
[00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:43.140]   I'm a really great guy, love this kid,
[00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:45.460]   we're nice people, pay my taxes, never killed anybody.
[00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:46.620]   And so what do you think?
[00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:47.700]   Can we get in?
[00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:50.340]   They, of course, like, you would know, would go,
[00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:52.620]   no, where's your ticket?
[00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:55.180]   And if I try to repeat, no, no, no, but you don't know,
[00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:57.060]   like, I've never cheated on my wife,
[00:30:57.060 --> 00:30:59.700]   you know, I'm not perfect, but I'm a pretty nice guy.
[00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:01.560]   Can we come in?
[00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:03.300]   They go, no.
[00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:06.180]   Because it doesn't matter about your,
[00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:07.460]   it doesn't work that way.
[00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:12.700]   The paradigm shift Nicodemus is having is Jesus saying,
[00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:16.140]   you point to your list of resumes, it doesn't work that way.
[00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:17.060]   You'll never be able to enter.
[00:31:17.060 --> 00:31:21.400]   And where this analogy breaks down is that ticket idea,
[00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:23.740]   really, once you get into a sporting event,
[00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:25.540]   your ticket, it's kind of worthless.
[00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:29.340]   But Jesus is so much more than a ticket to heaven.
[00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:34.180]   He's the means of transformation in this life,
[00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:36.460]   not just transportation to eternal life.
[00:31:36.460 --> 00:31:37.620]   And he, when you trust in him,
[00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:40.820]   he begins to change everything,
[00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:43.380]   but not because you've earned it or deserve it.
[00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:44.780]   And Nicodemus, he's sitting across,
[00:31:44.780 --> 00:31:45.620]   remember what he said?
[00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:48.720]   He said, rabbi, we know you're a teacher who comes from God.
[00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:51.580]   Rabbi is a Greek word for teacher.
[00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:56.580]   He says, teacher, we know you're a teacher from God.
[00:31:57.580 --> 00:31:59.340]   Nicodemus is also called a teacher.
[00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:02.060]   So he starts the conversation going,
[00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:04.260]   man, it's one teacher to another teacher.
[00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:06.780]   You've got some opinions, I've got my opinions.
[00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:11.180]   And Jesus is going, this isn't teacher to teacher.
[00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:14.060]   This isn't even teacher to student.
[00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:16.940]   This is savior to sinner.
[00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:19.700]   And that's why I'm here.
[00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:25.580]   And your rules and obedience following a teacher,
[00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:26.640]   that's religion.
[00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:31.640]   Trusting in a savior, that's relationship.
[00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:37.280]   And I'm not here for you to follow additional teachings,
[00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:38.360]   Nicodemus.
[00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:41.440]   And I know many of you,
[00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:44.200]   and I'm about to wrap up week after week,
[00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:47.480]   this hasn't hit home.
[00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:51.960]   And my prayer tonight is that if one person
[00:32:55.780 --> 00:32:56.940]   hasn't hit home,
[00:32:56.940 --> 00:33:01.420]   man, it would be worth every porch we've ever done.
[00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:05.160]   Because why do I say it doesn't hit home?
[00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:07.380]   I have conversations every single week down front.
[00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:08.920]   You know what often a lot of them look like?
[00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:11.400]   I say, man, this is, they'll ask a question
[00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:12.600]   or I wanna know more about this.
[00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:13.720]   And at some point I'll ask,
[00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:14.820]   hey, let me just ask you a question.
[00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:16.600]   It's kind of a bizarre out there question,
[00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:18.720]   but just curious and love to know.
[00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:19.640]   On a scale of one to 10,
[00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:22.600]   how confident are you that if you died today,
[00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:24.600]   which I hope doesn't happen,
[00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:26.000]   you'd go to heaven?
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.500]   10 being I'm totally confident,
[00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:28.760]   one being I'm not at all.
[00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:31.200]   And they'll answer and they'll say,
[00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:33.860]   you know, that's a good question.
[00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:38.560]   Five or seven, nine,
[00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:41.240]   all across the board, different answers people give.
[00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:43.040]   And then I'll ask another question.
[00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:43.980]   Seven, awesome.
[00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:45.840]   Why?
[00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:51.720]   And the most common answer looks something like this.
[00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:54.120]   Well, seven, well, because I, you know,
[00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:56.780]   I'm trying to, wrong answer.
[00:33:56.780 --> 00:34:01.360]   You and I standing before God and Him saying,
[00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:03.440]   why would you have eternal life?
[00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:05.640]   And answering and responding with any sentence
[00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:07.560]   that starts with because I
[00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:12.320]   will never be the answer.
[00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:15.720]   Because I on my own and you on your own,
[00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:19.880]   believe it or not, are incapable of bridging that gap.
[00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:22.220]   And it takes humility to say,
[00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:25.420]   I'll never be able to do that.
[00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:30.340]   But I accept you did on the cross
[00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:31.580]   what I could never do for me.
[00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:34.140]   And you died and you rose again, and I believe it.
[00:34:34.140 --> 00:34:37.520]   And if you are there, you can be a 10.
[00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:43.540]   Not because I, but I'm a 10 because Jesus.
[00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:46.820]   And I know exactly where I'm gonna spend eternity.
[00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:49.940]   At some point in this conversation,
[00:34:50.940 --> 00:34:54.780]   maybe it clicked, maybe it didn't.
[00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:55.660]   We're not told.
[00:34:55.660 --> 00:34:58.260]   We're told that Nicodemus leaves
[00:34:58.260 --> 00:35:00.940]   and no doubt he's wrestling, just curious,
[00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:02.180]   he's not sure, and he goes off.
[00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:05.700]   And fast forward a few chapters later,
[00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:09.860]   we're told the name of Nicodemus again.
[00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:12.580]   It's this time where Jesus is doing miracles
[00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:13.460]   and He's healing people.
[00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:16.420]   And He's teaching at the Feast of Booze.
[00:35:16.420 --> 00:35:17.700]   Think the Texas State Fair.
[00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:19.180]   Jesus is out at Texas State Fair.
[00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:20.860]   He's teaching, standing up on something.
[00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:22.060]   He's teaching everybody.
[00:35:22.060 --> 00:35:24.100]   And He just healed a guy on the Sabbath,
[00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:27.380]   which was a big don't do from the Pharisees perspective.
[00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:29.940]   And Jesus is becoming increasingly famous.
[00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:33.480]   And the religious leadership, that 70 men,
[00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:35.060]   that included Nicodemus, they get together
[00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:36.580]   and they go, this man must be stopped.
[00:35:36.580 --> 00:35:37.460]   We need to arrest him.
[00:35:37.460 --> 00:35:38.600]   Let's send the temple guard,
[00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:41.260]   which is like most equivalent to the mall cop or something.
[00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:43.340]   It's like, you guys are kind of staying in your lane
[00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:45.020]   at the temple, but we'll send you out there anyways.
[00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:46.540]   And so they go to arrest Jesus
[00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:47.940]   and they send him out there.
[00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:50.820]   Hours go by, the temple guard comes back,
[00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:52.300]   the Sanhedrin, that 70's waiting,
[00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:53.420]   going, we're gonna arrest Jesus.
[00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:56.140]   And the temple guard shows up and they don't have Jesus.
[00:35:56.140 --> 00:36:01.140]   And the Sanhedrin, that 70 men, goes, where is he?
[00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:04.620]   They're like, I've never heard anybody speak like this.
[00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:06.060]   It was like, it was powerful.
[00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:08.660]   Sanhedrin's going, you guys listened to a sermon?
[00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:11.240]   Like, yeah, I mean, it was really powerful.
[00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:14.260]   I mean, Carl gave his life to Jesus and that didn't happen.
[00:36:14.260 --> 00:36:15.540]   The point being, they begin to go,
[00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:17.200]   okay, this is unbelievable.
[00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:19.200]   Fast forward to chapter 11, and in chapter 11,
[00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:21.980]   Jesus raises a guy from the dead and it's decided
[00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:24.900]   he must be stopped at whatever the cost.
[00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:27.780]   And Nicodemus is watching all of this happen.
[00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:30.900]   And then one night, they send the temple guard out again.
[00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:32.840]   And Jesus is arrested in a garden.
[00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:36.700]   And he's there and he's praying.
[00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:39.540]   And Judas shows up with the temple guard
[00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:42.140]   and they take him back and they put him on trial.
[00:36:42.140 --> 00:36:45.740]   And they put the son of God on trial saying,
[00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:47.520]   who do you think you are?
[00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:50.900]   At the end of the trial, they declare with those 70 men
[00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:53.500]   among whom Nicodemus was present,
[00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:56.900]   he's guilty and deserving of death,
[00:36:56.900 --> 00:36:57.980]   but we can't kill anyone.
[00:36:57.980 --> 00:37:00.980]   So we'll hand him over to Pilate and ask for him to be killed.
[00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:06.660]   And if you're Nicodemus, and you're sitting there going,
[00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:07.620]   what has he done?
[00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:09.540]   But certainly Pilate's not gonna kill him.
[00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:11.660]   He stands Jesus before Pilate and Pilate says,
[00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:13.340]   what have you done?
[00:37:14.180 --> 00:37:15.820]   They say that you claim to be the king of the Jews.
[00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:19.140]   And Jesus says, my kingdom is not of this world.
[00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:20.900]   And Pilate says, this guy may be crazy,
[00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:23.220]   but he's not deserving of death.
[00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:25.160]   I'm just having beaten and release him.
[00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:27.860]   But the Jewish leaders, that 70 men,
[00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:30.140]   begin to incite the crowd.
[00:37:30.140 --> 00:37:33.660]   And in John chapter 19, they declare with a crowd around him
[00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:36.740]   in front of Pilate, if you release him,
[00:37:36.740 --> 00:37:38.480]   you are no friend of Caesar.
[00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:41.540]   From then on, verse 19, or verse 12 of chapter 19,
[00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:43.760]   Pilate tried to set Jesus free.
[00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:46.260]   The Jewish leaders kept shouting, if you let this man go,
[00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:48.520]   you are no friend of Caesar.
[00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:53.960]   Eventually, Pilate says, if you want him crucified,
[00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:56.020]   you can do that.
[00:37:56.020 --> 00:37:58.740]   And he's led away to be crucified.
[00:37:58.740 --> 00:38:00.500]   And I want you to think, you're Nicodemus,
[00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:02.180]   and you're seeing all of this happen.
[00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:03.500]   And this man that you went at night,
[00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:04.900]   and you're going, crucified?
[00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:06.760]   What has he done?
[00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:09.700]   He didn't crucify anybody.
[00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:11.860]   This was the worst of the worst, the murderers, rapists,
[00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:14.080]   people who had done things that society,
[00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:15.520]   there was no coming back from.
[00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:16.480]   What has he done?
[00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:18.320]   Healed the eyes of blind men,
[00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:20.680]   allowed people who'd never been able to walk to walk.
[00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:23.600]   He restored families back together when he healed lepers
[00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:24.900]   and let them go home.
[00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:27.240]   He raised someone from the dead.
[00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:30.860]   What has he done that's deserving of death?
[00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:32.760]   How can this be happening?
[00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:35.880]   And they lead him away, and he's crucified.
[00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:39.360]   And something happened,
[00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:42.640]   where it began to click in a way
[00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:44.140]   that was different for Nicodemus.
[00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:45.820]   And he went from, man, I'm a part of the 70,
[00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:47.020]   and they just led him away,
[00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:48.380]   to I am coming out in the open
[00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:50.220]   and associating with this man, Jesus.
[00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:52.260]   I'm not staying in hiding anymore.
[00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:56.880]   And after he's dead, Nicodemus, after Jesus dies,
[00:38:56.880 --> 00:39:00.180]   he goes and says, man, I don't care what it costs me.
[00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:02.980]   I'm associating with him.
[00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:05.360]   And he goes to Pilate, and a man named Joseph of Arimathea,
[00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:06.860]   John chapter 19, says this.
[00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:10.500]   They went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.
[00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:14.220]   Verse 38, now Joseph was a disciple of Jesus
[00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:16.680]   because he feared the Jewish leaders.
[00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:19.580]   With Pilate's permission, he came and took the body away.
[00:39:19.580 --> 00:39:22.780]   And who was with him?
[00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:27.780]   Nicodemus, the man who had visited Jesus earlier at night.
[00:39:27.780 --> 00:39:31.500]   And they took the body,
[00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:33.740]   and the blood of the savior of the world
[00:39:33.740 --> 00:39:37.100]   covered their hands, and they wrapped it up,
[00:39:37.100 --> 00:39:38.100]   and they buried him.
[00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:41.940]   And three days later, he would rise.
[00:39:41.940 --> 00:39:44.020]   Now, when did it begin to click?
[00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:47.140]   When did he go from, I'm afraid to be seen with you,
[00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:49.860]   to I will be performing your funeral?
[00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:54.100]   You don't exactly know, but perhaps it was.
[00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:59.940]   On that hill, where Jesus was prepared to be crucified,
[00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:01.740]   and Nicodemus shows up, and all he can see
[00:40:01.740 --> 00:40:03.940]   is the crowd around and the backs of people's head,
[00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:05.940]   and he's looking around, where could Jesus be?
[00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:07.940]   And then over the crowd,
[00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:12.060]   is raised up
[00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:16.540]   the miracle-working Messiah,
[00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:19.260]   the savior of the world.
[00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:21.700]   And maybe it began to click
[00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:26.700]   when the Son of Man is lifted up
[00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:32.940]   like Moses lifted up the serpent in the desert.
[00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:38.220]   Whoever believes and trusts in him,
[00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:42.220]   not what they've done, not what they will do,
[00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:45.980]   but him as the payment for their sin,
[00:40:45.980 --> 00:40:48.460]   they will have eternal life.
[00:40:48.460 --> 00:40:51.260]   And something happened where he goes,
[00:40:51.260 --> 00:40:54.060]   I'm not staying here anymore, I'm coming out in the open.
[00:40:54.060 --> 00:40:55.220]   In fact, church history tells us
[00:40:55.220 --> 00:40:56.300]   he went on to become a bishop,
[00:40:56.300 --> 00:40:59.780]   and eventually a saint recognized in the church.
[00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:06.340]   Now, whether or not Nicodemus,
[00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:08.100]   church history is accurate,
[00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:11.300]   the question is not did he receive Jesus, it's did you?
[00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:15.220]   And there's no more important question
[00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:16.980]   that you will ever ask or ever answer
[00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:18.740]   than that for the rest of your life.
[00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:21.100]   Have you accepted him as your Lord, your savior,
[00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:22.380]   the payment for your sin?
[00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:24.820]   And he was more than enough.
[00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:27.460]   Let me pray.
[00:41:27.460 --> 00:41:30.660]   And when I do, I wanna do something that we don't do often.
[00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:32.940]   And I just wanna invite anyone who has never,
[00:41:32.940 --> 00:41:34.460]   if you're not a 10,
[00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:36.500]   I wanna invite you to know that you can be a 10.
[00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:39.620]   I am 100% confident I'm gonna spend eternity with God.
[00:41:39.620 --> 00:41:43.660]   And anyone in the room who's never had a moment
[00:41:43.660 --> 00:41:45.060]   in their life where they've made the decision,
[00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:47.660]   I am putting my trust in Jesus
[00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:49.660]   as not the miracle man from long ago.
[00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:51.980]   He is the savior of my life, of my sin,
[00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:53.660]   of everything broken or wrong with me.
[00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:55.140]   And I accept you, God.
[00:41:55.140 --> 00:41:56.300]   And I wanna lead you in that prayer.
[00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:57.380]   And so I'm gonna pray.
[00:41:57.380 --> 00:41:59.140]   And then in a second, I'm gonna lead anyone
[00:41:59.140 --> 00:42:00.740]   that has not made that decision.
[00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:04.060]   And if there is one person, like I said,
[00:42:04.060 --> 00:42:06.300]   every porch we've ever done in history is worth it.
[00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:09.260]   There is nothing more important than you will ever answer.
[00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:14.620]   Father, I pray for anyone who has made that decision.
[00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:16.340]   You would deepen our love and affection for you.
[00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:17.980]   And I pray for anyone who hasn't.
[00:42:17.980 --> 00:42:21.940]   That tonight would be their night.
[00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:24.460]   And they would make that decision.
[00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:26.380]   And their eternity would be forever changed.
[00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:29.900]   And their life in this life would be forever changed.
[00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:31.500]   If you're in a room, if you're in the room
[00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:32.580]   and you're at a place where you know,
[00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:34.540]   I've never made that decision, or I'm not sure,
[00:42:34.540 --> 00:42:36.940]   I'm not confident, and I wanna be confident.
[00:42:36.940 --> 00:42:39.540]   I don't wanna wonder anymore where I stand with God.
[00:42:39.540 --> 00:42:44.180]   I wanna receive and accept the one who has lifted up for me
[00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:46.860]   as my savior.
[00:42:46.860 --> 00:42:48.340]   I just wanna invite you to raise your hand
[00:42:48.340 --> 00:42:49.180]   right where you are.
[00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:51.140]   I just wanna lead you in a prayer.
[00:42:51.140 --> 00:42:52.640]   And then I wanna pray for you.
[00:42:54.380 --> 00:42:57.300]   Wherever you're at right now,
[00:42:57.300 --> 00:42:59.260]   you just raise your hand up in the air.
[00:42:59.260 --> 00:43:05.900]   And there is no more defining decision you're gonna make.
[00:43:05.900 --> 00:43:07.860]   And I think God has you here for this reason.
[00:43:07.860 --> 00:43:09.820]   I see you all over the room.
[00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:11.740]   If that's where you are, let me just lead you in a prayer.
[00:43:11.740 --> 00:43:13.180]   And you can just pray to yourself this,
[00:43:13.180 --> 00:43:15.020]   Lord Jesus, I know I'm a sinner.
[00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:18.380]   I am in need of a savior.
[00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:25.020]   And I accept you and what you did on the cross
[00:43:25.020 --> 00:43:26.860]   as payment for my sin.
[00:43:26.860 --> 00:43:31.140]   And your resurrection as proof
[00:43:31.140 --> 00:43:33.220]   that payment was more than enough.
[00:43:33.220 --> 00:43:36.580]   Would you take my life and use it?
[00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:40.500]   And I receive the free gift of eternity
[00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:45.580]   that is mine because of what you've done
[00:43:47.140 --> 00:43:52.140]   out of the great love that you have for me and our world.
[00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:56.940]   Amen.
[00:43:56.940 --> 00:43:58.940]   Lord, I pray for these friends that just made that decision
[00:43:58.940 --> 00:44:00.500]   that you would take the seeds of faith
[00:44:00.500 --> 00:44:02.740]   and you would bury them deep into their heart.
[00:44:02.740 --> 00:44:04.380]   Thank you for the fact that eternities right now
[00:44:04.380 --> 00:44:05.980]   have changed all over the room.
[00:44:05.980 --> 00:44:07.320]   I pray for eternities that are changing,
[00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:08.540]   for people that are listening.
[00:44:08.540 --> 00:44:11.180]   And we thank you the new life,
[00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:12.980]   incredible gift that just happened,
[00:44:12.980 --> 00:44:15.900]   that heaven has a celebration, Luke chapter 15 says,
[00:44:15.900 --> 00:44:18.740]   that takes place when a single person decides
[00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:19.620]   to receive that free gift.
[00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:21.940]   And I pray for anyone in this room
[00:44:21.940 --> 00:44:23.740]   who sadly has not made that decision
[00:44:23.740 --> 00:44:26.580]   and has not accepted that free gift, God,
[00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:29.420]   would you graciously bring them to the end of themselves?
[00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:32.420]   And would they humbly just say, "God,
[00:44:32.420 --> 00:44:37.700]   "I'm not gonna try to earn it, work my way there.
[00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:39.020]   "I receive it."
[00:44:39.020 --> 00:44:41.980]   We worship you in song, amen.
[00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:43.980]   [MUSIC]
