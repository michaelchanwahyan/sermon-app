[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (gentle music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:10.080]   - Well hello, Porch friends, how we doing?
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.380]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.080]   I love being here on Tuesdays.
[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.760]   Thank you for having me tonight.
[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.680]   We have prayed much already, so I shall dive right in.
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.120]   We're wrapping up a series that we've been doing here,
[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.080]   if you haven't been around, and I know I've met some folks
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.760]   who are here for the first time, we're glad you're here.
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.400]   But we've been walking through a series called Adulting.
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.080]   What we're looking at here is just a mature view on life.
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.600]   The Bible says, "When I was a child, I thought as a child."
[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.960]   But I gotta let those things go away
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.440]   'cause I'm not a child anymore.
[00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.160]   There is a phrase that has been laid on your generation,
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.160]   which I believe is not necessary or correct
[00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.800]   if you don't want it to be.
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.480]   And that is that you are the generation
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.980]   of perpetual adolescence.
[00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.400]   In other words, you just don't wanna grow up.
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.040]   Hashtag adulting, man.
[00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.680]   Every now and then, you'll do things that look like
[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:01.600]   what a grownup would do,
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.440]   but you're just not ready to get it done.
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.180]   So we date like children,
[00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.080]   we think of relationships like children,
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.560]   we forego family and responsibility like children,
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.620]   we play with faith like children,
[00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.160]   and not in the way that Jesus commands.
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.000]   We deal with our money like children.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.520]   We talk about things of corporate
[00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.680]   and communal relationships like children,
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.920]   and I'm telling ya, it won't go well with you
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:30.760]   if you do that.
[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:36.000]   And so we're not talking about what it means
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.200]   to be a generation of men and women,
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.160]   and not just any men or any women,
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.720]   but godly, spiritually appraised, informed men or women,
[00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.520]   so that it might go well with you.
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.240]   Let me just start by saying this,
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.840]   because every chance I get,
[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.560]   if I could speak only on one topic,
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.440]   it would be on the nature and character of God.
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:56.280]   Why?
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.480]   Because my job is to be a servant of Christ
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.200]   and a steward of the mysteries of righteousness.
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.520]   I've got nothing to offer you except what I've been given,
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.800]   and I want to proclaim to you the excellencies of God.
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.920]   And that starts with understanding who God is
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.400]   and what he's done for you,
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.380]   but the reason I want to talk about who God is
[00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.200]   and what he's done for you is because the very first lie
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.200]   out of the chute attacked the very nature of God.
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.240]   And the problem that all of us have
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.920]   and the reason that we act like children,
[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.740]   or if you will, impetuous, feeling-driven,
[00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.240]   emotionally-based people,
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.400]   is because we don't believe that there is a God
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.640]   who is good, that we are culpable to,
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.920]   that is sovereign, and that is wise, and that he loves us.
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.620]   And so we suppress truth and unrighteousness
[00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.020]   because we think that running away from this authority
[00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.260]   figure is what's going to give us authentic life.
[00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.440]   That lie doesn't just affect millennials.
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.780]   It affects folks 20 years ahead of you like me,
[00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.720]   and it affects folks 10 years behind you.
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.560]   It affects everybody.
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.120]   It's the first lie right out of the chute.
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.320]   God isn't good, his word's not true,
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.520]   disobeying him is not that big a deal.
[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.720]   The very first lies that came.
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.260]   Now you need to know this about God
[00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.860]   because one of the things that a wise and mature person
[00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.940]   will do is he won't jump to conclusions
[00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.940]   based on just some preliminary examination of the facts.
[00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.760]   He knows that not every good book has a great cover.
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.200]   And so he wants to see what the depths
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.200]   of the content are there.
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.960]   Now when you want to find out who somebody is,
[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.620]   you listen to their words because the words
[00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.880]   are the overflow of a man's heart.
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.940]   And then you want to look not just at their words,
[00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.180]   but how their works back up their words.
[00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.560]   So let me just take you to the words and works of God.
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.320]   What God has done in this book called the Bible,
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.060]   the book, that's an arrogantly titled book,
[00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.700]   the Biblias, the book, it is the one book you need to know.
[00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:06.540]   Why?
[00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.500]   Because it's the one book that tells you
[00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.940]   where you came from, why you're here,
[00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.180]   why while you're here the world is in the condition
[00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.580]   that it's in, what to do about that condition,
[00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:20.580]   why you can live with hope in the midst of this condition,
[00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:25.260]   and what the remedy to your condition is.
[00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.540]   The Bible is not a rule book, it is a love letter from God.
[00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.100]   It is his effort to explain to you things
[00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.820]   that eye hasn't seen, ear hasn't heard,
[00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.580]   things that haven't entered into the mind of man.
[00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:41.020]   The Bible is trying to let God share with you
[00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.020]   what is going on in his story.
[00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.260]   And what's happened is we're living in his story
[00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.620]   in a moment in time that is not as he desired,
[00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.180]   but because he is not a divine rapist,
[00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.280]   he does not impose on us that which we do not choose.
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.340]   God is a God of relationship,
[00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.020]   and because he's a God of relationship,
[00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.620]   he has given us the ability to make decisions.
[00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:03.540]   And because we have the ability to make decisions,
[00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:06.460]   some of our decisions can go in a way
[00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.460]   that though they seem right to us in the beginning,
[00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:13.400]   they end up as the way of death, just like children.
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.080]   Children sometimes think, if I eat this way,
[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.760]   it'll be good for me, 'cause it always tastes good up here.
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.480]   But we know if you always eat what tastes good,
[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:24.520]   it doesn't always go well with you from the neck down.
[00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.880]   It won't look good, and it won't feel good
[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.680]   if you just put in your mouth whatever tastes good.
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.960]   Children run into danger, they don't know the difference
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.680]   between a rope and a snake, a curb and a cliff.
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.040]   And they need somebody to guide them.
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.500]   So I wanna tell you, what God has done in this book
[00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.620]   is he's told you that we are in the condition
[00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:48.740]   that we're in because we have rejected this idea
[00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:51.800]   that God is good, and that we can find life and light
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.360]   and hope and love and satisfaction in him,
[00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.120]   even though everything in the human experience early on
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.760]   testified that that was the case.
[00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:02.520]   We believed the lie, God wasn't good.
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:07.520]   The reason, the liar said, that he doesn't want us
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.560]   to eat of the tree of good and evil
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.960]   is not because we should show faith in him
[00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.400]   and have a relationship with him
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.680]   rooted in our own election.
[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.640]   And the reason that, that's why God put it there,
[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:21.360]   and the reason that God doesn't want us to eat of that tree
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.480]   is not because he thinks if we eat it
[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.480]   we can be as smart as him and not need him,
[00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:27.640]   it's because he knows that nobody
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.280]   is intrinsically good except him.
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.200]   Our goodness comes from him.
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.240]   And knowing good and evil, we won't always choose
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.480]   that which is good.
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:39.120]   Can I get an amen from this crowd on this?
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.800]   Most of the mistakes that we make, even in our 20s,
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:45.000]   is not a mistake that we make from a lack of information.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.840]   We know that probably ain't right.
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:53.560]   Okay, being addicted to two-dimensional images of women
[00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.920]   and finding my sexual satisfaction there
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.760]   and finding my affirmation from women there
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:03.480]   in a fantasy world is probably not the best route to go.
[00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:08.040]   It'd be much better if I could really share my heart
[00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:11.640]   and soul with another and enjoy in reality
[00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:13.680]   what is only a fantasy for me.
[00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:18.360]   I am not all pro if I'm all maddened on Xbox.
[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:23.520]   And so I'm not gonna sit there and wear a Hall of Fame
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:26.560]   jacket 'cause I kick tail in some Xbox league
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:28.640]   and wonder why the world doesn't take note.
[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:32.880]   I know that to be a man really in that small world
[00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:34.800]   of football, I gotta get out there
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.440]   and compete where it matters.
[00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:38.840]   And yet some of us give more time to being great
[00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:42.800]   with our thumbs than we do be actually great in our living.
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:45.480]   There's so many illustrations that most of the mistakes
[00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:49.720]   we make are not mistakes made because of a lack of knowledge.
[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:51.240]   See, God says, look, here's your deal, Wagner.
[00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:52.600]   You can know everything that I know,
[00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:53.680]   but you're not gonna do what I do
[00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:54.920]   'cause you're not intentionally good.
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:57.320]   What you need is a relationship with me.
[00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:59.700]   And the reason I don't want you to eat of this tree
[00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:02.360]   that will make you think you don't need me
[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:03.640]   is because you do need me.
[00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:05.040]   And the day you don't think you need me,
[00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:06.640]   you'll start doing things that seem right to you
[00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:08.160]   but will end up with death.
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:11.840]   So the story goes that we bought the lie
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:13.000]   that we don't need God.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.060]   We bought the lie that he wasn't good,
[00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:16.900]   that his word wasn't true.
[00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:18.240]   And we bought the lie that disobeying him
[00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:19.200]   was not that big a deal.
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:23.480]   And that got us to 2016 and where we are.
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:26.140]   But here's what you need to know about God.
[00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:29.640]   In Deuteronomy chapter four, God is starting to tell you
[00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:33.000]   a little bit about who he is and what he is like.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.600]   And he's going to do that by developing
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:38.920]   a relationship with people.
[00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:41.680]   And he's going to choose a certain group of people
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:44.000]   to work with, not because he loves those people
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.880]   more than other people, but because he's gonna show
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:47.360]   the world that through these people
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:50.840]   who he will give eyes to see, ears to hear,
[00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:53.760]   and hearts to respond, by the way that they begin
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:56.640]   to walk with God again, and by the way that they are blessed
[00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:59.340]   other nations would go, hey, what's going on with you?
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:03.840]   And they were to respond, not we're better than you,
[00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:05.120]   smarter than you, brighter than you,
[00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:06.300]   we got a better military than you.
[00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:08.800]   They were to respond, we have come to know
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:11.280]   that God is good and we have walked with him.
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:13.840]   So this is what God said to this group of people
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:15.120]   that he chose to reveal himself to.
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.200]   This is Deuteronomy chapter four, verse 32.
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:20.580]   He says, indeed, ask now concerning the former days
[00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:23.000]   which were before you, since the day that God created
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.280]   man on the earth, and inquire from one of the heavens
[00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:26.780]   to the other.
[00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:28.840]   In other words, go look back through all of human history.
[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:30.680]   Has anything been done like this great thing,
[00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:34.280]   which is you who were lost and in darkness
[00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:37.200]   have been called out of darkness into this great light.
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:41.680]   Has anybody ever heard of anything like this?
[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:44.380]   This isn't just some myth, this is anchored in history.
[00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:49.800]   Verse 33, has anybody heard the voice of God
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:52.380]   speaking from the midst of a fire
[00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:54.960]   as you have heard it and survived?
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:56.560]   No, God, the very God of creation,
[00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:59.200]   the power of the internal earth has come to you
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:01.280]   and told you something, or has a God tried to take
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:03.600]   for himself a nation from another nation
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:06.160]   by trials, by signs, and by wonders,
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.320]   and by war and a mighty hand and an outstretched arm?
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:10.120]   Now watch this, and by great tears
[00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:13.600]   as the Lord has done for you, know that the Lord,
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:16.080]   he is God, there is no other beside him,
[00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:17.800]   it says in verse 35.
[00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:19.000]   This is the God you've come to know.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.800]   This is the words of Moses as he's getting ready
[00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:24.080]   to advocate his leadership, pass it on
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:26.240]   to the next generation of leaders,
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:30.680]   and he's telling them, just observe who you are,
[00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:32.120]   where you've come from, why you've been given
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:33.680]   what you've been given, out of the heavens,
[00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:35.960]   he lets you hear his voice to discipline you,
[00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:37.880]   and on earth he let you see his great fire,
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:39.880]   the scripture says, and you heard his words
[00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:41.880]   in the midst of the fire, why?
[00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:44.600]   Why does God give us his words?
[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:46.660]   The scripture tells us in verse 37,
[00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:50.920]   because he loves your fathers.
[00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:57.680]   Therefore he chose to love the children of those fathers,
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:00.840]   and he personally brought you out of slavery
[00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:03.280]   and bondage and oppression from wicked rulers,
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:06.400]   which is represented by Egypt to the Israeli people,
[00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:08.040]   by his great power.
[00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:11.720]   You didn't do anything except follow God to life,
[00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:13.280]   just like in the New Testament.
[00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:16.640]   And when you got into this land you're about to go in,
[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:18.240]   he's gonna drive out nations that are greater
[00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:20.800]   and mightier than you to bring you
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:22.640]   and to give you in their land for an inheritance
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:24.120]   as it is today, know therefore today,
[00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:25.240]   watch this, we're getting to the point,
[00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:27.080]   know therefore today and take it into your heart
[00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:30.160]   that the Lord, he is God in heaven, above,
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:33.520]   and on the earth below, there is no other.
[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:35.740]   Know that he is God, know that he is good,
[00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:37.400]   know that his word is true, know that he's trying
[00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:40.400]   to save you from oppression, the oppression of self,
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:44.520]   or some sick other human who is trying
[00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:47.440]   to establish himself by oppressing you.
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:51.400]   And he says this to you, so you shall keep his statutes
[00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:53.480]   and his commandments which I am giving you today.
[00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:54.880]   That's not new information, right,
[00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:55.960]   that God wants you to listen to him,
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:57.600]   but I want you to listen to why.
[00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:01.720]   That it might go well with you
[00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:05.040]   and with your children after you,
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:09.560]   and that you may live long in the land
[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:12.100]   which the Lord your God is giving you for all time.
[00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:15.240]   Did you see what the heart of God is?
[00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:19.260]   The heart of God is that you would grow up
[00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.080]   and not think like an impetuous child
[00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:23.640]   who always thinks he knows more than other people
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:26.520]   and who will throw fits and tantrums and cry
[00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:28.800]   and use intimidations and every manipulation
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:31.000]   known to humankind to get what they want
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.520]   because they are absolutely certain
[00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:33.980]   that their dad must hate them
[00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:36.320]   because he doesn't pour Mountain Dew on his Lucky Charms
[00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:37.780]   breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
[00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:42.680]   And yet that dad goes, listen, I'd love nothing more
[00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:44.440]   than to give you a bowl of ice cream every now and then.
[00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:46.640]   I love the marshmallow, you know,
[00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:51.060]   in that little bad sugar-coated wheat inside Lucky Charms,
[00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:52.600]   but we can't live like that.
[00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:54.740]   It's not because I'm mean.
[00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:57.520]   It's 'cause I love you.
[00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:00.800]   And see, what happens as you grow,
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:02.160]   you start to understand
[00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:05.560]   that your mom wasn't just a jerk
[00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:07.280]   and your dad wasn't oppressive.
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:10.760]   They really wanted it to go well with you,
[00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:12.560]   and so you start then to act like them
[00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.120]   and feed yourself like them
[00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:16.400]   and hopefully walk like they wanted you to walk
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:18.720]   if you had parents who pushed you in that direction.
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:20.800]   This is the story of who God is.
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:21.640]   He is our Father.
[00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:23.460]   Some of you guys did have parents
[00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:25.260]   who loved you well and led you well.
[00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.500]   And God, the Scripture says,
[00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:30.460]   has a special place in his heart for you.
[00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:33.580]   And he doesn't want you to continue
[00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:35.460]   the legacy of dysfunction.
[00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:37.300]   He wants it to go well with you,
[00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:39.180]   that it might go well with your children after you,
[00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:41.340]   and that you might live long in the land,
[00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:43.480]   not be defined by despair.
[00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:48.300]   Now, here's the thing.
[00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:51.820]   The way things go with leaders
[00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:53.660]   is typically the way things go with the land.
[00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:55.340]   The reason I love to talk to the porch
[00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:56.660]   is because this is true.
[00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:58.880]   The philosophy of schoolchildren in one generation
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:02.460]   will be the philosophy of government in the next.
[00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:03.920]   Let me say that again.
[00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:06.300]   The philosophy of schoolchildren in one generation
[00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:10.900]   will be the philosophy of government in the next.
[00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:13.700]   And so what you're seeing in America today
[00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:18.300]   is leadership that has not been discipled
[00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:20.100]   and that acts like children
[00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:22.380]   and that doesn't know that there is a God
[00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:26.160]   who they should trust in,
[00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:29.100]   that if they trust in him,
[00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:32.440]   it will go well with them and for their children,
[00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:33.980]   and they will live long in the land.
[00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:36.020]   What you're seeing is that we are about
[00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:37.420]   to put ourself in a position
[00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:39.160]   where our land is no longer secure.
[00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:41.220]   If there's anybody that's suffering in America today,
[00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:44.620]   it is children, and it is not going well with us in general.
[00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:47.620]   We keep pretending we don't have $19 trillion in debt.
[00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:53.260]   We keep pretending that annihilating 60 million Americans
[00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:59.260]   because they seem inconvenient to us is not a problem.
[00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:02.540]   And the fact that we don't keep adding workers
[00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:05.980]   to our workforce that would go to work
[00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:09.260]   and contribute to the social welfare system
[00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:10.420]   and the fact that they're absent
[00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:12.660]   isn't part of the reason that we have a problem
[00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:15.280]   supporting this generation of folks who aren't working now.
[00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:17.580]   We just suppress the truth that unrighteousness
[00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:18.860]   is not going well with us,
[00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:20.680]   and there's going to be a day very soon
[00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:22.580]   when we are not secure in the land,
[00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:23.420]   and I'm gonna tell you,
[00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:26.340]   already we see our children suffering immensely.
[00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:28.680]   Depression is at an all-time high with children.
[00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:31.280]   Suicide rates at an all-time high with children.
[00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:36.560]   Drug use, medicating ourselves, all-time high.
[00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:41.620]   Emptiness, lostness, despair,
[00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:43.660]   fracture in the home, all-time high.
[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:51.720]   Because we don't have leaders who are adults,
[00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:55.400]   who understand truth and consequences.
[00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:57.580]   And God loves you.
[00:15:57.580 --> 00:15:58.540]   Here's what I want to tell you something.
[00:15:58.540 --> 00:15:59.640]   You guys look at this and you go,
[00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:02.920]   "What is this world that our parents have given us?"
[00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:04.740]   And you probably look specifically
[00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:06.860]   at leadership and government and you go,
[00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:09.740]   "I don't have any interest in government.
[00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:12.040]   "I have no interest in politics
[00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:14.780]   "because politics is not the source of my hope."
[00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:16.100]   And let me just encourage you,
[00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:17.660]   you are absolutely right when you say
[00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:19.640]   politics are not the source of your hope,
[00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:21.840]   but I'm gonna tell you something.
[00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:26.200]   Politics are something that you're responsible for.
[00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:28.980]   And the source of your hope
[00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:31.960]   wants you to have an effective politic.
[00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:35.060]   And what I'm gonna talk to you tonight about
[00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:39.780]   is having an adult view of government, policy, and politics.
[00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:42.540]   Because let me tell you,
[00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:44.820]   right now in this generation,
[00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:48.700]   apathy towards politics is at an all-time high.
[00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:50.860]   And on one hand, I wouldn't blame you
[00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:52.140]   because you go and say
[00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:54.140]   there's nothing but corruption that is there.
[00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:56.260]   Let me just read you a few quotes
[00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.680]   that have been around when you start to think about
[00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:00.620]   politics in general.
[00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:03.260]   And I love these because you're not the first people
[00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:04.260]   that have been discouraged
[00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:07.700]   when you start to think about politics and how they go.
[00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:09.420]   John Adams.
[00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:12.540]   That's like, "We're just getting started, John Adams."
[00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:16.420]   Said this, "That in my many years,
[00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:18.100]   "I have come to a conclusion
[00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:21.180]   "that one, useless man is a shame.
[00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:23.100]   "Two is a law firm.
[00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:24.740]   "Three is Congress."
[00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:25.580]   All right?
[00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:27.940]   And that's like right out of the chute.
[00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:30.580]   Mark Twain said this, "Suppose you were an idiot.
[00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:33.660]   "And suppose you were a member of Congress."
[00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:34.860]   "But I repeat myself."
[00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:35.860]   That's what he said.
[00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:40.200]   G. Gordon Liddy, who worked in the Nixon administration,
[00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:41.040]   said this.
[00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:45.600]   He said, "A liberal, or somebody who doesn't live by laws
[00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:47.800]   "that are right, is someone who feels a great debt
[00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:50.900]   "to his fellow man, which debt he proposes to pay off
[00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:52.740]   "with your money."
[00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:54.700]   He didn't trust folks in government.
[00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:57.180]   P.J. O'Rourke, a guy that was another leader and thinker,
[00:17:57.180 --> 00:18:00.940]   said, "If you think healthcare is expensive now,
[00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:03.440]   "wait until you see what it costs when it's free."
[00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:10.860]   And one guy said this 400 years before Christ.
[00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:12.660]   "Just because you don't take an interest in politics
[00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:15.540]   "doesn't mean politics won't take an interest in you."
[00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:17.700]   In other words, let me just tell you something, guys.
[00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:21.800]   Politics comes from the root word which means citizen.
[00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:23.300]   When you talk about politics,
[00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:25.340]   you're talking about citizenry.
[00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:27.460]   One of the same words that has the same root word
[00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:29.800]   as citizenry is the word for polite.
[00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:32.580]   In other words, politics is us talking about governance.
[00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:34.040]   How are we going to live?
[00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:35.860]   What is right, what is wrong,
[00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:38.260]   what is going to make it go well with us,
[00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:40.220]   and what is going to lead to despair?
[00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:42.700]   And so if you, Christian, if you,
[00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:44.580]   a person who's supposed to seek the welfare
[00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:46.260]   of the city in which you live, why?
[00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:47.380]   Because you're like your father
[00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:48.860]   who seeks the welfare of people
[00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:51.000]   and seeks to rescue them from darkness
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.420]   and deliver them to light.
[00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:55.100]   You, who are here as aliens and strangers,
[00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:56.940]   'cause you don't live like the rest of the children
[00:18:56.940 --> 00:18:58.780]   who don't know that there is a set standard
[00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:01.140]   of righteousness and good given you by a loving father
[00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:02.380]   who wants it to go well with you,
[00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:04.020]   you seek the welfare of others
[00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:05.820]   by being heralds of righteousness
[00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:08.940]   and declaring to others the way, the truth,
[00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:10.580]   and where life can be found.
[00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:13.140]   You should be concerned with the way
[00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:14.900]   that men govern their lives,
[00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:17.260]   because the way that men govern their lives
[00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:19.340]   will lead to the way that men live.
[00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:25.460]   And so you can't afford to be apathetic,
[00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:28.340]   apathetic from the word pathos, which means emotion.
[00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:30.020]   We get empathy.
[00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:31.740]   I feel your pain.
[00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:36.740]   If you are apathetic, it means you don't really care.
[00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:38.820]   One kid was asked by his teacher one day,
[00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:41.180]   "Hey man, what's apathy mean?"
[00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:43.620]   Johnny, and Johnny, "I don't know, I don't care."
[00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:46.540]   Okay, so that was the only question he got right, right?
[00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:48.040]   That's what apathy means.
[00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:56.140]   We can't afford to be apathetic about conduct.
[00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:58.280]   The same root word for politics
[00:19:58.280 --> 00:19:59.780]   is the same word for polite.
[00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:03.000]   The word polite is the word for what is right.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.820]   The word right is the same root word for righteousness.
[00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:07.820]   If we're not concerned for righteousness,
[00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:09.620]   what are we concerned with?
[00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:15.500]   And the reason that God is concerned for righteousness
[00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:17.360]   is because he's concerned with you.
[00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:21.900]   And so I'm just gonna tell you something, gang.
[00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:25.740]   You don't have the option to sit back there
[00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:30.740]   and just say, "I don't care about polity,
[00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:33.940]   "governance, politics."
[00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:37.460]   The idea of being a citizen, that's an office in our country
[00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:40.020]   we have a country that is a government of the people,
[00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:43.780]   by the people, for the people, and God is for people.
[00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:47.780]   And so he wants you to govern in a way
[00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:50.260]   that leads to blessing.
[00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:53.780]   What you are doing when you vote
[00:20:53.780 --> 00:21:00.100]   is you are delegating your right to rule to somebody else.
[00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:04.900]   And so you better not be apathetic about that.
[00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:12.120]   You better care deeply about who your rulers are,
[00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:15.760]   and you better want to know who rules your ruler.
[00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:22.820]   If you're not actively, gang,
[00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:26.740]   taking on the swift destruction that's in our land,
[00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:28.960]   if you're not paddling against wrong,
[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:30.840]   then you are being swept away
[00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:33.000]   by the current of unrighteousness.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:39.620]   And it is the job of adults to say enough is enough.
[00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:41.180]   And I'm gonna tell you something,
[00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:43.080]   your generation had better grow up.
[00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:46.500]   Because we need you, because a lot of people
[00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:48.160]   in my generation have failed you.
[00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:51.500]   And so I'll tell you what you can do.
[00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:52.700]   You can say, "My daddy was a drunk,
[00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:54.660]   "my daddy left my mama, so I'm gonna be a drunk
[00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:56.260]   "and I'm gonna leave my mama."
[00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:58.960]   And guess what, your kids will be just as angry as you.
[00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:04.960]   You can say, "My mom medicated herself into numbness,
[00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:08.420]   "my mom slept with six, seven, eight different guys
[00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:10.320]   "while I lived in the home with her,
[00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:12.320]   "and so I'm just gonna find my significance
[00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:14.900]   "and prostitute myself out to men in my 20s
[00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:18.660]   "and probably all the way through my life, just like mama."
[00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:20.660]   And you can be just as miserable as mom.
[00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:23.620]   Or you can say, "I'm gonna break the chain.
[00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:28.920]   "And I'm gonna maybe be the first person in generations
[00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:32.220]   "to start to not live like a child."
[00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:36.900]   And so I'm just gonna tell you, we, my generation,
[00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:38.020]   some of us have tried,
[00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:43.500]   but there has not been enough of us to make a difference.
[00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:45.940]   And we are giving you a problem.
[00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:47.940]   What children do when there's problems
[00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:49.060]   is they grab their blankie,
[00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:50.580]   they stick their thumb in their mouth,
[00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:53.660]   they go in the corner and they curl up and they go,
[00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:55.940]   (kissing)
[00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:57.260]   and I'm gonna tell you, we can't afford
[00:22:57.260 --> 00:22:59.220]   to have another generation of children.
[00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:02.220]   We need you to be men.
[00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:05.820]   We need you to be on the alert,
[00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:08.500]   to stand firm in the faith, to act like men,
[00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:12.000]   to be strong, to let everything you do be done in love.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.100]   It is time for a generation to rise up
[00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:18.000]   and to understand truth.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:26.440]   It is a fact that your generation is, right now,
[00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:29.860]   the major reason that a socialist
[00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:33.860]   is getting a lot of attention for leadership in his party.
[00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:39.740]   Socialism sounds like a great idea to children.
[00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:42.220]   I'm not gonna do anything,
[00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:43.980]   I'm gonna sleep in on Saturdays,
[00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:45.340]   I'm gonna play Xbox,
[00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:47.500]   and I expect there to be good food on my table
[00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:48.340]   in the evening.
[00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:51.940]   I'm gonna work out, I'm gonna be infatuated by body,
[00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:54.740]   I'm gonna play with myself and play with others' bodies,
[00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:58.940]   and I'm gonna expect to get to do that again the next day.
[00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:01.620]   If it's hard, I don't wanna do it very long.
[00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:04.560]   I want what I want, that's what children say.
[00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:07.620]   Somebody else can do the work.
[00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:11.500]   Feed me, clothe me, dress me, take care of me,
[00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:13.840]   and it will not go well with you.
[00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:19.540]   Now look, before I talk more about socialism in general,
[00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:22.900]   let me just tell you that I'm not wild
[00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:25.300]   about any of the solutions that are being put before you
[00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:26.740]   that are out there.
[00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:28.940]   I don't know if you guys have seen this little meme
[00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:29.980]   that's been out there right now.
[00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:30.940]   There's Sanders, there's Trump,
[00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:32.780]   there's Hillary, there's Cruz.
[00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:35.780]   (audience laughing)
[00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:40.220]   I ain't gonna go with Pinestraw.
[00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:44.340]   You ever feel like that?
[00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:46.660]   You're like, what the, you know, why?
[00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:48.460]   That's why you're apathetic.
[00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:50.220]   Hey, let me just say something to you real quick,
[00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:51.420]   because people ask me this time,
[00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:52.340]   what do I do right now?
[00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:53.460]   How do I vote?
[00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:55.460]   How do I determine how I participate
[00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:59.180]   as a person charged by God and given the freedom
[00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:02.140]   to have an office in a democratic republic,
[00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:04.360]   which means that we have the right
[00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:08.260]   to delegate authority for governance to other people.
[00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:11.780]   What do I do if I don't see anybody fit there?
[00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:13.140]   Well, I'll tell you what you don't do.
[00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:15.820]   Sometimes you can vote for the lesser of two evils,
[00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:16.660]   and this is important.
[00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:18.020]   I want you to listen to me.
[00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:21.660]   Until Jesus Christ himself runs for office,
[00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:24.460]   you will always be voting for the lesser of two evils.
[00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:29.980]   The Bible says all men are liars.
[00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:33.240]   Jesus says that when you look at a woman
[00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:35.300]   with lust in your heart, you commit adultery,
[00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:37.180]   but watch, listen to me.
[00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:39.780]   While it's true that compared to the righteousness of God,
[00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:44.380]   all men are liars, that doesn't mean you hire somebody
[00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:46.960]   who habitually practices deceit.
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:51.060]   Just because it's a fact that if you look at somebody
[00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:52.820]   with lust in your heart, you're an adulterer,
[00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:56.380]   it doesn't mean, gals, that you just marry a guy
[00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:58.780]   and you ignore his philandering ways.
[00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:04.740]   There are individuals who the direction of their life
[00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:06.540]   is not towards deceit, although compared
[00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:08.580]   to the holiness of God, all men are liars.
[00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:10.060]   There is none who does right.
[00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:11.700]   It's always the lesser of two evils,
[00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:14.060]   but is there a man whose practice
[00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:17.060]   and who the direction of their life, not the perfection,
[00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:19.820]   but the direction of their life is towards rightness?
[00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:20.820]   Are they humble?
[00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:23.860]   Are they ruled by a wisdom that is more
[00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:28.440]   than just the polls of the day?
[00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:30.420]   Do they know that there is a God who intends it
[00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:33.720]   to go well with them, who defines morality, not culture?
[00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:38.660]   And there are times when you will look
[00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:40.220]   at different candidates and you'll say,
[00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:41.900]   I think I can support this candidate,
[00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:43.460]   but I'm gonna tell you, there are certain things
[00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:45.580]   that you look at in candidates and you go,
[00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:48.120]   I can't call that a lesser of evils.
[00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:49.700]   That is flat evil.
[00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:52.380]   When you have somebody who says as part
[00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:54.700]   of their effort to be in office,
[00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:56.920]   I think it's okay to kill people,
[00:26:56.920 --> 00:27:01.540]   you cannot delegate your authority to that person.
[00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:09.740]   When you say, I think it's okay to treat people differently
[00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:11.800]   because of the color of their skin,
[00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:18.980]   or their gender, or their nationality,
[00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:22.440]   to oppress them, to treat them as worms,
[00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:24.300]   or cockroaches, or as less than human,
[00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:27.000]   you cannot vote for that person.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   Because you can't delegate your authority to them,
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.720]   so you'll tell, what do I do if it's them or Pinestrong?
[00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:38.960]   Okay, one of the things that really bothers me
[00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:40.640]   is I hear people say this, well, I'm not gonna vote
[00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:42.680]   for that person because they're not electable,
[00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:44.380]   not enough people will vote for them,
[00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:46.340]   and so if I vote for them, I'm throwing my vote away.
[00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:48.020]   You are never throwing your vote away
[00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:52.500]   when you stand for righteousness, ever, okay?
[00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:55.540]   And what happens is too many people have bought the lie
[00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:57.180]   that you can't elect somebody like that,
[00:27:57.180 --> 00:27:59.980]   and all of a sudden, we quit pursuing something like that.
[00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:02.020]   Do you guys know that maybe what we think
[00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:04.580]   is the greatest president who ever lived, Abraham Lincoln,
[00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:09.580]   when he ran, there were two primary parties
[00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:10.980]   in our system of government.
[00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:13.820]   They were the Whigs and the Democrats,
[00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:16.420]   and he ran as a third-party candidate,
[00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:19.660]   something called a Republican, and he got elected.
[00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:22.740]   Sometimes, a third-party candidate won't get elected,
[00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:25.680]   but what he'll do is he'll start to awaken the country
[00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:28.620]   to something better, and people sometimes don't think
[00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:30.220]   that there is something better out there
[00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:32.740]   because everybody either settled or was apathetic,
[00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:34.680]   didn't care, and didn't participate.
[00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:37.700]   You don't have that freedom.
[00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:40.260]   Adults don't put their thumb in their mouth
[00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:42.220]   and sit in the corner and sulk.
[00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:47.820]   They seek justice, they do good, they speak up,
[00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:52.620]   they stand firm, they stay humble, and they serve their king.
[00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:56.820]   So sometimes, gang, you might have different views
[00:28:56.820 --> 00:28:58.740]   on certain financial policies,
[00:28:58.740 --> 00:28:59.900]   you might have different views
[00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:02.540]   on even certain immigration policies
[00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:03.380]   about who we should let in
[00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:05.620]   and how we should deal with folks who are here illegally,
[00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:07.620]   and you might say that's a lesser of two evils,
[00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:09.380]   but there are certain things where you're gonna say,
[00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:12.080]   "I cannot vote for a lesser of two evils
[00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:15.620]   "because I can't delegate my authority to evil."
[00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:18.580]   And if that is the case, you write in, you speak up,
[00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:20.020]   you tell people why you can't,
[00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:22.500]   and you rally support behind somebody
[00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:24.300]   whose direction is towards righteousness,
[00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:28.160]   and maybe eventually, we'll have something better.
[00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:31.780]   But you cannot not vote because our country's leaders
[00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:35.340]   are not chosen by people who have the right to vote.
[00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:38.240]   Our country's leaders are chosen by people who vote.
[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:41.320]   And actually get in there and do it.
[00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:46.900]   And adults don't back down.
[00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:50.900]   They go to work, and they stand firm.
[00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:56.960]   So let me just say to you, as individual citizens
[00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:58.640]   who are concerned, therefore, with,
[00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:02.960]   as the Latin word for citizen is the same word as politic,
[00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:07.040]   it's a politike, and that person is concerned
[00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:08.880]   with governance, he governs himself well,
[00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:12.360]   and he decides to have others govern the land well.
[00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:14.760]   Let me tell you that one of the problems we have
[00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:19.080]   is that only a virtuous people
[00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:21.980]   are capable of enduring freedom.
[00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:24.180]   As nations become more and more corrupt,
[00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:28.520]   as they become slaves to more and more masters,
[00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:31.320]   they will be victims of more and more tyranny.
[00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:35.660]   In fact, when the Constitutional Convention in 1787 gathered
[00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:37.940]   and there was a lot of secrecy about what was happening
[00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:39.720]   and putting together the Constitution,
[00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:43.140]   a lady caught Benjamin Franklin as he was walking out
[00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:45.760]   of the Constitutional Convention, and she said,
[00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:49.700]   "Mr. Franklin, what kind of republic have you given us?
[00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:51.180]   "What kind of government have you given us?
[00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:53.040]   "Is it a republic or is it a monarchy?"
[00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:55.280]   And with no hesitation, Franklin looked at her,
[00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:57.380]   and he said, "It is a republic, ma'am,
[00:30:57.380 --> 00:30:58.820]   "if you care to keep it."
[00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:01.720]   Now, how do you keep it?
[00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:06.000]   You keep it in the way that our early leaders said
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:06.840]   that we should keep it.
[00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:08.280]   Listen to some of this stuff right here,
[00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:10.600]   and then I'm gonna tell you guys what we can do
[00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:12.060]   in light of where we are.
[00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:14.140]   This is George Washington
[00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:16.560]   at our very first presidential inauguration speech.
[00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:18.280]   He says, "The foundation of our national policy
[00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:20.720]   "will be laid in the pure and immutable principles
[00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:22.480]   "of private morality.
[00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:25.500]   "The propitious smiles of heaven
[00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:27.520]   "can never be expected on a nation
[00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:30.580]   "that disregards the eternal rules of order and right
[00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:32.840]   "which heaven itself has ordained."
[00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:35.240]   John Adams said, "Our constitution was made
[00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:37.080]   "only for a moral and religious people.
[00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:40.600]   "It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other."
[00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:45.680]   One guy said this about government in general
[00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:48.160]   when he took a look at everything that was going on,
[00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:51.320]   and that is this, that the best argument against democracy
[00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:53.520]   is a five-minute conversation with the average voter.
[00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:55.200]   "Democracy," one guy said,
[00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:58.000]   "gives every man the right to be his own oppressor."
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:02.060]   In other words, once people figure out
[00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:04.240]   that they can vote for themselves their own entitlements,
[00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:05.960]   it's the beginning of the end.
[00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:09.360]   This is why you have got to speak up to your generation
[00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:12.720]   who has somebody running for national leadership
[00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:15.320]   in the same way that you ran for class president
[00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:16.200]   in the fourth grade.
[00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:17.280]   How'd you do that?
[00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:18.960]   - If you make me class president,
[00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:21.280]   we'll have ice cream every day for lunch
[00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:23.120]   and pizza every day,
[00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:26.560]   and we'll have summer recess, we'll go for six months,
[00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:31.120]   and lollipops and cotton candy
[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:34.440]   and finally they just pull you off the stage, right?
[00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:37.780]   (audience laughing)
[00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:38.620]   But people are like,
[00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:40.980]   "Wow, he's gonna give us ice cream every day for lunch.
[00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:42.580]   "Let's vote for Todd."
[00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:44.680]   (audience laughing)
[00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:48.260]   Well, Todd didn't exactly approve that with the school board
[00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:51.620]   and those that fund ice cream every day for lunch.
[00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:54.940]   And so I just wanted to say this to you guys
[00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:56.580]   because that's a child's view.
[00:32:56.580 --> 00:32:58.020]   Let somebody else work for me.
[00:32:58.020 --> 00:33:00.460]   I'm gonna be lazy and selfish.
[00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:02.620]   So I wanna just acknowledge this.
[00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:04.180]   The inherent vice of capitalism,
[00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:05.440]   by the way, Churchill said this.
[00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:07.180]   The inherent vice of capitalism
[00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:09.140]   is an unequal share of the blessings.
[00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:11.620]   Some people work hard and get more,
[00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:14.620]   or some people work and get lucky.
[00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:16.580]   And so within a capitalistic society,
[00:33:16.580 --> 00:33:19.760]   there is an unequal sharing of the blessings,
[00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:22.420]   but the inherent blessing of socialism
[00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:24.900]   is the equal sharing of misery.
[00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:29.420]   Margaret Thatcher said the problem with socialism
[00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:32.060]   is that eventually you run out of other people's money.
[00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:36.980]   I love this quote by a guy named Herbert Spencer.
[00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:38.500]   He said, "The ultimate result of shielding men
[00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:39.820]   "from the effects of folly
[00:33:39.820 --> 00:33:42.820]   "is that they'll fill the world with fools."
[00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:49.540]   You can't legislate the poor into prosperity
[00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:52.900]   by legislating the wealthy out of prosperity.
[00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:54.140]   It just doesn't happen.
[00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:57.660]   What one person receives without working for,
[00:33:57.660 --> 00:34:00.700]   or another person must work for without receiving,
[00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:02.380]   that's a problem.
[00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:04.820]   And what happens is when half the people get the idea
[00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:05.660]   they don't have to work
[00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:07.340]   because somebody else is gonna work for them
[00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:08.760]   and they will take care of them,
[00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:09.920]   then when the other half gets the idea
[00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:11.160]   that it's no good to work
[00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:13.460]   because they don't get taken care of
[00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:14.820]   with their own effort and work,
[00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:16.880]   then nobody works and then you've got real problem.
[00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:18.300]   That's the problem with socialism.
[00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:21.140]   I love this meme that's been put out there right now
[00:34:21.140 --> 00:34:23.340]   that just says, "Hey, look, man, here we go."
[00:34:23.340 --> 00:34:25.100]   Right?
[00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:26.400]   So, hey, I took half of your sign
[00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:28.540]   because you had one and I didn't.
[00:34:28.540 --> 00:34:29.860]   I'm sure you understand.
[00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:34.220]   See, that's the problem with socialism right there, okay?
[00:34:34.220 --> 00:34:37.120]   That's not the way it works, children.
[00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:42.620]   You go to work, you take care of yourself,
[00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:46.220]   you take care of those who cannot take care of themselves.
[00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:53.140]   You're generous and because you are not just a capitalist,
[00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:56.280]   but you're a capitalist whose life is informed by Christ,
[00:34:56.280 --> 00:35:00.420]   you, like him, though you are rich,
[00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:02.360]   become poor for the sake of others,
[00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:06.500]   just like Jesus did for us.
[00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:09.060]   All right?
[00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:09.880]   So, gang, listen.
[00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:12.660]   [audience applauding]
[00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:16.240]   Your generation is feeding off
[00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:20.120]   this fourth grade elementary school candidacy.
[00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:26.480]   Your generation is apathetic towards what is polite,
[00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:30.920]   political, right, righteous.
[00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:31.760]   We can't do that.
[00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:33.540]   There's 83 million of you.
[00:35:33.540 --> 00:35:37.000]   You have the ability to go,
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.380]   "Hey, look, I came from a dysfunctional family
[00:35:39.380 --> 00:35:43.260]   "who for the last 16 years and the 10 years before that
[00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:46.080]   "and the 10 years before that has lived irresponsibly.
[00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:48.480]   "I'm not gonna continue the cycle of madness
[00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:50.020]   "that my parents have given me.
[00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:52.180]   "I'm gonna say we're gonna break the chain.
[00:35:52.180 --> 00:35:55.800]   "And I'm not gonna be apathetic about how we're governed.
[00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:56.980]   "I'm gonna get engaged.
[00:35:56.980 --> 00:35:58.640]   "I'm gonna cast my vote for righteousness
[00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:00.600]   "and I'm not gonna delegate my right to rule
[00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:02.780]   "to people that aren't ruled rightly."
[00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:05.200]   That's what adults do.
[00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:14.160]   So here's what I would just encourage you guys with.
[00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:17.660]   I would encourage you guys in the midst of this situation
[00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:19.120]   that we're in is to know this,
[00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:22.180]   that anarchy and rebellion is easy.
[00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:29.680]   But administration, okay, which is righteous rule, it's not.
[00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:34.600]   And children always do what's easy.
[00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:36.000]   Adults do what's hard.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.400]   If they're good adults, right,
[00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:39.680]   that's what you wanted your dad to do,
[00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:42.240]   to do the hard thing 'cause it was right for the family.
[00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:45.000]   And some of you guys don't like dad
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.220]   because he advocated his role.
[00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:48.560]   And this is your time.
[00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:52.040]   And so if you see poor leadership before you learn from it
[00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:54.160]   and don't repeat their sins,
[00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:57.920]   somebody has to say enough and make it your generation.
[00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:00.240]   Let's change this thing.
[00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:02.880]   And say, "I'm not gonna vote."
[00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:05.160]   Certain people, they're not just the lesser of two evils.
[00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:08.660]   That is evil and I will not support that.
[00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:11.320]   That is irresponsible.
[00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:15.680]   That's that oppression of the poor,
[00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:20.220]   that discriminatory racial language, that fascism,
[00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:21.620]   that murder of the innocent.
[00:37:21.620 --> 00:37:24.280]   I cannot delegate my authority to you.
[00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:25.440]   I will find another.
[00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:29.600]   But I will not just do nothing.
[00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:36.440]   Anybody can rage against the man, folks.
[00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:38.520]   That's what kids do.
[00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:40.320]   They throw tantrums against the man.
[00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:43.580]   Adults step up and go, "I'll be the man.
[00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:45.860]   "I'll do right.
[00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:50.620]   "I'll take this thing on and I'll change this bad boy around
[00:37:50.620 --> 00:37:52.480]   "and I'll be a part of the solution."
[00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:57.240]   And so what I'm gonna do tonight with you guys
[00:37:57.240 --> 00:38:00.840]   is just encourage you to get busy and be the solution.
[00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:03.020]   What I wanna tell you to do is to make sure
[00:38:03.020 --> 00:38:06.440]   that you're not somebody that thinks
[00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:08.040]   that the solution is government,
[00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:09.640]   but you're also not somebody that thinks
[00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:12.000]   there is no opportunity to do something
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.700]   in the way that we are governed.
[00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:16.040]   That we wanna be people who step up and say,
[00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:18.800]   "Hey, I'm gonna try and make a difference
[00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:20.520]   "in this world, in this life."
[00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:21.440]   Let me just encourage you,
[00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:22.640]   this is the purpose of government.
[00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:25.980]   It's in 1 Peter chapter two, verses 13 and following.
[00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:27.840]   It says, "Submit yourself for the Lord's sake
[00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:29.860]   "to every human institution,
[00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:31.600]   "whether to a king as to one in authority
[00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:32.880]   "or to governors as sent by him
[00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:34.680]   "for the punishment of evildoers
[00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:36.360]   "and the praise of those who do right."
[00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:38.080]   That's the purpose of government,
[00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:41.680]   to punish evildoers and to praise those who do right.
[00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:44.260]   And so you wanna make sure that you put in office
[00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:45.900]   people who know what evil is
[00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:48.380]   and call evil, evil and good, good.
[00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:52.620]   And woe to a land when they call evil, good and good, evil.
[00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:57.480]   "For such is the will of God,
[00:38:57.480 --> 00:38:59.980]   "that by doing right,
[00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:02.600]   "you might silence the ignorance of foolish men.
[00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:06.080]   "So act as free men," the scripture says.
[00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:09.080]   "Do not use your freedom as a covering for evil,
[00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:10.920]   "but use it as bond slaves of God.
[00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:13.680]   "Honor all people, love the brotherhood,
[00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:16.840]   "fear God, honor the king."
[00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:21.880]   We wanna be individuals that understand
[00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:24.980]   that the way we choose a king is we ask our king,
[00:39:24.980 --> 00:39:27.580]   again, ask our ruler, who rules my ruler?
[00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:29.180]   And I wanna just share with you
[00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:31.900]   this little section of scripture
[00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:34.020]   also in Deuteronomy in chapter 17.
[00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:35.780]   This is what God said to Israel
[00:39:35.780 --> 00:39:38.240]   about something that needs to be true of the king.
[00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:42.080]   The king's gotta know that God is good, his word is true,
[00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:44.360]   that disobeying him is gonna cost people eventually.
[00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:46.480]   One of the problems we have is that right now,
[00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:47.620]   people go, "Well, it's still working.
[00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:50.000]   "We're still being disobedient, we're still being lazy.
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.440]   "It's not hurt us yet, so I guess we can keep doing it."
[00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:54.720]   And we're just ignoring the law of the harvest.
[00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:56.440]   That's you reap what you sow.
[00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:57.700]   You reap it later than you sow it,
[00:39:57.700 --> 00:39:58.720]   and you reap more than you sow.
[00:39:58.720 --> 00:39:59.880]   What do I mean by that?
[00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:02.520]   If you sow an apple seed,
[00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:04.280]   you're not just going to get an apple,
[00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:06.880]   and you don't just get an apple the next day.
[00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:09.520]   It takes time for that apple seed to germinate, die,
[00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:10.360]   and go in the ground,
[00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:12.080]   but when an apple seed germinates and grows,
[00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:14.240]   what do you get, an apple?
[00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:15.480]   What do you get?
[00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:17.200]   You get an apple tree.
[00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:20.720]   You reap what you sow, you reap it later than you sow it,
[00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:23.200]   and you reap more than you sow.
[00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:26.580]   Adults know that.
[00:40:26.580 --> 00:40:31.080]   And they don't keep reaping destruction
[00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:33.220]   and think it's gonna turn to prosperity.
[00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:37.920]   You don't just entertain your flesh
[00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:39.580]   and do whatever the heart wants
[00:40:39.580 --> 00:40:43.780]   and expect there not to be a devastation in your life
[00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:45.440]   and the life of those that are around you.
[00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:48.280]   You know that, you've experienced that.
[00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:50.080]   And so this is what God said to the nation of Israel.
[00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:52.640]   When you go to enter into the land,
[00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:55.600]   which the Lord, dear God, gives you in verse 14,
[00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:56.880]   and you possess it and you live it,
[00:40:56.880 --> 00:40:58.200]   and you say, "I will set a king over me
[00:40:58.200 --> 00:40:59.800]   "like all the nations who are around me,"
[00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:01.040]   he would say, "That's a problem,"
[00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:03.280]   but he says, "You're probably gonna do that one day."
[00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:04.560]   And he says, "When you do that,
[00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:06.280]   "I want you to make sure that he does this."
[00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:07.320]   Jump down to verse 18.
[00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:08.160]   He says, "It shall come about
[00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:10.480]   "when this king sits on the throne of his kingdom,
[00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:13.640]   "he shall write for himself a copy of this law
[00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:16.840]   "on a scroll in the presence of the Levitical priest."
[00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:17.680]   So watch this.
[00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:19.960]   This is the only person in the entire nation,
[00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:21.520]   okay, gang, that was supposed to have
[00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:23.200]   his own copy of the law.
[00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:25.840]   And when he becomes a ruler,
[00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:30.920]   he was supposed to sit down and to hand write out
[00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:34.800]   the constitution for how people should be governed.
[00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:39.320]   And he wasn't just to do it on his own.
[00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:40.560]   People were to look over his shoulder,
[00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:43.200]   hey, hey, Chumlee, you just missed
[00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:44.600]   an entire paragraph there.
[00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:45.600]   Well, I'm not really wild about it.
[00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:48.320]   It's not yours to decide what part
[00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:50.360]   of good governance you adopt.
[00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:54.240]   This is the constitution that will lead to blessing.
[00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:59.120]   We believe in rex, not rex lex, but lex rex.
[00:41:59.120 --> 00:41:59.960]   What's that mean?
[00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:03.360]   It's an old Latin phrase for the king is not the law.
[00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:04.600]   That's rex lex.
[00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:05.960]   We are lex rex.
[00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:08.080]   The law is king.
[00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:11.800]   There are certain things that we can't tamper with.
[00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:12.960]   And if you tamper with them,
[00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:14.760]   it's not gonna go well with us.
[00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:16.240]   So let's make sure you get it right.
[00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:18.520]   And by the way, this is where the idea came
[00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:19.600]   that our president says,
[00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:21.360]   "I'm gonna live by this constitution,"
[00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:24.000]   which understood sin, nature of man,
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.440]   which is why it divided powers,
[00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:27.680]   because they knew that power corrupts
[00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:30.400]   and absolute power corrupts absolutely.
[00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:33.000]   They knew that this nation had come about
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:34.280]   because of divine providence.
[00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:37.640]   They knew that all men were given by their creator
[00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:39.720]   certain inalienable rights.
[00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:42.640]   And they knew that if they did not govern themselves,
[00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:44.400]   it wasn't gonna be long before the government
[00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:46.960]   of the people, by the people who didn't govern themselves,
[00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:48.440]   would have a government for the people,
[00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:50.080]   which was leading to destruction.
[00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:55.640]   David and I were talking about this beforehand
[00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:57.680]   and I've mentioned before,
[00:42:57.680 --> 00:43:00.520]   and he reminded me of the fact
[00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:03.320]   that the communist government of China
[00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:09.280]   looked at America and the fact that America kept winning.
[00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:10.640]   Have you heard one of our candidates say,
[00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:13.720]   "China's killing us because our leaders are idiots.
[00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:15.520]   "They're killing us, they're killing us."
[00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:16.920]   Well, here's the truth.
[00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:18.400]   For a long time, China looked at America,
[00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:19.440]   "They're killing us."
[00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:25.240]   And China sent sociologists over here to study America.
[00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:29.240]   And when they came over here,
[00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:32.320]   they thought that the reason that we were successful
[00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:34.640]   is because of maybe our history, our political systems,
[00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:36.400]   our economic systems, our cultural perspective.
[00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:38.880]   They thought maybe it was 'cause we had powerful guns
[00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:41.840]   or some system of politics or economics.
[00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:44.320]   But it says they studied over 20 years
[00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:46.200]   and they went back home and they reported
[00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:48.160]   to the communist leadership of China
[00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:50.800]   that the reason that the culture of America
[00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:53.640]   is more prosperous than the culture of China
[00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:57.440]   is because of the moral fabric of the nation
[00:43:57.440 --> 00:44:01.120]   being built on this thing called a Judeo-Christian ethic.
[00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:03.640]   That is the communist observation.
[00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:07.080]   They go, "Interestingly enough,
[00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:09.720]   "this church that we've tried to oppress in China,
[00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:12.600]   "when it's come in here and it's gone into certain villages
[00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:15.160]   "and the Christian moral foundation in China
[00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:16.880]   "has swept through a village
[00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:21.880]   "where the culture of faith emerges inside Chinese villages,
[00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:27.560]   "we can see that there is a reduction in opium addiction,
[00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:30.400]   "there's a reduction in crime,
[00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:33.200]   "and Christian communities and families
[00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:35.800]   "grow wealthier in China than their neighbors."
[00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:39.280]   It's almost like Deuteronomy 4 is true.
[00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:44.080]   And what the Chinese government said is,
[00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:48.540]   "Look, gang, it's what Alex de Tocqueville found
[00:44:48.540 --> 00:44:49.700]   "when he came over here from France.
[00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:52.740]   "He said the secret of America is her greatness,
[00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:56.480]   "and when she ceases to be good, she will cease to be great."
[00:44:56.480 --> 00:44:58.600]   And folks, what you've got going on right now
[00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:01.400]   is we have a nation of children who want what they want,
[00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:04.040]   and we no longer work for the common good,
[00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:08.260]   and we no longer pursue what divine providence
[00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:12.060]   has embedded into law, and we're acting like children.
[00:45:12.060 --> 00:45:14.420]   And I feel this way, so it must be okay.
[00:45:14.420 --> 00:45:15.820]   You have to let me do these things.
[00:45:15.820 --> 00:45:19.080]   I don't care if it redefines the historic family,
[00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:22.280]   which has always been the root foundation of strength
[00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:23.760]   for any civilization.
[00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:29.120]   I don't care that life and future generations
[00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:31.400]   are the source of our strength and posterity.
[00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:33.500]   If we don't want it, we'll kill it.
[00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:35.000]   And when they come, we'll ignore them
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   and keep choosing our own little fantasies,
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:38.360]   and we'll never grow up.
[00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:40.360]   Some of you guys have grown up in those homes,
[00:45:40.360 --> 00:45:42.920]   and it's time for some adults to show up,
[00:45:42.920 --> 00:45:44.640]   and this generation can do it.
[00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:46.900]   And we need you.
[00:45:46.900 --> 00:45:50.360]   And some of you guys need to be reparented
[00:45:50.360 --> 00:45:53.040]   and reeducated by the Father in heaven who loves you
[00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:54.860]   and cares for you.
[00:45:54.860 --> 00:45:56.120]   Now look, here's what I'm gonna tell you.
[00:45:56.120 --> 00:45:58.560]   I don't believe that hope rides on Air Force One.
[00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:03.800]   I believe the hope of our nation rides
[00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:07.780]   in the hearts of individuals,
[00:46:07.780 --> 00:46:10.460]   and it rides in a righteous generation.
[00:46:10.460 --> 00:46:13.880]   The way to affect an election,
[00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:16.340]   ultimately the way to affect a country,
[00:46:16.340 --> 00:46:18.240]   I would tell you is simply this,
[00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:20.120]   is to share with others how they can become
[00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:21.760]   and walk among the elect.
[00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:22.960]   The elect are those, literally,
[00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:25.080]   that means to be called out of darkness
[00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:26.120]   into His marvelous light.
[00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:28.840]   The way to change your country is to change its citizenry,
[00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:32.400]   and the way to change citizenry is to proclaim Christ.
[00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:36.780]   And so why you should vote, every chance you get,
[00:46:36.780 --> 00:46:39.840]   you vote with your life, and you vote with your prayers,
[00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:41.260]   and you vote with your mouth,
[00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:43.000]   and you declare the goodness of God.
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:44.600]   Let me just encourage you, gang.
[00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:49.380]   You should desire righteous laws,
[00:46:49.380 --> 00:46:53.900]   because righteous laws lead to prosperous lands,
[00:46:53.900 --> 00:46:55.580]   and because you care about people,
[00:46:55.580 --> 00:46:59.220]   you want there to be a governance that is good.
[00:46:59.220 --> 00:47:01.020]   And you go, well, Ty, I don't know if I wanna,
[00:47:01.020 --> 00:47:02.320]   you know, legislate morality.
[00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:03.940]   I don't know if we should legislate morality.
[00:47:03.940 --> 00:47:07.020]   That's what law is, it's a moral code.
[00:47:07.020 --> 00:47:08.860]   There is no such thing as a law
[00:47:08.860 --> 00:47:11.220]   that is not the legislation of somebody's morality.
[00:47:11.220 --> 00:47:13.060]   The question is not should we legislate morality,
[00:47:13.060 --> 00:47:16.020]   the question is whose morality are we going to legislate?
[00:47:16.020 --> 00:47:18.620]   Man's, it seems right, but ends in death,
[00:47:18.620 --> 00:47:20.860]   or God's, 'cause he wants it to go well with you,
[00:47:20.860 --> 00:47:22.560]   your children, and your posterity.
[00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:29.460]   Just so you know, this thing called the Establishment Clause
[00:47:29.460 --> 00:47:31.020]   which was written into our Constitution,
[00:47:31.020 --> 00:47:32.660]   which says that government should make no law
[00:47:32.660 --> 00:47:35.020]   respecting the establishment of the religion
[00:47:35.020 --> 00:47:38.260]   or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,
[00:47:38.260 --> 00:47:41.760]   was written not to keep the church out of government,
[00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:44.700]   but to keep the government out of the church.
[00:47:44.700 --> 00:47:46.820]   That idea of separation of church and state,
[00:47:46.820 --> 00:47:48.140]   it's not in your Constitution.
[00:47:48.140 --> 00:47:50.460]   It was written by President Jefferson at the time
[00:47:50.460 --> 00:47:52.900]   to a group of Baptists in Connecticut
[00:47:52.900 --> 00:47:56.780]   who were concerned that the Congregationalist church
[00:47:56.780 --> 00:47:58.820]   which dominated in Connecticut
[00:47:58.820 --> 00:48:01.260]   and was trying to influence government
[00:48:01.260 --> 00:48:04.600]   by having their particular expression of following Christ
[00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:06.300]   to be the rule and the law of the land,
[00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:08.300]   the Dansbury Baptists said to the President,
[00:48:08.300 --> 00:48:09.900]   "We're concerned that we may not get
[00:48:09.900 --> 00:48:10.780]   "to participate in government
[00:48:10.780 --> 00:48:12.420]   "because we're not Congregationalists."
[00:48:12.420 --> 00:48:15.500]   And he said, "We will make sure
[00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:17.160]   "that there is a wall of separation
[00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:18.940]   "between church and state."
[00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:21.140]   And what that means is we're not gonna let the state
[00:48:21.140 --> 00:48:22.540]   tell you how to worship God.
[00:48:22.540 --> 00:48:26.640]   But it was never ever intended to say
[00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:27.700]   that we don't want the church
[00:48:27.700 --> 00:48:29.460]   to inform how we govern ourself.
[00:48:29.460 --> 00:48:32.080]   That's where righteousness comes from.
[00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:36.340]   So I'm not here, gang, listen, this is my job
[00:48:36.340 --> 00:48:37.180]   and this is your job
[00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:38.940]   and this is what I'm gonna ask of you tonight.
[00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:44.180]   We're not here to impose our will on anybody,
[00:48:44.180 --> 00:48:47.460]   but we are here to make a divine proposal.
[00:48:47.460 --> 00:48:50.900]   And that is, gang, there's a better way.
[00:48:50.900 --> 00:48:54.400]   And we tell our friends, look, I know you think
[00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:56.100]   that right now you're in your 20s
[00:48:56.100 --> 00:48:57.620]   and you can just kinda party on
[00:48:57.620 --> 00:48:58.780]   and you'll get serious about life later,
[00:48:58.780 --> 00:49:01.100]   but that's not gonna go well with you.
[00:49:01.100 --> 00:49:03.760]   I know you feel this way.
[00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:04.680]   I know the world's telling you
[00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:06.180]   it's okay to chase your feelings,
[00:49:06.180 --> 00:49:07.460]   but I'm telling you, feelings are real,
[00:49:07.460 --> 00:49:08.900]   they're not reliable.
[00:49:08.900 --> 00:49:10.340]   And what you wanna do is be somebody
[00:49:10.340 --> 00:49:12.020]   just like Jesus makes a proposal,
[00:49:12.020 --> 00:49:13.820]   there's a better way, come with me.
[00:49:14.780 --> 00:49:16.420]   Somebody who used to live in darkness,
[00:49:16.420 --> 00:49:18.580]   but now has been called out and I'm living in light,
[00:49:18.580 --> 00:49:20.420]   come to me all you who are weary and heavy laden,
[00:49:20.420 --> 00:49:21.380]   I will give you rest.
[00:49:21.380 --> 00:49:22.940]   They may not listen.
[00:49:22.940 --> 00:49:24.480]   It's not our job to change them,
[00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:26.780]   but it is our job to make sure
[00:49:26.780 --> 00:49:29.020]   that we don't participate in their anarchy
[00:49:29.020 --> 00:49:30.880]   and rebellion against a government
[00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:32.520]   that they don't get to vote for.
[00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:35.520]   Loving people won't do it.
[00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:41.020]   They will speak up, stand firm, stay humble,
[00:49:42.940 --> 00:49:43.880]   and serve the king.
[00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:49.420]   So I wanna just encourage you with this, man.
[00:49:49.420 --> 00:49:51.900]   This is not new information that we're gonna live in a land
[00:49:51.900 --> 00:49:54.060]   that goes through what we're going through.
[00:49:54.060 --> 00:49:56.420]   You know, we were told that in the last days,
[00:49:56.420 --> 00:49:57.840]   difficult times will come,
[00:49:57.840 --> 00:50:01.360]   and men will become lovers of self.
[00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:03.100]   And so here's what I would offer to you,
[00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:04.120]   just a couple of quick points.
[00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:06.340]   Number one, don't panic.
[00:50:06.340 --> 00:50:07.580]   Don't panic, man.
[00:50:07.580 --> 00:50:09.280]   But let's start with just praying.
[00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:11.620]   First Timothy chapter two says this.
[00:50:11.620 --> 00:50:14.020]   First of all, then, I urge that entreaties and prayers
[00:50:14.020 --> 00:50:17.180]   and petitions and thanksgivings be made for all men.
[00:50:17.180 --> 00:50:20.120]   First Timothy two.
[00:50:20.120 --> 00:50:23.900]   And especially those who are in authority,
[00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:27.220]   so that we may lay a quiet and tranquil life
[00:50:27.220 --> 00:50:29.800]   in all godliness and dignity.
[00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:32.420]   Because this is good.
[00:50:32.420 --> 00:50:33.260]   You see this?
[00:50:33.260 --> 00:50:35.420]   This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior.
[00:50:35.420 --> 00:50:38.700]   He wants kids to live lives of peace,
[00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:43.020]   not rebellion and anarchy,
[00:50:43.020 --> 00:50:44.820]   not raging against the man,
[00:50:44.820 --> 00:50:50.380]   but following men that seek justice,
[00:50:50.380 --> 00:50:53.300]   do good, serve God,
[00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:55.840]   and honor the righteous king.
[00:50:55.840 --> 00:50:58.320]   So we wanna pray.
[00:50:58.320 --> 00:51:03.140]   We wanna be people who, as it says in Jeremiah 29,
[00:51:03.140 --> 00:51:05.460]   seek the welfare of the city in which we live in.
[00:51:05.460 --> 00:51:07.060]   And so part of seeking the welfare
[00:51:07.060 --> 00:51:09.820]   is that we speak with informed tongues,
[00:51:09.820 --> 00:51:12.140]   and we propose a better way.
[00:51:12.140 --> 00:51:13.940]   And we say, guys, I know that kinda,
[00:51:13.940 --> 00:51:17.460]   you know, the prevailing wisdom of the day
[00:51:17.460 --> 00:51:20.660]   is, you know, kinda try before you buy and live together,
[00:51:20.660 --> 00:51:22.820]   but let me just tell you, from a sociological perspective,
[00:51:22.820 --> 00:51:24.780]   that's not working out well for people.
[00:51:24.780 --> 00:51:28.340]   I know that our generation has been told
[00:51:28.340 --> 00:51:32.020]   and sold a bill of lies that if we feel a certain way,
[00:51:32.020 --> 00:51:33.580]   we should chase it, but let me just tell you,
[00:51:33.580 --> 00:51:34.780]   that doesn't go well with anybody.
[00:51:34.780 --> 00:51:36.500]   That's the way that children live.
[00:51:38.740 --> 00:51:41.500]   Not people who stand firm and act like men,
[00:51:41.500 --> 00:51:43.900]   and let everything they do be done in love,
[00:51:43.900 --> 00:51:46.620]   not in lust and licentiousness.
[00:51:46.620 --> 00:51:51.020]   Colossians chapter four says this,
[00:51:51.020 --> 00:51:52.140]   devote yourself to prayer,
[00:51:52.140 --> 00:51:54.340]   keeping alert in it with an attitude of thanksgiving,
[00:51:54.340 --> 00:51:56.140]   praying at the same time
[00:51:56.140 --> 00:51:58.980]   for those that are also participating
[00:51:58.980 --> 00:52:02.040]   in trying to prevail polity and righteousness,
[00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:04.020]   that God will open to us a door
[00:52:04.020 --> 00:52:07.180]   for the words that we may speak forth the mystery of Christ,
[00:52:07.180 --> 00:52:09.180]   for which Paul at this time had been in prison.
[00:52:09.180 --> 00:52:12.180]   He said, pray that we'd speak clearly and winsomely.
[00:52:12.180 --> 00:52:17.220]   Pray that God would let it be obvious to me
[00:52:17.220 --> 00:52:18.120]   in the way I ought to speak,
[00:52:18.120 --> 00:52:19.600]   and then meanwhile, all of us,
[00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:22.940]   let's conduct ourself with wisdom toward outsiders,
[00:52:22.940 --> 00:52:24.500]   making the most of every opportunity.
[00:52:24.500 --> 00:52:27.060]   Let our speech always be with grace,
[00:52:27.060 --> 00:52:29.180]   seasoned with salt, as it were,
[00:52:29.180 --> 00:52:32.300]   so that we'll know how to speak to every person.
[00:52:32.300 --> 00:52:34.260]   So gang, we need to pray.
[00:52:34.260 --> 00:52:36.520]   And need to be people that aren't panicking,
[00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:38.700]   aren't surprised, but we pray.
[00:52:38.700 --> 00:52:40.500]   Secondly, we want to purify ourself.
[00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:43.500]   We want to lead from moral authority.
[00:52:43.500 --> 00:52:46.260]   This is what the scripture says
[00:52:46.260 --> 00:52:47.980]   in first Peter chapter three, verse 15, it says,
[00:52:47.980 --> 00:52:51.460]   but sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts.
[00:52:51.460 --> 00:52:54.620]   In other words, if you're gonna call people to light,
[00:52:54.620 --> 00:52:57.380]   you don't want to be people who keep living in darkness.
[00:52:57.380 --> 00:52:59.260]   It doesn't mean you're gonna be perfect.
[00:52:59.260 --> 00:53:03.100]   Hypocrites, people who sin are not hypocrites.
[00:53:03.100 --> 00:53:04.260]   You need to know that.
[00:53:05.900 --> 00:53:08.080]   People who say something is wrong
[00:53:08.080 --> 00:53:10.540]   and then do it as if it's right, that's a hypocrite.
[00:53:10.540 --> 00:53:13.260]   Somebody who makes a mistake and goes, that's a mistake,
[00:53:13.260 --> 00:53:14.660]   that's not a hypocrite.
[00:53:14.660 --> 00:53:16.700]   That's human.
[00:53:16.700 --> 00:53:23.060]   And as you mature, you become less and less
[00:53:23.060 --> 00:53:24.200]   prone to those mistakes.
[00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:26.500]   You discipline yourself for the purpose of godliness.
[00:53:26.500 --> 00:53:31.160]   You sanctify yourself as a follower of God who is good.
[00:53:31.160 --> 00:53:32.700]   And you follow the Lord in your heart,
[00:53:32.700 --> 00:53:34.420]   always being ready to make a defense.
[00:53:34.420 --> 00:53:36.160]   When anyone asks you to give an account for the hope
[00:53:36.160 --> 00:53:38.020]   that is in you, and you do it with gentleness and reverence,
[00:53:38.020 --> 00:53:40.980]   and you keep, it says in verse 16, a good conscience.
[00:53:40.980 --> 00:53:42.780]   So the thing in which you're slandered
[00:53:42.780 --> 00:53:46.100]   as people who are oppressive and who think
[00:53:46.100 --> 00:53:48.900]   that they're more self-righteous than other people,
[00:53:48.900 --> 00:53:50.740]   the thing in which you are slandered,
[00:53:50.740 --> 00:53:52.980]   those who revile your good behavior in Christ
[00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:54.340]   will eventually be put to shame.
[00:53:54.340 --> 00:53:57.180]   In other words, just what Jesus did when he was accused.
[00:53:57.180 --> 00:53:58.580]   He just said, hey man, look.
[00:53:58.580 --> 00:54:02.060]   Wisdom will vindicate itself by our deeds.
[00:54:03.060 --> 00:54:04.760]   If you like what you got, keep doing what you're doing.
[00:54:04.760 --> 00:54:05.920]   Vote for that candidate.
[00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:09.300]   But I'm just gonna tell you, if you keep doing
[00:54:09.300 --> 00:54:11.780]   what you're doing, you're not gonna like what you got.
[00:54:11.780 --> 00:54:16.220]   And so, I'm gonna suffer if I'm in a land
[00:54:16.220 --> 00:54:18.620]   where the majority of people want to pursue
[00:54:18.620 --> 00:54:22.560]   a lack of wisdom and unrighteousness.
[00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:24.060]   And I'm gonna love you and not be angry
[00:54:24.060 --> 00:54:25.560]   and be forgiving towards you, but I'm gonna just
[00:54:25.560 --> 00:54:27.060]   keep telling you there's a better way.
[00:54:27.060 --> 00:54:29.620]   And I'm gonna live in this land that is letting
[00:54:29.620 --> 00:54:33.020]   perversity and evil be the rule and the law of the land.
[00:54:33.020 --> 00:54:35.180]   I'm not gonna participate in that.
[00:54:35.180 --> 00:54:36.740]   And you may mock me because I judge you,
[00:54:36.740 --> 00:54:38.860]   but eventually you're gonna come back to me.
[00:54:38.860 --> 00:54:41.340]   And you're gonna go, you know what?
[00:54:41.340 --> 00:54:43.020]   There's something about your home
[00:54:43.020 --> 00:54:46.540]   that's different than my home.
[00:54:46.540 --> 00:54:48.640]   There's something about your leadership
[00:54:48.640 --> 00:54:49.780]   that's different than my leadership.
[00:54:49.780 --> 00:54:50.840]   There's something about your love
[00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:52.740]   that's different than my lack of love.
[00:54:52.740 --> 00:54:55.940]   Would you teach me more of your will and way?
[00:54:55.940 --> 00:54:57.940]   So we pray.
[00:54:57.940 --> 00:55:01.460]   And we purify ourself.
[00:55:01.460 --> 00:55:02.700]   And then gang, I'll just end with this.
[00:55:02.700 --> 00:55:04.060]   We proclaim.
[00:55:04.060 --> 00:55:07.860]   We are heralds of righteousness.
[00:55:07.860 --> 00:55:10.260]   We are declarationers.
[00:55:10.260 --> 00:55:13.900]   First Peter chapter two, verse nine says this.
[00:55:13.900 --> 00:55:16.140]   But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood,
[00:55:16.140 --> 00:55:18.220]   a holy nation, a people for God's own possession
[00:55:18.220 --> 00:55:20.100]   so that you might proclaim the excellencies
[00:55:20.100 --> 00:55:22.300]   of him who has called you out of darkness
[00:55:22.300 --> 00:55:24.220]   into his marvelous light.
[00:55:24.220 --> 00:55:25.220]   Gang, I wanna tell you something.
[00:55:25.220 --> 00:55:27.300]   The reason that our country is in the condition
[00:55:27.300 --> 00:55:29.480]   that it's in today is because of the church.
[00:55:29.480 --> 00:55:32.840]   This is not a radical homosexual problem.
[00:55:32.840 --> 00:55:34.620]   This is not a pro-choice problem.
[00:55:34.620 --> 00:55:36.160]   This is not a democratic problem.
[00:55:36.160 --> 00:55:37.800]   This is not a republican problem.
[00:55:37.800 --> 00:55:39.600]   This is a spiritual problem.
[00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:41.760]   And the reason there's a spiritual problem in America
[00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:43.880]   is because the church has been weak,
[00:55:43.880 --> 00:55:45.560]   ineffective, and compromising.
[00:55:45.560 --> 00:55:51.760]   Because we don't teach the word of God.
[00:55:51.760 --> 00:55:54.740]   We don't sanctify Christ as Lord in our own life.
[00:55:54.740 --> 00:55:57.720]   We've either made politics our savior
[00:55:57.720 --> 00:55:59.780]   or we've made it our sworn enemy.
[00:55:59.780 --> 00:56:03.800]   And both of those are unbiblical.
[00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:06.040]   Instead, we're servants of the king
[00:56:06.040 --> 00:56:07.720]   who seek the welfare of the city that we're in.
[00:56:07.720 --> 00:56:10.180]   And we don't vote for compromised evil people.
[00:56:10.180 --> 00:56:14.080]   And when we have evil as the law of the land,
[00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:16.240]   we don't participate in it.
[00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:17.240]   We live rightly.
[00:56:17.240 --> 00:56:19.640]   And we love.
[00:56:19.640 --> 00:56:22.520]   And we propose a better way.
[00:56:22.520 --> 00:56:26.480]   With our speech seasoned with salt, as it were.
[00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:28.680]   And we just say, man, listen,
[00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:30.200]   I think what you're doing is wrong.
[00:56:30.200 --> 00:56:31.400]   I think it's gonna hurt you.
[00:56:31.400 --> 00:56:32.560]   But I'm gonna love you.
[00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:34.760]   And I'm gonna live my life this way.
[00:56:34.760 --> 00:56:35.800]   You live your life that way.
[00:56:35.800 --> 00:56:37.480]   If that's what you wanna do, I'm not gonna endorse it.
[00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:38.320]   I'm not gonna condone it.
[00:56:38.320 --> 00:56:40.240]   I'm not gonna call it right.
[00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:42.760]   I'm not gonna participate in the craziness
[00:56:42.760 --> 00:56:44.160]   of the spirit of the age.
[00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:49.700]   I'm gonna represent the one who created the age.
[00:56:49.700 --> 00:56:54.120]   The ancient of days.
[00:56:54.120 --> 00:56:55.800]   And I'm gonna tell you he's good.
[00:56:55.800 --> 00:56:57.400]   And he loves you.
[00:56:57.400 --> 00:56:58.520]   And there's a way out.
[00:56:58.520 --> 00:57:01.840]   Pray.
[00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:03.240]   Purify.
[00:57:03.240 --> 00:57:04.080]   Proclaim.
[00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:06.480]   Participate.
[00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:09.320]   Step up.
[00:57:09.320 --> 00:57:10.600]   Speak out.
[00:57:10.600 --> 00:57:12.000]   Stand firm.
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:13.780]   Stay humble.
[00:57:13.780 --> 00:57:14.620]   Serve the king.
[00:57:14.620 --> 00:57:18.840]   Father, I pray that this is the generation right here
[00:57:18.840 --> 00:57:20.400]   where we turn this mess around.
[00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:22.800]   That we stop being children who think
[00:57:22.800 --> 00:57:23.640]   that we don't have to do anything
[00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:24.840]   and someone else will take care of us.
[00:57:24.840 --> 00:57:27.840]   That we stop being small-minded and think
[00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:31.400]   that there is no law that we're in any way
[00:57:31.400 --> 00:57:33.040]   accountable to or responsible for.
[00:57:33.040 --> 00:57:33.880]   We know better.
[00:57:33.880 --> 00:57:35.280]   We know we reap what we sow.
[00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:37.560]   And we just keep kicking the can down the road.
[00:57:37.560 --> 00:57:38.680]   And our parents did it and they seemed
[00:57:38.680 --> 00:57:39.800]   to quote unquote get away from it
[00:57:39.800 --> 00:57:41.600]   even though we were miserable growing up underneath it.
[00:57:41.600 --> 00:57:43.680]   We know there's a real debt that's there.
[00:57:43.680 --> 00:57:44.880]   We know it's just a matter of time
[00:57:44.880 --> 00:57:46.960]   before the world gets its piece of us
[00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:49.680]   and says your devalued currency,
[00:57:49.680 --> 00:57:50.960]   which is the rule and the law
[00:57:50.960 --> 00:57:53.080]   and the monetary system of the world,
[00:57:53.080 --> 00:57:54.000]   is just a joke.
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:55.760]   And if we could, we'd come get you.
[00:57:55.760 --> 00:57:59.240]   And so Lord, I pray we'd start to live
[00:57:59.240 --> 00:58:02.160]   austere, wise, humble lives.
[00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:03.720]   Not be bullies.
[00:58:03.720 --> 00:58:04.740]   Not be arrogant.
[00:58:04.740 --> 00:58:08.720]   I pray we wouldn't be hopeless either.
[00:58:08.720 --> 00:58:11.120]   But we would do exactly what the scripture says.
[00:58:11.120 --> 00:58:13.520]   We would honor the king.
[00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:16.200]   We'd pray.
[00:58:16.200 --> 00:58:19.640]   We'd sanctify Christ as Lord in our hearts.
[00:58:19.640 --> 00:58:22.520]   And we would live our lives in a holy way
[00:58:22.520 --> 00:58:23.600]   before the people.
[00:58:23.600 --> 00:58:25.280]   Proposing to them a better way
[00:58:25.280 --> 00:58:26.800]   that you have shown us because you're good,
[00:58:26.800 --> 00:58:28.360]   your word is true.
[00:58:28.360 --> 00:58:31.400]   And following you is a blessing in Jesus' name.
[00:58:31.400 --> 00:58:32.240]   Amen.
