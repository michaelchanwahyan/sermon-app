1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:08,640
 (upbeat music)

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:24,840
 - How we doing?

4
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,980
 If you could go anywhere or do anything,

5
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:33,760
 where would you go and what would you do?

6
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,080
 I just want you to think on that for a second.

7
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,280
 If you could go anywhere in the world,

8
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,440
 anywhere on the planet,

9
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,200
 some of you super righteous people are like,

10
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,440
 heaven, no, not, anywhere on the planet,

11
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,680
 and you could do anything, what would you do?

12
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,600
 This is the question I ask guys

13
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,520
 when I begin to meet with them.

14
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,120
 So like discipleship on day one, I kind of go,

15
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,880
 as I've done this, I kind of do the same thing.

16
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,640
 And so day one, I always ask them,

17
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,440
 hey, if you could go anywhere and you could do anything,

18
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,800
 what would you do?

19
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,440
 And then the second question I ask them

20
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,980
 is the same question I'm about to ask you.

21
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,880
 If you've thought about that, if you have an answer,

22
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:10,880
 what is preventing you from doing that now?

23
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,960
 Why haven't you done that?

24
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,120
 Right, you got your life in front of you.

25
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,240
 Most of you are single.

26
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,160
 Why haven't you gone?

27
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:22,120
 And the reason I ask that question

28
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:26,200
 is because in two questions, as I get to know guys,

29
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:30,600
 it shows me their desires and it shows me their fears.

30
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,280
 Some of them, not exhaustively, but some of their desires,

31
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,360
 I get to know them a little bit,

32
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,400
 and it shows me some of their fears,

33
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,320
 the things that would hold them back.

34
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:43,200
 And as we were talking about this in sermon prep recently,

35
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,520
 my friend Garrett, who leads us out in Fort Worth,

36
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:50,840
 he said, you know, I just did it, I just went on that trip.

37
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,680
 And I was like, you did?

38
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,520
 I was like, well, tell me about it.

39
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,980
 And he goes, well, you know, I got a GoPro

40
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,800
 right before we went and I got some footage.

41
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,800
 Do you wanna see it?

42
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,160
 And I said, sure, yeah, yeah, sure.

43
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,920
 I'll watch your little amateur GoPro video, that's fine.

44
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:07,200
 And as I watched it, I was like, oh, man.

45
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,200
 Where was my invite, dog?

46
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,920
 Like, you don't wanna call a brother?

47
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,840
 And so anyway, I'll just show you what he showed me.

48
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,800
 Just watch this few minutes of his trip.

49
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,000
 This is where he did, this is where he went.

50
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,080
 I was like, man, are you serious?

51
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,420
 I mean, you didn't go to Sao Padre.

52
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:28,860
 I mean, you went on a trip, right?

53
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:33,660
 So 11 days, seven flights, five countries, right?

54
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:37,460
 Bali, Indonesia, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong.

55
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,940
 And I'm like, bro, where was my invitation?

56
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:42,080
 I feel like I missed out on the adventure.

57
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,320
 And tonight we're talking about missing out

58
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,260
 on the adventure.

59
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:50,060
 Some of you think, man, if I become a Christian,

60
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,820
 I gotta forfeit my fun.

61
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,260
 I'm not gonna have fun anymore.

62
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:55,700
 I mean, I used to think that.

63
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,660
 I used to look at those really serious Christians.

64
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,420
 They didn't make, honestly, a lot of Christians,

65
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,860
 didn't make Christianity look all that much fun.

66
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:05,680
 I was like, I don't wanna do that.

67
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,820
 And some of you, you got one foot in the world,

68
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:11,300
 one foot in the church, and you're missing out on both.

69
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,920
 You haven't fully embraced both.

70
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,340
 You got these sins that you're carrying with you,

71
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:17,720
 and I don't mean like we're all sinners.

72
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,300
 I mean like things that are coming

73
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,200
 between you and Christ, real idols.

74
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,940
 Others of you are like, man, I've been in a church,

75
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:25,880
 my entire life, and I know what religion is.

76
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,340
 It's a bunch of rules, and I follow them,

77
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,580
 and I'm really good at keeping them.

78
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:29,820
 And you don't know Jesus.

79
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:33,840
 And you're missing out on the adventure

80
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,540
 that I see in this book that Christ calls us to.

81
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:40,860
 And I don't want you to.

82
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:44,060
 In fact, I'm real passionate about you jumping

83
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,460
 on the adventure with us.

84
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:49,940
 I'm telling you, Jesus has invited us on an adventure.

85
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:52,260
 So as we move through this series, missing out,

86
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,620
 we've talked about this idea of FOMO, right?

87
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:57,140
 This thing that our generation has created,

88
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,340
 the fear of missing out.

89
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:01,020
 Tonight we're talking about missing out on the adventure.

90
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,660
 And I've been very, very vocal.

91
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,520
 If you've hung out with us for a while,

92
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,340
 that sin robs you of creativity.

93
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,380
 As I look back on my life, I realize

94
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:09,620
 that I was doing the same things,

95
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,060
 taking the same shots of Patron,

96
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,820
 going to the same bars, the same clubs,

97
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,980
 sleeping with the same girl, doing the same drugs,

98
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,640
 and thinking that was life.

99
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,260
 What a joke.

100
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:23,100
 What, like a dog to his vomit.

101
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,740
 What a joke, I was deceived.

102
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:28,460
 And you know what, I thought Christians were deceived.

103
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,940
 And I was deceived.

104
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:33,740
 And I don't want you to be deceived.

105
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:37,660
 And so what does it look like if we went all in with Jesus?

106
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:41,020
 'Cause I'm telling you, man, if you're stuck

107
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,980
 in that routine of doing the same things,

108
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:45,080
 expecting different results, you're missing out

109
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,260
 on the adventure Christ is calling you to.

110
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:50,240
 In fact, idols in our lives cause us

111
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,060
 to miss out on real worship.

112
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:58,020
 And lukewarm, Americanized Christianity

113
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,920
 causes us to miss out on the adventure

114
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,540
 that Jesus has called us to.

115
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,980
 And I don't want that either.

116
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:07,980
 So let me ask you a question.

117
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:10,300
 Before we go any further in the message,

118
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,820
 I just want you to reflect on something.

119
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:16,420
 What if you believed God was real?

120
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,460
 There's a God, a creator God, the heavens and the earth,

121
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,900
 he controls everything, he loves you.

122
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,980
 What if you just, at a heart level,

123
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:25,300
 what would your life look like if you completely grasped

124
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:29,060
 that what if you believed God is real, the Bible is true,

125
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:32,140
 Jesus is the way, and there's a heaven and there's a hell

126
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,560
 and everybody goes somewhere?

127
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,620
 What if you believed that with all your heart,

128
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,220
 like you were, you like woke up and you're like,

129
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:42,240
 I know for a fact, God is real, the Bible is true,

130
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,580
 Jesus is the way, and there's heaven and hell,

131
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,700
 and we're all gonna spend eternity somewhere.

132
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,400
 What would your life look like?

133
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:53,680
 If you believed that with all your heart,

134
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,920
 what would you do, how would you live, where would you go?

135
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:04,740
 And what's holding you back right now from going all in?

136
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:07,700
 So tonight we're gonna look at possibly

137
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:11,440
 the most relevant passage in the scripture

138
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,200
 to Dallas and Fort Worth.

139
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:18,200
 It's a real life account of Jesus interacting with someone.

140
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,120
 It's not a parable, it's not a fictional story

141
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,280
 told for a purpose, this is a real account of Jesus

142
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,160
 interacting with someone that I would say,

143
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,960
 arguably, we all want to be.

144
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,520
 And it's interesting to me that we wanna be most,

145
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,080
 the person from the scripture that we wanna be the most

146
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,880
 is the person who did not follow Christ.

147
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,280
 And you're like, no, JB, I don't wanna be someone

148
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,440
 who didn't follow Christ, I wanna be someone

149
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,880
 who did follow Christ, but I would say the way

150
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,360
 that we live our lives, most of us tonight in this room,

151
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,160
 the way that we live our lives says that who we wanna be

152
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:53,160
 most like is the one who is young, who is wealthy,

153
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:57,720
 and who is powerful, known in the scriptures

154
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,000
 as the rich young ruler.

155
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,960
 And so that's where we'll be in Mark 10.

156
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:06,320
 And specifically, we're gonna talk about this adventure,

157
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:10,480
 what is not needed, what is needed to go on the adventure,

158
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:15,480
 and what you gain from the adventure in Mark chapter 10.

159
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,640
 This story, in fact, shows up in all the synoptic gospels.

160
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,280
 Synoptic just means the firsthand account.

161
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,200
 These people, Matthew, Mark, and Luke,

162
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,040
 they all wrote the gospels based on what they saw.

163
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,320
 Then John, not part of the synoptic gospels,

164
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,960
 but a part of the gospels, wrote his account much later,

165
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,280
 or later, I'll say.

166
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,840
 And so Matthew, Mark, Luke, they're just writing down

167
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,560
 what they see, the synoptic gospels.

168
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,800
 And so all three of them have this story in their account.

169
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,560
 And so we have lots of details from this story.

170
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,120
 We know this guy pretty well.

171
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,480
 We know that he was a ruler, that he was powerful,

172
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,120
 we know that he was young, he was a young adult,

173
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,320
 he beat here at the porch.

174
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,480
 We know that he had lots of money.

175
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,880
 All of these accounts tell us,

176
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,320
 we gather these details from these three accounts.

177
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,400
 In Mark chapter 10, he says this.

178
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,680
 Now, I love what the ESV says.

179
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,080
 It says, "Jesus was on a journey."

180
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,840
 Jesus was on an adventure.

181
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,640
 He sets out on an adventure.

182
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,800
 Here in the NIV, it says this.

183
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,840
 "As Jesus started on his way,

184
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:11,520
 "a man ran up to him and fell on his knees before him,"

185
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,880
 and says, "Good teacher."

186
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,160
 In Greek, it's perfect rabbi.

187
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:21,360
 He asked, "What must I do to inherit eternal life?"

188
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,440
 He asked the question you wanna know the answer to.

189
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,240
 What do I gotta do to get into heaven?

190
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,920
 And he asks sincerely, he falls on,

191
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,080
 Christ, good rabbi,

192
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:35,440
 what must I do to inherit eternal life?

193
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,240
 What must I do?

194
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,280
 He's looking to be affirmed.

195
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,840
 Jesus says, "Why do you call me good?"

196
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,240
 Jesus answered, "No one is good except God alone."

197
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,240
 Some of the cults would use this passage to say,

198
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,960
 see there, Jesus rejected this idea that he was God,

199
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,800
 but he didn't.

200
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,600
 We can see through the bigger breadth of the scriptures.

201
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,200
 Jesus is challenging this man's idea.

202
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,920
 It is very clear in the scriptures that Jesus is God.

203
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,120
 He received worship.

204
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,360
 He says, "I and the Father are one.

205
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,080
 "You, whoever has seen me, has seen the Father."

206
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,040
 But here, he's challenging this man's idea of good

207
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,160
 'cause this man says that humans,

208
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,800
 believing Jesus is human, can be perfectly good.

209
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,320
 And so he says, "Hey, you're good.

210
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,640
 "What must I do to be good

211
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,000
 "and enter into the kingdom of heaven?"

212
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,960
 And Jesus says, "Why do you call me good?

213
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,800
 "No one's good except God alone.

214
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,720
 "You know the commandments.

215
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,740
 "You shall not murder.

216
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,940
 "You shall not commit adultery.

217
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,000
 "You shall not steal.

218
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,620
 "You shall not give false testimony.

219
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:34,260
 "You shall not defraud.

220
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,760
 "Honor your father and mother."

221
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,960
 And so Jesus gives the second table of the 10 commandments,

222
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,780
 which are that section of the 10 commandments

223
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,400
 which are most easily measured.

224
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:47,800
 You can measure your performance in these commands from God.

225
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,960
 And the guy cuts him off.

226
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,540
 Says, "Teacher, rabbi," he declared,

227
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,840
 "all these things I've kept since I was a boy."

228
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,680
 He's looking to be a father.

229
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,540
 "Hey, I got good news.

230
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:56,900
 "I've done those things.

231
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,540
 "I've done those things."

232
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,720
 Ladies, as a side note,

233
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:06,400
 if there's a guy here, he's got a Bible,

234
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:11,360
 and he goes to church, and he's memorized some scriptures,

235
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,880
 it doesn't mean he knows Jesus.

236
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,360
 Hey, guys, as a side note,

237
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,280
 there's a lady here.

238
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,120
 She's got a Bible.

239
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,680
 She goes to church, even serves there in the nursery,

240
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,840
 memorized some passage.

241
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:29,960
 It does not mean she knows Jesus.

242
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,480
 This guy, this guy was a great rule follower.

243
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,560
 He was killing it.

244
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,620
 The Pharisees would have said,

245
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:37,000
 "Man, this guy, he needs to go start a church."

246
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,200
 Jesus says, "He doesn't know me."

247
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,560
 And so my first point this evening

248
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,460
 is performance is not your passport.

249
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:48,680
 Your performance is not your passport to this adventure.

250
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,520
 This guy wants the adventure of eternal life,

251
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,280
 and he's hoping he's good enough for it,

252
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,120
 and he comes up, and he says,

253
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,140
 "Hey, you're good.

254
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,060
 "I wanna be good.

255
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,680
 "Who's good enough to get into heaven?"

256
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,080
 But the scriptures say this really key fact,

257
00:10:59,080 --> 00:10:59,960
 and you've gotta hear this.

258
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,080
 In fact, write this part down.

259
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,980
 No one's good enough to get into heaven.

260
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:07,600
 No one is good enough to get into heaven.

261
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,440
 Now, some of you are just like,

262
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,280
 "What, that's harrowing.

263
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,120
 "What are you talking about?"

264
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,200
 Ephesians 2, eight, nine says

265
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,620
 no one gets into heaven by what they do.

266
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,480
 In fact, in Isaiah, God says,

267
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,480
 "Your good works are like filthy rags to me."

268
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,960
 That's Isaiah 64, six.

269
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,720
 No one is good enough to get into heaven.

270
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,840
 The scripture said there is no one good, not even one.

271
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,600
 And this man says, "What must I do?"

272
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,320
 And then he says, "I've done these things."

273
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,800
 He's looking to himself, and this is why this is important.

274
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:42,160
 Every single week, almost without fail,

275
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,040
 I come up here and I meet with many of you.

276
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,640
 I love my Dallas and Fort Worth young adults.

277
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:53,660
 And I ask you, how certain are you that you go to heaven?

278
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,200
 And you give me an answer, and then I say,

279
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,840
 if God says, "Why should I let you in?

280
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,720
 "What would you say?"

281
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,600
 And every single week, without fail,

282
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,560
 someone answers that question.

283
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,320
 If God says, "Why should I let you into heaven?

284
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,560
 "What would you say?"

285
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,860
 And they say, "Well, because I."

286
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:15,160
 "Well, because I try hard.

287
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,480
 "And because I've done good things.

288
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,320
 "Because I go to church.

289
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,320
 "Because my parents are Christians.

290
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,640
 "Because I, because my."

291
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,520
 No, no, no, no, no.

292
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,880
 No one gets into heaven because I, because my.

293
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,900
 The only people who'll get into heaven,

294
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:35,900
 because Jesus died for my sins.

295
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:39,040
 Not 90% of my sins.

296
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,920
 Not 99% of my sins.

297
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,400
 100% of my sins, past, present, and future,

298
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,000
 he died for, and I trusted in that.

299
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,640
 His death and resurrection for the forgiveness of sins.

300
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:54,120
 And so because of what God has done, I will go.

301
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,500
 If I point to my resume, I've missed it.

302
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,760
 If I point to God's resume, I've got it.

303
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,800
 I'm not missing out.

304
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,320
 And so you might be here, and you might be like,

305
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,280
 "Oh, that's cool.

306
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,000
 "This guy's clearly trying to follow the rules."

307
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,820
 You may be here and be like,

308
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,740
 "Well, I'm not trying to follow the rules.

309
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,000
 "In fact, I'm living an adventure, JP.

310
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,840
 "In fact, I got some money.

311
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,740
 "I got a six-figure job, right?

312
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:16,000
 "And that trip Garrett and Phil

313
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,820
 "and Austin and Brian went on, easy, man.

314
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,640
 "I'll book it next week, no big deal.

315
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,120
 "Get on Travelzoo, make it happen."

316
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,540
 You're gonna be like, "Man, I got resources.

317
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,740
 "You're telling me I need to go on an adventure?

318
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:26,780
 "I'll make a habit, go on an adventure.

319
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:27,760
 "What, Bali, Indonesia?

320
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,500
 "Where, let's go, man, Fiji, Bora Bora, let's go."

321
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:36,200
 And you're still missing out on the adventure.

322
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,280
 It's not that the adventure's not the trip.

323
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,640
 That's not the adventure.

324
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,060
 The adventure's not the trip itself.

325
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,740
 In fact, you know that Garrett and those guys,

326
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,320
 when they were in the airport,

327
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,460
 they bumped into some guys

328
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:50,060
 that were on the almost exact same trip as them.

329
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:53,240
 And so they were talking, they had a great time catching up.

330
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,400
 And it was clear that these guys

331
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,400
 didn't have the Holy Spirit.

332
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,720
 In fact, they were like, "Man, when we go to Bangkok,

333
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,320
 "with a little bit of money, you can get anything."

334
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,000
 And as Garrett told me that,

335
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,760
 I responded in the same way that they did in that airport,

336
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,600
 as they shared Christ with these young men.

337
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,440
 Grieved.

338
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:17,480
 'Cause we know, man, that's not a passport.

339
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,480
 That's a prison.

340
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:24,200
 That's you being slave to something.

341
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,240
 There's real consequences to that,

342
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,280
 that I don't want for you, that God doesn't want for you.

343
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:33,920
 That may be temporary enjoyment for a moment,

344
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:39,240
 followed by a lifetime of covering up that temporary,

345
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,340
 trying to forget that temporary enjoyment.

346
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,680
 Right?

347
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:49,480
 So you won't get to heaven by keeping the rules.

348
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,340
 And you won't experience heaven here on earth

349
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,280
 by breaking them.

350
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,280
 It's just a temporary satisfaction

351
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:00,680
 that ends in a not satisfaction at all.

352
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,360
 It actually leads to slavery.

353
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,540
 Your performance is not your passport.

354
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,240
 What you do is not your passport.

355
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:11,640
 We were planning a summer vacation a few years ago,

356
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,080
 just before Weston was born,

357
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,220
 and so we had Presley and Finley.

358
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:16,840
 And they had never really traveled,

359
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,760
 they had never been on an airplane.

360
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,360
 And so we were thinking about where we would go,

361
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,400
 and we found this deal to this all-inclusive resort

362
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:27,720
 that we had been to before on our honeymoon.

363
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,780
 And this was kind of a sister company,

364
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:32,760
 and it had all of these things that you can do for kids,

365
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,960
 and splash pads, and everything.

366
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,680
 And so we're really excited, it was in Mexico,

367
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,960
 all-inclusive resort in Mexico,

368
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,800
 really excited to take the girls there.

369
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,440
 And so about six months out, we booked a travel.

370
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,760
 And I'm telling Presley and Finley

371
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,040
 kind of every night about this trip, man.

372
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,040
 And you're just like,

373
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,780
 they don't have a category for Mexico.

374
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:50,460
 In fact, Mexico to them was like heaven.

375
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:52,320
 It's just like this place, you can't imagine,

376
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,560
 it's so incredible.

377
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,520
 I would tell them, and they're like,

378
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,360
 daddy, and so they would ask me,

379
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,640
 and they'd be like, daddy, tell us about Mexico.

380
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,760
 And I'm like, all right.

381
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,580
 Well, what do you wanna know?

382
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:04,040
 And they'd be like, daddy, is there a swimming pool there?

383
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,320
 And I'm like, oh, girls, come on,

384
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,680
 is there a swimming pool there?

385
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:10,000
 Listen, you're going to see the largest swimming pool

386
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,040
 in the entire world, the biggest swimming pool

387
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,640
 that you could possibly imagine

388
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,920
 is going to be there in Mexico.

389
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,060
 Where is it gonna be, like we drive there?

390
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,560
 No, it's gonna be right outside your room.

391
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,680
 Our room, what do you mean?

392
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,480
 Like, we're gonna have a balcony, oh,

393
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,360
 and you can sit, hang over the swimming pool,

394
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,400
 and there's the swimming pool.

395
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,160
 And you know what's just past the swimming pool?

396
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,080
 Is the ocean, do y'all know what the ocean is?

397
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,560
 And they're like, no, tell us about it.

398
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,640
 And I'm like, you know, they're like, daddy,

399
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,880
 is there fish in the ocean?

400
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,500
 I'm like, is there fish in the ocean?

401
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,160
 Girls, listen, you know what we're gonna do?

402
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,240
 Do you know what we're gonna do?

403
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,320
 I said, first of all, right in front of the ocean

404
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:43,160
 is the biggest sandbox you could ever imagine.

405
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:46,120
 And we're gonna build sandcastles.

406
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,040
 Sandcastles so big we could sleep in 'em.

407
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,720
 And then, you know what we're gonna do?

408
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,880
 Now, I'm blowing their mind with this.

409
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:57,480
 We're gonna swim with dolphins.

410
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,280
 And they're like, what do you mean?

411
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,040
 (audience laughing)

412
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,960
 And I'm like, well, there's dolphins,

413
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,800
 and we're gonna swim with 'em.

414
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,240
 And you're like, we get to touch 'em?

415
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,080
 No, we get to touch 'em.

416
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,680
 You're gonna hold on to their fin

417
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,360
 as they pull you through the water,

418
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:13,200
 and they're like, (imitates explosion)

419
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,200
 What?

420
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,600
 Like, we're on an elevator, right,

421
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,120
 and Presley's just grinning ear to ear,

422
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,440
 and this guy's like, oh, you,

423
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,880
 this strange man's like, oh, you're really happy, huh?

424
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,480
 She's like, I'm going to Mexico.

425
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,440
 (audience laughing)

426
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,640
 And so the day comes.

427
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,200
 The day comes, we wake up early that morning.

428
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,640
 Early that morning, we're packed.

429
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,120
 The four of us are packed, you know?

430
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,440
 And so we wake up early before the sun comes up,

431
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,080
 and we drive to DFW Airport,

432
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,040
 and we park at Remote North Parking,

433
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,760
 and I get all of our bags.

434
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,240
 You know, Monica and I are carrying their bags.

435
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,040
 We get all their bags, and we go and wait for the shuttle,

436
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,640
 and the shuttle comes, and they get on the shuttle.

437
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,760
 And this is all very adventurous for them.

438
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,920
 This is all very fun.

439
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,760
 We get on the shuttle.

440
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,720
 It takes us to the terminal.

441
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,560
 We get off the terminal.

442
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,240
 We take the long escalator up with all of our bags,

443
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,960
 you know, to the desk, and we're checking in,

444
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,720
 and Monica checks in and gets her ticket.

445
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,000
 Presley checks in and gets her ticket,

446
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,080
 and I get up there, and she goes, oh, I'm sorry, sir.

447
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,800
 We can't take your passport.

448
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:07,240
 I'm like, (laughing)

449
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,720
 let's, you know, what, yeah, no, what do you mean?

450
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,880
 She's like, I'm sorry, sir,

451
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,200
 but, you know, your passport has clearly been washed

452
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,160
 or something, it's wrinkled.

453
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,200
 I was like, we can't accept it.

454
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,200
 I'm like, oh, yeah, yeah, I promise you can.

455
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,560
 You can, look, what, do you need an ID?

456
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,400
 What, do you need a credit card?

457
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,480
 Here's $100, you can take it, you know.

458
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,960
 What are you talking about?

459
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,960
 And she's like, no, sir, they won't let you in the country.

460
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,880
 And so you can't go.

461
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:34,280
 Well, what are you, no, no, I need to talk to your manager.

462
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,160
 I mean, there's gonna be dolphins there

463
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:40,060
 and big sandbox and swimming pool.

464
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:41,320
 Like, we gotta go to Mexico.

465
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,560
 You don't understand, I've been, six months,

466
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,400
 I've been telling 'em.

467
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,040
 I'm like, hey, you gotta tell 'em.

468
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,660
 I can't tell 'em, you tell 'em.

469
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,200
 I can't break this news to 'em.

470
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,800
 What do you mean I can't go?

471
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,160
 She's like, sir, I'm sorry, you can't go.

472
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:56,160
 And nothing I could say would change that.

473
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,800
 I didn't have what I needed for the adventure.

474
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:04,220
 And that's what I don't want for you.

475
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:08,520
 That's what's gotta change.

476
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:11,240
 That's what I'm begging the Spirit of God

477
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,580
 to change in the next few minutes.

478
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:15,880
 So we hang out together for just a few more minutes

479
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,760
 but the Spirit of God will come into your heart

480
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,480
 and give you what you need for the adventure

481
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,100
 and you would realize it's not your performance.

482
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:27,940
 But what he's done, 2015 years ago,

483
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,860
 God becoming a man, living a perfect life

484
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:31,760
 and dying a perfect death on your behalf

485
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,880
 so that you could live the adventure with him starting now.

486
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:41,320
 And so this guy says, all these things I've done,

487
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,720
 what's Jesus gonna say?

488
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,640
 What's he gonna say to me?

489
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,160
 Oh man, look at this guy, Mr. Self-righteous,

490
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,320
 he's done all these things.

491
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,800
 Oh, you've done, oh man, you've done all these things, huh?

492
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,720
 Does Jesus punk him?

493
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,080
 He's like, oh, who do you think you,

494
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,760
 oh, you think you're good, huh?

495
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,000
 Oh, you think you're so good.

496
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,400
 No, listen, sometimes I hear Jesus like that.

497
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,760
 In fact, in the past when I've read this passage,

498
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,520
 in Mark's account though, verse 21 is really key.

499
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,720
 Jesus looked at him and judged him.

500
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,160
 Nope, it's not what it says.

501
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:14,060
 Jesus looked at him and loved him.

502
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:18,420
 He had compassion on this guy.

503
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:22,120
 And he says, man, I want him to get it.

504
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,560
 So he goes after his idols.

505
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,100
 He says, one thing you lack,

506
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:29,560
 go and sell everything you have and give it to the poor

507
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:33,220
 and you will have treasure in heaven, then come follow me.

508
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,700
 And I read that, I'm like, oh, hold on.

509
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,020
 It's like Jesus doesn't even know the answer.

510
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,080
 That's not the right answer.

511
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:37,920
 What's he doing there?

512
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,620
 And he's answering very strategically

513
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:41,460
 'cause he sees this guy's heart

514
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:43,940
 and he goes after his idols.

515
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:47,640
 He says, hey, not to punk him, but to show him his heart,

516
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,660
 to show him his idols because he loves him,

517
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:52,220
 the scripture says.

518
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:54,720
 He says, I wanna show you the idols that you have

519
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,780
 that prevent you from knowing me

520
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:58,100
 and having a relationship with me.

521
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,220
 And so let me ask you a question.

522
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,220
 What are your idols?

523
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:04,460
 What are the idols in your life that come before Christ?

524
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:07,980
 Is it money, is it a relationship, is it a job?

525
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:10,880
 Is it performance?

526
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,020
 Is it anxiety?

527
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:15,660
 Is it stuff, is it status?

528
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,420
 What are your idols before Jesus?

529
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:20,420
 He tells him, go sell everything you have

530
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,700
 and give it to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven.

531
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:25,780
 And it says, at this, the man's face fell,

532
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,760
 literally, he just becomes sad, like,

533
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:31,420
 he knew he couldn't do that.

534
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:34,720
 And he went away sad because it says he had great wealth.

535
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:41,420
 And so Jesus is inviting him on the adventure of a lifetime

536
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:45,420
 and all he needs to start that adventure is, ready, need.

537
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:49,120
 That's what I think this passage is about.

538
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:53,500
 All you need is need, my second point this evening.

539
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:58,500
 All you need for this adventure, for this trip, is need.

540
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,700
 You have to have need.

541
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:04,900
 You have to realize your need for God, that you need him.

542
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:07,540
 To have a savior, you need to know

543
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,860
 that you need to be saved,

544
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:12,820
 that you're in a position where, man, I can't save myself.

545
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:15,820
 There's something outside of me that has to save me.

546
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,340
 That thing is Jesus.

547
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:18,620
 See, Jesus comes to him, he says,

548
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,340
 hey, there's just one thing you lack.

549
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,060
 He says, there's one thing you lack.

550
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:25,260
 Go, sell, give, come, follow.

551
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,180
 Five verbs.

552
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:29,100
 One thing you lack, go, sell, give, come, follow.

553
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,740
 Well, wait a minute, Jesus, that's five things.

554
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:31,700
 What's the one thing he lacks?

555
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,540
 Need.

556
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:36,420
 See, the stuff that you have, your money,

557
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:37,900
 your material possessions,

558
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,820
 those things are preventing you

559
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:43,020
 from having the thing that you need most, which is need.

560
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:45,260
 You have surrounded your life with comfort,

561
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:47,100
 and therefore, that comfort has prevented you

562
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,740
 from being in a place where you need need.

563
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,220
 I had a conversation recently with someone,

564
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:53,180
 they were just like, I don't enjoy God.

565
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:55,260
 I was like, well, that's because

566
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,700
 you don't think you need him.

567
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:01,900
 If you believe that he's the solution to your need,

568
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:04,460
 if he's the only thing that's gonna meet that need,

569
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:07,060
 you'll begin to enjoy him.

570
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,900
 See, this man's wealth was a deterrent

571
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,540
 to what he needed most.

572
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:15,780
 Because while his wealth brought comfort,

573
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,180
 what he needed was need.

574
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:21,940
 And Jesus is testing his need and attacking his idols,

575
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:25,100
 or testing his need by attacking his idols.

576
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,300
 Let me explain to you what I'm saying,

577
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,900
 just in case I'm losing you, okay?

578
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,460
 In all three accounts of the Gospels,

579
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:32,620
 Matthew, Mark, and Luke, where this story falls,

580
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,260
 it's right after another story.

581
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,980
 It's right after a story where Jesus says,

582
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:40,180
 let me tell you who gets into the kingdom of heaven.

583
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:43,380
 He answers this guy's question right before the story

584
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,500
 in all three Gospels.

585
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,180
 You know who gets into the kingdom of heaven?

586
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:49,380
 He says, anyone who comes to me like a child.

587
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:51,220
 Why is that in there?

588
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:52,500
 It's like God is shouting something at us.

589
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,140
 Why does he want us to hear that?

590
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:55,500
 It's kind of an obscure verse, right?

591
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,660
 Mark 10, verse 15.

592
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:59,300
 Truly I tell you, anyone who will not receive

593
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,780
 the kingdom of God like a little child

594
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,020
 will never enter it.

595
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:06,780
 Do you guys know anything about kids?

596
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:09,460
 I've had three.

597
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:10,300
 I mean, not personally,

598
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:12,420
 but I participated in someone having three.

599
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:17,780
 And we have a little son now, he's two and a half years old.

600
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:19,420
 And he is, let me just describe him to you.

601
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:22,180
 He is need surrounded by noise.

602
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:23,060
 That's who he is.

603
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:28,940
 Like he contributes to Team Pecluta, zero.

604
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:32,740
 He's never mowed the lawn.

605
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,700
 He's never cleaned the house.

606
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,860
 I mean, the other day,

607
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:40,660
 I thought he was gonna make himself breakfast

608
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:43,220
 and he poured the Cheerios all over the living room.

609
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,180
 I mean, that's what he does.

610
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:46,900
 He's need surrounded by noise.

611
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:49,660
 He's never paid for anything.

612
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:52,340
 He's never been like, daddy, I just wanna repay you

613
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,940
 for the way that you take care of me.

614
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,940
 And so dinner's on me tonight.

615
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,500
 I got it.

616
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,540
 He doesn't have a job.

617
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,700
 He doesn't financially contribute.

618
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:03,500
 He is need surrounded by noise.

619
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:07,180
 And Jesus says to you, you wanna know who gets me?

620
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:11,700
 People who come to me with dependence.

621
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,540
 People who need.

622
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:15,140
 See, some of you, what's gonna keep you

623
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:17,840
 out of the kingdom of heaven, which is no trite thing.

624
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,460
 I'm just very emotional as I was writing this message

625
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,460
 thinking about that.

626
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:26,660
 It's the fact you don't need God.

627
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:27,500
 You got you.

628
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:30,620
 You got stuff.

629
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:32,100
 I mean, you got a good job.

630
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,460
 You're gifted.

631
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:34,780
 Pretty.

632
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:36,140
 You don't need God.

633
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:36,980
 What do you need God for?

634
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:37,820
 You got Dallas.

635
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:38,640
 You got Fort Worth.

636
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,820
 Why do you need God?

637
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:44,460
 And that's what's gonna keep you out.

638
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,860
 I mean, this guy was in church every Sunday, man.

639
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:49,260
 That's who this guy is.

640
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:53,660
 But he didn't have need.

641
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:59,860
 Jesus said, I want you to come to me like one of these.

642
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:04,700
 This joker in Mark 10, Luke 18, Matthew 19,

643
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:07,740
 he doesn't even have a name.

644
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:10,500
 He's just an example of what not to do.

645
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:13,020
 And Jesus comes to him with a real invitation,

646
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:15,220
 a very rare invitation, okay,

647
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:17,620
 that we don't see a lot in the scripture, right?

648
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:19,860
 We see it with the disciples, the apostles.

649
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,020
 Jesus comes to Matthew, says,

650
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:23,660
 hey, leave your tax collector booth and follow me.

651
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:24,660
 He says to some other guys,

652
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:26,820
 hey, throw down your nets and follow me.

653
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,460
 And then he comes to this rich young ruler.

654
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,260
 He says, hey, I want you to sell everything you have,

655
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:33,180
 give it to the poor, then come and follow me.

656
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:36,900
 This guy could have been the 13th disciple, right?

657
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,660
 I mean, these are guys we name our kids after.

658
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,860
 These are arguably some of the most famous people

659
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,940
 in the history of history.

660
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,860
 Matthew, Mark, Luke, John.

661
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:47,300
 These are people whose books,

662
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:50,780
 their writings we teach from, we gather around

663
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:53,580
 and say, hey, will you just teach me what Matthew wrote?

664
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:57,060
 Let me name my friend Matthew.

665
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:59,140
 Now here's, I don't know, Bob,

666
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:00,820
 and we don't even know his name, right?

667
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,140
 'Cause all we know is his resume.

668
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:04,660
 We know he's rich, we know he's young,

669
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:07,380
 we know he's powerful, that's all we know.

670
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:09,880
 And we know he's the guy that didn't follow Jesus.

671
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:13,140
 Do you think he missed out on an adventure?

672
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:16,980
 Yeah, I think he missed out on an adventure.

673
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:17,820
 Why?

674
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:20,140
 Because it says he had great wealth.

675
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:23,820
 I love what Randy Alcorn said here this weekend

676
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:24,860
 as he visited, he said,

677
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:28,580
 things have mass and mass has gravity.

678
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:31,800
 Don't let things be the center of gravity for you.

679
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,020
 Said in another way, he says,

680
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:38,820
 don't let things that you can't let go of hold you back.

681
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:41,440
 Don't let anything in your life that you can't let go of

682
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,280
 hold you back.

683
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,100
 Is that a relationship?

684
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,460
 I don't know what that is for you,

685
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:46,980
 but is there any debate right now in your mind

686
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:49,540
 that we are the rich young rulers?

687
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,460
 Like, are you there, you're like,

688
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,300
 well, hey, I don't have any,

689
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,500
 I'm lost on this 'cause I'm not rich.

690
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,060
 Let me tell you something, you are unbelievably rich

691
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:56,020
 just because of where you are.

692
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:59,140
 Minimum wage in America, if you make minimum wage,

693
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:02,820
 you are in the top 10% richest people on the planet.

694
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:05,420
 The average wage is around $2 a day.

695
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:07,900
 In Indonesia, it's 39 cents an hour.

696
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:10,740
 Okay?

697
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:15,100
 If you make $50,000, you are deep within the top 1%

698
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,940
 of the wealthiest people on the planet.

699
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:17,780
 If you're wondering where I get this,

700
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:20,060
 it comes from globalrichlist.com.

701
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:23,820
 I had a friend who went to Russia for 10 years.

702
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:26,180
 He came back and we said, we asked him as a staff,

703
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,740
 as we kind of interviewed him and asked him questions,

704
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:29,340
 we said, hey, what was different?

705
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,440
 What changed about Dallas-Fort Worth?

706
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,460
 And he said, you want me to, you know,

707
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:34,460
 I have an answer to that.

708
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:35,800
 It's kind of a strange one.

709
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,640
 We said, what?

710
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,260
 He said, storage buildings.

711
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:40,580
 They're everywhere.

712
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:44,340
 He's like, you guys have built huge buildings

713
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:46,740
 to store your stuff because you have so much stuff,

714
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:48,900
 you can't even keep it on your own property.

715
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:51,600
 You had to get another property to keep your stuff on.

716
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:57,100
 You know the greatest health problem in America?

717
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,180
 Like you go somewhere else and it's like,

718
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:00,580
 well, clean water, right?

719
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:02,540
 Food to eat.

720
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,220
 In America, it's obesity.

721
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:08,880
 Like we're the first country in the history of the world,

722
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:13,380
 right, that our primary health problem is obesity.

723
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:15,740
 Like you look at any time in the past and it's like,

724
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:16,820
 what's their primary health problem?

725
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:18,020
 They're starving to death.

726
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:20,660
 Us, we've got so much food, we don't know where to keep it.

727
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,780
 We keep it on us.

728
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:25,620
 (congregation laughing)

729
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:27,860
 Just think about it for a moment.

730
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:28,780
 It'll blow your mind too.

731
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:29,620
 I mean, it's great.

732
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:31,300
 This is us, right?

733
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,700
 Because of where you live,

734
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,660
 you are among the wealthiest people on the planet.

735
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:35,660
 You're like, dude, I don't even have a job.

736
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:36,540
 You know what, I didn't have a job once.

737
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:37,780
 I was laid off.

738
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:39,220
 You know what I did?

739
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,820
 Because I woke up in America,

740
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:44,060
 I got up early that morning and I began to knock on doors

741
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:47,020
 and I said, you know what, I'm gonna make $100 today.

742
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:48,620
 And the first door I knocked on, I said,

743
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,540
 hey, can I rake your leaves?

744
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:50,380
 They said, sure.

745
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,420
 I said, what will you pay me?

746
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:52,380
 80 bucks.

747
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:53,580
 Awesome, you got it.

748
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:58,220
 Because of where I live, that opportunity is afforded to me.

749
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:59,060
 Why do I tell you that?

750
00:29:59,060 --> 00:29:59,900
 Here's why.

751
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:02,600
 Because opportunities like that combat need.

752
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:08,560
 It's really, really hard to be needy when you have a lot.

753
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:11,300
 Like, do you realize that our brothers and sisters

754
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:14,140
 of the faith, 21 brothers and sisters of the faith

755
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:16,680
 lost their head a few days ago.

756
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:20,780
 They were beheaded like Paul.

757
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:25,820
 Like John the Baptist, their heads were cut off.

758
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:27,500
 And you know, if ISIS was here,

759
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,360
 my greatest fear would not be

760
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,620
 that they would take our heads off.

761
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:33,020
 It would be that they would have no reason to.

762
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:38,340
 Amen, hey, I got a Christian over here.

763
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:39,660
 You sure, you sure that's a Christian?

764
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:41,540
 No, he's not a Christian.

765
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:44,140
 I saw him on Lord Greenwood, that's not a Christian.

766
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:45,340
 No, leave their head on.

767
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:48,380
 No, I saw him with that girl the other day.

768
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,740
 I think he's clean, man.

769
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:50,580
 Let him go.

770
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:52,700
 He's one of us.

771
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:55,900
 I got a Christian over here.

772
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,740
 No, she's not, no, she's not.

773
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:59,940
 I've been watching her, she's not a Christian.

774
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:00,860
 She had no Christ.

775
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:03,400
 Let her go, keep her head on.

776
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:06,240
 Man, are you serious?

777
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,780
 The world we live in.

778
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:12,220
 I wanna be clear, I just wanna say it one more time

779
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:14,660
 in case you think I'm coming with workspace stuff.

780
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:17,620
 All you need is need.

781
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:20,380
 You gotta need him.

782
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:21,960
 You gotta need him.

783
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:30,900
 Money, money may not be your idol,

784
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:33,180
 but it funds them.

785
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:37,140
 You wanna know what your idol is?

786
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:39,600
 You look at your time and your money.

787
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,660
 Look at your calendar and your checkbook.

788
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:46,300
 Okay, let me just ask you a question.

789
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:48,980
 Let's just say you could break into this story

790
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:49,820
 right here, man.

791
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:53,100
 Let's say you could talk to this rich young ruler.

792
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:57,180
 Like Jesus is like, hey, go and sell everything you have.

793
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:58,420
 Give it to the poor and then come follow me.

794
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:00,060
 And he's like, he leaves sad.

795
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:01,100
 You could step in right there.

796
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:01,940
 You could talk to him.

797
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:02,760
 What do you say?

798
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:03,600
 No, no, no, no, no, no.

799
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,420
 Hey, buddy, listen, listen, listen.

800
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:05,540
 You don't understand, man.

801
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:06,900
 That is Jesus.

802
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,940
 That is God in the flesh.

803
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,360
 All that stuff you don't wanna sell,

804
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,100
 it's actually his stuff.

805
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,260
 No, he owns everything.

806
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:15,620
 The cattle on a thousand hills are his.

807
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:17,220
 You want to follow him.

808
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:18,380
 You're talking about eternal life.

809
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:20,740
 Eternal life is found in him alone.

810
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:21,580
 You wanna go with him.

811
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:22,540
 Listen, listen, trust me, trust me.

812
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:23,380
 Now, there's this book.

813
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:24,220
 It's in the Bible.

814
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:25,420
 It's 66 books.

815
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,260
 But I've read it.

816
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:27,100
 And here's the deal.

817
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,460
 You wanna go.

818
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:29,700
 No, we don't even know your name.

819
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:30,740
 We wanna know your name.

820
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,380
 Go with him.

821
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:33,220
 Go with him.

822
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,260
 What would you tell this guy?

823
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:35,420
 No, go all in.

824
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,220
 No, it all doesn't,

825
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:39,100
 all that stuff you think that matters, it doesn't matter.

826
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,180
 Go all in with him.

827
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:41,020
 Hey, tell yourself that.

828
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:42,840
 Remember that question I asked you on the front end?

829
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,980
 What's keeping you from going all in?

830
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:49,260
 You tell your heart, you speak to your heart right now,

831
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,940
 whatever you would tell this guy.

832
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:53,420
 No, no, no, no, listen, that relationship,

833
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:54,700
 no, no, no, it doesn't matter.

834
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,740
 Pornography, get rid of the computer.

835
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:59,620
 Anything that's holding you back and go all in.

836
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:02,220
 Go all in.

837
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:09,940
 And Jesus looked around and said to his disciples

838
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:12,900
 how hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God.

839
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,780
 It's not about money.

840
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:15,740
 It's about idols.

841
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:18,260
 The disciples were amazed at his words,

842
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:20,380
 but Jesus said again, children,

843
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:22,980
 how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God.

844
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:26,620
 It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle

845
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:30,540
 than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.

846
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:32,820
 He's saying, hey, the kingdom of heaven is impossible

847
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:34,920
 for anyone who doesn't think they need it.

848
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:37,260
 Some of you may have heard that the camel

849
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:39,020
 and eye of the needle is a gate to Jerusalem.

850
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:39,840
 That's stupid.

851
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,860
 There's no historical evidence to support that.

852
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:43,180
 Dismiss it.

853
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:45,540
 It's a camel and a needle.

854
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:46,460
 That's what he's talking about.

855
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:48,340
 He's saying, hey, it's impossible.

856
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:52,080
 The disciples were even more amazed and said to each other,

857
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,380
 who then can be saved?

858
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,660
 Jesus looked at them and said,

859
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:57,700
 listen, with man this is impossible,

860
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:58,660
 but not with God.

861
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:00,580
 All things are possible with God.

862
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,260
 And then Peter spoke up and said, hey, Jesus, listen,

863
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:04,500
 we left everything to follow you.

864
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,340
 Do we get in?

865
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:06,160
 Like, we're getting in, right?

866
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,140
 'Cause we left it all.

867
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:09,620
 And Jesus says, you haven't left anything.

868
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:13,160
 Oh, you think you've been missing out, huh?

869
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:15,740
 Truly I tell you, Jesus replied,

870
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:18,660
 no one who has left home or brothers or sisters

871
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:21,300
 or mother or father or children or field for me

872
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:24,300
 and the gospel will fail to receive 100 times as much

873
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,140
 in this present age.

874
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:27,620
 Homes, brothers, sisters, mothers, children,

875
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:30,500
 and fields along with persecutions.

876
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:33,240
 And in the age to come, eternal life.

877
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:37,180
 But many who are first will be last,

878
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:40,140
 and the last will be first.

879
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:41,600
 And so what does it cost you?

880
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:44,220
 Everything, what do you gain?

881
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:45,940
 So much more.

882
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:49,100
 My third point is all you gain is everything.

883
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:52,040
 On this adventure, all that you gain,

884
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,160
 all you have to gain is everything.

885
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:56,140
 Let me try to make that practical, let me quantify it.

886
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:58,100
 If you think Christ's followers are missing out,

887
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,140
 you've missed the point.

888
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,820
 God is not seeking to take an adventure from you,

889
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:04,220
 he's seeking to give you one.

890
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:06,340
 Jesus says, I've come so that they might have life

891
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:07,180
 and have it to the full.

892
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:08,780
 Now, if you don't understand that,

893
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:10,820
 you probably grew up in some dead church

894
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:13,260
 where you're like, hey, those guys who follow Jesus,

895
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:15,120
 I don't wanna be anything like 'em.

896
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:17,140
 But we'll all kinda put on this dog and pony show

897
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:18,860
 and pretend like we know the one true God,

898
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:20,580
 and we'll pretend like he gives us joy,

899
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:22,480
 but really we're all miserable inside.

900
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,260
 All right?

901
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:25,460
 And that's not Christianity,

902
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:27,180
 and that's not what I'm talking about.

903
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:29,580
 Jesus is calling you to an adventure,

904
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:30,860
 and the adventure starts now.

905
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:31,720
 And what does it start with?

906
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,560
 Listen closely.

907
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,700
 It starts with belief.

908
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,980
 Your actions will follow your belief.

909
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:38,500
 If you believe in God,

910
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,560
 then you know you are not missing out.

911
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,980
 And what you believed here,

912
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:44,540
 not what you did here,

913
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:46,840
 will determine your eternity.

914
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:51,020
 Do you really believe that Jesus is the Son of God,

915
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:53,500
 and that God defeated death through him,

916
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:56,180
 that God has forgiven our sins through him?

917
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:59,900
 Because heaven and hell are both real outcomes

918
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:04,500
 of your belief here on earth.

919
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,700
 You have real eternal outcomes.

920
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:08,700
 You will really be somewhere someday,

921
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,780
 forever and ever and ever and ever.

922
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:15,460
 Your belief here will determine your adventure here

923
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:17,160
 and your reward there.

924
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,000
 Did you hear that?

925
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,620
 Your belief here will determine your adventure here

926
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:21,700
 and your reward there.

927
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,340
 Jesus says 100 times as much.

928
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:24,820
 C.S. Lewis said it like this.

929
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:27,060
 The only thing you will own in heaven

930
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,960
 will be things you gave away here.

931
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,020
 Wow.

932
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:34,020
 The only things you'll possess in heaven

933
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,620
 are the things that you had given away

934
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:37,020
 while you were on earth.

935
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:40,060
 Guys, listen, man.

936
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:43,860
 Imagine how much fun, and I said fun,

937
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:45,420
 this guy could have had.

938
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:48,540
 Jesus, they're talking, hey, here's what I want you to do.

939
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,780
 I want you to go and sell everything you have

940
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:50,780
 and give it to the poor and then follow me.

941
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:51,700
 We believe that.

942
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:52,580
 We hear that and we're like, dude,

943
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:53,980
 why couldn't he have just been like Peter

944
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:55,580
 and throw down your nets?

945
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:56,900
 Or one of the other apostles, rather,

946
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:59,540
 just, hey, throw down your nets and follow me, right?

947
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:02,180
 I mean, he's gotta sell everything.

948
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:03,740
 Like, he's gotta go on eBay and Craigslist.

949
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:04,580
 Okay, here's the deal.

950
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:07,120
 It's all up for sale, state sale, you know.

951
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:10,420
 How much fun would this have been?

952
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:12,820
 This is like my dream day.

953
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:14,940
 Craigslist, eBay, like, okay, here's the deal.

954
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:16,340
 I'm gonna liquidate all of this stuff.

955
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:17,420
 I'm gonna take this money.

956
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:18,260
 Oh, you want some?

957
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:19,100
 Here you go.

958
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:19,920
 Oh, you want some?

959
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:20,760
 Okay, here you go.

960
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,580
 Let me make your day, too.

961
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:22,740
 Oh, you can't afford that car payment?

962
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:23,580
 I just bought your car.

963
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:24,420
 It's your car now.

964
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:25,240
 There you go.

965
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,080
 Oh, you're behind on your house?

966
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:26,980
 No, it's your house.

967
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:28,220
 I just purchased it from the bank.

968
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:29,180
 Take it.

969
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,180
 How much fun would that,

970
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:31,860
 have you guys ever been generous like that?

971
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:34,260
 Like, that is a lot of fun.

972
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:35,900
 It is really, really fun.

973
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:38,020
 And like, 'cause it's all Jesus's.

974
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:39,660
 So he's like, "Hey, Jesus, I sold everything.

975
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:40,500
 "I gave it to the poor."

976
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:41,540
 It's really fun.

977
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:42,380
 Okay, now where are we going?

978
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:43,220
 Let's go, man.

979
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:44,040
 Let's rock.

980
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:44,880
 Where are we going, Bali?

981
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,700
 What?

982
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:46,540
 Where are we going?

983
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:47,380
 Where are we going, Jerusalem?

984
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:48,200
 Okay.

985
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,040
 Across?

986
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:49,880
 Oh, man, that doesn't sound fun.

987
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,140
 (congregation laughing)

988
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:52,700
 So what's next, if you read on?

989
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:56,180
 Jesus isn't asking you anything that he didn't do.

990
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:58,780
 He not give everything?

991
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:01,360
 He gave everything.

992
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,660
 Gave it all.

993
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:05,740
 For you, because he loves you.

994
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:08,220
 The greatest act of the law of the world is ever known.

995
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:12,020
 And instead, this guy returned to keeping the rules

996
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:14,020
 and counting his money.

997
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:14,980
 He was a slave.

998
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:18,260
 He wasn't free, he was a slave.

999
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:20,300
 He was a slave like some of us are slaves.

1000
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:23,820
 See, what you can't give away, you don't own.

1001
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:24,660
 It owns you.

1002
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:26,740
 You're its slave.

1003
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:30,040
 What you cannot give away, you do not own.

1004
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,820
 It owns you.

1005
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,620
 But whatever you give up for Christ, you will gain more.

1006
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:38,620
 I'm not saying that if you give a dollar, you get 100.

1007
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:40,300
 You might gain a correct understanding of money

1008
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:42,580
 and no longer need the dollar.

1009
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:43,560
 You might get 100.

1010
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:46,260
 I don't know how God's going to do that,

1011
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:49,920
 but I see here that whatever you give, you gain more.

1012
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,040
 Not in a prosperity gospel kind of way,

1013
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:54,280
 but you will be blessed.

1014
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:57,260
 I know people who have been blessed.

1015
00:38:57,260 --> 00:39:00,500
 And this adventure that we're talking about,

1016
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,740
 I love what Jim Elliot says.

1017
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:03,820
 He says, "He is no fool who gives what he cannot keep

1018
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:05,420
 "for that which he cannot lose."

1019
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:09,060
 He is no fool who gives that which he cannot keep

1020
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:11,140
 for that which he cannot lose.

1021
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:14,500
 And this adventure that we're talking about,

1022
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:15,340
 it starts right now.

1023
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:16,900
 It's not heaven.

1024
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:19,000
 Heaven's the after party.

1025
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,440
 The adventure, it starts right here in Dallas,

1026
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,340
 right there in Fort Worth.

1027
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:27,300
 Heaven's the after party, man.

1028
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:29,100
 That's where we get to go and celebrate

1029
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:31,500
 the adventure that we had down here.

1030
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:33,700
 Do you guys know what today is?

1031
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,140
 Fat Tuesday, if you didn't know.

1032
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:37,880
 And do you guys know what Fat Tuesday is?

1033
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,180
 A lot of us, it's just like, well,

1034
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:40,380
 it's just a day to get drunk and--

1035
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:41,220
 - Get Mardi Gras.

1036
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:42,420
 - Get these Mardi Gras.

1037
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:43,500
 It is Mardi Gras.

1038
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:46,500
 But do we know even what that is?

1039
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:47,340
 Check this out.

1040
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:48,260
 Why is it called Fat Tuesday?

1041
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,460
 Let me tell you.

1042
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:53,380
 Fat Tuesday, it has religious implications, actually.

1043
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:55,420
 Fat Tuesday is the day before Ash Wednesday.

1044
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:57,020
 Ash Wednesday is the day that starts Lent.

1045
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,500
 Lent is fasting.

1046
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,860
 So what do we do on Fat Tuesday?

1047
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:02,740
 We gorge ourselves on good food

1048
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:04,900
 so that then we can fast through Lent.

1049
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,180
 That's where this comes from.

1050
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:07,620
 And it's turned into debauchery, right?

1051
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:08,900
 We turn it into Lower Greenville, Uptown.

1052
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:11,260
 We're like, hey, we go and we get wasted.

1053
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:16,120
 And we have girls trade their dignity for 50-cent beads.

1054
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,900
 That's what we do on Fat Tuesday.

1055
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:22,540
 But it's interesting.

1056
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:25,740
 This is the origination of this is that we would go,

1057
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:28,820
 and because we're gonna have to give something up for God,

1058
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:31,700
 we go and we are gluttons.

1059
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:36,220
 And I think some of you view Christianity this way.

1060
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:40,180
 Hey, I'm gonna get right with Jesus one day,

1061
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:42,740
 but right now I'm gonna have all the fun that I can

1062
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:45,480
 before I go there, and you're missing out on real fun.

1063
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:49,140
 And before you start to think, oh yeah, sure, Pastor Boyd,

1064
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:50,980
 'cause maybe you're a guest, you don't know.

1065
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:54,680
 You don't know, man.

1066
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:59,020
 Like whatever you think fun is, I've done it on steroids.

1067
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:01,780
 All right, cocaine, yeah, you got it.

1068
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:02,780
 Ecstasy, you got it.

1069
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:04,580
 The bar scene, you got it.

1070
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:07,560
 Club scene was the ruler of it.

1071
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,620
 The rich young ruler.

1072
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:10,600
 Girls, oh yeah.

1073
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:13,200
 The cars, you got it.

1074
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,460
 The bikes, yes, sir.

1075
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:17,900
 Penthouse condo, yes, sir, check.

1076
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:21,060
 And so whatever you think, no, this is where life is.

1077
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:23,460
 I'm telling you from experience.

1078
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:25,260
 As someone who has found the one true God,

1079
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:27,460
 he found me actually, changed my life.

1080
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:28,740
 You're missing out.

1081
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:30,340
 I'm sad for you.

1082
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:34,700
 In fact, this weekend, we just moved,

1083
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:37,140
 and so we have a bunch of boxes in our garage,

1084
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:39,420
 and I was looking for something.

1085
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:40,900
 I was actually looking for a motorcycle helmet

1086
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:42,780
 and a shipwreck coin, but that's an illustration

1087
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:46,880
 for another day, and what I found was a box of pictures,

1088
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,620
 photographs, and so I opened the box,

1089
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:50,960
 and I began to go through them,

1090
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,140
 and a lot of Monica and I, when we were dating,

1091
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:54,220
 it was Valentine's Day, so I was like,

1092
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,540
 you know, this will be fun, we'll go,

1093
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:57,020
 and we'll look at these pictures for Valentine's Day,

1094
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:59,180
 but there was a stack of pictures, and I pulled it out,

1095
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:00,020
 and you know what it was?

1096
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:02,340
 It was Mardi Gras in New Orleans.

1097
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:04,080
 See, I went big.

1098
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:09,260
 And I was looking through them, and I was deeply grieved.

1099
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:13,820
 I saw the look on my face, the glary stare,

1100
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:16,860
 the drunkenness.

1101
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:19,700
 I mean, as I went through it, I mean, it was pornography,

1102
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:23,620
 is what it was, pornography that I participated in.

1103
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:27,540
 And it was the party, and there I am,

1104
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:30,780
 holding a hurricane in one hand,

1105
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:32,660
 arm around a girl in another hand,

1106
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:35,300
 you know, kind of a smile in the camera,

1107
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:39,740
 and what's crazy, man, I remember that trip.

1108
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:42,100
 I mean, I remember some of that trip,

1109
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:43,900
 and I remember going up to the trip.

1110
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:46,380
 I remember how excited we were for that trip.

1111
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:48,820
 I remember after that trip, the stories we told.

1112
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:50,700
 Remember, dude, you threw up, you threw up

1113
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:53,260
 all over your pants, and then you wore them the next day,

1114
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:56,140
 and it was like, that was fun?

1115
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:57,580
 When you wore up the pants with throw up on 'em?

1116
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:58,740
 Like, really?

1117
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:01,900
 That's the story, that's what we walked away from.

1118
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:02,740
 Like, that's our trophy.

1119
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:06,620
 Remember the pants and the throw up, it was so gross, ha ha.

1120
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:08,180
 Man, it sounds gross.

1121
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:10,820
 Isn't that crazy?

1122
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:13,340
 Do you see what the enemy does, how he tricks you?

1123
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:17,660
 Sin robs you of creativity, you're doing the same thing.

1124
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:19,340
 It's like, this is life.

1125
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:24,020
 50 cent beads for my dignity, life.

1126
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:30,820
 And God says, no, man, can I give you life?

1127
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:36,860
 Trusted Christ, and became a Christian,

1128
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:41,220
 and within two years was in the jungles of Africa,

1129
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:44,860
 teaching the government, conflict reconciliation,

1130
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:47,660
 and shortly thereafter was on a boat

1131
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:49,380
 traveling through the Amazon jungle

1132
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:51,740
 for days to get off in the villages and play soccer,

1133
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:54,140
 and give hope to orphans.

1134
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:58,180
 You talk about laughing 'til you cry.

1135
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:01,820
 Shortly thereafter, when the earthquake hit Haiti,

1136
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:04,460
 we went, met with organizations,

1137
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:07,220
 and talked about how we can change a nation.

1138
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:09,900
 All of a sudden, I felt like I was being used by God.

1139
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:14,900
 I felt alive, had lots of fun, and came back to Dallas.

1140
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:21,860
 Last year, we were able to give financially, generously,

1141
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:25,460
 more than I've made in years past.

1142
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:28,860
 And I don't say that to brag.

1143
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:30,720
 And I don't say that because we have a lot of money,

1144
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:34,700
 we don't, except for we're in America, and we all do.

1145
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:35,780
 But we don't have a lot of money.

1146
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:38,060
 I say that because our view of money changed,

1147
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:39,740
 and I realize it's all God's.

1148
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:43,740
 If I would run an account on the times

1149
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:45,300
 that I've laughed the hardest,

1150
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:48,260
 it wasn't on the back, it's not on the back of tailgates

1151
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:52,140
 with Bud Lights in my hand, and I've laughed there.

1152
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:53,460
 But the times I've laughed the hardest

1153
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:56,180
 have been around fire pits with other brothers and sisters,

1154
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:58,460
 reflecting on the goodness of God.

1155
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:03,260
 In fact, top 10 times would be celebrating life

1156
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:05,600
 with other followers of Jesus Christ.

1157
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:09,300
 I've done things, I've got lots of regrets,

1158
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:13,060
 but I found life in Jesus and in following him.

1159
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:15,900
 And I tell you that because I know some of you

1160
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:18,300
 are halfway in, which means you're not in at all.

1161
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:21,780
 And he's calling you, he's looking you in the eyes right now

1162
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:23,260
 and he has a real personal invitation to you,

1163
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:25,380
 and you say, hey, I want you to come and follow me.

1164
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:29,280
 And I'm telling you, both experientially

1165
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,560
 and from the scriptures, from a God who loves you,

1166
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:36,280
 that there's life there, life is found in Jesus alone.

1167
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:40,920
 In summary, your personal effort is not your passport.

1168
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:45,900
 All you need is need, and all you gain is everything.

1169
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:50,160
 Garrett sent me this email.

1170
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,560
 It was 'cause we were dialoguing about his trip.

1171
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:55,740
 And it was real interesting what he said.

1172
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:58,900
 He said, you know the best parts,

1173
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:01,460
 and this will sound cliche, but he says,

1174
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:03,260
 the best parts weren't the surfing,

1175
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:08,860
 weren't the skydiving or the BMXing through the jungle.

1176
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:11,700
 Like, the best parts were sharing the gospel with people.

1177
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:14,600
 Just going through and talking about Jesus.

1178
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:15,540
 And I said, well, what do you mean?

1179
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:16,900
 And so he shot me this email and he said,

1180
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:19,500
 just imagine this, when we were in Bali,

1181
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:21,180
 we really wanted to surf Bali,

1182
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:23,180
 because the surfing there is extraordinary.

1183
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:25,620
 And so we were gonna go and we had a driver,

1184
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:27,020
 we had hired a driver there,

1185
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:29,340
 and he had already taken two guys right before us.

1186
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:32,540
 And so he came back to pick up Brian and I,

1187
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:34,180
 this is Garrett saying this.

1188
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:35,460
 And so I'm leaning forward, I'm listening.

1189
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:38,020
 And he says, JP, imagine this, we're driving down the road,

1190
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:39,780
 the sun is shining, got my flip flops on

1191
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:41,620
 and my swimming trunks and my tank top,

1192
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:43,700
 and there's jungle on both sides.

1193
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:46,100
 And we're driving along a white sandy beach,

1194
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:48,540
 there's crystal blue water where we're about to surf.

1195
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:50,940
 And our driver, we began to talk to him

1196
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:52,420
 and we began to share the gospel to him.

1197
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:53,780
 And he stops, he cuts us off and he says,

1198
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:56,060
 oh man, the two guys before you

1199
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:58,580
 have already told me about your God.

1200
00:46:58,580 --> 00:47:02,460
 But then we continued the conversation for 20 minutes.

1201
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:04,380
 We talked about how Jesus is the only way,

1202
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:05,540
 that there is no other way.

1203
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:07,140
 We talked about how the Bible is different

1204
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:08,660
 from other religious books.

1205
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:10,260
 We talked about how much God loved him,

1206
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:12,340
 that he gave his only son in Jesus Christ,

1207
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:16,340
 that 2015 years ago, in an event that every atheist

1208
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:17,980
 on the face of the planet acknowledges

1209
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:19,220
 by the date they put on their checks,

1210
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:22,180
 God became a man in the form of Jesus Christ.

1211
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:23,660
 And then in the midst of that,

1212
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:25,620
 in the 20 minutes of us talking Jesus with him,

1213
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:27,380
 he took a phone call and Garrett said,

1214
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:29,820
 he was riding shotgun, I turned back to Brian

1215
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:31,340
 and I said, you know what?

1216
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:36,940
 This is better than surfing, better than skydiving,

1217
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:40,520
 better than anything we could experience here.

1218
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:44,080
 To which Brian says, man, you're totally right.

1219
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:47,920
 And Garrett doesn't need to go to Bali

1220
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,120
 to live the adventure.

1221
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:51,120
 I know, because I'm doing life with him,

1222
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:52,760
 that Garrett's living the adventure

1223
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:54,360
 right there in Fort Worth today.

1224
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:57,400
 That those guys are on the adventure,

1225
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:58,720
 they're all in with Jesus.

1226
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,620
 They've lost their life for his sake.

1227
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:03,320
 They hold it loosely, they've leveraged everything

1228
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:05,520
 for the sake of the kingdom, so that one day

1229
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:08,080
 they can enjoy all of those things forever and ever

1230
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:09,120
 and ever and ever.

1231
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:11,600
 And to some of you, that's just impractical.

1232
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:14,400
 And we want to help you make that practical.

1233
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:15,960
 We'd love to meet with you and pray with you

1234
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:18,640
 and talk with you and see you go all in.

1235
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,120
 I've stumbled into a church,

1236
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:21,840
 I sat in the back row hungover,

1237
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:24,500
 when I trusted in Jesus and I saw him devour my life

1238
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:27,720
 and I want the same thing for you if he hasn't.

1239
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:28,920
 Because here's the deal.

1240
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:32,640
 We talked about heaven and hell.

1241
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:33,840
 I wanna tell you about it.

1242
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:36,960
 Do you know that there's no missing out in heaven?

1243
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,440
 Heaven is the fullness of God,

1244
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:39,600
 there's no missing out there.

1245
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,140
 There's no FOMO in heaven.

1246
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:43,480
 There's no FOMO.

1247
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:45,440
 Do you know what hell is?

1248
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,320
 Hell is eternal FOMO.

1249
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:51,220
 Hell is being somewhere with the full realization

1250
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:52,920
 of everything that you could have had

1251
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:55,280
 that was freely available to you,

1252
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:58,360
 that when Jesus said, "Follow me," you said, "No."

1253
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:04,980
 And therefore you experience missing out

1254
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:08,980
 for the rest of the rest of the rest.

1255
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:11,940
 And I'm telling you that in heaven,

1256
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:14,820
 you will not regret anything you gave up

1257
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:16,540
 for the sake of the kingdom there.

1258
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:20,540
 There will not be a single FOMO experience in heaven,

1259
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:23,520
 a single regret experience in the kingdom.

1260
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:26,620
 God said, "Hey, you go all in with me."

1261
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:29,460
 I'm gonna pray now that you would.

1262
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:31,540
 Lord, help us.

1263
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:35,820
 Father, help us to realize that Jesus is better,

1264
00:49:35,820 --> 00:49:39,480
 that whatever we would hold on to here,

1265
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:41,660
 that Christ is better.

1266
00:49:41,660 --> 00:49:45,260
 Better than riches or gold,

1267
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:50,140
 better than pornography or trinkets that we might collect,

1268
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:54,720
 better than watches, better than bags and purses,

1269
00:49:56,120 --> 00:50:00,580
 better than shoes and anything that we might collect

1270
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:04,840
 on this planet, that it would be like sand in your kingdom,

1271
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:05,840
 like asphalt.

1272
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:10,660
 And Father, I pray that you would strip our lives

1273
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:13,040
 of everything that distracts us from you,

1274
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:14,600
 which is such a scary prayer.

1275
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:18,480
 As we sing this song, Lord, I pray that each of my friends

1276
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:21,840
 would plead with you, strip our lives of everything

1277
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:24,640
 that comes between you and us.

1278
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:28,920
 And Father, we praise, we want to declare,

1279
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:30,920
 Jesus is better.

1280
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:31,820
 It is in his name.
