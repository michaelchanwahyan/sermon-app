[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.460]   [MUSIC - "I'M A SLAVE TO THE NIGHT"]
[00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:13.340]   I'm a slave to the night.
[00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:22.280]   Another weekend, I'm just living my life.
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.480]   I tell myself that it's fine.
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.840]   Why do I wake up with this feeling inside?
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.800]   Is it OK?
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.680]   Or is it time to change?
[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.360]   Am I OK?
[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:59.560]   It's raining my virtue for vice.
[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.920]   Like I've been walking around closing my eyes,
[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.760]   it's not going to hurt you.
[00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:07.260]   He lies.
[00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.440]   And it feels so good.
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.080]   It feels no good.
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.960]   And it feels so good.
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.200]   It feels no good.
[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.160]   It's raining my virtue for vice.
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.640]   [MUSIC - "I'M A SLAVE TO THE NIGHT"]
[00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:34.120]   Is it shame that I feel?
[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:42.600]   I think I'm happy, but don't know if it's real.
[00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.560]   And I pretend that it's all chill.
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.520]   But inside, I think I'm too far gone.
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.520]   I think I'm too far.
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.000]   Is it OK?
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   Why do I feel this way?
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Am I OK?
[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.960]   It's raining my virtue for vice.
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.920]   Like I've been walking around closing my eyes,
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.920]   it's not going to hurt you.
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:26.920]   He lies.
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.400]   And it feels so good.
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.880]   It feels no good.
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.880]   And it feels so good.
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:37.880]   It feels no good.
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.360]   And it's taking my life.
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.840]   And it feels so good.
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.320]   It feels no good.
[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.320]   And it feels so good.
[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.320]   It feels no good.
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.800]   It's raining my virtue for vice.
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:03:00.280]   Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:06.760]   It's raining my virtue for vice.
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.760]   Like I've been walking around closing my eyes,
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.760]   it's not going to hurt you.
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:14.760]   He lies.
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:21.240]   And it feels so good.
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:26.720]   Oh, but it feels no good.
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.720]   When I wake up, it feels so good.
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.200]   It feels so good.
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.200]   And it feels so good.
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.680]   It feels no good.
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.160]   And it's taking my life.
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.640]   And it feels so good.
[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.640]   It feels no good.
[00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.640]   Wasting my life.
[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.120]   And it feels so good.
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.640]   It feels no good.
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.040]   It's raining my virtue for vice.
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.520]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:02.000]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   What's up, guys?
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   Man, how about that?
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   That was amazing.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   Thank you, Laura Webb.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.480]   It's like being on American Idol or something in here.
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.680]   Welcome, friends in the room, friends in Fort Worth,
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.560]   friends in Houston, in El Paso, in Tulsa, in Cedar Rapids,
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.400]   Iowa, in South Africa.
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.920]   That's new.
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.480]   Wherever you're listening, we are glad that you're here.
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.080]   I'm going to start us off with a story
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.280]   as we continue this series, Vice and Virtue.
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:44.160]   A few months ago, my wife and I had our five-year anniversary.
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.360]   And-- let me move this.
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.160]   Thank you.
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.360]   And we went to-- we decided we were
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.760]   going to go to New York in the wintertime.
[00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.160]   We were going to go see the tree and see the lighting.
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.000]   Yeah, thank you, man.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.420]   This is such an encouraging crowd.
[00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.000]   I'll keep going.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.440]   And we planned it all out.
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.440]   And we were only going to be there for four days.
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.040]   So we had never really spent time together in New York.
[00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.160]   And as you know, if you've been there,
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.720]   there's more than enough to do for four days' worth.
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.160]   And so if you're going to really max out your experience,
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.400]   you've got to plan things out.
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.760]   You've got to look into things, make reservations.
[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:15.840]   You need to-- especially if you're
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.720]   trying to work on a budget, because everything in New York
[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.040]   is like a billion dollars.
[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.520]   If you're listening from New York, can we work on that?
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.480]   So anyway, so we are looking into coupons.
[00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.800]   And this is where you've got to buy tickets for this show
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:26.520]   if you're going to be here.
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.320]   And if you want to see Hamilton on Broadway,
[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:29.840]   you've got to go to like 18 different websites
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:30.560]   and type things in.
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.480]   Still didn't work.
[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:34.800]   And we just went through all the different planning
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.640]   for that event so that when it came,
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.560]   we would max out those four days that we
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:39.600]   were going to have there.
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.800]   And so we asked friends for kind of their lists of, hey,
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.440]   this is for sure where you need to eat.
[00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.320]   This is for sure where you need to go.
[00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:47.840]   And we just had an amazing time.
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.040]   And we got to see the 9/11 Museum,
[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.560]   got to go to Rockefeller Center, got to go to Central Park,
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:57.000]   do the bikes, got to go experience
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.880]   the joys that is the subway, which we tried
[00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.320]   to minimize our time on that.
[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.160]   We got to just go all throughout the town and have the best
[00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:06.240]   or try to make the most of every single moment
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.280]   that we had on that trip.
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:13.040]   And the reason I start there is because the Bible presents
[00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.960]   this idea that your life and my life
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.240]   is like we're on this trip.
[00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.600]   And it tells us that inside of your life,
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.840]   you only have so many moments where
[00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.800]   you're going to get to use, you're going to get to live,
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.200]   you're going to get to experience.
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:30.280]   And so make sure that you are diligent to maximize
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:33.280]   your purposeful to put to use the moments
[00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:34.560]   that you're going to have.
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.960]   Just like we only had four days or a certain number of hours
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.600]   that you're going to be there, the Bible
[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.440]   presents this idea that you and I only
[00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:43.000]   have a certain number of moments in this life.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.280]   And so we are to be very purposeful as it
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.280]   relates to how we use them.
[00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:50.880]   And the reason why that's relevant to this series of vice
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.320]   and virtue, OK, living with purpose and living on meaning
[00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:54.640]   and making the most of opportunities,
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:55.960]   what's it have to do with advice or virtue,
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:56.920]   is because tonight we're going to look
[00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:59.000]   at a passage of scripture where the apostle Paul
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.840]   in Ephesians chapter 5, if you have a Bible,
[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:01.920]   you can flip open there.
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:06.520]   He says that this is a vice that will keep you
[00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.360]   from living a life of meaning.
[00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.820]   It's really the only one that we've looked at so far where
[00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:12.760]   Paul says, look, hey, as it relates to your life,
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:13.840]   here's how you should live.
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.240]   And as it relates to this particular vice,
[00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:18.640]   the vice of drunkenness, you need
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:21.440]   to be very, very careful that you do not
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:24.280]   allow this vice to take you off course
[00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:28.120]   and to lead you to live a life that is not just reckless.
[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:31.480]   It is a life that's void of meaning.
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:33.840]   And so we're going to be in Ephesians chapter 5.
[00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:35.480]   Ephesians chapter 5, starting in verse 18.
[00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:37.680]   If you have a Bible, you can flip there.
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:41.360]   If not, it will be up on the screen.
[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:42.160]   And we'll dive in.
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.480]   Let me just say this about alcohol in biblical times
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:47.840]   because there's a lot of misinformation out there
[00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:50.520]   and a lot of--
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:52.720]   it's just it was a different time and a different day.
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:55.080]   Alcohol in Paul's day was probably
[00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:56.560]   as prevalent, if not more prevalent,
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:58.880]   than it is even in our day.
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:03.080]   And why I say that is because at that time, really,
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:04.520]   we didn't totally understand or they
[00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:09.120]   didn't totally understand bacteria and the way
[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:11.360]   that you boil water and you get rid of different things
[00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:12.120]   in order to get sick.
[00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:14.040]   So what they knew is, hey, if you drink water,
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:15.280]   you could get sick.
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.320]   It'd be essentially like if you're drinking water
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:18.360]   in a third world country.
[00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:18.840]   Same thing.
[00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:20.440]   They'd be like, man, if you drink water, you can get sick.
[00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:21.840]   Or if you drink wine, you get drunk.
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:23.440]   And I think I'm going to go with the second.
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:25.480]   And so they would just-- it was just a very common thing
[00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:26.800]   where, hey, if I'm going to have to risk it
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:28.560]   and roll the dice here, I'd rather risk it
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:30.800]   with the second than with the first.
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:33.840]   And so Paul writes to a culture that much like ours,
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:39.000]   celebrated, embraced, and had wine or had alcohol
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.760]   in a very prevalent way.
[00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:42.720]   And he says, as Christians in this life,
[00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:44.720]   here's how you and I are to relate to alcohol.
[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.760]   So we're going to dive right in as we just
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:48.600]   explore what it looks like to interact
[00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:51.400]   with this vice of drunkenness.
[00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:55.360]   In this series, we've been covering biblical virtues
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:59.280]   and the corresponding cultural vices
[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:00.280]   that exist in our world.
[00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:05.800]   So we'll pick it up in verse 15 of chapter 5.
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:11.280]   "Be very careful, then, how you live, not as unwise,
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:16.080]   but as wise, making the most of every opportunity,
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:18.000]   because the days are evil.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.480]   Therefore, do not be foolish."
[00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:21.840]   Or the same Greek word is the word stupid.
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.440]   So don't be stupid, but understand
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:25.400]   what the Lord's will is.
[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:26.880]   So Paul says, look, hey, as it relates
[00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:27.920]   to how you're going to live your life--
[00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:29.320]   everybody listen up really here.
[00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:31.600]   The Greek word in be careful is emphatic.
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.760]   It's saying, hey, I want everyone's attention right
[00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:36.080]   here as it relates to how you're going to live your life,
[00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:37.840]   how you're going to spend your time, he would say to you
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:41.120]   and say to me, you need to be very, very careful that you
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:42.960]   don't allow just the current of culture--
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:44.280]   that's the days of evil--
[00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:45.480]   to sweep you away.
[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:47.520]   And you don't allow other people in your life
[00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:50.560]   or the culture around you or the family you were raised in,
[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:52.640]   you don't allow those things to dictate how you're
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:53.720]   going to use your life.
[00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:58.200]   Don't be stupid, he says, but know what God's will is,
[00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:01.160]   or know what God wants you to do inside of your life,
[00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:02.520]   and then do that.
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:04.040]   Know what God wants you to do in that job,
[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:05.520]   know what he wants you to do in that relationship,
[00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:07.240]   know what he wants you to do at any given moment.
[00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:09.320]   Be someone who's attentive and listening and careful that,
[00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:11.840]   hey, in this moment right now, I want to be careful to do
[00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:13.920]   what God would have me do, what would he have me do,
[00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:14.760]   and then I want to do it.
[00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:17.000]   That's what Paul says, do that.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.320]   Making the most of every opportunity, living for eternity.
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:23.160]   And then he takes a left turn that almost feels like,
[00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.560]   what, and he says this.
[00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:29.600]   Do not get drunk on wine, which leads to debauchery,
[00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:33.480]   which on the face, or on the surface, you're like,
[00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:36.360]   take it easy, Paul, feels like a little personal, buddy.
[00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:37.720]   I mean, it's just a couple, a couple,
[00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:39.840]   I mean, just a little tipsy, it was a couple drinks,
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.640]   that's my business, why don't you keep your own business,
[00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:46.640]   Paul, and yet there's a reason why he connects these ideas.
[00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:50.720]   It's very intentional that he brings up what he does next.
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:52.280]   So I just want to camp out on the first topic that we're
[00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:55.040]   going to talk about in these three ideas tonight,
[00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:57.160]   is living underneath the influence.
[00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:59.600]   Living underneath the influence, because I think what
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:01.560]   Paul does here is pretty brilliant,
[00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:03.400]   and it's very, very purposeful.
[00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:05.140]   There's a couple things that he tells us inside of this,
[00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:08.560]   where he says, man, live for eternity, live purposefully,
[00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:12.940]   cut back on the alcohol, and don't consume so much,
[00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:15.560]   because it's going to lead you somewhere very specific.
[00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:17.120]   And he tells us, it will lead you
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:19.960]   in the direction of debauchery.
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:22.360]   I think where we're immediately going to have a challenge
[00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:24.960]   is when Paul says, hey, don't get drunk on wine,
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:27.960]   I think that all of us would be like, dude, look, Paul,
[00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:30.920]   I'm not drunk, okay, it was a little buzzed,
[00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:34.520]   and it was my birthday, okay, so I deserved it.
[00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:36.840]   And all of us would just be like, it's not,
[00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:39.100]   I never get drunk, like drunk is the guy who's like,
[00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:41.720]   passed out and his friends had to carry him home,
[00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:43.680]   or he just ended up sleeping at the bar, wasn't drunk,
[00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:45.240]   and so what do you even mean by drunk?
[00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:46.560]   What does Paul mean by drunk?
[00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:48.080]   What does it mean to get drunk?
[00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:51.160]   Is it two drinks, three drinks, four?
[00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:54.400]   What is, is it what the T-A-B-C says is drunk?
[00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:57.280]   Is that what Paul had in mind when he wrote this?
[00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:01.280]   And I think Paul would say you're asking the wrong question.
[00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:04.280]   It's not about how much alcohol you have,
[00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:07.060]   it's about how much of you the alcohol has.
[00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:10.200]   It is not about how much you drink
[00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:11.600]   or how much alcohol you consume,
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:13.600]   it is about how much of you,
[00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:16.880]   how much of your control of your life
[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:20.440]   the alcohol has over you.
[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:22.520]   But just to give a little bit of clarity before we go on,
[00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:24.280]   'cause Paul's going, hey, don't get drunk on wine,
[00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:25.800]   which he would say in case you're like,
[00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:27.480]   I never drink wine, I'm a beer guy.
[00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:28.880]   He would say don't get drunk on beer,
[00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:30.240]   don't get drunk on shots of Patron,
[00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:31.760]   don't get drunk on anything.
[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:33.960]   And if you're going, I don't know that I'm really drunk,
[00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:35.820]   here's just a couple context clues,
[00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:38.680]   maybe this will be helpful for you as it relates to drunk.
[00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:42.820]   If you wake up the next day with a hangover,
[00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:44.620]   you probably were drunk.
[00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:48.420]   I don't know if that would be controversial or not,
[00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:51.000]   I would think not, but save the email
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   'cause I probably won't respond.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.520]   If you find yourself forgetting things
[00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:57.960]   about the night before, you probably were drunk.
[00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:00.760]   If you're like, man, I can't believe that I texted him this,
[00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:03.200]   the text is in Spanish, I don't even speak Spanish.
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.560]   (audience laughing)
[00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:06.360]   You probably had too much to drink.
[00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:12.220]   If you are unable to concentrate,
[00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:13.920]   or you're having to really, really concentrate
[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:18.920]   when you talk, you're like, yes, put this sentence together.
[00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:23.640]   You probably have had too much to drink or are drunk.
[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:25.760]   If you are swaying when you walk
[00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:27.800]   and you accidentally find yourself,
[00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:29.580]   or you find yourself accidentally tripping
[00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:33.380]   on a flat surface, you probably have had too much to drink.
[00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:38.200]   If you are taking shots, okay,
[00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:41.280]   I know this is not gonna be a popular one, shots fired,
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:43.320]   pardon the pun. (audience laughing)
[00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:44.160]   (laughing)
[00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:45.560]   That's not my notes, it's so bad.
[00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:48.200]   (audience laughing)
[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:50.240]   It's kind of genius though.
[00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:53.480]   If you are taking shots, you probably
[00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:56.600]   are not drinking biblically,
[00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:59.280]   because there's really only one reason why you take shots.
[00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:01.640]   It's not like you're like, oh my goodness, this is,
[00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:02.480]   (audience laughing)
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:04.680]   this is delicious, what is this again?
[00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:06.240]   You're like, ah.
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:10.200]   You're probably not drinking.
[00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.400]   If you're playing drinking games,
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:14.920]   I know, I get another one where it's like,
[00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:16.760]   easy man, you're up in our business.
[00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:18.760]   If you're playing beer pong,
[00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:22.440]   you probably are not drinking biblically,
[00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:25.000]   unless you are a master with the ping pong balls.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.120]   (audience laughing)
[00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:27.920]   And Paul would say, if you're drinking
[00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:29.080]   for the purpose of getting drunk,
[00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:31.720]   which I think a lot of us, I mean, let's be honest,
[00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:33.400]   if we were honest with Paul, and he says,
[00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:36.720]   hey, do not get drunk, or don't drink to get drunk,
[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:39.520]   you're like, Paul, then why would I drink?
[00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:41.280]   And I think he would say, yeah,
[00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:42.920]   you should think about that then.
[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:43.920]   (audience laughing)
[00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:46.360]   He says, do not get drunk on one,
[00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:47.720]   and I love it because he tells us why,
[00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.320]   and there's two reasons inside of the text
[00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:51.040]   that he tells us, and it's not,
[00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:52.800]   is it because God is against fun?
[00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:54.360]   Is that what this is about?
[00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:58.400]   No, it's because of where drunkenness leads,
[00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:00.040]   and he uses a word we really don't use anymore,
[00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:02.400]   the word debauchery, so today, probably at your job,
[00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:04.440]   you weren't like, oh my gosh, he debauched me.
[00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:07.920]   He's a debaucher, I tell him, no good, he's a debaucher.
[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:09.960]   Debauchery is a word that we don't use a ton,
[00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:12.200]   but it just means reckless living.
[00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:14.160]   It means out of control living.
[00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:16.480]   And Paul says the reason why alcohol is a bad thing
[00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:19.640]   is not because God's against fun or your birthday party.
[00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:21.200]   The reason why he says don't get drunk
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:23.680]   is because he leads to a particular place,
[00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:24.840]   and one of the places that it leads
[00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:26.920]   is to out of control living,
[00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:28.720]   where you're no longer in control,
[00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:31.240]   but the alcohol has begun to take over
[00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:32.840]   your ability to speak, your ability to walk,
[00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:35.280]   your ability, oftentimes, to even think.
[00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:37.200]   And he says where it leads is no more good.
[00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:38.400]   It leads to out of control living.
[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:42.680]   It leads to sending text messages that you regret.
[00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:46.480]   It leads to calling ex-boyfriends or girlfriends
[00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:48.360]   and letting them know you think
[00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:49.600]   you really should get back together.
[00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:52.440]   It leads to decisions that we wake up the next morning
[00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:53.260]   filled with regret.
[00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:56.840]   It leads to bar taps that we never would've racked up sober,
[00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:58.320]   paying for people we don't even know.
[00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:00.000]   He's like, it leads to out of control spending.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.100]   It leads to out of control living.
[00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:03.980]   It leads to going home with someone
[00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:07.020]   that we don't even know their last name.
[00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:10.300]   I mean, sadly, it leads to an out of control living
[00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:12.480]   that for some of us, it's led to like,
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:17.320]   I gotta get an STD test because I slept with him
[00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:21.060]   and we didn't use protection or we,
[00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:23.000]   I went further than I wanted to.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.260]   It leads to shame, hangover.
[00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.200]   And Paul would say, man, it leads you to a place
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:31.300]   that God does not want you to go.
[00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:35.920]   And this loss of control, it doesn't just make you,
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:37.600]   you shouldn't just not drink and drive.
[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:38.700]   It makes you a worse dater.
[00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:39.760]   You shouldn't drink and date.
[00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:43.320]   You shouldn't drink and be a friend,
[00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:45.120]   drink and do anything that's gonna impair it.
[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:48.140]   And Paul says, if you allow alcohol to take control,
[00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:52.580]   it will lead you to a place of reckless living,
[00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:55.040]   of regret, and of pain.
[00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:57.200]   And the worst thing, I think, he says,
[00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:58.720]   the place that it leads you to
[00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:02.360]   is really found inside of the context
[00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:03.520]   of everything that he said.
[00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:05.160]   And this is what I think Paul's biggest point
[00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:06.080]   in this whole thing is,
[00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:08.900]   it's gonna lead you to waste your life.
[00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:11.200]   Like, it's gonna lead you to waste those moments.
[00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:12.600]   I mean, that's the point in the entire context.
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:13.800]   He's like, dude, hey, look, okay,
[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:15.560]   God created everything on this earth, your life.
[00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:17.280]   You're here for a reason, you're here for a purpose.
[00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:18.640]   You only got so many minutes.
[00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:20.840]   Don't waste them being wasted.
[00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:22.760]   Don't waste them being spent at the bar,
[00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:23.600]   having too many drinks,
[00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:25.280]   having those superficial conversations
[00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:26.440]   just 'cause you're both buzzed.
[00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:27.880]   And yeah, I like God too.
[00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:29.640]   Don't waste them in those conversations.
[00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:31.100]   Don't waste those moments of your life.
[00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:32.120]   You only have so many.
[00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:33.560]   That's his point.
[00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:35.640]   It's not like, hey, God's against beer.
[00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:38.240]   It's he's against you wasting your life.
[00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:39.920]   It's you not experiencing the purpose
[00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:41.480]   for which you were born, created.
[00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:44.540]   And if you're a believer for which God has saved you,
[00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:48.860]   it's you not experiencing a life full of meaning.
[00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:53.560]   By living in line with God's will in every situation,
[00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:56.080]   by seeing the world around you and living on purpose
[00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:58.840]   or living on mission for God,
[00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:01.280]   is it wrong to have a drink?
[00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:02.120]   It may be for you.
[00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:02.940]   I don't know.
[00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:04.020]   We'll talk about that a little bit more in a second,
[00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:04.960]   but that's not his point.
[00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:07.120]   His point is don't allow alcohol
[00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:09.160]   to lead you to a place where it takes you
[00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:11.440]   off of the reason for which you exist,
[00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:14.140]   the reason that you're here on this planet.
[00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:15.160]   I mean, you think about it.
[00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:16.720]   You never hear, as it relates,
[00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:18.020]   if we were to answer Paul's question of like,
[00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:21.480]   hey, don't get drunk because it leads to X,
[00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:24.420]   I think we may have different answers in the room
[00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:26.840]   based on our experiences, our own story,
[00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:28.480]   the stories that we know of our friends,
[00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:30.600]   but all of us would answer pretty much
[00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:32.160]   in the same genre of things.
[00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:36.520]   It leads to less than awesome things
[00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:38.040]   and God would be like, yes, do more of that.
[00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:39.320]   In other words, you never hear someone be like,
[00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:40.400]   hey, and then I got drunk
[00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:43.480]   and I had the most amazing quiet time I've ever had.
[00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:44.600]   Best time, God's word.
[00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:46.000]   I mean, it was rich.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:46.840]   It was rich.
[00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:47.680]   You never hear that.
[00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:48.500]   You never hear someone be like,
[00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:50.760]   dude, I just, I got hammered drunk
[00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:52.920]   and then I had the best prayer time I've ever had.
[00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:54.480]   I never have heard someone say,
[00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:56.200]   man, I got hammered drunk and I just,
[00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:58.380]   I led this guy, I led my neighbor to Christ.
[00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:00.800]   I mean, I'm tearing up thinking about it right now.
[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:01.960]   It just doesn't happen.
[00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:04.280]   But you do hear all the time,
[00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:07.000]   man, I got really drunk and I did X.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:12.200]   And sometimes it's laughable and sometimes it's not.
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:16.040]   And Paul says, man, don't allow alcohol
[00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:19.460]   to rob you of a moment,
[00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:22.240]   of a life full of moments that don't have meaning,
[00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:26.320]   of a life that's void or doesn't have purpose inside of it.
[00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:31.120]   Like imagine if on that New York trip,
[00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:34.080]   if I had come back and I talked to some friends
[00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:36.560]   and imagine like the trip went totally different.
[00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:38.120]   Instead of going all this different places,
[00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:39.760]   I came back and you asked me how it went
[00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:43.320]   and I was like, yeah, it was good.
[00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:45.740]   And you're like, hey, did you go to Rockefeller?
[00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:47.420]   Did you go to Central Park and do the bikes?
[00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:49.360]   Did you go eat the frozen hot chocolate
[00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:50.640]   just like in serendipity?
[00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:51.920]   Did you go on the ice skating rink?
[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:54.000]   Did you go to all the different things,
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.040]   you know, the Empire State Building?
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:56.720]   And I was like, no.
[00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:58.720]   What'd you do?
[00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:01.320]   It's a little fuzzy, honestly.
[00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:05.480]   We found this bar the first night
[00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:08.000]   and we got there and we had margaritas.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.520]   My wife, she loves margaritas, me too.
[00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:11.960]   And we had like three, maybe four.
[00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:13.160]   Then we did shots.
[00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:16.320]   And it's kind of, I don't,
[00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:18.120]   I kept struggling to really remember.
[00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:20.240]   And then the next day we woke up,
[00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:23.180]   we slept in and we're dealing with the headache thing.
[00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:25.000]   So it was like, oh, we gotta get Starbucks.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.240]   Oh man, so much pain.
[00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:29.240]   And then we just kind of waited out the day we ate.
[00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:31.200]   We ate in Chinatown, I do remember that.
[00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:33.760]   And then we did it, we went back to that bar
[00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:35.800]   that second night, that same time.
[00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:37.240]   Or that second night again.
[00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:40.800]   And that one I don't remember really at all.
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:43.280]   And then the next, and on and on.
[00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:47.600]   You'd be like, you wasted your trip to New York.
[00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:50.080]   And maybe you're going, oh man, that sounds so fun.
[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:50.920]   I mean, think about it.
[00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:52.080]   You could do that in Dallas at least.
[00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:52.920]   We can all agree there.
[00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:54.000]   Regardless of what you believe,
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.600]   your Christian faith or any of that,
[00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:56.600]   you'd at least be like, yeah,
[00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:58.480]   you know that there's bars in Dallas.
[00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:00.460]   You don't have to do that inside of New York.
[00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:01.800]   Even if you are not a Christian,
[00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:03.300]   we would all agree there, you wasted,
[00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:06.320]   in other words, you missed out on the reason
[00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:07.920]   you went to New York.
[00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:10.760]   Which is to experience, to make the most
[00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:12.240]   of every moment that you had there,
[00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:16.040]   and you wasted it just hitting one bar after the next.
[00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:20.160]   In so many ways, that's what Paul is saying
[00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:21.560]   about your life and my life.
[00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:24.600]   Like if you spend it being drunk,
[00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:27.240]   you are spending it missing out on the reason
[00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:28.440]   why you're here.
[00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:32.280]   The reason that God has put breath inside of your lungs.
[00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:35.140]   The reason he's given you another day, another weekend.
[00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:37.280]   He says don't waste your life being wasted.
[00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:41.260]   And if you're not careful to do so as it relates to alcohol,
[00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:45.380]   you will allow it to rob you of meaning.
[00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:48.140]   Not only that, I mean, let's be honest.
[00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:49.820]   I think we could at least, most of us agree
[00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:53.580]   that alcohol, it like robs you of creativity.
[00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:55.060]   It robs you with some level of adventure.
[00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:56.180]   I know a lot of you are like, dude,
[00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:57.220]   have you ever seen The Hangover?
[00:21:57.220 --> 00:21:58.220]   That's my life.
[00:21:58.220 --> 00:21:59.540]   It's adventurous.
[00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:02.340]   Okay, for most people, what it looks like is like,
[00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:06.000]   dude, drinking in your life is just monotonous.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.440]   Your weekends are monotonous.
[00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:08.600]   If you're a weekend warrior,
[00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:10.660]   you do the same thing every weekend.
[00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:12.100]   You're like, Friday's here, what are we doing?
[00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:13.680]   We're getting lit, get blacked out.
[00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:15.520]   And then Saturday's here and I'm gonna do it again.
[00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:16.840]   And then next weekend, I'm gonna do it again.
[00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:18.320]   And then after that, I think I'm gonna do it again.
[00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:19.320]   And then after that, I mean,
[00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:23.260]   that is the most pathetic life I can imagine.
[00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:26.740]   And if you're going, oh, dude, you just don't know.
[00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:27.840]   You don't know.
[00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:28.840]   And there's nothing, honestly,
[00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:29.680]   that I'm gonna be able to tell you
[00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:31.320]   that can make you believe that.
[00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:34.360]   But the God who's there has so much more for you
[00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:36.800]   than you numbing yourself to the pain
[00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:38.040]   of whatever's going on in your world,
[00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:39.400]   the stress of your job.
[00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:42.800]   Like he has invited you on this incredible adventure
[00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:44.280]   where he's leading you to a place
[00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:47.700]   where you experience meaning, not shame, in your life.
[00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:51.040]   And he says, if you live under the influence,
[00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:53.180]   you are headed towards destruction.
[00:22:56.800 --> 00:23:01.800]   And if you are, I think, tragically, honestly,
[00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:03.440]   there was an article that came out,
[00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:04.280]   or it wasn't even an article,
[00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:06.040]   it was a TED Talk by some psychologist
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:08.080]   and it was like how 30 is not the new 20.
[00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:10.520]   And it just talked about a common belief in our day
[00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:12.560]   where it says, man, young adults think that like,
[00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:16.020]   hey, my 20s is really, or 30 is the new 20.
[00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:17.720]   So I used to have to have everything together
[00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:19.960]   and by 20, I would begin to take steps in my life.
[00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:21.620]   And now I've got to 30, my 20s,
[00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:23.440]   I can just kind of do whatever I want.
[00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:25.760]   And the point of the whole conversation
[00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:29.000]   from the psychologist is what really God's Word confirms.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.320]   Is that if you go through your 20 being like,
[00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:32.680]   dude, I'm just gonna, I'll deal with this stuff later,
[00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:34.520]   I'll grow, I'll develop as a person later.
[00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:37.060]   Right now, I'm kind of just living for the weekend.
[00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:40.160]   You are living without purpose.
[00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:43.880]   You are putting pause on even your growth as a person.
[00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:44.720]   I don't even know if it's pause,
[00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:46.500]   you may be going backwards.
[00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:48.240]   I mean, we've all met the dude at the wedding
[00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:50.200]   who's like 50 and you're like,
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:52.200]   you never left your fraternity.
[00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:55.000]   He's like, where's the keg stands, let's do this.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.980]   And you're like, man, you are so tan right now
[00:23:57.980 --> 00:23:59.720]   and you never left your fraternity.
[00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:04.560]   And what happened with him is what,
[00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:06.960]   tragically, I think many people are doing right now.
[00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:09.440]   God doesn't say, man, life begins when you're 30.
[00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:10.400]   Right now, let me just tell you something,
[00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:11.880]   you are becoming something.
[00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:13.160]   You are becoming someone.
[00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:15.680]   You are working on, today you worked on your marriage
[00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:18.560]   and you may be thinking, I'm not even dating someone.
[00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:20.420]   Yes, you worked on your marriage.
[00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:21.960]   The type of spouse you're gonna be,
[00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:23.000]   the type of person you're gonna be,
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.240]   the career path that you're gonna be on,
[00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:25.200]   all of them will work today.
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:26.680]   You are becoming someone.
[00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:28.280]   You're not coasting in your 20s.
[00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:33.680]   You are becoming someone.
[00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:37.540]   And your relationship with alcohol
[00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:40.040]   is gonna be a key determining factor
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:42.500]   in the someone that you are becoming.
[00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:44.480]   And Paul says, don't let it have control.
[00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:46.400]   There is someone to have control of your life
[00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:48.240]   and here's where he goes next in verse 18.
[00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:51.520]   Instead, be filled with the Spirit.
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:53.640]   So we contrast drinking alcohol
[00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:55.040]   and being drunk or being controlled by that
[00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:56.760]   and he says, no, don't be controlled by that
[00:24:56.760 --> 00:25:00.000]   but be controlled or be filled with the Spirit.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.960]   Speaking to one another in psalms, hymns,
[00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:04.980]   and songs from the Spirit.
[00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:07.960]   Sing and make music from your heart to the Lord.
[00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:10.520]   Always giving thanks to God the Father for everything
[00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:12.520]   in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:14.000]   So our second idea that we're gonna talk about
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.660]   after living under the influence
[00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:17.400]   is living in the Spirit.
[00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:19.980]   Well, Paul says, don't give yourself
[00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:21.320]   to being controlled by alcohol
[00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:24.760]   but do allow the Spirit of God to control your life.
[00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:27.440]   What does it mean to be filled with the Spirit?
[00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:29.840]   And this is so huge and there's lots of resources
[00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:31.780]   on watermark.org you can go listen to.
[00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:33.160]   So I'm not gonna cover it really in depth here
[00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:34.760]   but there's a lot of misconceptions
[00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:36.920]   about filled with the Spirit.
[00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:39.440]   In fact, one of them is the glow down on filling up.
[00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:41.040]   Our senior pastor here did.
[00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:42.700]   It's excellent and there's several messages
[00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:43.760]   that are involved there.
[00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:45.800]   But what does it mean to be filled with the Spirit?
[00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:46.680]   'Cause a lot of people would say,
[00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:47.880]   like, hey, to be filled with the Spirit,
[00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:49.220]   you gotta speak in tongues,
[00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:51.080]   you gotta have like some emotional experience.
[00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:53.160]   It was like, they'll express it like,
[00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:55.200]   oh man, that felt like the Spirit
[00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:56.560]   was so filled in this place.
[00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:58.560]   It was so rich inside of there.
[00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:00.040]   And I think people do that
[00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:01.160]   from well-meaning places.
[00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:04.000]   Biblically, what it means to have someone
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.180]   who is filled with the Spirit
[00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:09.880]   is the same idea of surrendered to the Spirit.
[00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:12.720]   The same idea of being controlled by the Spirit.
[00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:13.560]   What do I mean?
[00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:14.380]   What's an example of that?
[00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:16.080]   When someone says, hey, they're filled with rage,
[00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:18.280]   they don't mean there was like an injection of rage
[00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:19.420]   that went into their body.
[00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:22.800]   It means they were controlled by rage.
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:25.880]   Biblically, this is what it means to be filled
[00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:28.960]   is to be surrendered to or given over to
[00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:30.840]   the Spirit of God.
[00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:32.560]   That you and I are to do that.
[00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:34.300]   And Paul lays out really what that looks like
[00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:37.000]   by going into, hey, addressing one another
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.840]   with scriptural Psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs,
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:42.640]   have spiritual or scriptural Bible things.
[00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:43.960]   Fill your mouth is what he says.
[00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:46.640]   Fill your mind or renew the way that you think.
[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:48.000]   Fill your heart, he says.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.440]   He uses all of these different things.
[00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:51.520]   He says this is what it looks like to be controlled
[00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:52.760]   or to be surrendered to the Spirit
[00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:55.840]   is you begin to allow God's Word to fill your mind,
[00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:58.200]   fill your heart, fill your mouth,
[00:26:58.200 --> 00:26:59.880]   and do it together with other people,
[00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:01.880]   addressing one another, he says.
[00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:03.520]   Does that make sense?
[00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:05.040]   It's not dissimilar to this.
[00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:10.040]   When I was, so in college, sorry.
[00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:15.360]   You guys talk amongst yourselves while I remember this.
[00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:17.320]   When I was in college, I worked at the summer camp
[00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:20.800]   during the summer, and there were these different stations
[00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:24.120]   where I was a counselor, and I would,
[00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:26.120]   every day you would wake up and they would basically
[00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:27.360]   put you at these different stations
[00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:29.660]   where you're the counselor that's overseeing the blob,
[00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:32.280]   or you're the counselor overseeing the trampolines,
[00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:36.040]   or overseeing the canoe and sail clinic,
[00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:37.840]   or overseeing the boats, or overseeing these different
[00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:39.800]   things, for whatever reason, often I would get put
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:43.180]   on the canoe and sail, and they would have these sailboats
[00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:45.560]   where you would have a bunch of campers that would come down
[00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:47.880]   and you're essentially like the head, like here we go,
[00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:50.160]   I'm the sail guy, come on in, I'll teach you how to do it,
[00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:52.400]   and you would load everybody up, and each camper would be
[00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:54.280]   on their own boat, you'd teach them how to do it,
[00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:56.520]   and you'd go through what it looks like to,
[00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:58.240]   if there's an emergency, and pulling out the sail,
[00:27:58.240 --> 00:27:59.200]   and all this different stuff.
[00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:00.680]   The biggest thing that you had to make sure
[00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:02.600]   that these kids would know how to do is they would have
[00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:04.560]   to pull the ropes on their sailboat,
[00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:06.200]   this little small sailboat, in a certain way
[00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:08.560]   that would expand open the sail,
[00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:10.920]   that if you're gonna allow the wind to take your boat,
[00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:13.360]   you gotta pull the ropes and it opens up the sail.
[00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:15.680]   It's pretty easy, other than that, you can't mess it up.
[00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:17.800]   So we'd go out there, we'd all get out,
[00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:19.480]   as the counselor, you're like, I gotta make sure
[00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:22.520]   none of these kids gets eaten by an alligator or something,
[00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:24.120]   here we go, Timmy, all right, here we go,
[00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:28.040]   and we'd go out, and inevitably, every single time,
[00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:28.880]   (laughs)
[00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:30.880]   there's no Timmy, every single time,
[00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:32.660]   there would be like, there would be a Timmy,
[00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:33.760]   we're just gonna call him Timmy,
[00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:36.200]   there'd be one kid that would be way in the back,
[00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:37.320]   and every time you're up front,
[00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:38.600]   and you're with all the other kids, and you're like,
[00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:40.480]   how do, you can't really turn the sailboat around,
[00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:43.280]   the wind is pushing this, Timmy, Timmy!
[00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:47.040]   Open up the sail, Timmy, pull the ropes,
[00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:50.160]   pull the, Timmy, look at me, Timmy!
[00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:54.240]   Pull the ropes, open up the sail to allow the wind to push,
[00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:55.920]   in other words, Timmy, you're not gonna move
[00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:59.080]   if you don't open up the sail, allow the sail to expand,
[00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:01.640]   and you will be moved in our direction,
[00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:03.360]   you'll move in the right direction,
[00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:06.320]   you are dependent, Timmy, on the wind,
[00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:07.980]   so open up the sail.
[00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:12.680]   And stay with me, 'cause this is the left turn.
[00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:14.840]   (laughing)
[00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:19.280]   In the same way, this is really what the Bible presents
[00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:21.520]   as it relates to walking by the Spirit,
[00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:22.880]   that you and I, what is our role?
[00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:24.080]   Our role is not to be the wind,
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:25.400]   our role is not to move the boat forward,
[00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:26.680]   our role is to literally just say,
[00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:28.460]   look, I'm gonna open up my life,
[00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:30.000]   I'm gonna open up my mind to God's Word
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:30.840]   and allow it to come in,
[00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:32.880]   I'm dependent on the Spirit of God
[00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:34.720]   if I'm gonna move my life in the right direction.
[00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:36.080]   I don't have what it takes on my own,
[00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:37.560]   I've got what's called a sin nature,
[00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:40.060]   everything inside of me that is just because of me
[00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:42.100]   wants to lead me in a wrong direction,
[00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:43.360]   wants to lead me towards an affair,
[00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:44.760]   wants to lead me towards getting drunk,
[00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:45.960]   wants to lead me towards getting high,
[00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:47.520]   wants to lead me towards materialism,
[00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:50.440]   everything about me is headed in the wrong direction.
[00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:52.160]   But when I allow the Spirit of God
[00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:54.320]   to fill the sails, if you will, of my life,
[00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:56.100]   that's the only way I can move in the right direction,
[00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:58.000]   so how do I get the Spirit of God
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.200]   to fill the sails of my life,
[00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:01.480]   to move me in the right direction?
[00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:04.240]   By opening up the sail,
[00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:08.780]   or opening up my mind, my heart, my life,
[00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:12.760]   to God's Word, to renewing the way that I think,
[00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:14.600]   allowing the Spirit of God to lead me,
[00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:19.460]   and when I do that, it moves me in the right direction.
[00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:21.280]   I'm dependent on the Spirit of God,
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:22.800]   and the way that I can access
[00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:25.540]   just being filled with the Spirit
[00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:28.020]   is by opening up my mind, opening up my heart,
[00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:30.700]   opening up my life to allow God's Word
[00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:33.600]   to renew the way that I think, the way that I live,
[00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:34.720]   the way that I see the world,
[00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:35.760]   and I do it with one another.
[00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:37.120]   That's what Paul just said.
[00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:39.140]   That's what he says inside of that text.
[00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:40.660]   This is how the spiritual life is lived,
[00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:42.100]   and where does it lead to?
[00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:45.320]   I mean, if the life under the influence
[00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:48.220]   leads to shame, regret, pain,
[00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:50.660]   leads to at least headaches and hangovers,
[00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:53.960]   where does the life with the Spirit lead to?
[00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:55.100]   Because he doesn't tell us here,
[00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:56.180]   but there is a place he tells us,
[00:30:56.180 --> 00:30:57.060]   and I'm gonna tell you briefly.
[00:30:57.060 --> 00:30:59.260]   You can write down Galatians chapter five.
[00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:00.880]   If you wanna read it later, it tells us where Paul says,
[00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:02.580]   look, hey, if you ever allow your life
[00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:04.460]   to be filled with the fruit of the Spirit,
[00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:06.820]   or you allow the Spirit of God to take over,
[00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:08.400]   and the more that you allow the Spirit of God
[00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:10.120]   to take over your life,
[00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:11.820]   here's what he's gonna produce inside of your life.
[00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:13.940]   He says this in chapter five, verse 22 of Galatians.
[00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:15.320]   But the fruit of the Spirit,
[00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:18.940]   what's produced by the Spirit in someone's life is love,
[00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:25.140]   joy, not depression, peace, not anxiety,
[00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:31.620]   forbearance or patience, kindness,
[00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:35.740]   goodness, faithfulness, gentleness,
[00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:38.940]   self-control, like unlike alcohol,
[00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:40.900]   where you lose more and more control
[00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:41.980]   the more you have of it,
[00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:43.740]   the more you have of the Spirit,
[00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:46.780]   or the more the Spirit has of you,
[00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:50.860]   the more you gain control over your life.
[00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:53.460]   And I love what comes next.
[00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:54.900]   It always ministers to me.
[00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:57.780]   Against such things there is no law.
[00:31:57.780 --> 00:32:01.300]   Paul, what do you mean?
[00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:04.120]   Yeah, against such things there's no law.
[00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:05.800]   There's no need for a law against these types of things.
[00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:07.740]   When that is the governor of someone's life,
[00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:09.820]   when the Spirit of God is directing someone's life,
[00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:11.900]   it produces things inside of them
[00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:14.060]   that if everyone was governed by that,
[00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:15.160]   we wouldn't need laws.
[00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:16.780]   We could take all the locks off the doors,
[00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:17.920]   you can leave your car unlocked,
[00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:19.260]   you don't have to worry about school shootings,
[00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:21.740]   you don't have to worry about any of that stuff.
[00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:22.580]   Because he says against such things,
[00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:23.640]   in other words, there's never been a law
[00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:25.840]   that's like, all right, hey, too much peace.
[00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:28.460]   Break it up, too much peace over here, too much joy.
[00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:31.140]   This guy's a little too kind for me, if you ask me.
[00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:33.060]   There's never been anything like that.
[00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:36.100]   He says against such things there is no law.
[00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:44.640]   It's really, it's such a beautiful truth.
[00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:51.060]   Because I grew up in a home that my parents divorced very,
[00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:55.460]   really, there was a lot of alcoholic abuse that took place.
[00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:57.220]   And it finally ended around age 12.
[00:32:57.220 --> 00:33:02.400]   And had the Spirit of God had control,
[00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:07.140]   over one of my parents,
[00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:10.800]   my story would have looked different.
[00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:14.240]   Not only would his life have been different,
[00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:16.320]   his children's life would have been different.
[00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:22.040]   And unlike the way that alcohol,
[00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:23.560]   it's not bad every single time,
[00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:25.240]   it's a gift from God, the Scripture says,
[00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:29.620]   but the places it can lead, the Bible says, be cautious.
[00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:34.680]   Because unlike alcohol, that's never a solution
[00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:35.600]   to people's problems.
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:38.560]   The Spirit of God is an incredible solution
[00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:40.060]   to what you're facing in life.
[00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:42.600]   In other words, you never hear the story.
[00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:44.520]   I mean, it's almost comical, but it's true.
[00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:46.360]   I never heard the story of somebody who came down front
[00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:50.920]   and be like, look, we were having tons of dating problems.
[00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:52.880]   And then we introduced alcohol.
[00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:56.260]   And everything's been incredible ever since.
[00:33:56.260 --> 00:33:58.760]   And then never heard the person,
[00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:00.720]   like, I was so far from God.
[00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:02.960]   And then I found shots of Patron.
[00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:06.080]   Turned it all around.
[00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:07.880]   It just doesn't happen.
[00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:09.860]   But when the Spirit of God begins to come in,
[00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:12.520]   wherever it comes in, the Bible tells us
[00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:14.720]   where the Spirit is, there's freedom.
[00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:16.200]   There's liberty brought in.
[00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:18.520]   There's life there.
[00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:21.440]   And that's what God wants to lead you and lead me to,
[00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:23.640]   if we'll just open up the sails of our life.
[00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:30.920]   So Paul says, don't be controlled by alcohol.
[00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:32.820]   Do be controlled by the Spirit of God.
[00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:35.780]   And so if you're anything like me,
[00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:37.120]   when I sit and listen to a sermon like this,
[00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:40.520]   I'm like, okay, don't be drunk on wine.
[00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:41.840]   Check, got that?
[00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:43.620]   Or anything else.
[00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:45.840]   Do be surrendered to God and his control.
[00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:50.760]   Can I have a Mambo taxi on Friday night or not?
[00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:54.660]   Can we just make it that clear and that simple?
[00:34:55.700 --> 00:34:59.780]   And so what I wanna do next is just talk really quickly
[00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:01.500]   about living in the tension.
[00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:05.460]   Because the answer is maybe.
[00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:07.960]   There's not a one size fits all.
[00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:11.040]   And so the third idea, if we're talking about living
[00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:12.840]   under the influence and where that leads you,
[00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:14.640]   living in the Spirit and where that leads you,
[00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:16.800]   the third idea is living in the tension
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:18.340]   the Bible presents as it relates to alcohol.
[00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:20.680]   'Cause you're right, Jesus, I mean, Jesus,
[00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:23.420]   his first miracle, turning water into wine, absolutely.
[00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:24.260]   People who like to drink,
[00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:25.420]   it's like their favorite Bible verse.
[00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:30.080]   Like, dude, Jesus was also called a drunkard in Matthew 15.
[00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:31.540]   Feels like we have something in common.
[00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:34.500]   And so there is this tension of like,
[00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:36.300]   man, there's incredible caution,
[00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:38.380]   and yet the Bible tells us in Psalm 104
[00:35:38.380 --> 00:35:41.140]   that God gave wine to make glad the hearts of men.
[00:35:41.140 --> 00:35:44.980]   And so am I free?
[00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:46.780]   Can you drink?
[00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:48.760]   And so I just wanna open the conversation,
[00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:50.180]   and if nothing else, honestly,
[00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:53.220]   if you leave here tonight and you begin to ask the question,
[00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:54.520]   why do I drink?
[00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:57.280]   Then I feel like I've done my job.
[00:35:57.280 --> 00:36:00.480]   Like, in other words, what you need to leave here
[00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:02.160]   and feel responsible for is the answer.
[00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:03.820]   In other words, it's Scripture to give this away.
[00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:05.940]   It's not a clear, like, yes, you can,
[00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:07.120]   as long as you're not getting drunk,
[00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:07.960]   you're always free to drink.
[00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:09.800]   The question is all about why.
[00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:10.680]   What's at the heart?
[00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:11.880]   Why are you drinking?
[00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:15.760]   And you gotta wrestle that down.
[00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:16.760]   There's clear parameters.
[00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:18.620]   I'm about to lay out a few of which,
[00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:21.240]   of why, when it's clearly not okay, but why?
[00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:22.720]   Like, literally, I want you to think about it.
[00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:24.000]   You can write that down if you can't,
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   if you're not, if you think, oh, he's saying, like,
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.100]   one of those things he really didn't want me
[00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:27.940]   to actually do.
[00:36:27.940 --> 00:36:31.980]   I really want you to think, why are you drinking?
[00:36:31.980 --> 00:36:34.160]   Every time.
[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:36.760]   Here's why I wanna drink right now.
[00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:38.320]   Here's why I want a drink.
[00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:39.160]   Here's why I want this drink.
[00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:40.920]   Here's why I'm drinking right now.
[00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:43.480]   Begin to be thoughtful every single time.
[00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:45.400]   I mean, if nothing else, that's what the Bible
[00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:47.220]   would command all of us to.
[00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:49.280]   And there's certain outliers that it would clearly say,
[00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:50.640]   no, you definitely should not drink.
[00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:52.340]   Or this is an occasion where you, for sure,
[00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:53.180]   should not drink.
[00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:54.040]   I'm gonna go over a few of those.
[00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:55.360]   But if you leave here and you just wrestle,
[00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:58.000]   you begin to be thoughtful about, hey, is it okay?
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.760]   Am I, is the reason I wanna drink right now
[00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:03.020]   okay in God's eyes?
[00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:06.320]   Then I feel like I've done my job.
[00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:08.240]   But here's some of the reasons why it would not be
[00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:09.200]   a good idea to drink.
[00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:11.380]   If you need to drink or do not drink
[00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:13.560]   to achieve a state of mind, if you're like,
[00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:16.400]   I just need to escape, I just need to get outta here,
[00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:17.360]   I don't wanna remember anything,
[00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:18.880]   I'm so overwhelmed with life,
[00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:21.240]   that's not a good reason to drink.
[00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:24.100]   Truly, the Bible says that you and I, over and over again,
[00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:26.860]   it says that we're to be sober-minded, sober-minded,
[00:37:26.860 --> 00:37:29.020]   on the alert.
[00:37:29.020 --> 00:37:31.940]   First Peter five, Romans 12, verse three,
[00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:33.380]   First Thessalonians five, verse six,
[00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:34.900]   and over and over again.
[00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:35.740]   That you and I are to be sober.
[00:37:35.740 --> 00:37:37.140]   So if you're like, man, I just wanna check out,
[00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:38.260]   that's not a good reason.
[00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:39.700]   So if that would be how you would answer the question,
[00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:41.400]   that's not a good reason to drink.
[00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:45.220]   Do not drink to get over a need.
[00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:50.860]   Or because of a need, if you're like, I need a drink,
[00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:53.080]   my boss was crazy today,
[00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:55.640]   that's probably not a good reason to drink.
[00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:57.600]   And I know sometimes people say that in joking,
[00:37:57.600 --> 00:37:59.580]   but if you're not able to be like, I was kidding,
[00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:03.380]   I really don't need it, I'm fine, I'll be okay without it,
[00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:07.120]   then you probably are drinking to fill some sort of need.
[00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:10.060]   What do I mean by need?
[00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:11.560]   Like if you're like, hey, I need,
[00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:13.920]   I need a drink in order to have fun tonight, am I right?
[00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:17.440]   If you need a drink, because what you're doing,
[00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:19.240]   in order to have fun at what you're doing,
[00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:21.240]   what you're doing is not fun, or neither are you.
[00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:22.840]   There's something going on there,
[00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:25.060]   (congregation laughing)
[00:38:25.060 --> 00:38:28.520]   and if that's the case, and that's why you're drinking,
[00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:29.760]   that's not a good reason to drink,
[00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:32.100]   and you're like, well, it just makes me a better dancer.
[00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:34.240]   It doesn't make you a better dancer, number one.
[00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:36.660]   (laughing)
[00:38:36.660 --> 00:38:39.420]   I'm sorry, I could go here longer, but I'm not going to.
[00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:40.700]   (congregation laughing)
[00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:42.300]   It's not a good reason to drink.
[00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:46.360]   If you're drinking to get over a breakup,
[00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:49.060]   it's not a good reason to drink.
[00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:54.880]   If you're drinking, could confuse, discourage,
[00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:58.840]   or tempt someone around you, it's not a good reason to drink.
[00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:01.440]   Romans chapter 14, if you want to go read it later,
[00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:02.280]   you can write that down.
[00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:04.160]   Romans chapter 14, First Corinthians 10,
[00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:05.880]   Paul lays out essentially this argument
[00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:08.140]   that happened inside of a couple of the early churches
[00:39:08.140 --> 00:39:11.540]   where it's a kind of a longer,
[00:39:11.540 --> 00:39:13.400]   it's hard to condense really quickly,
[00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:15.580]   but essentially, the churches were debating over
[00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:18.520]   whether or not you could eat meat, sacrifice to idols.
[00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:21.040]   So Paul was like, dude, this meat, it's filet mignon,
[00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:23.900]   it was sacrificed to an idol, those idols don't exist.
[00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:26.280]   I can eat this all day long, it's not gonna be a big deal.
[00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:28.160]   All they did was like, hey, we give this to you, Zeus.
[00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:30.680]   Zeus isn't real, so people eat up steaks on the thing,
[00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:32.500]   and they defended people, and they were like,
[00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:33.840]   I can't believe you did that, and Paul went,
[00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:36.160]   okay, time out, hey, if it's gonna offend anyone,
[00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:37.140]   we can't do this.
[00:39:37.140 --> 00:39:39.480]   If it's gonna cause anyone to stumble,
[00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:41.360]   and he says they're the weaker brother
[00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:42.960]   'cause their faith doesn't allow them to do it,
[00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:47.080]   but even so, he says, I'm not going to use my freedom
[00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:52.080]   that I have if it's gonna offend, confuse,
[00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:57.120]   or discourage, or tempt anyone that I'm around.
[00:39:57.120 --> 00:40:00.480]   So if your drinking is gonna do that,
[00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:04.100]   am I saying that you should sacrifice
[00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:06.720]   or not take advantage of the freedom that you have to drink
[00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:08.920]   if it's gonna discourage, tempt, or confuse someone?
[00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:09.760]   Yes.
[00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:13.440]   Even there, you gotta be thoughtful,
[00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:15.920]   that when you go out to drink, I mean, that the context,
[00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:17.400]   hey, the people that I'm gonna be around,
[00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:20.000]   are they gonna be tempted to get drunk?
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:21.840]   Are they gonna be discouraged or confused by like,
[00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:23.920]   hey, I thought you were a Christian?
[00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:25.460]   Is it gonna bring clarity to the fact that,
[00:40:25.460 --> 00:40:26.820]   oh man, Christians can have that?
[00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:28.600]   Will it allow you to have an incredible conversation?
[00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:30.640]   Is the way I'm drinking and when I'm drinking
[00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:32.800]   going to confuse, tempt, or discourage different people?
[00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:33.960]   I mean, context is everything.
[00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:35.400]   I mean, think about it.
[00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:39.440]   If I pull out this Dos Equis,
[00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:42.940]   everyone just got a little quieter in here.
[00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:44.080]   (congregation laughs)
[00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:47.480]   And if I take it, and is this not okay?
[00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:54.040]   Oh man, I would drink to that.
[00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:55.120]   Need a lime.
[00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:56.960]   It's water, people, good grief.
[00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:58.000]   (congregation laughs)
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   Man, this is, everyone's like, oh my gosh,
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:01.840]   pastor?
[00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:02.760]   (congregation laughs)
[00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:04.280]   What sort of church is this?
[00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:06.680]   (congregation laughs)
[00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:08.520]   Why would that not be okay?
[00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:11.120]   I mean, some of you know the reason.
[00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:13.760]   Some of you are just like, oh man, I don't know.
[00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:16.360]   If I like seeing the pastor have a Dos Equis.
[00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:17.880]   (congregation laughs)
[00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:20.720]   But the reason it's not okay is because it could discourage,
[00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:23.480]   it could offend, it could confuse people
[00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:26.160]   who may not have either the familiarity
[00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:27.800]   with what the Bible teaches on it,
[00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:29.160]   or may not be in a place in their own life
[00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:30.600]   where they're like, dude, that's a part of my past.
[00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:31.720]   That's a part of my alcohol.
[00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:34.360]   Claire, I'm gonna give this to you so don't tip it over.
[00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:35.960]   Hey, no sips, okay?
[00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:38.360]   Keep an eye.
[00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:40.720]   But there's times where it's okay
[00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:42.560]   and times where there's not.
[00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:44.680]   And the Bible says there's a place,
[00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:46.200]   and if the people that you're around
[00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:48.920]   are gonna be discouraged or confused or tempted by it,
[00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:50.080]   then don't.
[00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:53.200]   The fifth reason is if you cannot, stop.
[00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:57.840]   Do not drink if you cannot stop.
[00:41:57.840 --> 00:42:03.320]   Like Blake Shelton said, the more I drink,
[00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:04.640]   the more I drink.
[00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:07.840]   And it's very deep, Blake.
[00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:11.000]   (congregation laughs)
[00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:17.160]   And this truly, I think, is a legitimately decent size
[00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:19.280]   of the audience right now.
[00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:22.440]   Who are you like, man, I don't know if I can stop.
[00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:24.360]   When I have one, it means I had eight.
[00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:28.720]   And you need to be honest with yourself,
[00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:32.200]   be honest about why, and you need to seriously evaluate,
[00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:33.440]   should you even drink?
[00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:36.720]   Maybe you need to take a time where you don't,
[00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:39.360]   and you're like, dude, it's not that big of a deal, okay?
[00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:41.160]   Look, drinking, I don't need it.
[00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:43.960]   It's not that big of a deal, great, then don't do it
[00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:45.520]   if it's not that big of a deal.
[00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:47.840]   I could stop if I want to.
[00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:49.520]   Prove it.
[00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:53.000]   If nothing else, do it yourself.
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:53.960]   Some of you may be just like,
[00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:56.440]   hey, I'm not having alcohol for a month.
[00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:57.440]   I don't wanna be a slave to this.
[00:42:57.440 --> 00:42:59.280]   I don't wanna be in chains to this.
[00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:04.120]   Fifth reason is to not drink if you can't stop.
[00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:06.040]   And this is a more serious problem in the room
[00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:08.440]   than most of us would be honest enough to admit.
[00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:11.840]   (congregation laughing)
[00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:15.720]   If you leave here,
[00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:21.000]   and you don't feel at least the inclination,
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:21.960]   you've gotta be honest.
[00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:25.520]   Hey, is it okay for me to drink in this situation,
[00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:26.880]   right now, right here?
[00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:28.120]   I mean, that's what the Bible says,
[00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:29.560]   that it's not always okay.
[00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:31.120]   It's not just, hey, it's clear, it's fine,
[00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:32.520]   it's good for me, whatever you say, pastor.
[00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:36.000]   There is a tension, and so all that I'm asking you to do
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.360]   is step up to the line of being thoughtful.
[00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:41.440]   Is this gonna discourage people around me?
[00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:45.480]   Is this gonna confuse my example of my Christian faith?
[00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:49.000]   Is this something where, man, I can't stop.
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:52.040]   Am I doing this to get over something
[00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:53.280]   that is a part of my life,
[00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:55.360]   or some pain that I'm experiencing here?
[00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:57.300]   To be thoughtful in every situation.
[00:43:57.300 --> 00:44:00.160]   I'm gonna invite Ryan to come back up,
[00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:02.720]   and we'll play a video in a second,
[00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:06.080]   but it's just a video that was captured
[00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:07.720]   from some of our video team
[00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:14.080]   of a guy who really stepped into experiencing his purpose
[00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:18.000]   over the last year, or a little over a year ago.
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:19.060]   He's a guy who spent many years,
[00:44:19.060 --> 00:44:21.680]   and you'll see in the video, not experiencing his purpose,
[00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:24.060]   and he met Jesus, and everything changed.
[00:44:24.060 --> 00:44:27.320]   He met Jesus, and he began to find freedom,
[00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:29.200]   and he began to find what I hope you hear,
[00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:32.720]   and nothing else, not that God's anti-beer.
[00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:35.480]   He's pro-you, and pro-you experiencing the purpose
[00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:38.000]   for which you exist.
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.160]   You guys, listen and watch my friend John.
[00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:43.440]   - My name is John Satriano,
[00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:45.560]   and I'm a recovering drug addict alcoholic
[00:44:45.560 --> 00:44:47.220]   saved by the grace of God.
[00:44:47.220 --> 00:44:49.040]   Ever since I can remember,
[00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:52.400]   I cared a lot about what people thought of me.
[00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:53.760]   I let it define me.
[00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:56.360]   I was so empty that the opinions of others
[00:44:56.360 --> 00:44:58.640]   made up my character.
[00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:02.420]   So the keys to my peace were in other people's pockets,
[00:45:02.420 --> 00:45:03.960]   which is a dangerous place.
[00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:06.880]   And it was around the age of 15
[00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:09.840]   when I started to fill this God-sized hole in my heart
[00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:11.280]   with worldly things.
[00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:12.480]   It was the first time I got high.
[00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:14.300]   It was the first time I got drunk,
[00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:18.980]   and it sparked this 11-year spiral out of control.
[00:45:18.980 --> 00:45:24.820]   Very soon, I found myself neck deep in an addiction,
[00:45:24.820 --> 00:45:27.600]   a daily-use addiction to cocaine and alcohol.
[00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:31.400]   I remember coming home and seeing my mom
[00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:34.040]   hysterically crying on the couch,
[00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:36.000]   and my dog barking at me,
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:39.800]   because it was like I was hurting my mom so much
[00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:41.080]   to see her son like that.
[00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:42.480]   And at that time, I could've told you
[00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:44.040]   that I didn't care at all.
[00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:46.640]   And it was around this time last year
[00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:48.000]   where I had nothing left.
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.200]   It was then I decided I needed to get help,
[00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:52.860]   and so I entered into a faith-based rehab.
[00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:57.160]   It was there that I found that my drinking and drugging
[00:45:57.160 --> 00:45:58.160]   wasn't my problem.
[00:45:58.160 --> 00:46:00.760]   It was the solution to my problem, which was my heart.
[00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:02.880]   And so during the 90-day stay at rehab,
[00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:05.840]   I made the longest journey that I could ever make,
[00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:07.960]   and that was from my head to my heart.
[00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:11.400]   I remember specifically being in my counselor's office,
[00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:14.240]   coming to the realization that my entire life
[00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:16.400]   was built on this false self
[00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:20.240]   that was choking the life out of me, pride, ego.
[00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:22.520]   And I remember in that moment
[00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:24.800]   feeling two hands on my shoulders
[00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:26.800]   and hearing a voice that said, "I'm here with you."
[00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:27.720]   And it was God.
[00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:30.200]   And from that moment, I leaned on the only power
[00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:31.200]   that was ever gonna save me,
[00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:32.920]   and that was the power of Jesus Christ.
[00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:37.920]   It is because of Christ that I'm not a slave
[00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:40.240]   to that lifestyle anymore, that substance.
[00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:45.240]   And through that, through just handing over my will to God,
[00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:47.560]   he's reconciled so many relationships.
[00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:49.200]   And he's given me a life today
[00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:50.560]   that I could not have imagined.
[00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:54.480]   The makeup of my days now is filled with just a peace
[00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:56.080]   that exceeds understanding.
[00:46:56.080 --> 00:46:58.060]   My name's John, and that's my story.
[00:46:58.060 --> 00:47:04.320]   (congregation applauding)
[00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:06.240]   - That's awesome.
[00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:07.440]   Let me be really clear.
[00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:12.900]   John encountered Jesus, and it changed everything.
[00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:16.500]   He met a man who would forgive him of his sins,
[00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:19.120]   who would begin to heal the heart that he had,
[00:47:19.120 --> 00:47:21.760]   the brokenness of his heart,
[00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:23.960]   the sin that had infected him.
[00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:25.880]   And he found healing, and he found purpose.
[00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:27.720]   Now, let me be also really clear.
[00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:29.860]   John, just like the sinner on this stage,
[00:47:29.860 --> 00:47:31.940]   just like the sinner in that seat,
[00:47:31.940 --> 00:47:34.480]   could in a moment, if he has not surrendered to God,
[00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:37.520]   saying, "Here is the soul of my life.
[00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:40.000]   "I'm opening up the sail to you, God.
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:41.620]   "I'm gonna renew my mind.
[00:47:41.620 --> 00:47:43.320]   "I'm gonna walk by your spirit.
[00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:44.980]   "I'm gonna lean in dependence on you,
[00:47:44.980 --> 00:47:46.140]   "not in dependence on alcohol,
[00:47:46.140 --> 00:47:47.980]   "in dependence on cocaine, on anything else, God.
[00:47:47.980 --> 00:47:50.740]   "In a moment, I can turn my back on you."
[00:47:50.740 --> 00:47:54.760]   And it all hinges on whether John, day after day,
[00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:56.240]   takes up his cross, dies to himself,
[00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:58.880]   says, "I'm gonna surrender to you again today, Lord.
[00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:00.700]   "I'm gonna walk with your people around me.
[00:48:00.700 --> 00:48:02.420]   "I'm not gonna chase the dreams of this world
[00:48:02.420 --> 00:48:03.840]   "and the pleasures of the world around me.
[00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:04.820]   "I'm not gonna chase materialism,
[00:48:04.820 --> 00:48:06.980]   "get in a bigger car, more money in my bank account,
[00:48:06.980 --> 00:48:09.260]   "whatever other lies the world around me is trying to sell.
[00:48:09.260 --> 00:48:10.760]   "I'm gonna walk in dependence on you, God.
[00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:12.760]   "That's the only way I have any shot."
[00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:16.600]   And in a moment, John, everything could fall apart,
[00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:17.500]   and he knows that.
[00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:19.720]   Do you know that?
[00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:23.080]   Do you know that the shambles around your life right now,
[00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:25.880]   and somebody in this room needs to hear me in this,
[00:48:25.880 --> 00:48:27.120]   you're not gonna be able to pick 'em up
[00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:28.420]   and put 'em back together.
[00:48:28.420 --> 00:48:32.320]   You can't do it, you're not strong enough.
[00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:33.360]   You don't have what it takes.
[00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:34.200]   There's a God who's there.
[00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:36.920]   If you'll open the sail of your life,
[00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:38.080]   surrender to him,
[00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:42.440]   will come in and lead you to a life and a place
[00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:45.200]   unlike anything you could even imagine.
[00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:46.680]   And you'll find purpose.
[00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:48.740]   You'll find life.
[00:48:48.740 --> 00:48:52.720]   And you'll find Jesus.
[00:48:53.720 --> 00:48:56.000]   So more than enough, he is enough.
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:58.760]   That's what life is about.
[00:48:58.760 --> 00:49:01.320]   If you've never trusted in Christ before,
[00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:02.160]   if you've never had a moment
[00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:03.600]   where you put your faith in him,
[00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:04.840]   tonight is your night.
[00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:09.240]   The last thing I'd wanna leave you with is don't drink.
[00:49:09.240 --> 00:49:12.160]   If you're numbing with alcohol to numb your pain,
[00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:13.440]   and you're like, "Dude, I don't believe in God,"
[00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:15.320]   you should drink more.
[00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:18.480]   You should drink, you shouldn't stop.
[00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:21.000]   That's what I would do if I didn't have the hope
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:23.080]   that is found only in Christ.
[00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:25.440]   You look at a world around us
[00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:27.280]   and all the brokenness that is there.
[00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:33.320]   If you can be sober and atheist,
[00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:34.540]   I'm confused.
[00:49:34.540 --> 00:49:37.320]   Because you don't have any hope.
[00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:41.240]   And you may tell yourself you do.
[00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:44.720]   You're not standing on anything that has hope.
[00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:48.840]   And Christ alone offers that.
[00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:51.640]   And maybe you are a Christian,
[00:49:51.640 --> 00:49:53.800]   and you look around and you're in shambles.
[00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:58.600]   Jesus, if you would surrender and walk with him,
[00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:02.200]   day by day offers to lead you
[00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:07.160]   to a life like you could only dream of.
[00:50:07.160 --> 00:50:09.240]   Let me pray.
[00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:12.760]   Father, thank you
[00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:17.280]   for the ways that you're at work in our life.
[00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:20.960]   Thank you that the vision you have for the Christian faith
[00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:23.600]   is so much bigger than don't drink beer.
[00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:26.360]   How pathetic of a dream vision goal would that be?
[00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:28.800]   But the vision you have for us
[00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:31.000]   is that we would experience abundant life.
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:33.440]   Thank you for the ways that you worked
[00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:35.140]   in my friend John's life.
[00:50:35.140 --> 00:50:39.160]   Would you continue to do so?
[00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:41.000]   Would you continue to do so in my life?
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:42.880]   Take ground in my heart in the places
[00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:48.000]   where I need more of your spirit to take more of my heart,
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:49.880]   and I need the things of Jesus to grow
[00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:51.480]   and the things of David to die.
[00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:53.360]   Father, for anyone in this room
[00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:56.620]   who's never accepted the free gift that you offer us
[00:50:56.620 --> 00:50:57.960]   by dying on the cross in our place
[00:50:57.960 --> 00:51:00.520]   to pay for our sin, past, present, and future,
[00:51:00.520 --> 00:51:03.060]   and rising again, the free gift,
[00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:06.240]   if they'll just accept and trust in that,
[00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:08.160]   would tonight be their night?
[00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:11.400]   Would you do what only you can do?
[00:51:11.400 --> 00:51:14.940]   Just move in their heart, move on their heart.
[00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:18.880]   Father, I pray for those of us who are evaluating,
[00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:21.720]   would you lead us to evaluate why am I drinking right now?
[00:51:21.720 --> 00:51:26.080]   And help us to be surrendered to the spirit of God,
[00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:29.720]   and would he fill our sails in this life
[00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:31.560]   through our dependence on him?
[00:51:31.560 --> 00:51:33.240]   We worship you now in song, amen.
[00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:43.240]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
