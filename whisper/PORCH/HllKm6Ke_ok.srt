1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,480
 (audience cheering)

2
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:04,240
 - All right, hey porch, why don't you join me

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,160
 as we read God's word together.

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,280
 From the book of 2 Timothy chapter one,

5
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,520
 verses one through 12.

6
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:15,040
 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus,

7
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,180
 by the will of God according to the promise

8
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:19,760
 of the life that is in Christ Jesus.

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,460
 To Timothy, my beloved child,

10
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:25,880
 grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father

11
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,900
 in Christ Jesus our Lord.

12
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,020
 I thank God whom I serve as did my ancestors

13
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:34,240
 with a clear conscience as I remember you constantly

14
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,680
 in my prayers night and day.

15
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,660
 As I remember your tears, I long to see you,

16
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,700
 that I may be filled with joy.

17
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,860
 I am reminded of your sincere faith,

18
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,920
 a faith that dwelt first in your grandmother Lois

19
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,080
 and your mother Eunice,

20
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:51,840
 and now I am sure dwells in you as well.

21
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,500
 For this reason, I remind you to fan into flame

22
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,040
 the gift of God which is in you

23
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,120
 through the laying on of my hands.

24
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,000
 For God gave us a spirit not of fear,

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,880
 but of power and love and self-control.

26
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,400
 Therefore, do not be ashamed of the testimony

27
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,320
 about our Lord, nor of me his prisoner,

28
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,800
 but share in suffering for the gospel

29
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,280
 by the power of God, who saved us

30
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,500
 and called us to a holy calling,

31
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,120
 not because of our works,

32
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,680
 but because of his own purpose and grace,

33
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,640
 which he gave us in Christ Jesus before the ages began,

34
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,960
 and which now has been manifested

35
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,560
 through the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus,

36
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,260
 who abolished death and brought life and immortality

37
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:39,360
 to light through the gospel,

38
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,920
 for which I was appointed a preacher and apostle

39
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:46,160
 and teacher, which is why I suffer as I do.

40
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:50,020
 But I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed,

41
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,620
 and I am convinced that he is able to guard

42
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:56,760
 until that day what has been entrusted to me.

43
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:00,120
 Now, for our first message in 2 Timothy.

44
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:04,200
 (audience cheering)

45
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,560
 - All right, Porch, how we doing tonight?

46
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,400
 We doing okay?

47
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,400
 (audience cheering)

48
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,080
 It's great to see you, welcome back.

49
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,120
 If you've been here before, we're so glad

50
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,720
 that you would continue to give up your Tuesday night.

51
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,540
 If this is your very first time in the room,

52
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,180
 you picked a great evening to join us

53
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,040
 because we are kicking off a brand new series tonight

54
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,720
 that I cannot wait to get into.

55
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,440
 But before we do, it just feels right for us to pray.

56
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,400
 I'm gonna take a moment and I'm gonna pray for us

57
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,920
 and then we'll dive headlong into this.

58
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,080
 God, thanks for tonight.

59
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:39,080
 Lord, I feel a deep sense of mine and our need

60
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,800
 for you in this moment, God.

61
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,040
 These people, they do not need me, Lord.

62
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,360
 They do not need the porch, God, they need you.

63
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,520
 And then God, not only do we need you,

64
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,600
 but God, we're here and we're saying to you,

65
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,120
 we want you, God.

66
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,840
 Like we wanna be connected to something

67
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,320
 that is big and bold and beautiful,

68
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,640
 and God, that thing is you.

69
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:04,000
 And so hear us here now that God, we want you in this place.

70
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,840
 If you agree with those words that God,

71
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,040
 we need you and we want you, would you just,

72
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,440
 in the quietness of where you are, tell him that.

73
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,280
 God, I need you.

74
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,320
 Maybe tell him what you need him for.

75
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:20,080
 In the quietness of where you are,

76
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,520
 maybe you're here and you're wanting for more of him.

77
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,440
 Tell him that and why you're wanting for more of him.

78
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:33,120
 God, we know you're worthy of wanting,

79
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,400
 you're necessary for needing,

80
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,720
 and we're a people who are united by those things.

81
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,960
 So meet with us now, please, we pray.

82
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,480
 In Jesus' name, amen.

83
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,240
 Well, when Brooke and I visited Rome several years ago,

84
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,320
 we did as the Romans do,

85
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:51,680
 and we made sure to hit all the hot spots along the way.

86
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,920
 We checked out the Colosseum, we walked the Roman Forum,

87
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,280
 we went to the Pantheon,

88
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,000
 we made sure to go by the gelato shop.

89
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,480
 We did what any regular tourist would do,

90
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,760
 and yet of all the places that we hit,

91
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:08,200
 there was one place that stood out above the rest for me,

92
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,280
 that before we left Italy,

93
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,880
 we made sure, though it was our last destination,

94
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,840
 it would be the most meaningful destination,

95
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,800
 and yet it would not only strike you

96
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,720
 as a typical tourist destination,

97
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,400
 because it is this little tiny building

98
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,800
 known as Mamertine Prison.

99
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,400
 Now, you probably hear that and think, prison.

100
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,400
 I guess we'll never travel together,

101
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,060
 because you and I have very different ideas

102
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,120
 about what travel looks like.

103
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,400
 It doesn't look like going to prison,

104
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,880
 it actually looks like trying to go on vacation,

105
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,160
 and yet what you need to know about this prison

106
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,440
 is this prison is not your normal prison.

107
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,240
 It's a curious little place,

108
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,160
 because it's not a place for common criminals.

109
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,840
 You see, in the Roman Empire,

110
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,640
 it would have been a place for the empire's own enemies.

111
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,600
 It's not a variety of cell blocks,

112
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,280
 it's not multiple cell doors,

113
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,640
 it's actually just one cell,

114
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,920
 and that cell was reserved for those

115
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,480
 that were either awaiting trial

116
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,160
 or awaiting their own execution,

117
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:07,280
 and it is this cell that is pictured behind me

118
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,640
 that the Apostle Paul sat in himself

119
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,520
 as he awaited his own execution,

120
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:18,360
 and it's within this cell that he penned his last

121
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,800
 and his most personal letter.

122
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,040
 He penned a letter to his young protÃ©gÃ©,

123
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,200
 he penned a letter to Timothy,

124
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,160
 and I remember as I walked into the cell,

125
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,760
 the reason it struck me so powerfully

126
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,120
 is I was within its walls

127
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,520
 and I crouched within Paul's own place,

128
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:40,160
 I opened that letter, I read 2 Timothy to myself,

129
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,240
 and as I read those words, a thought struck me.

130
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:51,200
 Paul, you lived an impactful life,

131
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:55,440
 and yet this cell is a testament

132
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,080
 to the fact that your life ended,

133
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,400
 but the gospel didn't.

134
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,800
 The gospel, it didn't die in this cell alongside you,

135
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,560
 it pushed forward, it carried on,

136
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,800
 it pressed ahead, and it begged the question for me,

137
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,080
 how did that happen?

138
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,480
 I'll tell you how it happened.

139
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:19,080
 It happened because a young man, a young leader,

140
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,280
 someone like you in their 20s and 30s

141
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,120
 heard the call from Paul,

142
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,440
 and he rose up, stood his ground,

143
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,200
 embraced responsibility for the gospel,

144
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,040
 and he continued that work

145
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,720
 that has made the difference in your own world.

146
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,720
 You see, that letter was written to a young man,

147
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,000
 a man by the name of Timothy,

148
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,120
 and Timothy knew, my time is now,

149
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,520
 my turn has come, and I am praying, Porch,

150
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,680
 that we, as young people like Timothy,

151
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,960
 would realize our time has come

152
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,640
 and our turn is now,

153
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,680
 and I'm hoping we will embrace the call

154
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,960
 the same way he did,

155
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,880
 because I don't know if you've noticed,

156
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,120
 but our spiritual heroes of the faith,

157
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,920
 they aren't getting any younger.

158
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:10,360
 Like, you can just look back over the last decade,

159
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,640
 and we have lost great names,

160
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,600
 the names of people like J.I. Packer and Tim Keller

161
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,360
 and R.C. Sproul and Charles Stanley and Billy Graham,

162
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,760
 and I could go on and on,

163
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,400
 but we have lost so many heroes of the faith,

164
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,440
 and yet, though their lives have ended,

165
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,920
 the gospel must not.

166
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,320
 The gospel must continue forward.

167
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:33,400
 The question, though, that is confronting us here tonight

168
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,840
 is the same question that confronted me there in that cell

169
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,200
 as I crouched down against its wet floor.

170
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,680
 Who is going to go with it?

171
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,960
 Who will carry the work ahead?

172
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,560
 And I'll just level with you.

173
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,600
 I'm hoping it's me.

174
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,320
 I'm hoping it's you.

175
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,200
 Like, I'm hoping it is us,

176
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,640
 that God looks upon people like us

177
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,680
 within our generation, for our generation,

178
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,280
 and for every generation to come

179
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,680
 to be the people that see the people

180
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,560
 that see the movement of God from eternity past

181
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,520
 and grab hold of it and carry it into eternity ahead.

182
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,160
 That's what I'm hoping for,

183
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:13,120
 which begs the question, how do we do that?

184
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,440
 Well, that's what this entire letter is about.

185
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:20,720
 You see, famously, people's final words,

186
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,080
 their own swan song, often impart the most important things

187
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,240
 that they want to communicate,

188
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,440
 and in this letter, we see some of those things

189
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,480
 from the Apostle Paul.

190
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:32,480
 He wants to tell you how you can accept the call,

191
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,720
 you can embrace the responsibility,

192
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:39,280
 you can take the baton, you can carry the gospel,

193
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:43,720
 but before he tells you all the activities you need to do,

194
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,640
 he wants to tell you the attitude

195
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,300
 with which you need to do it.

196
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,780
 That's where the whole letter opens up.

197
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:52,600
 That's why Hunter read us through those first 12 verses,

198
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,320
 because it introduces to us a mentality,

199
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,040
 an outlook, a mindset that we need to have,

200
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,000
 an attitude we must adopt

201
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,440
 if we're going to be a part of this work.

202
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:05,320
 So if you have a Bible, turn with me to 2 Timothy.

203
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:09,440
 As you're doing that, let me just say this from the get-go.

204
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,920
 Some of you are here and you're like,

205
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,680
 dude, you are intense, and I'm not a Christian.

206
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,760
 I am here just checking things out.

207
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,200
 We're checking him or her out,

208
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,760
 and I did not know necessarily

209
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,360
 that you were gonna be coming on so strong,

210
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,720
 and yet let me just say,

211
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,360
 this evening is an interesting evening,

212
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,920
 because while every single Tuesday

213
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,760
 we try to open the scriptures in a way

214
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,600
 that appeals broadly to all people,

215
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,760
 this chapter is very specifically written

216
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,140
 to the family of God.

217
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:40,940
 And so I'm gonna be speaking most specifically to believers,

218
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,560
 but if you're here and you don't know Jesus,

219
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,120
 let me just encourage you with this.

220
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:47,600
 Jesus has something for you here tonight too.

221
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,160
 So let's look into what Paul has to say

222
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,520
 as he writes to his young protege.

223
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,000
 We're gonna pick it up in verse six.

224
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,960
 Paul begins, I mean, he says through the first few verses

225
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,680
 who he is and then who Timothy is,

226
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,680
 and I love that he identifies Timothy specifically

227
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,780
 within verse five that he has a sincere faith,

228
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,240
 which means it's not a hypocritical faith.

229
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,800
 It's not a faith that saves face.

230
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,840
 It's not put on to others like him.

231
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,840
 Instead, it is a faith of genuity.

232
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,400
 And then as we keep going, it gets into six,

233
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,240
 and it says this.

234
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,800
 "For this reason, I remind you, Timothy," or believer,

235
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,320
 "to fan into flame the gift of God,

236
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,380
 "which is in you through the laying on of my hands.

237
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:29,880
 "For God gave us a spirit not of fear,

238
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:34,080
 "but of power and love and self-control."

239
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,880
 Now out of the gate, there's some debate

240
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,640
 around what Paul means when he says,

241
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,320
 "Fan into flame the gift of God

242
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,320
 "that is in you through the laying on of my hands."

243
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,640
 Some commentators, they read that

244
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,720
 as an individual interpretation

245
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,200
 that Paul is telling Timothy,

246
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,080
 "Hey, I want you to fan into flame

247
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:53,420
 "the God-given gifts that are specific to you.

248
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,860
 "You're a pastor, and so you need to work on your teaching

249
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:58,160
 "and your preaching and your leading and your shepherding."

250
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,000
 And so Timothy, you get to work on those things.

251
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,640
 You see, they look at Timothy

252
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:05,040
 like he's the guy in high school sports

253
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,480
 that has all this raw potential,

254
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,560
 but he has none of the work ethic to actually seize it.

255
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,400
 They're telling him,

256
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,440
 "Hey, you need to get after it, Timothy."

257
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,280
 And yet what we know is while there is some good argument

258
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,600
 that that would be true, that's not the only argument.

259
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,760
 In fact, I think there's a better argument

260
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,660
 for what he means when he says,

261
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,900
 "Fan into flame the gift of God."

262
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:23,960
 What does he mean then?

263
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,040
 Well, I think he tells us in verse seven.

264
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:31,040
 He says, "For God gave us, aka gifted us,

265
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,800
 "a spirit not of fear."

266
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,100
 So what's the gift then?

267
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:41,180
 "He has gifted us a spirit of courage.

268
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:45,140
 "He has gifted us, you, brother, sister,

269
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:48,840
 "a spirit of courage,

270
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:52,120
 "which is why we must kindle the flame of courage."

271
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,620
 That's your first point.

272
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,700
 We must kindle the flame of courage.

273
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,180
 Like that's the attitude

274
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,420
 that God wants his people to walk with.

275
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:03,380
 That's the manner in which we move.

276
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:06,620
 But notice courage is given from God,

277
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,020
 which implies something really important.

278
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:11,500
 It implies that courage is not your factory setting.

279
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,020
 Like it's not your default mentality.

280
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,860
 Fear is.

281
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:20,320
 Fear is the default setting for people that do not know God.

282
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,660
 And we get that because we're all tyrannized

283
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:23,820
 by some kind of fear.

284
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:26,780
 Fear of the future, fear of failure, fear of man,

285
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:29,100
 fear of the outsider, fear of death,

286
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,140
 fear of not being enough.

287
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:32,900
 Whatever it is, you can name your fear for yourself.

288
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:37,220
 That is your default mode until Jesus.

289
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,820
 But then Jesus steps into your story

290
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,220
 and he changes everything.

291
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:42,260
 And as he changes everything,

292
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:45,340
 he moves you from a mentality of fear

293
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:48,140
 and into a mentality of courage,

294
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,860
 which is really important to understand.

295
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:55,820
 Because as he gives you a spirit of courage,

296
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:58,540
 that insinuates something so important.

297
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:00,060
 And I want you to catch this

298
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,020
 'cause I think you're gonna want it.

299
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:04,020
 He gives you a spirit of courage

300
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:07,740
 because he does not intend for you

301
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:11,060
 to live a lame Christianity.

302
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:14,060
 He gives you a spirit of courage

303
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:19,060
 because his future for you is not small nor insignificant.

304
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,660
 He gives you a spirit of courage

305
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:26,340
 because he wants a future that is big and it is bold instead.

306
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,820
 That is his intent for your life.

307
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:31,340
 He wants you to have a courage

308
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:33,820
 that moves past low risk environments

309
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,980
 and steps into high risk environments

310
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,860
 because that's what courage is needed for.

311
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,460
 Like no one needs courage to tell their mom, hello.

312
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:43,980
 But fellas, you need courage to tell her hello.

313
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,260
 You know, like that's different.

314
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:46,660
 There's a different level of risks there.

315
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,820
 And what we know is that the higher the risk,

316
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,380
 the higher the reward.

317
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:53,060
 And so if Jesus is calling you into a life

318
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:57,060
 where courage must be your default setting, your mentality,

319
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,700
 what that insinuates is, yes, okay,

320
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,740
 there's going to be some risk,

321
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:05,100
 but there's also gonna be some reward.

322
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:08,260
 There's going to be something in my journey with him

323
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:10,940
 through this life that is going to be fulfilling,

324
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,340
 that's going to be meaningful,

325
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:13,740
 that's going to be worthwhile.

326
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,260
 And we all want that.

327
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,380
 You want that.

328
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,860
 I know you do 'cause I talk to you

329
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:21,220
 every single week down front or out in that coffee shop

330
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,660
 that you walk through people that want to leave a legacy

331
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,460
 and make a difference and change the world

332
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:26,460
 and find fulfillment.

333
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:29,060
 That's what young adults want.

334
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:31,860
 And the amazing thing that Paul is telling us

335
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:36,260
 as God gives you a gift through the spirit of courage

336
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:41,620
 is he wants that for you more than you want that for yourself.

337
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:44,420
 He's looking at you and he's like,

338
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:46,260
 oh, you want to leave a legacy?

339
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,300
 You want to change the world?

340
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,340
 You want to find fulfillment?

341
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:51,140
 I want that for you more than you want that for yourself.

342
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:54,300
 And yet here's the issue.

343
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:57,780
 If we're in agreement, God, why then isn't that my reality?

344
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:02,860
 Because we're not as courageous as we think.

345
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:09,020
 We're not as courageous as we think.

346
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:13,100
 You see, we set great goals,

347
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:16,540
 but what we fail to realize in view of our great goals

348
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:19,020
 is that those great goals actually fall short

349
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,380
 of the greatness of God

350
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:23,140
 and the goals he would set for your life instead.

351
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:25,380
 And so what we do is rather than focusing

352
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:29,060
 on changing eternity, we focus on changing the world.

353
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:33,940
 Rather than working to leave behind a spiritual legacy,

354
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:37,700
 we just focus on leaving behind a physical legacy.

355
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,620
 When we could be making a difference forever,

356
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:43,460
 instead we just focus on making a difference today.

357
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,300
 I'm not saying that those things are not good,

358
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,860
 but I am saying those things are not of God.

359
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:52,860
 God wants your life to be purposed into something

360
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:56,980
 that transcends the barriers of our time

361
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:01,100
 and extends into the future forever.

362
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,540
 That's the kind of greatness he's calling you into.

363
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:06,860
 That's the sort of courage he has given you for.

364
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:11,900
 John Shedd says, "A ship in harbor is safe,

365
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,980
 "but that's not what ships are built for."

366
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:18,100
 Some of you hear that and you're like, "Yes, I want that.

367
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,460
 "I wanna set out onto the open ocean.

368
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,180
 "I wanna raise my sail.

369
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:23,380
 "I wanna catch the wind.

370
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,660
 "I want to voyage into the future."

371
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:29,420
 And yet often what we know is we dream dreams

372
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,460
 that often are too small for God

373
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,500
 because we fear looking odd or different

374
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,340
 or strange or weird in the eyes of the world.

375
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:39,020
 And because we do, hear me,

376
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:42,260
 we settle for the creature comforts

377
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:44,740
 of a casual Christian life

378
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:50,100
 when the radical reward of a courageous life

379
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,940
 is waiting for you instead.

380
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:55,900
 That's why we have to fan the flame.

381
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,340
 That's why we have to keep the fire.

382
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:59,900
 That's why we have to cultivate our courage

383
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,940
 because while God has given us the gift,

384
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,980
 it's our job to keep the gift.

385
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:05,900
 So how do we do that?

386
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,420
 How do you keep your fire burning?

387
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:10,180
 Well, I'll put it very simply,

388
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:11,300
 though there's a lot that we could say,

389
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,740
 I would just simply tell you

390
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,820
 what we believe in our family, Brooke and I,

391
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:19,900
 that you just say yes to whatever God asks.

392
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,100
 That's it.

393
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,340
 You just say yes to whatever God asks.

394
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:26,780
 We have a family motto that we wanna live our lives

395
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:29,060
 on the cutting edge of faith,

396
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:31,300
 which just means we wanna live

397
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,020
 where the fighting is fiercest.

398
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,780
 We know we wanna be in a place

399
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,980
 where God has to be greatest.

400
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:39,340
 If we're in a place of life

401
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:40,740
 where God is not required to move,

402
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,980
 why would we wanna be there?

403
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,820
 We wanna be where God has to make himself known

404
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:49,340
 to be exactly who he says he is.

405
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:54,340
 And so we say yes to him as often as possible.

406
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:57,020
 Now, those yeses look different

407
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,940
 over the course of our lives.

408
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,740
 Like they've looked small and they've looked big

409
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:01,740
 and they've looked peculiar

410
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,740
 and they've looked uncertain at different times.

411
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:07,060
 I mean, it's looked as small as just going across the street

412
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:10,180
 and watering the widow neighbor's plants.

413
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:14,980
 It's looked as personal as taking our guest bedroom

414
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:17,260
 and opening it up and inviting a girl

415
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,500
 who'd been kicked out from her family

416
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,900
 to live with us for a season

417
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:22,620
 until she could get her feet back underneath her.

418
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:26,500
 It looked as unpredictable as leaving community

419
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,420
 and stepping away from our city and journeying someplace

420
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,900
 we never thought we would live

421
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:35,500
 because there was no ministry there that needed to be there.

422
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:40,340
 You just say yes to God.

423
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:42,860
 Now, I'm not putting us up here as the example to follow.

424
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:45,700
 We have said no far too many times

425
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:48,460
 and every single no we have lived to regret.

426
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:52,540
 And so I'm imploring you don't say no

427
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:56,180
 when God is asking you to say yes.

428
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:59,540
 So where's he asking you for your yes tonight?

429
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:02,940
 Like, is it finally to come clean

430
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:06,200
 of the last 2% of your sin struggle

431
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,140
 that you've been hiding away and keeping in the dark

432
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:09,500
 because you don't know what people will think of you

433
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,700
 if you actually come forward about it all?

434
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,500
 Is it yes to joining region

435
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,180
 and actually working through your past

436
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:19,340
 as opposed to ignoring that that thing happened

437
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:20,580
 and as long as I don't look at it,

438
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:21,980
 I don't have to remember it?

439
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:27,900
 Is it yes to talking to your coworker about Jesus?

440
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,760
 And I don't mean talking to them in a way

441
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,060
 where you're trying to intellectually armbar them

442
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:34,620
 into submitting into devotion to Christ.

443
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:37,160
 I'm talking to you about visiting with them in a way

444
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:40,720
 where you just ask them, hey, what do you think of God?

445
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,440
 And then letting the conversation flow naturally

446
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,760
 and visiting with them about the person of Jesus.

447
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,180
 Like, is it saying yes to writing a letter

448
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:49,240
 and building a bridge with that estranged sibling,

449
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,040
 brother, sister that you haven't spoken to

450
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:54,320
 in weeks, months, even years?

451
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,500
 Maybe it's yes to answering Tyler's call

452
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,960
 and filling out an application

453
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,340
 and joining us here at The Porch

454
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:02,400
 and leveraging your life for a cause

455
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,240
 that is bigger than yours.

456
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,160
 I'm not talking about the cause of The Porch,

457
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,320
 I'm talking about the cause of the kingdom.

458
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,240
 There is a yes that God is asking of you,

459
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:13,080
 so why wouldn't you say yes to it?

460
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:17,200
 Because listen to me, Noah, he said yes to building an ark

461
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,800
 when the earth had never rained.

462
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:25,120
 And God used his family in the process of recreation.

463
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,380
 Abraham said yes to following God

464
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:29,960
 when he didn't even know where God was taking him.

465
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,800
 And it was through Abraham

466
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:37,080
 that he became the father of many nations.

467
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:41,300
 Moses said yes to confronting Pharaoh.

468
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:45,240
 And God, he performed signs and wonders

469
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:49,160
 as he delivered his own people out of Egypt.

470
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,920
 Ruth said yes to Naomi,

471
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:54,400
 and God made her the ancestral mother to the Messiah.

472
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,680
 David said yes to facing Goliath,

473
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:59,720
 and God made him king over his people.

474
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:02,280
 Elijah said yes to confronting the prophets of Baal,

475
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,360
 and God sent fire from heaven.

476
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:07,440
 And best of all, Jesus said yes to the cross

477
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,800
 when no man in his right mind would have.

478
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,200
 And yet because he said yes,

479
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,580
 God raised him in victory over sin and death.

480
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:18,520
 Why don't you say yes?

481
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:22,800
 It's through your yes

482
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,680
 that you kindle the flame of your courage.

483
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,880
 You cultivate the gift God has given.

484
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,120
 You see, you believe big about God.

485
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,200
 You believe big about God,

486
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:38,240
 and then you say yes to putting yourself in positions

487
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,200
 where he becomes big as a result.

488
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:46,460
 And when you do, that changes everything

489
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:48,120
 about the way you lead your life.

490
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:53,740
 It leads you to not just move through this world casually,

491
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:56,880
 but it leads you to embrace opportunity,

492
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,780
 even if it is risky,

493
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,920
 which is what Paul goes on to say next.

494
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,720
 He tells us in verse eight,

495
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,000
 "Therefore, because God has given you a spirit of courage,

496
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,120
 "do not be ashamed of the testimony about our Lord,

497
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,520
 "nor of me, his prisoner, but share in suffering

498
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:13,000
 "for the gospel by the power of God."

499
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 So we've already clarified that God has given you a courage

500
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,160
 that's going to lead you into a life that is rewarding,

501
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,800
 but it will require risk.

502
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,720
 And Paul tells you right here,

503
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,440
 "Hey, it's gonna require two risks of you very specifically.

504
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:30,920
 "It's not isolated to these two and these two alone,

505
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:33,440
 "but it certainly will be these two and these two alone."

506
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,880
 And I love the two that Paul gives us

507
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,960
 because it shows that Paul, he knows his audience.

508
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,600
 He understands Christians very well

509
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,640
 because he actually points to the two risks

510
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,640
 that we're often most gun-shy about

511
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,080
 when it comes to our faith.

512
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,640
 Telling people about Jesus

513
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:51,400
 and suffering well whenever hardship comes.

514
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,120
 Those are the two things that Paul does.

515
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:54,960
 Why would he do that?

516
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,400
 Why would he say this?

517
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,240
 Because Paul knows your second point,

518
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,380
 courageous faith is uncensored faith.

519
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,200
 Courageous faith is uncensored faith.

520
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,160
 Like courageous faith,

521
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,240
 it's unashamed of what other people think

522
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:12,640
 and it is unafraid of any difficulty ahead.

523
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,880
 So I was thinking about how to illustrate this to you.

524
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,480
 And I just thought, okay, if you're a sports fan,

525
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,600
 you're gonna understand this more than likely.

526
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,880
 And if you're a Cowboys fan,

527
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,240
 you're gonna understand this most definitely

528
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:26,480
 because every single season without fail,

529
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,280
 we are unashamed of where our loyalty lies.

530
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,300
 We didn't buy this, right?

531
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:33,560
 Like we step up and we say, hey, this is who we are.

532
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:36,120
 And yet though we're unashamed of where our loyalty lies,

533
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,160
 we're also unafraid of the consequences

534
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,120
 of following these guys

535
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,680
 because year after year after year after year,

536
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,080
 they don't ever seem to pan out the way

537
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,520
 that we're hoping they would.

538
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,760
 Here's the thing though.

539
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:49,800
 The difference between Jesus and the Cowboys

540
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,040
 is Jesus is undefeated.

541
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,480
 (congregation cheering)

542
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:56,200
 Jesus has never lost.

543
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,800
 He has only ever won,

544
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,480
 which means you have no reason

545
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,560
 to censor any part of your faith.

546
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,880
 So why would you do it?

547
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:06,840
 Well, why do you censor anything?

548
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:09,120
 You censor something

549
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,360
 because you think that something is inappropriate,

550
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,520
 which means if you're censoring your faith,

551
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:18,960
 you think Jesus is inappropriate.

552
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,320
 You look at him and say, hold on,

553
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,840
 this wouldn't be right for this moment.

554
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,980
 Like I'm at the office and so I need to censor you

555
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,120
 because it would feel inappropriate

556
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,080
 to jeopardize my working relationships

557
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,360
 when in reality all you're doing

558
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,260
 is you're jeopardizing their eternity.

559
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:38,240
 You censor him when you're out with your friends

560
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,080
 because man, it feels inappropriate

561
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,240
 to kind of impose my Christian convictions

562
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,720
 and spoil all of the fun,

563
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,120
 even though those same Christian convictions

564
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,720
 are trying to save you from the guilt and the regret

565
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,820
 you know you're gonna feel in the morning.

566
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,880
 You censor him from your social media

567
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,720
 because it feels inappropriate to risk your image

568
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,120
 to your followers when in reality,

569
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,560
 what you're doing is you're risking your witness

570
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,240
 to all of your followers.

571
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,240
 This is the crazy thing.

572
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,840
 Jesus never censored himself for you.

573
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:19,680
 He was willing to be 100% of who he said he was,

574
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:23,480
 the son of God, and he was willing to do 100%

575
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:28,480
 of what he said he would do, die for your sins.

576
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,100
 And that is truly inappropriate.

577
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:39,760
 And yet he was willing to live uncensored

578
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,100
 in his fidelity for you.

579
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:45,920
 So that way now, because we have believed

580
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:50,700
 in a God who saves, we can live unashamedly

581
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:53,780
 with fidelity to him.

582
00:25:53,780 --> 00:26:00,940
 We don't have to care what anyone thinks

583
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:04,140
 because we already know what God thinks.

584
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:06,780
 And we don't have to be afraid

585
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:10,220
 because we already know how the story ends.

586
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:12,940
 Jesus tells us in John 16, 33,

587
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,740
 "I have said these things to you,

588
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,580
 "that in me you may have peace."

589
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:17,420
 Why, Jesus?

590
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:19,620
 "Because in the world, you'll have tribulation.

591
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:20,980
 "You will have trouble.

592
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:24,180
 "But take heart, I've overcome the world."

593
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,580
 Paul says it later when he writes

594
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:27,700
 to the church at Corinth, 2 Corinthians 4, 16, 17.

595
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:30,500
 "So we do not lose heart.

596
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,540
 "Though our outer self is wasting away,

597
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:36,040
 "our inner self is being renewed day by day.

598
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,860
 "For this light momentary affliction

599
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,860
 "is preparing for us," what?

600
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:42,620
 "An eternal," not a temporal,

601
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:47,140
 "but an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison."

602
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:50,980
 Listen, Christian, you and I should never believe

603
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,540
 that trouble isn't coming.

604
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:56,100
 The Bible has said far too much

605
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,300
 to convince us that it will.

606
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,820
 We should never believe that trouble isn't coming,

607
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:04,160
 but we should always believe that hope isn't far behind.

608
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:08,780
 That's why when, not if, but when trouble does come,

609
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:09,900
 we don't lose heart.

610
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,940
 So listen to me.

611
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:17,460
 If you fear that you won't have a future

612
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:20,660
 because of what you did in the past,

613
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:23,040
 in Christ, you have hope,

614
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,860
 because shame doesn't get to write the end of your story.

615
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:29,900
 If you're suffering because you have some chronic pain

616
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:32,980
 or some mental illness or some body shame,

617
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:35,280
 in Christ, you have hope,

618
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:38,140
 because he has promised to replace your mortal body

619
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:39,900
 with a heavenly one.

620
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:43,980
 If you lose your family, your friends,

621
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:47,200
 your loved ones out of your allegiance to Jesus,

622
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,460
 then in Christ, you have hope,

623
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:50,860
 because it is through him that we have new family,

624
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:52,900
 we have new friends, we have new loved ones.

625
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:55,220
 It's through him that we have us.

626
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:59,920
 You have hope, which I know as I say that,

627
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:03,860
 for those of you in this room that are suffering right now

628
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:07,380
 and that have been suffering for a long time,

629
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:10,600
 you nonetheless wonder, okay, I get that,

630
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,980
 I understand that I'm going to suffer.

631
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:16,020
 In fact, I know that I will 'cause I am already,

632
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:18,740
 but why, Jesus, must I suffer?

633
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:21,180
 I'll tell you why.

634
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:24,340
 Because it is in your suffering,

635
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:27,560
 not your strength, that Jesus saves.

636
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:32,360
 It's in your suffering, not your strength,

637
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,740
 that Jesus saves.

638
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:38,740
 It's by suffering that we comfort one another.

639
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:40,980
 That's what 2 Corinthians 1, 3, 4 says.

640
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:43,140
 It says, "Blessed be the God and the Father

641
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:45,800
 "of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies,

642
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,540
 "and the God of all comfort,

643
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:49,200
 "who comforts us in," what?

644
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,400
 "In our affliction, so that we may be able

645
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,300
 "to comfort those who are in any affliction

646
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,000
 "with the comfort with which we ourselves

647
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,060
 "are comforted by God."

648
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:01,400
 Do you hear that?

649
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,640
 You're more capable of comforting people

650
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,600
 because of your suffering than you are apart from it.

651
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:10,180
 This is why vulnerability begets vulnerability,

652
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:13,420
 and courage is contagious, according to Brene Brown.

653
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:14,660
 We were talking, Brooke and I,

654
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:16,660
 over the course of the weekend with our nanny, Lauren,

655
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:18,780
 and she was unpacking some of the highlights

656
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:20,220
 of her time at LAUNCH.

657
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,920
 And as she was kind of running through the list

658
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,340
 of all the things that she got to experience,

659
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,960
 the thing that kind of topped all of them

660
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:28,060
 was this evening that she had with the girls

661
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:29,420
 in her group late at night,

662
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:32,100
 and they just started sharing their stories with one another.

663
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,540
 They just started speaking honestly with one another.

664
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:36,100
 And the reason that evening was so significant

665
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,540
 is because as they started sharing about themselves,

666
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:39,620
 and not just the best of themselves,

667
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:40,540
 but the worst of themselves,

668
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:42,180
 the hardest things of themselves,

669
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:47,180
 what they found is that it began to comfort one another.

670
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:52,860
 You see, in Christ, wounding can be wonderful.

671
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,340
 Bruising can be a blessing,

672
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:59,060
 because those things actually become a bonding agent for us.

673
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:00,140
 And so many of you get that.

674
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:02,180
 Like, you have been in places where someone looked up

675
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:03,500
 and was like, "Yeah, man, I struggle with porn."

676
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:06,340
 You're like, "Dude, I thought no one would ever say it,

677
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:07,840
 "but me too.

678
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,220
 "Yeah, I'm bulimic, me too."

679
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:14,780
 You've been in that place.

680
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:19,660
 You've heard someone identify their deepest pain,

681
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:22,180
 that thing they would hide furthest away,

682
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:23,920
 and yet they bring it into the light,

683
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:27,860
 and as they do, you feel comforted by it.

684
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:31,740
 You see, suffering can save,

685
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:34,220
 but it doesn't just do that.

686
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:37,180
 It's by suffering that others see Christ as sufficient.

687
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:39,300
 It's by suffering that others see Christ as sufficient.

688
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,780
 2 Corinthians 12:10 tells us,

689
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:43,580
 "For the sake of Christ, then I'm content with," what?

690
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,580
 "With weaknesses and insults and hardships

691
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,120
 "and persecutions and calamities.

692
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,380
 "For when I'm weak, then I'm strong."

693
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:53,940
 Listen, do you know how compelling it is to people

694
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:56,420
 when they know what's happening in your life?

695
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:58,580
 Like nothing's going right, everything's going wrong,

696
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:01,740
 and yet you're okay?

697
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,900
 That's so confusing to them.

698
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,860
 It's so confounding, it's so perplexing.

699
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:07,980
 They're like, "Hold on, this doesn't make any sense.

700
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,660
 "How are you so stable?

701
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:11,140
 "How are you so secure?

702
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:12,980
 "How are you so strong?"

703
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:15,640
 It leaves them wondering what you have

704
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:18,520
 that they and the rest of the world does not.

705
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:25,000
 And then it compels them to understand you have Jesus,

706
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,100
 and they need him too.

707
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:30,340
 And then lastly, suffering saves

708
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:33,220
 because it's by suffering that Jesus makes himself known.

709
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:38,220
 Jesus, he suffered for our sake.

710
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:42,340
 And so if you follow him, you get to suffer.

711
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:44,300
 Notice you get to, not have to,

712
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:47,560
 you get to suffer for the sake of others.

713
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:54,360
 And that also is wildly perplexing.

714
00:31:55,800 --> 00:32:00,800
 They wonder like, "Why would you give me money?

715
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,520
 "Like you've been saving up for that car,

716
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,820
 "for that trip, for that remodel,

717
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:08,320
 "and yet you've given me whatever it was you were saving

718
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,620
 "because you heard I had a need?

719
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:10,820
 "Why would you do that?

720
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:12,200
 "Why would you forgive me

721
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,600
 "when I've been nothing but difficult for you?

722
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,220
 "Why would you be kind to me

723
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:18,340
 "when I've only ever been hateful to you?

724
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:20,240
 "Why would you comfort me

725
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:24,700
 "when all I've ever been is indifferent towards you?"

726
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:30,640
 And then they learn, "Oh, it's because you know Jesus.

727
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:35,320
 "It's because you know a man

728
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:40,180
 "who initiated towards the unlovable,

729
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:43,120
 "who pursued the undesirable,

730
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,560
 "who saved the unforgivable.

731
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:49,180
 "That's how.

732
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:51,860
 "It's not you, it's him.

733
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:54,680
 "And it's him through you now."

734
00:32:55,580 --> 00:33:00,380
 You see, suffering can save,

735
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:04,300
 which means fear isn't our future, friends.

736
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:06,340
 Like if you know Jesus, that's not your future.

737
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:08,500
 Freedom is instead.

738
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:09,860
 And because that's the case,

739
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:13,200
 that's why we don't have to blur our beliefs for people,

740
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,200
 and we don't have to censor our faith for others.

741
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,180
 Like we know we can speak plainly,

742
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:19,620
 and we can share openly,

743
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:21,620
 and we can suffer peacefully

744
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:24,660
 because Jesus has made all of that possible.

745
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:29,660
 We have been given a gift of courage,

746
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:33,100
 and that changes everything about the way we move.

747
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:36,180
 Now, does that mean it's always gonna be easy?

748
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,620
 For sure not.

749
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,460
 There's nothing easy about the Christian life.

750
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:40,420
 And Paul knows that.

751
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:42,120
 Like he's gonna actually tell Timothy,

752
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,080
 "Hey, I know that you have the gift of courage,

753
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,000
 "but I also feel like you need some confidence

754
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,380
 "to boost that courage."

755
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:48,500
 And so listen to what he says.

756
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,260
 He says, in these final four verses

757
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:51,520
 that we're gonna read together, 9 through 12,

758
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:54,440
 he says, "God saved us, and he called us

759
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,940
 "to a holy calling, not because of our works,

760
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:59,260
 "but because of his own purpose and grace,

761
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:02,560
 "which he gave us in Christ Jesus before the ages began,

762
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,400
 "and which now is being manifested

763
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,660
 "through the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus,

764
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:08,860
 "who abolished death and brought life and immortality

765
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:09,920
 "to life through the gospel,

766
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,080
 "for which I was appointed a preacher and an apostle

767
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:15,220
 "and a teacher, which is why I suffer as I do."

768
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,620
 It's a mouthful.

769
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:18,460
 Paul has a little bit of a run-on sentence

770
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:21,520
 'cause he gets so excited that he finishes by saying,

771
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,940
 "But I'm not ashamed,

772
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,900
 "for I know whom I've believed,

773
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:27,400
 "and I'm convinced, not just confident,

774
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:30,180
 "but I'm convinced he is able to guard

775
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:33,220
 "until that day what has been entrusted to me."

776
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:34,060
 I love it.

777
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:38,060
 Paul looks at Timothy and he gives him this pump-up speech.

778
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:40,900
 Like he knows, hey, I've told you what's true,

779
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,660
 I've called you to what's hard,

780
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:45,580
 and yet you might need a little confidence boost

781
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:46,900
 beneath your courage.

782
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:50,340
 He looks at Timothy and he sees what my coach saw in us

783
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:52,460
 when I was in high school with my first year

784
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:54,060
 playing high school football,

785
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:56,620
 and we were finally, for the first time in like 20 years,

786
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:59,040
 facing off against our cross-town rival.

787
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:03,900
 And listen, they were good, like really good.

788
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,380
 Like they'd won state the year before kinda good

789
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:08,780
 and played in a different district altogether than us,

790
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:09,940
 and yet in this moment,

791
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:13,340
 they were coming to play against us, and we were bad.

792
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:14,340
 And I'm not being modest.

793
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:15,540
 Like we were really bad.

794
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:18,060
 We were not in any way whatsoever

795
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:19,860
 comparable for the competition.

796
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:21,780
 And yet in this moment, our coach knew,

797
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:24,380
 hey, I'm gonna give you good courage.

798
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:26,020
 I'm gonna train you, I'm gonna prepare you,

799
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:27,220
 we're gonna practice hard.

800
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:30,180
 You're gonna have every reason to step into that fray

801
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:32,100
 and fight as well as possible.

802
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,000
 And yet he also knew, though you have courage,

803
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,540
 you need some confidence to boost that courage.

804
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:37,980
 You get a little shot in the arm.

805
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:42,140
 And so he walked into that meeting and he gave us a speech,

806
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:47,720
 the likes of which I dream about to this day.

807
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:54,240
 It fills my bones as I prepare to preach.

808
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,960
 You know, it's like that kind of moment.

809
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,560
 It was so motivating.

810
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:00,840
 It roused my inner man and it led me forth

811
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:03,720
 into the throes of battle to be utterly defeated.

812
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:06,520
 And yet he did all of this because he knew,

813
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,760
 hey, it's one thing to have courage,

814
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:11,900
 but you also need good reason for courage.

815
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,760
 You need some confidence beneath it.

816
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,320
 Timothy needs the same from Paul.

817
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:20,400
 So Paul, he writes this pump up speech.

818
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:24,640
 He gets so engulfed by all that he's sharing.

819
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,800
 And the reason why is because he wants Timothy to know,

820
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,220
 hey, true courage finds its confidence in Christ.

821
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:33,000
 True courage, it finds its confidence in Christ.

822
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,520
 It doesn't find its confidence in anything else.

823
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,280
 It doesn't find its confidence in your ability.

824
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:39,360
 It doesn't find its confidence in your social status.

825
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:42,360
 It doesn't find its confidence in what people think of you

826
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:46,640
 or how well you're regarded, what your reputation is online.

827
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:49,760
 It doesn't find confidence in anything but him.

828
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:53,040
 And the reason we know that is he gives us four reasons

829
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:56,240
 within these four verses for that confidence.

830
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,760
 He tells us first and foremost in verse nine

831
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,960
 that Jesus is the one who calls and saves.

832
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,880
 He's the one who calls and saves.

833
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:04,720
 Like, I love it.

834
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,040
 None of us were looking for Jesus when he found us.

835
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,440
 None of us.

836
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,640
 Like, think about where you were when he found you.

837
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:12,540
 I know where I was.

838
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:16,160
 Like, I was at this cheesy little youth group conference

839
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,000
 out in Arlington, Texas.

840
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,560
 And as I sat in this room,

841
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:23,840
 it was this overly dramatic skit from stage

842
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:27,120
 that absolutely plucked my heartstrings

843
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,160
 and compelled my faith.

844
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,680
 And I look back on that and I'm like, oh my gosh,

845
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,680
 like, that is the most cringe-worthy skit ever.

846
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,840
 And yet it was through that thing that Jesus decided,

847
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,840
 yep, you're mine, come on.

848
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:42,320
 Like, he used that because he doesn't need anything else.

849
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,520
 He can do whatever he wants

850
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,560
 whenever he wants with whoever he wants.

851
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:50,080
 He's the one who calls and he's the one who saves.

852
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:53,320
 It is up to him when it happens and how it happens

853
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,400
 and with who it happens.

854
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,720
 And so when it comes to us,

855
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:58,520
 it gives us every reason to share the gospel

856
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:03,080
 at all times and in all ways and with all peoples.

857
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,560
 The second reason we have confidence

858
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,560
 is because Jesus does all the work himself.

859
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,720
 Does all the work himself.

860
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,520
 Like it says so in verse nine.

861
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:14,000
 He says, "Not because of our works,

862
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,320
 but by his own purpose and grace."

863
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,920
 Meaning, listen, someone's salvation does not depend

864
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,360
 on your ability to get the sales pitch right.

865
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:25,240
 Some of you need to hear that.

866
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:28,880
 Like someone's salvation, it does not depend

867
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:33,680
 in any way whatsoever on your ability to sound fluent

868
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,840
 or answer all their questions

869
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:38,800
 or walk the Roman's road with them

870
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,760
 or present a compelling case for Christ.

871
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,760
 He doesn't need you to do any of that.

872
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,840
 Like it's not about how awesome you are,

873
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:48,040
 it's about how awesome he is.

874
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,680
 That's what saves.

875
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:52,120
 He's the one that does the work.

876
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:56,480
 He has done way more with way less in the past, I promise.

877
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:00,000
 So say yes to him.

878
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:00,840
 That's the second reason.

879
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:05,000
 The third reason is Jesus abolished death once and for all.

880
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:05,920
 That's verse 10.

881
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,440
 Which is important for us to understand

882
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:11,440
 because what that's telling us is it took,

883
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,440
 Jesus has taken the sting out of that very thing

884
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:17,040
 which we should be most afraid of in life.

885
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:20,400
 We have no reason to fear death any longer.

886
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,240
 Why?

887
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,000
 Because Jesus neutered it of all its power.

888
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:28,480
 And so what are you afraid of by sharing the gospel?

889
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,200
 That they won't like you?

890
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:35,240
 That they'll make fun of you?

891
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:38,520
 That they won't invite you out on the weekend?

892
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:41,760
 Like listen to how trivial this stuff is.

893
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,960
 And yet that's the reason,

894
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,320
 and I'm not trying to belittle that

895
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:47,760
 because I understand a desire to be liked.

896
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,320
 And yet Jesus is looking at you and saying,

897
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:53,560
 "Hey man, their soul is worth more than your approval.

898
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:56,160
 "So tell them about me."

899
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,440
 That's the third reason.

900
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,600
 And then the fourth reason is Jesus isn't a theory,

901
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,200
 he's a person.

902
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,600
 And I gotta be careful

903
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,520
 'cause I've got two minutes to finish this thing

904
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,720
 and I might get on a soapbox with this point.

905
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:09,840
 But verse 12 tells us,

906
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:14,040
 "I know whom, not what, but whom I have believed."

907
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:20,000
 I'm convinced so much evangelism does not work

908
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,800
 because we are trying to tell people

909
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:28,240
 about a concept to understand than a person to know.

910
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:32,720
 We're so convinced that what they need

911
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,000
 are the facts of the faith.

912
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,800
 And I'm not diminishing the significance of truth,

913
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,120
 but what I am telling you

914
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:41,480
 is that there's no fire within facts and facts alone.

915
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:44,080
 Facts don't make followers of Jesus,

916
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:46,680
 they just make fans, that's all they do.

917
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,640
 Like you can know all about someone

918
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,440
 but not actually know someone.

919
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:53,480
 Jesus has not settled

920
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,640
 for that kind of relationship with you.

921
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:58,800
 He did not live the perfect life,

922
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,040
 die the death you deserve,

923
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,360
 rise forth from the grave,

924
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:04,240
 taking up his own life in his own hand,

925
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:07,640
 and then ultimately beating back all shame forever

926
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,120
 for those that would believe in him

927
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,320
 just so we could know about each other.

928
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:15,440
 Do you hear how ludicrous that is?

929
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,920
 That's not what he's come to do.

930
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:17,920
 And yet so many of us,

931
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,760
 we are settling for an evangelism

932
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,920
 that is just trying to invite people

933
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,400
 into that kind of dynamic.

934
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,280
 Jesus did not die for that kind of dynamic.

935
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:28,000
 He died so people would know him,

936
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,560
 walk with him, love him, relate to him.

937
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:32,800
 And I probably shouldn't say this,

938
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,200
 but if that's your strategy,

939
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,160
 you should ask yourself the question,

940
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,800
 how well do you know him

941
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,240
 or do you just know about him?

942
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:45,400
 We have good reason for confidence, friends.

943
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:48,600
 God has given us a spirit of courage

944
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,480
 and he has given us good reason to live like it.

945
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:53,600
 So let me ask you, why don't you?

946
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:58,400
 I've been thinking about this.

947
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,200
 I've been thinking about that a lot.

948
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:04,160
 I think there's a lot that we could say

949
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,920
 about why we don't live lives of courage,

950
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:09,120
 but why we live lives of cowardice.

951
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:12,280
 And there's really plausible,

952
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:15,480
 really understandable reasons for why that is.

953
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:19,280
 Reasons that are not specific to you and you alone,

954
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:22,160
 but are also inclusive of me, myself.

955
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,480
 Like I'm not perfect at this.

956
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:25,800
 I fail at this every week.

957
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,400
 But what reasons could there be?

958
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,920
 Like, yes, I know it could be the opposition

959
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,960
 we fear we'll face from others.

960
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:36,400
 It could be a neglect of spiritual discipline.

961
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,320
 It could be some willful sin in our life.

962
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:40,560
 We could number a variety of different things

963
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:41,400
 that put us in a place

964
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,360
 where we don't feel like we can do this.

965
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:45,160
 And yet I'll tell you bottom barrel,

966
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:50,160
 why so many of us do not operate with this sort of courage.

967
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:55,400
 And the reason why is we don't think we're good enough.

968
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,400
 We don't think we're good enough.

969
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:04,480
 We look at ourselves and we think, me?

970
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:08,320
 No, like certainly not me.

971
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:11,520
 Like I don't know enough and I'm not bold enough

972
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:14,520
 and I'm not charismatic enough and I'm not funny enough.

973
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:19,520
 And I'm not witty enough and I'm not learned enough

974
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,840
 and I'm not smart enough and I'm not enough.

975
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:24,280
 Like that's the bottom line is I'm just not enough.

976
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:26,120
 And so Jesus, you've got to find someone else.

977
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:28,400
 Like I trust that you will do that.

978
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,400
 I believe you'll send someone else,

979
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,680
 that you'll find someone else who will call to them.

980
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:36,200
 You'll send someone else that will go to them,

981
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:39,280
 that you will send someone else who will save them.

982
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:42,840
 And God looks at you and he says, I already did it.

983
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:46,720
 I sent someone.

984
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:50,760
 I have spoken through someone.

985
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:53,800
 I have saved through someone.

986
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:57,760
 And yet that someone, being the someone of Jesus Christ,

987
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,960
 wants to go with you.

988
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:03,160
 He wants to do it with you.

989
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:11,880
 Like when we were lost in our cowardice,

990
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:15,320
 unwilling to do what we know we should do,

991
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:18,640
 Jesus, he came courageously for you.

992
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,360
 He moved from heaven to earth

993
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:22,840
 and he navigated all the complexities

994
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:27,760
 and all the difficulties and all the challenges

995
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,160
 of our present day,

996
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:31,920
 because he ultimately wanted to get to you.

997
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,760
 And we were ashamed of our sin

998
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:36,400
 and yet Jesus was not ashamed of you at all.

999
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:39,080
 He lived uncensored for you.

1000
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:42,160
 He moved through this world in a way

1001
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:45,920
 where he never feared associating with you.

1002
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:48,520
 (gentle music)

1003
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:55,600
 I wish some of you would get that.

1004
00:44:55,600 --> 00:45:04,080
 That he wants you, man.

1005
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:08,120
 He longs for you.

1006
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:13,840
 He hungers for you.

1007
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,920
 He yearns for you.

1008
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:20,520
 So much so that he would be all that he is

1009
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:21,360
 in coming to you,

1010
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:23,720
 that you could be all that you are in coming to him.

1011
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:26,840
 And then when we were uncertain

1012
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:28,600
 if we would ever be right with God again,

1013
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:31,120
 Jesus had confidence that you'd be his anyways.

1014
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:32,920
 He knew.

1015
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:36,080
 He knew the cost.

1016
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:37,400
 He didn't second guess it.

1017
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,920
 He knew the price.

1018
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:42,880
 And he's willing to pay it.

1019
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:46,920
 He knew the debt that only he could cover.

1020
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:51,120
 And so he had confidence to come and to get you.

1021
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:55,320
 Jesus knew when his time had come

1022
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:58,640
 that his turn was then and he raced into it.

1023
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:02,640
 Paul, Paul knew when his time had come

1024
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:07,280
 and when his turn was now and he raced into it.

1025
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:08,680
 The same was true for Timothy.

1026
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:11,320
 The question that I just wanna leave you with is,

1027
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:14,960
 do you believe your time is now and your turn has come?

1028
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:18,040
 And will you race into it as well?

1029
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:21,040
 Let me pray that you would.

1030
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:22,200
 Jesus, thanks for tonight.

1031
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:23,800
 Thanks for the sufficiency of your word.

1032
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:26,280
 Thanks for the power of your spirit.

1033
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:28,960
 I have nothing good to give these people.

1034
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:33,520
 I have no amount of fervor, no amount of zeal,

1035
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:35,840
 no amount of passion that can compel them to believe,

1036
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:39,040
 that can move them to action.

1037
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:41,840
 I can't rattle their dead bones and bring them to life,

1038
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,440
 but you, Jesus, can do all of that

1039
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,720
 and you can do so much more.

1040
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:49,160
 And so I'm praying, God, that you would now.

1041
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:52,440
 God, this has just been on my heart

1042
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:55,200
 as I've been thinking about second Timothy.

1043
00:46:55,200 --> 00:47:00,320
 But God, far be it for the porch to be a place

1044
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:01,760
 that is found popular.

1045
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:05,920
 But let it be, God, that the porch is found

1046
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:07,480
 to be a place that is powerful,

1047
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:11,040
 a place where you delight to dwell,

1048
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:13,120
 where you move amongst your people,

1049
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:17,760
 where you breathe new life and you forgive old sin.

1050
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:22,760
 And you change souls forever.

1051
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:27,240
 Would you do that work now, God?

1052
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:30,680
 Please, we pray in Jesus' name, amen.

1053
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:34,040
