6
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:52,540
 We are continuing this series, FAQ, looking at some frequently asked questions.

7
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:55,820
 Let me start with a story that happened a couple days ago in my world.

8
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:00,980
 It was Sunday afternoon after church here, took the kids home, and told my wife, man,

9
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:04,860
 I'm going to take our older two kids to the pool, community pool down the road.

10
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,540
 Six-year-old son, four-year-old daughter, load them up in the car, head towards the

11
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:09,540
 pool.

12
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:14,420
 I realized on the way there, all the pool toys that I had at one point, we had accidentally

13
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:17,460
 left or something had happened, and they just had disappeared.

14
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,940
 And so, I thought, dad of the year, let's stop at Walgreens.

15
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:22,620
 I'm going to let you guys pick out any pool toy you want.

16
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:27,140
 Go into the store, you get a toy, you get a toy, congrats.

17
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:31,740
 We walk into the store, and I head immediately over to the pool toy section at Walgreens,

18
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,340
 which is not that impressive, but it exists.

19
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:36,860
 And I'm standing there, and I'm like, hey, you can pick any of these out.

20
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:41,380
 And my daughter, immediately, she's four, she finds some little princess ball with Anna,

21
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:42,980
 Elsa, and different princesses.

22
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:43,980
 She's got it.

23
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:47,460
 She's locked in, and it was like $1.59, so I'm winning already.

24
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:51,740
 I look at my son, and I say, man, hey, now she got her toy, you pick out your toy, and

25
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:52,740
 then we're going to go hit the pool.

26
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:56,820
 And he goes, I don't want one of these pool toys.

27
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:57,820
 I want that.

28
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:02,140
 And he points over to a $15 superhero, and I was like, no, we're going to get a pool

29
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,980
 toy to go swim in the pool.

30
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,460
 Remember, I'm dad of the year.

31
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,580
 You weren't even going to get a toy, and then I decided to graciously allow you to pick

32
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,980
 a toy, and so we're going to pick one of these pool toys over here.

33
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:11,980
 And he says, I don't want that.

34
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:12,980
 I don't want that.

35
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:13,980
 I was like, okay, then you're not going to get anything.

36
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:14,980
 He said, okay, fine.

37
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:15,980
 I want that.

38
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,820
 And he points to something else, and it's like this Pokemon pack thing.

39
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:21,180
 He doesn't even understand what Pokemon is, and I'm like, you don't even know what to

40
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,180
 do with that.

41
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,180
 We're not going to get that.

42
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,180
 And he's like, no, that's what I want.

43
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,180
 And I said, great.

44
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,180
 You're going to pick one of these, or you're not getting anything.

45
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,020
 And he says, no, that's not what I want.

46
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,020
 I want something else.

47
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,020
 And I said, great.

48
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,020
 We're not going to get anything.

49
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:35,180
 So we start walking out, and he just goes ballistic like a six-year-old does, waterworks

50
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:38,020
 everywhere, screaming in the middle of Walgreens.

51
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:42,500
 And it's one of those moments as a parent where you're like, oh, my, you are not getting

52
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,500
 it.

53
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,500
 You're going to get a spanking is what you're going to get, no toy.

54
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,500
 And I said, thank you, spanking.

55
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:54,500
 Oh, man, you don't even have kids, and you're saying spanking.

56
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,500
 Oh, man, that one got me.

57
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:01,500
 Anyway, so I say, hey, we're going to get in the car.

58
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,500
 We're not getting a toy.

59
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,500
 In fact, she's not getting a toy.

60
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,500
 Nobody's getting a toy.

61
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,500
 All of our fun gone.

62
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,500
 Get in the car.

63
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,540
 And he just continues to go ballistic.

64
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:13,220
 And I said, hey, I wanted you to get a pool toy because we're going to the pool so that

65
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:18,260
 you could play with your pool toy at the pool.

66
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:23,460
 And he is still unmoved and goes, I don't want that.

67
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:26,460
 And eventually we get in the car, we head to the pool.

68
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:27,460
 No toy.

69
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:30,820
 Now, what does it have to do with tonight?

70
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:40,740
 Well, at the heart of tonight's topic, it is felt and can feel for people who struggle

71
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:48,580
 with this particular thing as though the church has said, hey, there's this gift that God

72
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:53,420
 has and God wants you to have, but it's a gift that can only be experienced and a gift

73
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:56,660
 that is to be experienced in a specific context.

74
00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:00,140
 Just like, hey, this is a, I'm going to get you a toy gift, but it's for the pool.

75
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,380
 We have to get a pool toy.

76
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:07,340
 And if you want to experience it, you've got to experience it there.

77
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:14,620
 And for people who struggle with what I'm going to bring up in a conversation, it can

78
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:20,260
 feel like, man, that's not a gift that I want.

79
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:29,580
 More specifically, what I want to talk about tonight is can I follow Jesus and be LGBTQIA

80
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:37,860
 plus or LGBT just so that I don't get tongue tied for the rest of the sermon?

81
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:44,460
 Because it can feel like, man, I want to follow Jesus, but the church is always saying, hey,

82
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:48,180
 there's this gift God has given him sex for marriage and that relationship and a man and

83
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,180
 a woman.

84
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:52,900
 And I don't want that gift.

85
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:56,660
 And you're telling me just like me saying, my son, no, we're going to go play the pool.

86
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:59,060
 I don't want to go to the pool.

87
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:01,660
 And I don't want that gift.

88
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:08,140
 And you telling me, hey, just enjoy it and just experience God's design of marriage between

89
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,700
 man and a woman.

90
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:17,100
 That's not something I want.

91
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:22,540
 And this is a really personal issue for a lot of us who have, like me, people in your

92
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:30,500
 family or people who were roommates in college or people in your immediate family, siblings,

93
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:37,620
 uncles, a father member or a father, a mother, somebody who struggles or is a part of this

94
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:40,100
 community.

95
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:45,780
 And so as Christians, what would God say?

96
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,340
 And I want to launch into this conversation.

97
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:51,420
 Let me say a couple of things up front.

98
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:59,060
 Unfortunately, too often the church, when it comes to this topic, has done a really

99
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:06,660
 poor job of speaking to it in a way that is loving, truthful, and gracious.

100
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:11,780
 And it's taken God's word, which is meant to be a gift to guide us to life, and it has

101
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:16,700
 hit people, so to speak, and beat them down with it.

102
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:20,900
 And if you are listening right now or at a later date, you're tuning in, I want you to

103
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,620
 stay with me throughout the entire message.

104
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:26,660
 And I want you to know that if you're here tonight or you know somebody that is in the

105
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:32,020
 LGBTQIA+ community, that you are welcome here.

106
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,420
 You are loved.

107
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:38,100
 God is not done with you, just like he's not done with all of the different pornography

108
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:42,980
 viewing and sexual sin and heterosexual ways that's inside of this room.

109
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:51,540
 And you're amongst a bunch of broken people, myself very much included, who are clinging

110
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:56,460
 to Jesus and living in God's grace every single day.

111
00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:00,260
 And what you're not going to hear in this sermon is a picketing, because oftentimes

112
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:03,420
 Christians have seemed to isolate this specific issue.

113
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:08,900
 You don't see a lot of pickets and marches for anti-gossip.

114
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:18,540
 And the church has done a bad job of communicating with both grace and with truth.

115
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,780
 And so I want to attempt to answer that tonight.

116
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:24,940
 We're going to take a lot, we're going to fly through a lot of information and walk

117
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:32,620
 through can I be LGBTQIA+ and follow Jesus?

118
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:35,180
 Because the answer might surprise you.

119
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:39,620
 And so I want to answer that first question and then go into a couple underneath that,

120
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:43,820
 which is the first one of can I be LGBT and follow Jesus?

121
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:48,580
 Well, first, what does it mean to follow Jesus?

122
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:53,060
 The Bible says that when we use the vernacular, the language of like, hey, following Jesus

123
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:58,220
 and trusting in Christ and coming to a place where you accept Jesus as your Lord and your

124
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:03,020
 Savior, that's where you, if you haven't heard this before, a Christian is simply somebody

125
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:07,860
 who says, I accept Jesus as the payment for my sin on the cross.

126
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:12,140
 When he died on the cross, he paid for everything past, present, future, every sexual sin in

127
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:16,060
 my past, every sin in general that I've ever done and every sin I ever will commit.

128
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:20,580
 I'll never be able to earn a relationship with God, but Jesus has made a way so that

129
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,220
 I could have eternal life with him.

130
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:25,720
 I receive you as my Lord and Savior.

131
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:32,780
 And then the Holy Spirit begins to work in that person's life and begin to convict and

132
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:35,740
 begin to bring about change in their life.

133
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:41,940
 But may, let me be abundantly clear, someone does not change in order to become a Christian.

134
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:47,580
 Someone becomes a Christian or trusts in Christ and Jesus through his spirit begins to change

135
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,620
 them.

136
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:53,900
 And so following Jesus includes, man, I'm trusting him for salvation.

137
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:59,060
 And Jesus also said, if you want to follow me, and this is to everybody, in Luke chapter

138
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:08,140
 nine, verse 23, whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross

139
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:10,820
 daily and follow me.

140
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,780
 What does that mean?

141
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:19,060
 Well, when this was spoken to his followers, Jesus hadn't died on the cross yet.

142
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,700
 In fact, he hadn't even predicted he was going to die on the cross yet.

143
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:25,060
 So what they just heard is Jesus said, you know that instrument of death?

144
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:29,980
 This would be in the 1600s saying the guillotine, pick up your guillotine or pick up the gas,

145
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:34,380
 the execution of the day and follow me.

146
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,380
 What is he saying?

147
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:43,380
 He's saying, hey, those who follow me are going to die daily to themselves and their

148
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:49,020
 preferences and the call on all of us who follow Jesus, regardless of our sexuality,

149
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:56,740
 as to continually, despite imperfectly, say, God, man, I am surrendered to your will.

150
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:57,740
 And I am not perfect.

151
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,900
 And I am attempting to.

152
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:05,900
 And there are parts of me that don't want to follow everything that you say in the Bible.

153
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:12,740
 But you by your spirit, I am seeking to walk in dependence with you and die daily.

154
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:16,240
 So Jesus said it means to follow him.

155
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,620
 So that's what it means to follow Jesus.

156
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:24,340
 It's trusting in him for eternal life and trusting him and dying daily in this life.

157
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:27,460
 Now what does it mean to be LGBTQIA+?

158
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:37,180
 Well, I want to focus specifically on the same sex relationships aspect of that.

159
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:39,100
 And there's a number of different reasons for that.

160
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:42,540
 And we may do a views from the porch on some of the intersex or some of the queer questioning

161
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,260
 and the different things involved in that.

162
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:52,380
 But the first four have tremendous overlap in regards to same sex relationships.

163
00:10:52,380 --> 00:11:01,900
 If by LGBT, you mean I have a disposition either that I can't explain because I was

164
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:06,700
 introduced to same sex pornography or experienced some sort of event and I can trace it back

165
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,740
 in my life or you can't.

166
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:13,740
 And you would just say, as long as I can remember, I've had attraction to the same sex.

167
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:20,820
 When all the other kids were going through puberty and they had attraction to girls if

168
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:27,460
 they were boy and boy or yeah, boys if they were girl, I didn't have that.

169
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:34,320
 If you simply mean attraction, the Bible wouldn't classify that as sin.

170
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:41,180
 Same sex attraction is different than same sex action.

171
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:47,440
 By same sex attraction, all that that means is, man, I have a wiring for whatever reason.

172
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:52,820
 And this is a temptation for me, which wouldn't be a sin any more than a guy who's married

173
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:58,020
 like myself, who still has attraction to women that are not my wife.

174
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:00,840
 Now, it's not a sin to have that attraction.

175
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:05,620
 It's a sin for me to sleep with someone who's not my wife.

176
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:08,900
 And the Bible doesn't speak to orientation.

177
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,360
 It speaks to action.

178
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:17,540
 Because even the language of the orientation, it wasn't as developed or existent.

179
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:24,580
 What Paul and over and over, as we're gonna see in the scripture, speaks to is that sexual

180
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:29,520
 action outside of the context of marriage, which we're gonna look at here in a second,

181
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:33,260
 and that can be heterosexual, that can be oral sex, that can be pornography, that can

182
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:37,700
 be sex with, which is cannibally a lot more prevalent in this room than homosexual sin

183
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,700
 is.

184
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:43,980
 And it's just as offensive to God to be sleeping with your girlfriend as it is to be sleeping

185
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:48,480
 with your boyfriend of the same sex.

186
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,660
 Both of which are outside of God's design for sexuality.

187
00:12:52,660 --> 00:13:00,960
 And so if by LGBT you mean, hey, I am living and existing in same sex relationships, you

188
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:06,160
 are living outside of God's design for sexuality and for relationships.

189
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,720
 Paul, the apostle, says this in 1 Corinthians chapter 6 verse 9.

190
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:15,280
 There's about seven different locations in the Bible that speak specifically to same

191
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,360
 sex relationships.

192
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,520
 Six towards male and male relationships and one towards female and female.

193
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,860
 Every time it speaks how this is not God's design.

194
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:27,400
 Not how God created it.

195
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:33,520
 First Corinthians 6 verse 9 says, "The sexually immoral," which is sex in any context outside

196
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:41,740
 of marriage, "nor idolaters," which is greed, worshiping something, "nor adulterers, nor

197
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:49,140
 men who have sex with men, nor thieves, nor greedy, nor drunkards, nor slanderers, nor

198
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:52,820
 swindlers, will inherit the kingdom of God."

199
00:13:52,820 --> 00:14:01,980
 Wait, Paul, are you saying that being gay or bisexual or lesbian will keep you out of

200
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,580
 heaven?

201
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:05,500
 No.

202
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:15,060
 He's saying embracing unrepentant sin is a mark of someone, generally speaking, who doesn't

203
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,060
 know Jesus.

204
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:19,100
 And he uses a number of different things.

205
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:29,420
 He's saying people who consistently get drunk or slander or swindle or rob from or are thieves.

206
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:32,380
 Anyone who is embracing, the point is not that specific type of sexuality, it's saying

207
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:40,420
 anyone who embraces living in a way that God says is wrong is someone who is not living

208
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:46,700
 consistent with the faith that they claim to have in Jesus.

209
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:53,540
 And so can I follow God and be perpetually sleeping around with people of the opposite

210
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:55,540
 sex?

211
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:59,660
 Paul would say that is confusing at best or a mark of the fact that you don't actually

212
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:03,660
 have a relationship with Jesus.

213
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:12,020
 And his point is about unrepentant sinful behavior is not the mark of the people of

214
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:14,460
 God.

215
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:17,940
 Now doesn't Jesus say judge not?

216
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:20,660
 This is something you're probably going to hear a lot.

217
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:23,500
 Jesus said don't judge, the Bible said don't judge, you're not supposed to judge.

218
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,700
 The Bible doesn't say not to judge, it says how to judge.

219
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,820
 If you don't believe me and you're listening at a later date or you're listening right

220
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:34,020
 now, you can flip over to 1 Corinthians chapter 5 where the apostle Paul is writing to the

221
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:36,580
 church in Corinth and he's writing this letter.

222
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:41,820
 And in the letter he says you need to judge this specific person.

223
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:46,140
 And he gives this identification of a guy in the church group, the small group at that

224
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:50,740
 time, and he says there's a guy who is sleeping around with his father's wife.

225
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:54,780
 As in his father had gotten remarried and he's having an affair with his father's new

226
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,120
 wife.

227
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:01,260
 And Paul says even people outside of the church are like oh man that is Jerry Springer, that

228
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,340
 is not okay Springer stuff.

229
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:04,340
 Uh uh.

230
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,340
 That's what Paul says.

231
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:09,340
 He said even the church, even people who are not Christian are going whoa, whoa, let's

232
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,340
 back it up here.

233
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:14,500
 And this guy is boasting as though look at me, I'm living in sin and Jesus paid for it.

234
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,500
 And he says that person doesn't know Jesus.

235
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:22,900
 The Bible doesn't say not to judge, it says how to judge.

236
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:28,980
 Often well Jesus never spoke about same sex relationships.

237
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:32,060
 Jesus didn't speak about a lot of things.

238
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:36,780
 If the criteria for whether something is okay for a Christian or not is whether Jesus specifically

239
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:44,740
 spoke about it, then things like someone beating their wife would be okay, which it certainly

240
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,340
 is not.

241
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:52,140
 Jesus never spoke about heroin, which it certainly is not.

242
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:58,460
 But the Bible clearly over and over speaks, and I want to get to God's heart behind this,

243
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:08,300
 to God's design for marriage, sexuality, and that living in a same sex relationship is

244
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:15,660
 not living in line with God's design.

245
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:21,980
 As Christians, and maybe this will help, especially if you're listening and you're here maybe

246
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:27,380
 for the first time and you're just, you're not certain why Christians seem to be so adamant.

247
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:33,220
 And candidly, just if this is your first time, we talk about issues related to heterosexual

248
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:39,020
 sin, gossip, pornography, substance abuse, we talk about all of that 10 times X, we talk

249
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,020
 about this.

250
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:45,500
 But the Bible says that we're to take God's word and it is to be the standard that informs

251
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,500
 how we live.

252
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,820
 Then in a culture that says, man, you do what you feel, you do what you want, you do what

253
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:55,300
 you think, for you, Christians, because we said, man, I'm following Jesus, I gave up

254
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:59,380
 the right to say, you know what, I do what I want, Jesus, I'll pick and choose what you

255
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,380
 want.

256
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:04,980
 No, it says that as Christians, we pick up our cross and we die daily and we use the

257
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:07,020
 standard of God's word.

258
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:10,620
 What's interesting is no matter what somebody believes, your coworkers, people around you,

259
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:15,420
 people who have no faith in Jesus, everybody has a standard.

260
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:22,700
 In fact, as tolerant as our society is, there's things where we would go, that's out of bounds,

261
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:23,700
 no matter what somebody believes.

262
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:28,980
 You guys know who the number one music recording artist, single artist of all time is?

263
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:32,180
 Can you guess?

264
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,180
 Elvis.

265
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:39,300
 Elvis, man, this is a smart front area right here.

266
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:43,380
 Elvis Presley is the, and I haven't seen the movie, this is not an endorsement for any

267
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:47,980
 of that, Elvis Presley is the single most successful recording artist of all time.

268
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:53,340
 In fact, when you look at all bands collectively, the only one that beats them is the Beatles.

269
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:59,340
 Elvis, who only lived to 42 years old, the number of different hits that he had, it was

270
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:04,020
 crazy and just the successfulness that he puts Taylor Swift, Drake, everybody, it's

271
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,020
 not even close.

272
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:08,620
 He's in another stratosphere.

273
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:14,260
 Elvis wasn't just incredibly successful, he also had some really broken sexuality that

274
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,260
 you may not be familiar with.

275
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:19,220
 When he married his wife, Priscilla, in the 1970s, this is not a critique of Elvis, who

276
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,420
 I don't know, and I hope he's in heaven.

277
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,860
 I hope she trusts in Jesus.

278
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:28,620
 But as she records, they got married and about nine months later they had their first babies,

279
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:30,500
 Lisa Marie.

280
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:37,940
 And Priscilla would go on to say that when she was pregnant with her baby, Elvis made

281
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:41,460
 clear, "I won't sleep with you once you have the baby.

282
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:45,780
 I'm not attracted to women who've had babies.

283
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:49,380
 And I will sleep around," and he did.

284
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:54,140
 Now my guess is if you're hearing that, that's not exactly the type of romantic love that

285
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:56,540
 you want to have in your future.

286
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:59,740
 And most of us would go, "Wait a second, what?

287
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:00,820
 She got pregnant?

288
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:01,820
 She had his baby?"

289
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:04,980
 And he said, "Oh yeah, by the way, I don't sleep with moms, so I'm going to move on from

290
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:05,980
 here."

291
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:08,300
 That's not cool.

292
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,900
 Because you would go, "That's not right.

293
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:10,900
 Now let me ask you a question.

294
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,540
 I'm being serious."

295
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:18,460
 Apart from holding to a biblical standard, some sort of anchor, a compass, something

296
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:21,820
 that informs what you believe, why is it not right?

297
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,260
 And you would say, "Well, it just doesn't sit right.

298
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,260
 That's so wrong."

299
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,260
 Why?

300
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:29,100
 It's just your opinion.

301
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,540
 And this is where as Christians, we don't have a choice of going, "This is my opinion

302
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:32,540
 or not.

303
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,500
 This is what God's Word says.

304
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,820
 Even when I don't like it, He's calling me to follow it."

305
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,860
 Maybe you would say, "No, hey, I'm fine with that.

306
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:40,860
 I don't matter."

307
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,980
 But my guess is there's other examples.

308
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:48,380
 You know there's a group that the vast majority of every person I've ever met would say, "That's

309
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,100
 out of bounds and not okay.

310
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,980
 That violates my standard of what's sexually appropriate and what's not."

311
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,940
 It's a group that's located in America.

312
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:56,380
 It's called the North American...

313
00:20:56,380 --> 00:21:00,720
 It's called NAMBLA, the North American Association of Man-Boy Love.

314
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:05,820
 It's a group that advocates for the consent and the age of consent to be removed for people

315
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:10,520
 who were born with a sexual desire to sleep with younger kids and for children who are

316
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:16,420
 born with a sexual desire to sleep with older men.

317
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:22,300
 Now, because the Bible makes clear, it's not just consensuality that makes something okay

318
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,420
 or not.

319
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:28,420
 The Bible makes clear sex is intended to be experienced in the context of marriage between

320
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,900
 one man and one woman.

321
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:34,380
 I can clearly say that's not okay.

322
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:37,220
 But apart from having a standard, you can go, "Hey, no, this is right.

323
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,220
 No, that's illegal.

324
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,220
 That's the law of..."

325
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:44,180
 There's a lot of things that were legal at one point in this country, and it didn't make

326
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:46,100
 them right.

327
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:49,900
 But there's something inside of you that says, "No, that's not okay."

328
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:50,900
 And I would agree.

329
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:55,220
 And if you're a Christian, you can because the Bible...

330
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:59,980
 If you're not, you're just going based on your opinion.

331
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:06,260
 And God's Word is to be this thing that informs us and the standard that we hold to.

332
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:09,460
 Even when society around says, "Man, you're a bigot.

333
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:10,920
 You're hateful.

334
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:14,860
 You don't love people."

335
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:19,580
 And that is not any of my heart or any of the people that are around here's heart ever

336
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:21,540
 to come across as.

337
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:25,100
 And you are loved no matter your sexuality, no matter if you agree with me or you listen

338
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:29,560
 to me or you care what I have to say, no matter if you care what God has to say or you ever

339
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,740
 come to trust in Jesus.

340
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:36,040
 And you're welcome here as long as you want.

341
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:40,380
 But when it comes to the issue of sexuality as it relates to...

342
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:46,020
 When it comes to every issue, as Christians, we go, "What does God's Word say about this?"

343
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,100
 So that's my next question.

344
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:51,700
 What does God's Word say about LGBT relationships?

345
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:55,340
 Well, as I mentioned already, there's six different occasions.

346
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:59,700
 That's in Genesis chapter 19, Leviticus 18, Leviticus 20, Romans chapter 1.

347
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,700
 I'll read that one in a second.

348
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:01,700
 First Corinthians 6 verse 9.

349
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,140
 I said first Corinthians...

350
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:10,460
 First Timothy 1 verse 10 word explicitly says these type of relationships are not what God

351
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:15,180
 desires, are not consistent with his design.

352
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:19,900
 But it also says that same-sex relationships are inconsistent with his design for things

353
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,860
 like marriage.

354
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:27,940
 That the Supreme Court can redefine marriage, but that doesn't mean God now recognizes that

355
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:30,340
 as a marriage.

356
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:37,180
 It says over and over the teachings of Scripture that marriage is between a man and a woman.

357
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:40,620
 And I don't say any of this to shame or make anybody feel uncomfortable or make your uncle

358
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:45,140
 who's gonna listen to this message two years from now upset.

359
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:50,600
 I say it to go, "This is just what the Bible says."

360
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:57,980
 And because I believe it's God's Word and it's true, I don't get to pick and choose.

361
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:03,220
 Jesus in Matthew chapter 19, he said this, "For this reason a man will leave his father

362
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:05,620
 and mother and be united to his wife."

363
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:07,420
 Jesus is defining marriage.

364
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:11,380
 "The two will become one flesh.

365
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:14,180
 They are no longer two, but one.

366
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:17,980
 Therefore God has joined together, let no one separate."

367
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:21,600
 Paul speaking about marriage and saying it's between a man and a woman in this matrimony

368
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,900
 says it's not just between a man and a woman, it's ultimately a metaphor, which is why God

369
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:28,340
 cares so much about it.

370
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:32,900
 And he repeats the same verse, which is a quote from Genesis chapter 2.

371
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:36,180
 "For this reason a man will leave his father and mother, be united to his wife.

372
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:37,500
 The two will become one flesh."

373
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:42,740
 Then he says, "This is a profound mystery, but I'm talking about Christ and the church."

374
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:47,820
 That Paul says marriage is a metaphor.

375
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:51,960
 Earthly marriage between a man and a woman is a picture of God's unending, unbreakable

376
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:56,380
 union with his bride, the church.

377
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:59,920
 And it's meant to be a picture to the watching world.

378
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:05,380
 But it is clear over and over that teaching is between one man and one woman.

379
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:09,100
 It's also inconsistent in regards to what does the Bible teach.

380
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:15,020
 It also teaches that same-sex relationships are inconsistent with God's vision of sexuality,

381
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:20,420
 which was a gift, the very first gift God gave to be experienced between man and woman.

382
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:27,960
 Genesis chapter 1 verse 27 says this, "God created mankind in his own image.

383
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:31,460
 In the image of God, he created them, male and female."

384
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:34,400
 Let me hit something, just a side note really quick.

385
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:41,420
 The image of God in humanity is not seen in men, and it's not seen in women.

386
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:44,620
 In other words, the fullness of seeing the image of God on display in terms of humanity

387
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:50,760
 is seen in men and women, male and female.

388
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:57,120
 The qualities and characteristics of women, just like men, equally reflect together the

389
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:03,900
 image of God, which is why in a society and why Satan is consistently trying to dissolve

390
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:09,160
 and assault even the perspective that there is male and female.

391
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:12,620
 Because if he can get rid of that, he is getting rid of the image of God being reflected in

392
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:15,180
 our world.

393
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:18,940
 But he made male and female in the image of God to reflect the image of God, just like

394
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:24,140
 women reflect aspects of the image of God and men reflect aspects of the image of God.

395
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:28,760
 One of them on their own does not fully reflect the fullness of the image of God.

396
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:32,580
 But then it said this, it's the very first gift, and Adam said, "Amen."

397
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:37,420
 God blessed them and said, "Be fruitful and multiply.

398
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:39,500
 Increase in number and fill the earth."

399
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:43,780
 God's very first command was, "Hey, I want you to have sex and make babies."

400
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:46,400
 In other words, creation is five minutes old.

401
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,740
 God just finished, he's rested, he's looking around, the angels are like, "Man, this is

402
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:50,740
 awesome.

403
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:51,740
 What are you going to do next?"

404
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:52,740
 He's like, "Man, you better watch out.

405
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:53,740
 You've seen nothing yet."

406
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:55,860
 He tells them, "I want you guys to be fruitful and multiply."

407
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:59,060
 The angels are like, "Whoa, we have never got to be a part of that."

408
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:03,300
 Adam's first command is, "I want you to have sex with your wife and your wife, you guys

409
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:06,820
 to come together and out of the overflow of that sexuality and that intimacy and that

410
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:12,260
 love together, you are going to procreate and replicate and increase."

411
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:16,220
 In other words, the purpose of sexuality and sex in general is not just pleasure, it's

412
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:18,900
 procreation.

413
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:21,740
 It's a gift that pleasure is involved to it, and God over and over hits at that.

414
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:24,300
 God is the inventor of sex, he's so for it, we talk about that all the time.

415
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:28,300
 But part of the purpose of procreation or of sexuality involves procreation between

416
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,620
 a man and a woman.

417
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:35,020
 So it doesn't just say that God says it's inconsistent with his design, it's inconsistent

418
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:40,100
 with marriage, it's also inconsistent with the purpose of sexuality.

419
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:44,140
 And finally, it's inconsistent with his design, as I've said.

420
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:53,280
 In Romans chapter 1 verse 25, it says Paul speaking about how you can see a society has

421
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:57,460
 rejected the truth and embraced the lie, and he says this, "They exchanged the truth about

422
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:59,420
 God for a lie.

423
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:05,860
 They worshipped and served created things rather than the Creator who is forever praised.

424
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:10,500
 Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts.

425
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:14,740
 Their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones with other women.

426
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:20,040
 In the same way, men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with

427
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,300
 lust for one another.

428
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:26,760
 Men committed shameful acts with men, with other men, and received in themselves the

429
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,860
 due penalty for their error."

430
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:37,020
 Now when you read those, if you have same sex as a part of your current attraction or

431
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:39,260
 struggle in the past, you can feel all kinds of shame.

432
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:45,340
 Paul's point is just a clear reflection of rejecting God's design, and he doesn't just

433
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,340
 use this one.

434
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:47,740
 He uses idolatry.

435
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:50,420
 He uses worship of self.

436
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:56,900
 Also in the passage, he uses disobedience to parents and hatred and murder.

437
00:28:56,900 --> 00:29:00,380
 But his point is, hey, it's a clear rejection of God's design, and here's what happens when

438
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:03,780
 you reject a Creator's design.

439
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:05,580
 Consequences.

440
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:08,740
 Like, we see this on like small levels.

441
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:13,780
 There's times where my wife, I've learned that if I go to wash the laundry that is her

442
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:18,360
 clothes and my clothes, I have to be very careful to not take clothes from a very specific

443
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:23,100
 pile that she throws in the closet on the floor in a very specific location.

444
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,100
 Why?

445
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:27,180
 Because in the past, I would go in there, get all of the laundry, husband of the year,

446
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:29,980
 throw it in here, gonna throw this in the washing machine, and I throw it in there.

447
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:33,180
 It inevitably gets washed, and then I put it in the dryer, and I get it out, and I'm

448
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:34,620
 like, man, I'm not just gonna stop there.

449
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:39,940
 I am gonna fold these things, and I'm gonna fold it all up, and I'll pull out a shirt

450
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:44,540
 or a sweater made of something called cashmere.

451
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:47,800
 And when it went in the washing machine, it was like this big.

452
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,580
 And then it came out, and it was like this big.

453
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:54,100
 And I'll try to get it wet and stretch it out and stretch it out, and then I look on

454
00:29:54,100 --> 00:30:02,860
 the tag, and it says cashmere do not wash or dry or hand wash and hang dry.

455
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:09,500
 And as silly as that is, any time that we reject, dismiss, fail to follow the creator's

456
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:13,140
 instructions, there's consequences.

457
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:15,740
 And what do I mean by consequences?

458
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:20,120
 I wanna share some statistics that will be available in the message description of this

459
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:24,420
 message on YouTube and will be available on the Porch blog as early as tomorrow or the

460
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:35,800
 next day at the porch.live/blog that are not indicative of all same-sex relationships ever,

461
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:42,140
 but they are trends, and I wanna be very specific and make sure that all of the research is

462
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:46,380
 published exactly and so you can go find, 'cause in today's age, you can go find whatever

463
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:52,620
 link and stat you want from BuzzFeed or Vox or whatever that's out there, and these are

464
00:30:52,620 --> 00:31:01,020
 peer-reviewed, medical-published surveys and research to see why if you're God, you would

465
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:08,300
 say, "I don't want this," just like I don't want all the pain that comes with pornography

466
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:13,340
 and addiction, both now and in future marriages, all the different ways that any type of living

467
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:19,740
 outside of God's design has negative, painful impact.

468
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:24,620
 So what are some of the ways that that takes place in terms of when you go against God's

469
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:26,940
 design?

470
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:28,820
 One is in the arena of mental health.

471
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:36,220
 The United Kingdom reported that homosexuals are, in a study that was done, 50% more likely

472
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:40,980
 to suffer from depression and engage in substance abuse than the rest of the population.

473
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:47,060
 They're 200% in the same study found more likely to be at risk for suicide.

474
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:53,860
 LGBT youth have been found to be three times more likely to commit suicide.

475
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:59,540
 Often it's attributed that this is from a stigma of society where they are a minority

476
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:05,460
 and have not been accepted, but even in countries that have gone the farthest to produce and

477
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:10,140
 encourage and celebrate the type of relationships, there's not a reduction in the incidence of

478
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:11,140
 suicide.

479
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:12,500
 There's actually an increase.

480
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:18,780
 A study was done in Sweden which legalized same-sex marriage, which US did in 2015.

481
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:21,980
 Sweden did it in 1944.

482
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:30,340
 It made speaking against sexual orientation a crime prosecutable as hate speech in 2003.

483
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:34,120
 It was recognized by the International Lesbian Gay Association as the most gay-friendly country

484
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,820
 in Europe.

485
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:43,100
 Today there's a 300% increase in risk of suicide among homosexual men.

486
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:45,220
 That's from the European Journal of Epidemiology.

487
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:48,140
 There's an overall decrease in life expectancy.

488
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:54,780
 The Eastern Psychological Association found the average life expectancy for someone who

489
00:32:54,780 --> 00:33:01,860
 lives in the LGBT community is dramatically lower than heterosexuals.

490
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:07,660
 It was found to be over 20 years lower.

491
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:13,100
 Only 1% of homosexual men died from old age, and the study concluded it's a lifestyle more

492
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:16,180
 dangerous than smoking.

493
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:20,820
 I don't say any of this to say anything other than there are clear trends that God is saying,

494
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:29,860
 "I don't want the pain that comes along, the extinction of life."

495
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:38,140
 Part of the reason for the decrease in life longevity is related to the increased likelihood

496
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:40,540
 of disease.

497
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:48,660
 Only 3% of the US population is in the LGBT community.

498
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:51,800
 They make up 43% of the cases of syphilis.

499
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,260
 This is from the CDC 2020.

500
00:33:54,260 --> 00:34:02,940
 60% of cases of gonorrhea, 97% of the new epidemic of monkeypox, the new virus of monkeypox.

501
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:15,420
 In 2019, 70% of HIV cases, 70% were among homosexual men, 70% of the new cases in the

502
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:17,180
 United States.

503
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:20,460
 Why is disease so rampant?

504
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:24,820
 Studies have found that monogamy is an extreme minority.

505
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:30,660
 The Journal of Sexual Research, all these again will be listed, found that the modal

506
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:38,580
 range is in the largest range, a majority of where most people in the community fall,

507
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:45,660
 of sexual partners was between 101 and 500 in their lifetime.

508
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:52,100
 The study also reported that 10 to 15% had between 500 and 1,000 partners.

509
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:58,100
 Another that 10 to 15% reported more than 1,000 sexual partners.

510
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:06,980
 According to one study, 66% of gay couples reported sex outside of their monogamous relationship

511
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:09,740
 within the first year.

512
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:18,060
 The same study indicated that 90% of couples interviewed who were in a relationship had

513
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:24,380
 sex outside of that relationship with somebody within five years.

514
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:33,620
 In a society that says, "Man, this is about love," it's at least also about sex.

515
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:45,580
 Now, as Christians, this is where we, as those called to love people, have to seek to do

516
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:48,340
 so in a way that is loving and affirming.

517
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:54,420
 I want to focus on how to do that exactly, especially with members who may not be believers

518
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:59,260
 and how we shift the focus away from sexuality.

519
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:04,900
 If somebody said, "Man, why can't you just encourage and support me making this decision?"

520
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:08,980
 If a friend came to you and said, "Hey, I'm thinking about moving to this town," and in

521
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:16,860
 this town, you knew they would have a 300% increase in the likelihood of committing suicide,

522
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:24,060
 a 50% increase in the likelihood of substance addiction, drug addiction, or alcohol addiction,

523
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:34,260
 that they would have an increased likelihood of divorce and take 20 years off their life,

524
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:38,940
 would it be loving to say, "You should move there?

525
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:39,940
 I think that's great.

526
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:43,260
 You're going to take 20 years off your life.

527
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:49,820
 You're going to have sexually transmitted diseases virtually statistically a guarantee.

528
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:53,980
 You're going to have an increased likelihood of suicide way higher than if you just stay

529
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:57,700
 celibate."

530
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:06,100
 And yet as a society, Christians have been so beat to say, "Man, if you reject them choosing,

531
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:11,420
 despite those consequences, you are not loving."

532
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:16,920
 And when we look at God's Word and you look at even what societal research says, could

533
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:21,460
 it be that the opposite is true?

534
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:27,100
 We actually are trying to love by not encouraging that.

535
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:31,660
 Could it be that the society that says, "Let them do whatever they want no matter the consequences

536
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:38,460
 on their life," is actually the ones not loving?

537
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:44,380
 And Jesus said, and Paul taught, that love without the truth is not love.

538
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:47,620
 First Corinthians chapter 13 verse 6 says, "Love does not delight in evil but rejoices

539
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:49,060
 in the truth."

540
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:56,820
 Well, what if they were born that way?

541
00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:01,920
 There's an article called "Adultery, It's in Our Genes" released in Time Magazine.

542
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:05,140
 And in it, there's a quote from Rick Warren who's a pastor that just said, "Yeah, I was

543
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:09,640
 born with the desire to have sex with every beautiful woman that I see."

544
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:13,540
 And no one would say that's an encouraged thing.

545
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:17,660
 Someone who has a history of alcoholism in their family may be born with a higher propensity

546
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:26,140
 to be an alcoholic, which is going to dramatically decrease their life expectancy and life fulfillment

547
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:28,980
 in general.

548
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:32,340
 And if they were in your life and said, "Hey, do you think that me drinking all day long

549
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:33,340
 is a bad thing?

550
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:40,900
 And if you tell me it is, you are a bigot," you would say, "No, I love you enough to say

551
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,380
 it isn't.

552
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:46,300
 And I don't say any of this to diminish the feelings and the real temptations and all

553
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:51,660
 the different ways that that's a part of so many stories and so many friends, but this

554
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:52,980
 is the tension that we exist in."

555
00:38:52,980 --> 00:39:01,940
 Finally, and I'm going to move really quickly, how do we love the LGBT community like Jesus

556
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:02,980
 does?

557
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:05,980
 First thing that I've already said multiple times is we communicate Christ first.

558
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:10,020
 The greatest concern God has for humanity is not their sexuality, it's their relationship

559
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:11,020
 with Him.

560
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:14,620
 And I'm going to focus on, for non-believers, the church has no business in telling people

561
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:18,700
 and picketing outside, "You should change your sexuality."

562
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:21,580
 Jesus didn't require us to change to become Christians.

563
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:24,700
 We became Christians and He's on a journey of changing all of us.

564
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:28,100
 So if you have friends that are in your life, if I was to sit down with a same-sex couple

565
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:31,840
 that was sleeping together, I wouldn't focus on their sexuality any more than when I sit

566
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,980
 down with a heterosexual couple that's sleeping together.

567
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:37,380
 I'm going to focus on Jesus.

568
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:39,540
 And what do they believe about Jesus?

569
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:44,300
 I had a friend, I was at this group, and there was some influential Christian leaders from

570
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:48,020
 around the country, and there was this conversation taking place, and one of them said, "Man,

571
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:50,420
 I just, I don't know, it's so hard to talk.

572
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:54,540
 The goalpost has moved, now the first question all of my non-Christian friends ask is, 'Hey,

573
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:57,500
 do they accept homosexuality?

574
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:00,940
 What do they, as your church, think about homosexual relationships?'

575
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:01,940
 And I just don't know what to say."

576
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:08,100
 And I said, "I think you totally know what to say.

577
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:10,020
 You would say, 'I'm guessing.'"

578
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:13,820
 If somebody asks you that question, "What do they think about homosexual, people who

579
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:15,340
 are in homosexual relationships?"

580
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:18,620
 The same thing that I think about people in heterosexual relationships.

581
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:21,180
 They need Jesus.

582
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:25,740
 That every person's a broken, sinful person, and everyone was born broken with a sexuality

583
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:26,740
 that's broken.

584
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:31,620
 Myself, yourself, everyone.

585
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:34,620
 And so we focus first and foremost on Christ.

586
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:41,060
 How do we approach fellow believers as it relates to this issue?

587
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:47,100
 Those that we have a relationship with, we point them to the truth from God's word.

588
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:49,980
 Just like we hope that they point us to the truth from God's word.

589
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:54,180
 If I was sleeping with somebody who's not my wife, as I referenced earlier, I would

590
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:57,780
 hope that people who love me would come alongside and say, "Hey, this is not okay.

591
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:59,540
 You know that, right?"

592
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:02,940
 I've searched the Bible.

593
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:06,580
 This is something God does not encourage.

594
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:10,460
 And they would love me enough to speak that truth and come alongside.

595
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:12,660
 And we do this with any sin, in any direction.

596
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:17,820
 That we live in community, the Bible says, with one another.

597
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:18,820
 Two other things.

598
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:25,780
 I want to, if you're listening, and you're part of the LGBT community and following Jesus,

599
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:30,340
 or not a part of that community, but you have same-sex attraction, and you are seeking to

600
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:34,580
 follow Jesus, I want to speak specifically to you.

601
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:39,860
 And I'm talking to the person who said, "Man, I, despite the fact that God may never change

602
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:47,980
 my sexual desires, that I am attracted to the same sex, and God may never change those,

603
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:49,940
 but I am trusting him.

604
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:55,020
 And if he calls me to celibacy and calls me not to marriage, which is nothing and not

605
00:41:55,020 --> 00:42:01,060
 something that I want at all, I am trying and seeking to trust him."

606
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:06,660
 I want to speak to you and acknowledge a couple things.

607
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:13,460
 One, the weight, all of us are called to carry our own cross and follow Jesus.

608
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:18,660
 The weight of the cross that you carry is heavier than others.

609
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:23,620
 It may not be the heaviest of all, but it is at least heavier in some ways than someone

610
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:30,140
 who would say, "Man, I don't struggle with that."

611
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:36,860
 And to the many of you here and listening online and around the country, you are an

612
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:38,620
 inspiration.

613
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:40,820
 I am so proud to worship Jesus with you.

614
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:43,100
 I am so proud to be a part of a church with you.

615
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:44,400
 You strengthen my faith.

616
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,940
 You make me love God more.

617
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:50,220
 You inspire me the way that you are willing to say, "God, whatever it is, my sexuality,

618
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:53,860
 my future, my marriage, I'm giving it in your hands and I'm trusting it with you.

619
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:57,100
 Though none come with me, though the world around me says, 'Just give it up, get in the

620
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:59,900
 relationship that you want,' I am trusting you.

621
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:02,780
 God help me trust you."

622
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:07,940
 You are an inspiration and the strength of your faith may be four times the strength

623
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:13,420
 of a heterosexual that's in this room looking at pornography and your willingness to say,

624
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:14,420
 "God, I trust you."

625
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:24,260
 In addition, Jesus says that there is a special, eternal reward for anything that is sacrificed

626
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:26,980
 to those who surrender to him in this life.

627
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:32,780
 And he speaks in Isaiah specifically about sexuality and remaining single for the kingdom

628
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:33,780
 of God.

629
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:34,780
 It says this in Isaiah chapter 56.

630
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:37,660
 He speaks of eunuchs, but at that time it was just somebody who couldn't have sex or

631
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:39,500
 couldn't get married.

632
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:46,300
 To the eunuchs who choose, verse 4 of 56, Isaiah 56, who choose to do what pleases me

633
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:52,020
 and hold fast to my covenant, I will give them within my eternal temple that's in heaven

634
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:57,700
 and its walls a memorial and a name that is better than sons and daughters.

635
00:43:57,700 --> 00:44:03,500
 I will give them an everlasting name that will endure forever and ever.

636
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:12,180
 Finally, if that's a part of where you are, as much as it would be a disservice for me

637
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:18,060
 to say, "Man, God cannot or God has promised if you just walk with Jesus, he's going to

638
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:24,100
 change that," because he hasn't promised that.

639
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:29,940
 I've seen many stories where he has, but he hasn't promised that.

640
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:33,660
 But it would equally be a disservice for me to say, "Hey, if you walk with Jesus and you

641
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:41,100
 depend on his spirit and you yield to him and you trust him and you trust him, that

642
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:46,100
 God couldn't bring change in your life," because it's just not true.

643
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:48,740
 First Corinthians, that same passage, let me read it and I'm about to close.

644
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:53,420
 It said this, "Don't you know wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of God?

645
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:54,420
 Do not be deceived.

646
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:58,820
 Neither sexually immoral, idolaters, adulterers, people, men who have sex with men, thieves

647
00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:04,020
 or greedy or drunkards or slanders or swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God."

648
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:08,300
 And that is what some of you were.

649
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:10,540
 You're not anymore.

650
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:13,100
 You were washed.

651
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:15,820
 You were sanctified.

652
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:16,820
 You were justified.

653
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:17,820
 How?

654
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:19,820
 By behaving?

655
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:20,820
 No.

656
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:26,820
 By the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and the spirit of our God.

657
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:30,180
 Paul says, "Man, that was some of your stories.

658
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:31,180
 That's not your story.

659
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:32,660
 That doesn't define you anymore."

660
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:39,260
 There's a friend of mine who was in same-sex relationships for 15 years.

661
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:41,980
 He was in LA.

662
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:44,020
 He just thought, "This is a part of my life."

663
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:45,020
 His name's Leonard.

664
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:50,940
 And he would find himself just torn over, "Man, I don't know that I want to be this way, and

665
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:54,260
 yet I'm giving into this, and I don't even know that I could ever stop giving into this."

666
00:45:54,260 --> 00:46:01,700
 And just was so broken, he stumbled into a church.

667
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:07,140
 And there, he heard the gospel, and he trusted in Christ, but he still had sexual desires

668
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:08,140
 that were still there.

669
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:11,820
 And he didn't know what to do with them, and he just felt even more tormented over, "God,

670
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:12,820
 when will you change this?

671
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:16,020
 Will you ever change this?"

672
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:18,940
 And his story, and I'm not saying it's your story or everyone's story, his story is he

673
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:23,880
 just came to a place where he began to attend a small group of other people, and he began

674
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:26,340
 to live in the light.

675
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:29,380
 And he began to go, "God, if you never change this, I'm going to trust you."

676
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:35,980
 And he said, "God, just, he saved me."

677
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:42,660
 And he began to rewrite his story.

678
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:47,580
 He eventually met a girl named Mandy, and he thought, "Man, I'll never."

679
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:51,940
 And their relationship, he thought, would never be something that would be a part of

680
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:58,980
 his life, and yet, God began to bring change in his heart.

681
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:04,980
 It wasn't overnight, it wasn't something that just, everything went away.

682
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:10,200
 And she loved Jesus, and he loved Jesus, and they eventually got married, and then shortly

683
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:12,180
 after that, they had a little girl that was born.

684
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:15,500
 Here's her picture.

685
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:21,140
 And her name's Hope.

686
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:30,100
 And I was talking to him earlier today, and his story is that there is hope.

687
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:33,480
 God may not write the same one that he is for you, and wherever you are, and whatever

688
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:38,220
 God, whatever your story in general is, if you're struggling with heterosexual sin, homosexual

689
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:41,220
 sin, God loves you, and there's hope.

690
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:45,180
 But it's not found in yourself, it's found in the Spirit of God, walking in community

691
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:46,900
 with the people of God.

692
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:53,420
 And there's no one who's run too far, or who has done too much to not experience God's

693
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:57,040
 grace in their life.

694
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:05,700
 Can you be someone who has sexual attraction that the world would say makes them LGBT,

695
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:06,860
 and follow Jesus?

696
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:09,980
 You absolutely can.

697
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:17,500
 It's like you can be heterosexual, and you follow Jesus by surrendering to him, and his

698
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:23,940
 will, and trusting him, knowing that whatever and wherever you're at, there is hope.

699
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:25,460
 You are loved.

700
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:26,460
 God loves you.

701
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:28,460
 And he's not done.

702
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:31,380
 Let me pray.

703
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:40,260
 Father, I thank you for the friends that have been a part, that are a part of this

704
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:49,900
 gathering, of this church, the men and women who have surrendered their sexuality, their

705
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:53,740
 relationships, just our life in general to you, and those of us that have had to through

706
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:57,860
 sexual, heterosexual ways, and those of us through homosexual ways, God, I thank you

707
00:48:57,860 --> 00:49:02,020
 specifically for the men and women who have battled same-sex attraction, who have said,

708
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:08,140
 "God, no matter if it means that the course that I wish I would have is not the one that

709
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:11,540
 I'm going to have, if celibacy is the future that I have, God, I'm going to seek to trust

710
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:12,540
 you.

711
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:13,700
 Will you help me trust you?"

712
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:23,020
 How they inspire and strengthen the body of Christ all over the world in a culture, and

713
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:28,620
 in a world that screams, "Follow your feelings and your heart.

714
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:34,060
 Don't let anyone tell you that you should do otherwise."

715
00:49:34,060 --> 00:49:39,140
 They say, "I'm going to follow Jesus."

716
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:44,300
 And I thank you personally for the inspiration they consistently are.

717
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:49,220
 And I thank you for the ways that we get to surrender a walk with you, and you have a

718
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:52,340
 future and hope for us.

719
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:58,180
 I pray that anyone who hears this that feels condemned would, by your Spirit, feel free

720
00:49:58,180 --> 00:50:02,340
 and feel hope.

721
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:03,900
 We worship our King.

722
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:04,820
 Amen.

723
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:07,160
 (whooshing)
