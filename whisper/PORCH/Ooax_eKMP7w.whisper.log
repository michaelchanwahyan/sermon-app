[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760]   (dramatic music)
[00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.340]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:18.880]   - All right, here we go.
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.160]   Ready up for romance, kicking off.
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.960]   Welcome friends here, Fort Worth, El Paso,
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.240]   Phoenix, Fayetteville, Philadelphia,
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.840]   wherever you are joining and tuning in from, Nashville.
[00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.480]   We are kicking off a new series, Rated R for Romance,
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.800]   looking and exploring love, dating, relationships,
[00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.320]   and looking specifically at the Song of Solomon.
[00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.320]   What would you say is the greatest love song of our era?
[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.560]   - Maybe.
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:47.480]   - Maybe, okay.
[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.760]   In this room, we're probably divided about some.
[00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.280]   There's probably some classics that make the list,
[00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.400]   like this oldie but goodie from T. Swift.
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.560]   (silence)
[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:07.800]   Love story, such a classic.
[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.280]   Or maybe you, like me, can bring it back to high school
[00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.040]   and you're like, dude, this was just the jam back then.
[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.400]   Hit that falsetto, Usher, come on.
[00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.240]   But I think without question,
[00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.840]   the greatest love song of our generation,
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.960]   or of just like this era that we're living in,
[00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.200]   has got to be this by your girl, Whitney.
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:55.200]   (laughing)
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.400]   Falsetto coming from the audience, man.
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.920]   Oh, dude, what is it with that song?
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.920]   It almost makes you emotional in here.
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.840]   You're dating, you're welcome.
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.560]   The reason I start there is 'cause tonight,
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.200]   we are starting a series where we are looking at a song
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.200]   that the Bible calls the greatest love song of all time,
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.160]   the Song of Solomon.
[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.200]   And for the next six weeks, we're gonna explore
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.120]   just the relationship that this song that Solomon,
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.760]   who wrote in 1 Kings chapter four,
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.120]   we're told that Solomon, who was a king in ancient Israel,
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.800]   lived 3,000 years ago, so some of this literature
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.840]   we're about to study will be the oldest literature
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.760]   you maybe have ever read.
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.840]   And Solomon wrote a ton of songs, not thongs.
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.560]   (laughing)
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.320]   Hopefully he didn't write a ton of thongs.
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.400]   But he did write a ton of songs.
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:48.200]   And this one, he said, was the greatest of all of them.
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.880]   Get your, yeah, rate it R, man.
[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.960]   It is rated R for romance, okay?
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:53.840]   And so we're gonna explore.
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.960]   So here's what you need to know about this song.
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.000]   It's never been, I don't know that it's ever been
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.200]   more needed and more relevant.
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.440]   We live in a culture that both loves love
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.280]   and is really bad at love.
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.400]   Everyone loves it.
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.480]   You know, there's a reason why "The Bachelor"
[00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.840]   is the most successful show, like on ABC,
[00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.960]   year after year, wow, this room.
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.480]   And yet at the same time, we live in a culture
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.960]   that the divorce rate is 50% where no one seems
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.160]   to be able to, or many people, though they fall in love,
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.280]   they don't seem to be able to stay in love.
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.120]   There's kind of bad example after bad example
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.080]   that we're given from Hollywood,
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.200]   and just the most notable names are people
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.640]   who fell in love but they couldn't stay in love.
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.200]   We're given bad example after bad example,
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.560]   including many of "The Bachelor," you look around,
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.360]   trending over the weekend is Miley Cyrus
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.360]   leaves her bisexual relationship with a girl.
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.040]   She just had divorced her husband.
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.600]   We just are given one bad picture
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.560]   of what it looks like to have love and romance
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.240]   after another.
[00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.440]   And even the ones that we would all be like,
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.400]   oh, they're so beautiful, must be amazing,
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.120]   that Brad and Angelina, they end up falling apart.
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.400]   And so, so many different bad examples are given,
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.940]   and it would be awesome if there was a great example.
[00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.640]   And the good news is that God, who's there, loves romance.
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.400]   He created it, he loves sex, he created it,
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.480]   and he intended it to be a part of just his incredible
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.560]   design for human relationships,
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.760]   specifically in the context of marriage.
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.800]   And he gives us this amazing, beautiful picture
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.680]   in the Song of Songs.
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.280]   And it showcases what a romantic relationship
[00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.140]   should look like, really from the chase to the wedding
[00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:33.520]   to the rest of their life together.
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.560]   It's a book that, honestly, as we're gonna go through it,
[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:36.840]   you're gonna be like, dude, I cannot believe
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.000]   this is in the Bible.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.440]   It is a book that young Hebrew boys,
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.640]   or just Hebrew men and women, were not able to read
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.820]   until they were either married or 30 years old,
[00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.680]   because it was so erotic and sexual
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.060]   in its nature and content.
[00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.480]   They're gonna make love two times in this book.
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.000]   They are including types of sexual expression
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   towards one another that, dude, you do not wanna read
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.320]   with your mom sitting next to you,
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.040]   'cause you're like, I cannot believe this is in there.
[00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.800]   And so we're gonna explore what God has to say,
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.080]   because God, one of the greatest lies that people are told
[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.040]   is that God is against sex.
[00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.360]   God created sex, he is all about it.
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.640]   And he wants you and I to experience his design for sex
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.880]   in the context of marriage and have a romance
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.360]   like so few people ever begin to experience
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.200]   or ever really experience inside of their life.
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.360]   So we're gonna look at this book
[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.280]   for the next handful of weeks.
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.000]   Here's what you need to know about the book.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.640]   It is Hebrew poetry.
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.600]   In other words, it was a song,
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.920]   and the original Hebrew language,
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.120]   which is what it was written in and translated to English,
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.200]   it was a song that rhymed together.
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.120]   So a lot of the things you almost miss out on,
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.360]   so we'll try to highlight some of those,
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:38.760]   because it was just like a song.
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:42.400]   It had moments where it rhymed and flowed together.
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.360]   And in the song, it has three different characters.
[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:48.400]   It has a man, a woman, and her friends.
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.720]   It has a man who speaks about 30% of the time,
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.800]   a woman who speaks about 55% of the time, feels normal,
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.720]   and then her friends, 'cause it's like,
[00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.360]   man, if you're gonna be my lover,
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.320]   you gotta go with my friends.
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.080]   And that's what we're gonna trace and see
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.140]   as we explore this book together.
[00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:04.880]   And tonight, we're gonna look at the chase.
[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:05.720]   What do I mean by the chase?
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.400]   I mean those kind of initial stages in dating
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:09.380]   where the book starts off.
[00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:12.180]   I don't know if you are in the middle of a chase right now,
[00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:15.420]   if you are like, I haven't had anyone chasing me
[00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:18.440]   in years or ever, or you are someone
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:19.700]   who probably needs to stop chasing,
[00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:23.160]   'cause they said no, but it's applicable to all of us,
[00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.560]   'cause at some point, that initial stage of relationship
[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.180]   is gonna be a part of your life.
[00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:30.000]   And what does it look like to successfully navigate
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.540]   those waters together?
[00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:35.660]   Most of you will be married in the next decade,
[00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:36.500]   statistically.
[00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:38.080]   It's not a guarantee, I'm not making promises,
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.580]   but statistically, the majority of you
[00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:42.520]   in the years that you're a part of are gonna decide
[00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.360]   who is gonna be your spouse.
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.680]   And next to who is gonna be the God that you worship,
[00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.600]   who is going to be the person you marry
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.980]   is one of the most important decisions that you can make.
[00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:53.200]   And so if we're gonna do so and have the opportunity
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.960]   to learn from what God says this is who you should look for,
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:57.960]   this is how you should handle the chase,
[00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:01.080]   what a tragedy it would be to not take advantage of that
[00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:02.480]   and to learn from Miley Cyrus
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.080]   versus the God of the universe.
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.240]   So in this book, we're gonna go through the chase,
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:10.340]   dating and engagement, the wedding night and sex,
[00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:13.440]   conflict, how to stay in love after you fall in love,
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.160]   and kind of a till death do us part,
[00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.520]   continuing to move together and marry together.
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.080]   So tonight, I'm gonna read the verses
[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:20.480]   that we'll cover from this first chapter.
[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:21.920]   There's a lot of Bible we're about to cover,
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:23.740]   a chapter and six verses total.
[00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:24.960]   So if you didn't get a quiet time in,
[00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:26.320]   you're about to get it in right now.
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:28.200]   Here we go, we're gonna start in verse two.
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.360]   After verse one, he says, "The song of songs,"
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:33.760]   Solomon's song, and it immediately launches into her.
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:35.540]   She's the first one speaking.
[00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:37.820]   "Let him," talking about her boo,
[00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:40.240]   "kiss me with the kisses of his mouth,
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:43.400]   "for your love is more delightful than wine.
[00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:46.340]   "Pleasing is the fragrance of his perfumes.
[00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:49.260]   "Your name is like perfume poured out.
[00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.140]   "No wonder the young women love you.
[00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:53.180]   "Take me away with you, let us hurry.
[00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:55.860]   "Let the king bring me into his chambers."
[00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:57.340]   The friends jump in, they say,
[00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:00.620]   "We rejoice and delight in you, you too.
[00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:02.920]   "We will praise your love more than wine.
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:05.140]   "How right they are to adore you."
[00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:06.740]   Her speaking, "Dark am I,"
[00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:07.940]   talking about her skin complexion,
[00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:10.980]   "yet I'm lovely, daughters of Jerusalem.
[00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:12.980]   "Dark like the tents of Kadar,"
[00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:14.180]   which is just this kind of tribe
[00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:16.180]   that made these dark tents,
[00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:18.860]   "like the tent curtains of Solomon.
[00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:20.660]   "Do not stare at me because I'm dark,
[00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:22.980]   "because I've been darkened by the sun.
[00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:24.940]   "My mother's sons were angry with me,
[00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:27.620]   "and they made me take care of the vineyards,
[00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:29.340]   "and my own vineyards I hadn't neglected."
[00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:30.580]   So she's just, in that culture,
[00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:31.820]   it would have been attractive,
[00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:33.300]   unlike in our culture where it is like,
[00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:35.020]   everyone is trying to get tan.
[00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:36.100]   In that culture, everyone was trying
[00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:37.860]   to not be tan, 'cause it showed
[00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:39.580]   that you were out working in the fields a lot
[00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:41.660]   if you were dark, showed you were a commoner.
[00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:42.740]   So she's basically saying, like, man,
[00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:44.060]   she's got this humble insecurity
[00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:45.260]   about the way that she looks,
[00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.140]   but she also knows that she's lovely.
[00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:51.560]   Verse seven, she speaks to him,
[00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:56.800]   "Tell me, you whom I love, where you graze your flocks,
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:59.220]   "and where you rest your sheep at midday.
[00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:01.460]   "Why should I be like a veiled woman
[00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:03.420]   "besides the flocks of your friends?"
[00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:08.620]   He speaks and responds in a flirty, almost playful way,
[00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:11.220]   "If you don't know most beautiful of women,
[00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:12.940]   "follow the tracks of the sheep,
[00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:15.540]   "and graze your goats, your young goats,
[00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:17.380]   "by the temps of his shepherds."
[00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:21.020]   You know exactly where I am, lady, you come and get me.
[00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:24.040]   Verse nine, he speaks, "I liken you, my darling,
[00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:26.860]   "to a mare among Pharaoh's chariot horses."
[00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:28.900]   I'm gonna come back to that, 'cause he's not just saying,
[00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:30.320]   girl, you like a horse.
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:33.940]   Your cheeks are beautiful, and your earrings,
[00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:35.220]   your neck with strings of jewels,
[00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:38.240]   will make earrings of gold studded with silver.
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:39.420]   While the king was at his table,
[00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:42.820]   my perfume, she's speaking, spread its fragrance.
[00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:44.260]   My beloved is like a sachet,
[00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.620]   that's just kind of like a necklace with a sack on it,
[00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:49.020]   of myrrh, that's perfume, that would have been in there,
[00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:50.980]   resting between my breasts.
[00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:53.420]   My beloved is to me a cluster of henna blossoms
[00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:54.920]   from the vineyards of En Gedi.
[00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:58.300]   "How beautiful are you, my darling," he says,
[00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:01.380]   "Oh, how beautiful, your eyes are like doves."
[00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:03.500]   Doves could only focus on one thing at a time,
[00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:05.540]   so he's not saying, you have birdie little eyes,
[00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:09.460]   he's saying, you only have eyes for me.
[00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:11.220]   "How handsome are you, my beloved,
[00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:13.620]   "oh, how charming," she says to him.
[00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:17.260]   Our bed is verdant, or green, as in, of grass,
[00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.220]   and the beams of our house are cedars,
[00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:21.020]   rafters and firs, talking about the kind,
[00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:22.840]   they're outside in a park, if you will,
[00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:24.340]   having a conversation.
[00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:29.260]   She says, "I am a rose of Sharon, a lily of the valley."
[00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.260]   He says, "Like a lily among thorns
[00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.540]   "is my darling among young women."
[00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:39.220]   She says, "Like an apple tree among the trees of the forest
[00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:40.760]   "is my beloved among the young men.
[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:42.880]   "I delight to sit in his shade,
[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:45.360]   "and his fruit will be sweet to my taste.
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.640]   "Let him lead me into the banquet hall,
[00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:49.020]   "and let his banner over me be love."
[00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:50.280]   Beautiful.
[00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:51.800]   "Strengthen me with raisins," she says,
[00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:54.660]   "refresh me with apples," those are aphrodisiacs.
[00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:57.760]   "For I am faint with love.
[00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:58.860]   "His left hand is under my head,
[00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:00.420]   "and his right hand embraces me.
[00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:03.800]   "Daughters of Jerusalem," she then turns
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:05.260]   and talks to her friends.
[00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.560]   Actually, she's getting all hot and bothered.
[00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:11.340]   "I charge you by the gazelles and does of the field,
[00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:15.420]   "do not arouse or wake in love till it so desires."
[00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:18.560]   What I wanna cover tonight as it relates to the chase
[00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:21.260]   is I would call red flags in romance.
[00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:22.600]   I wanna look at some of the characteristics
[00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:24.140]   that mark this couple's relationships,
[00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:25.460]   and there are five red flags
[00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:28.220]   that if they do not mark your relationship,
[00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:30.540]   or if the things that we're gonna cover
[00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:32.320]   are absent from your relationship,
[00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:33.660]   you should be concerned.
[00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:37.580]   And as you navigate the waters of a relationship someday,
[00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:39.040]   'cause maybe you're like, "Man, I'm single,
[00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:42.420]   "and I have no way to apply this right now."
[00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:44.620]   In some context, in some future day,
[00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:47.060]   you may enter into a relationship,
[00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:48.780]   and you need to know, "Hey, these are red flags
[00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:51.620]   "I should really be concerned about."
[00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:53.220]   Consistent red flags all throughout the Scripture,
[00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:55.580]   the Bible says, but tonight we're gonna see it
[00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:57.760]   as we look at some of the characteristics
[00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:59.060]   that mark their relationship,
[00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:00.460]   and if they're absent from yours,
[00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:01.460]   you should be concerned.
[00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:02.700]   So red flags in dating.
[00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:04.660]   The first red flag that I wanna highlight
[00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:07.220]   comes from the first couple verses that she said,
[00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:11.300]   and it's that you should have a red flag
[00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:12.940]   if what attracts you to them
[00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:16.220]   does not include their character.
[00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:17.220]   If what attracts you to them
[00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:18.380]   does not include their character,
[00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:21.080]   or when their character is not what attracts you to them.
[00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:21.920]   Red flag number one.
[00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:22.940]   Why do I say that?
[00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:24.300]   She basically, the first verse,
[00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:25.460]   it says, "Hey, let him kiss me."
[00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:26.580]   Another translation says,
[00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:29.420]   "Kiss me, and kiss me, and kiss me again."
[00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:30.420]   And she's basically going like,
[00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:33.220]   "Dude, this is a guy, I want him to lay one on me right now."
[00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:34.220]   And if you read that, you're going,
[00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:37.740]   "What has possibly got her so in the mood?"
[00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:39.460]   And she says, "Here's why.
[00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:41.300]   "My man," verse three,
[00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:44.380]   "is pleasing in his fragrance and perfumes."
[00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:48.200]   But he says, "But his name or his reputation,
[00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:52.420]   "the person that he is, is like perfume poured out."
[00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:54.460]   In the original Hebrew, it actually all rhymes together,
[00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:55.300]   but she basically says like,
[00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:57.060]   "Dude, this brother smells good,
[00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:59.460]   "but even better than how he smells on the outside
[00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:02.220]   "is the type of person he is on the inside."
[00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:04.140]   His reputation, his name,
[00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:07.160]   is like the highest and greatest perfume
[00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:08.220]   that there could be.
[00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:09.660]   It's of incredible value.
[00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:13.140]   What attracts her most to him
[00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:14.780]   was not an outside appearance,
[00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:17.860]   but his character, his reputation,
[00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:19.620]   who he was as a person.
[00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:20.440]   And this drove her to go,
[00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:22.140]   "Man, that is someone that I want to be
[00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:24.060]   "in a relationship with."
[00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:28.820]   Is what attracts you to the person that you're dating,
[00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:32.140]   their character, like who they are,
[00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:33.640]   their relationship with Jesus,
[00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:37.260]   their ability to be trustworthy.
[00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.740]   The person, not just how they look on the outside,
[00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:41.660]   but are you attracted to, can you with integrity,
[00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:42.980]   like if you're dating someone right now,
[00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:43.980]   is part of what attracts you,
[00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:45.380]   and I'm not saying, like physical attraction,
[00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:46.940]   dude, I hope you're madly in love
[00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:49.420]   and madly attracted on the outside of what they look like.
[00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:51.280]   But if you don't have a character
[00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:52.700]   that you're also attracted to,
[00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:54.940]   you are attracted to something that is fleeting,
[00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:57.660]   declining, and the Bible says deceiving.
[00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:00.340]   It's going away, the character's gonna be there.
[00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:01.960]   And so if you do not have someone,
[00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:03.620]   or if the character of the person that you're dating
[00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:06.340]   in a relationship is not attractive to you,
[00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:08.300]   you should be concerned.
[00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:10.740]   Is what attracts you to them their love for people?
[00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:12.140]   The way they treat people?
[00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:14.820]   The way they use their time, the words that they say?
[00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:17.080]   The way they keep their word or promises?
[00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:19.760]   Do they seem like someone who's gonna be a good mom
[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:20.820]   or a good dad?
[00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:25.020]   Someone that you want your daughters to be like someday.
[00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:29.260]   Someone you want your sons to be like someday.
[00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.420]   Is what attracts you to them, your character.
[00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:33.460]   Girls, the Bible says that a man
[00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:35.780]   is supposed to lead you in marriage.
[00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:38.500]   And if you're gonna allow somebody to lead you
[00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:41.340]   in a relationship, in your marriage,
[00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:43.860]   I cannot stress enough,
[00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:48.220]   you need to be asking, who is leading him?
[00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:51.140]   If you're gonna allow him to lead your life,
[00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:52.500]   he's gonna lead the direction of your family,
[00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:54.180]   lead your children someday.
[00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:56.260]   Ask them the question, is he being led by himself,
[00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:58.900]   by his own desires, by his future work preferences
[00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:00.380]   and his dream for his life,
[00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:03.080]   or is he led by the Spirit of God and the Word of God?
[00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:04.840]   And the same I would say to guys.
[00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:06.340]   Guys, if you're gonna ask a girl,
[00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:08.660]   and you wanna know, is this a girl who's gonna be like,
[00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:10.380]   dude, she's just gonna wear me,
[00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:12.860]   I cannot stress this so important.
[00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:14.420]   There's so many beautiful women
[00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:17.260]   who guys go in and they're like, oh man,
[00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:18.700]   they're just, look at her, this is amazing,
[00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:20.540]   we're gonna have this amazing sex someday,
[00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:22.740]   and they get in and the wife is nagging,
[00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:24.740]   she doesn't love them, she doesn't love Jesus,
[00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:28.700]   she's selfish, she ends up just doing anything
[00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:32.300]   but pursuing God's best, and they're just really hot.
[00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:36.620]   And that honeymoon sex, it faded away,
[00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:38.540]   and now the relationship and romance is cold.
[00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:40.300]   You need to be asking, hey, this is a woman
[00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:43.780]   that I wanna covenant my life with.
[00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:45.140]   Can she follow me?
[00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:46.320]   How do I know if she can follow me?
[00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:48.640]   Is she following Jesus right now?
[00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:50.780]   And so the way that you can determine,
[00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:53.140]   like, is this someone who has character in their life,
[00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:55.860]   is like, hey, what if they're a guy, what is leading him?
[00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:57.740]   What's directing his life?
[00:15:57.740 --> 00:15:59.180]   Is he a part of a church and committed
[00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:00.500]   underneath the authority of elders?
[00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:02.940]   'Cause that's what the Spirit of God in the Bible says,
[00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:04.100]   it leads men to do.
[00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:08.940]   Is she being led to spend time caring for other people?
[00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:10.460]   Does she serve with her gifts?
[00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:12.980]   That's what someone who follows Jesus is gonna do.
[00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:16.100]   What is the character of the person that you're dating?
[00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:20.460]   And if they are not someone who is following Jesus,
[00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:21.940]   focusing on the relationship with them,
[00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:24.220]   where character, who they are as a person,
[00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:27.300]   is what jumps out and attracts you to them,
[00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:28.940]   you should be concerned.
[00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:34.100]   This is so huge, and I'm gonna try to say this
[00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:35.180]   as gently as I can.
[00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:41.240]   Bad character attracts bad character.
[00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:44.740]   And good character attracts good character.
[00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:46.820]   In other words, they find each other.
[00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:48.660]   Like if you're, and so bear with me,
[00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:49.940]   if you are in a place where you're like,
[00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:51.900]   dude, I've just been in one dysfunctional relationship
[00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:53.340]   after the next, all men are pigs,
[00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:55.900]   can't believe these guys are just a bunch of jerks out there,
[00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:57.100]   this is just what they are,
[00:16:57.100 --> 00:17:00.180]   and I've just had like seven messed up jerk guys
[00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:02.420]   take advantage of me, it's just what guys do.
[00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:08.380]   Who's the common denominator in all of those relationships?
[00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:11.060]   It's you.
[00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:13.780]   Or they're hot.
[00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:16.500]   But it's you.
[00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:18.220]   Like if you're dysfunctional,
[00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:19.820]   I've said before, my wife is a counselor,
[00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:20.980]   she'll always just say like,
[00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:23.820]   man, the level of dysfunctionalness in a person,
[00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:27.340]   it's like the other person will find
[00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:29.060]   that same person of dysfunction.
[00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:30.660]   The best way that you can set yourself up
[00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:31.660]   to have the type of marriage
[00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:33.340]   and to find the type of spouse that you want
[00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:35.500]   is to focus on your character.
[00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:36.340]   Because the opposite is true,
[00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:38.380]   like someone of good character who's following Jesus,
[00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:40.780]   who cares about the things God cares about,
[00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:43.620]   they're not gonna date someone who has bad character.
[00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:45.420]   You know that, right?
[00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:47.060]   Like in other words, you feel like, man,
[00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:48.740]   what the Bible says, when it lays out,
[00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:50.260]   like this is what a godly husband should be,
[00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:53.140]   should lay his life down for his wife
[00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:54.940]   and serve her and care for her
[00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:56.860]   and spend time with his kids
[00:17:56.860 --> 00:17:58.940]   and sacrifice all of his desires
[00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:00.660]   to care for the needs of his family,
[00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:04.580]   that's a really mature character man.
[00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:08.340]   And the best way that you can focus on
[00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:10.220]   making sure that you move in the direction
[00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:12.020]   of having that type of man in your life,
[00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:13.780]   and it's not guaranteed,
[00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:15.500]   but the best way that you can move in that direction
[00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:17.180]   is by being that type of,
[00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:21.380]   or being the type of person that that man is looking for.
[00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:23.340]   'Cause a man of incredible character
[00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:24.580]   is not gonna be like, oh, you know what,
[00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:27.060]   you know, she's out, she's probably gonna sleep around,
[00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:29.380]   she's got kind of this side addiction
[00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:30.380]   or she drinks a little too much,
[00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:32.340]   but dude, she is smoking hot.
[00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:34.380]   That's not a man of character.
[00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:35.660]   And so the best thing you can do right now
[00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:38.820]   is focus on working on your relationship with Jesus,
[00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:39.820]   not focusing on dating.
[00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:41.260]   Some of you may need to break up and just say,
[00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:42.540]   I'm gonna go to the region,
[00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:43.980]   I'm gonna work on my character,
[00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:46.220]   I'm gonna develop and become the type of person
[00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:48.300]   that God wants me to be.
[00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:49.780]   And I'm gonna set myself up, hopefully,
[00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:52.460]   to find a spouse that has that same vision,
[00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:55.980]   shares those same values and character,
[00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:57.220]   which lasts far longer
[00:18:57.220 --> 00:18:59.820]   than the physical characteristics
[00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:03.260]   that I see today that are gonna be gone tomorrow.
[00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:05.020]   I had a friend recently call
[00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:07.220]   and they were sharing about a relationship
[00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:08.340]   that they had just formed,
[00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:10.180]   they had not been walking with Jesus
[00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:12.220]   for really any amount of time,
[00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:14.860]   and really kind of in general,
[00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:16.020]   they'd just kind of been in and out,
[00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:17.300]   they'd been in some rehab,
[00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:18.460]   and God's grace is big enough
[00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:19.940]   and bigger than all of that stuff,
[00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:22.220]   but just had just been a mess.
[00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:24.100]   And they called and they were like,
[00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:27.340]   hey, got this new girl, you're gonna love her,
[00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:29.700]   she's a church girl, loves Jesus, Christian,
[00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:31.380]   it's been great, we're going to church together,
[00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:32.220]   living together.
[00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:33.660]   And my biggest red flag was like,
[00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:36.620]   man, I don't know that that's true.
[00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:40.140]   I don't know that she is falling in Jesus,
[00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:41.340]   because she's dating you.
[00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:43.580]   And if she was following Jesus,
[00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:46.420]   she would be dating someone who's following Jesus.
[00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:47.940]   And you're not following Jesus right now.
[00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:49.820]   And so my biggest flag and biggest concern about her
[00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:51.700]   is that she's dating you.
[00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:53.140]   And you need to get healthy,
[00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:56.660]   you need to get into an abiding relationship with Christ,
[00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:58.980]   you need to get in community with other people around you,
[00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:01.340]   and as gently and as compassionately as I can,
[00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:02.580]   I don't mean to say that to pick on you,
[00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:05.940]   'cause that's applicable to some of us in the room.
[00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:09.100]   The biggest concern I would have
[00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:10.940]   is that they're dating you.
[00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:13.260]   And you need to say,
[00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:15.380]   man, I've just not been following what God says for me,
[00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:16.620]   but what the Bible lays out,
[00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:19.740]   a type of romance and love that is possible for me,
[00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:22.380]   the type of peace that can mark my home
[00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:24.700]   and my children could grow up in,
[00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:26.820]   I would love to have that.
[00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:29.260]   And God says, work and focus on your character.
[00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:31.340]   So the first quality, first red flag is that
[00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:32.540]   what attracts you to them is not their character.
[00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:34.980]   The second quality is when others
[00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:36.340]   don't celebrate their relationship.
[00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:37.780]   You see in verse four,
[00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:39.540]   that the friends chime in and they say,
[00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:44.540]   we rejoice and delight in you, you too.
[00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:46.620]   We praise your love more than wine,
[00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:48.220]   how right they are to adore you,
[00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:49.540]   more than wine or more than the party,
[00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:51.060]   essentially, that would be.
[00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:53.220]   Hey, better than any weekend party thing
[00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:55.140]   that we're getting together is this relationship.
[00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:56.380]   They had friends in their life being like,
[00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:57.300]   dude, this is amazing.
[00:20:57.300 --> 00:20:59.580]   You guys are better together than you are apart.
[00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:01.380]   We celebrate, we're all about it.
[00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:02.940]   Why do I say the word celebrate?
[00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:04.940]   Because the people in your life
[00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:06.140]   are not coming alongside and going like,
[00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:08.940]   I'm not just kind of neutral on you guys moving forward,
[00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:11.380]   but this is a great thing.
[00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:13.500]   People in your community group or your small group,
[00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:16.580]   people who are believers in your family or friends,
[00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:17.420]   people coming around being like,
[00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:19.300]   this is awesome, I support this.
[00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:20.980]   I support you dating him.
[00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:23.420]   He's the type of guy that I wanna date someday
[00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:27.020]   or that I hope my children end up dating.
[00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:29.860]   Oftentimes, the inverse is true.
[00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:33.020]   Where people in our life try to tell us like,
[00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:33.940]   hey, I'm just concerned.
[00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:35.420]   He doesn't seem like that great.
[00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:37.980]   He doesn't seem like that great of a guy.
[00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:39.780]   Or I'm not sure he's the right one for you.
[00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:41.820]   And if that is things that you're hearing,
[00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:43.260]   you should be concerned.
[00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:46.500]   Whoever over and over says that God's provision
[00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:49.140]   and protection for us is other believers in our life
[00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:51.140]   speaking out the truth of what they see.
[00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:54.460]   Oftentimes, this leads people to go,
[00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:56.220]   to almost like buy this lie that's like,
[00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:58.380]   you know what, the world is just against us.
[00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:00.420]   Everyone's jealous of our love together,
[00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:02.700]   and they don't like it because they just can't have it,
[00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:04.940]   and it's so sizzly together, and I don't even care.
[00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:06.700]   I'm disconnecting from everyone.
[00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:08.060]   This couple didn't do that.
[00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:09.980]   How do I know that?
[00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:12.300]   Because you can't celebrate what you don't see.
[00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:13.660]   And they had people in their life going like,
[00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:15.060]   this is a great thing.
[00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:17.940]   Are people in your life encouraging
[00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:19.100]   and celebrating the relationship,
[00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:21.500]   or are they concerned about it?
[00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:23.600]   And if so, you should be concerned.
[00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:27.140]   If you have believers in your life,
[00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:27.980]   and you're dating someone,
[00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:31.300]   I wanna encourage you to ask them these two questions.
[00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:32.340]   Like in your community group,
[00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:35.660]   I wanna invite you to take advantage of what God says,
[00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:38.140]   that plans fail for lack of counsel.
[00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:40.700]   Over and over, the prophets say like,
[00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:42.340]   man, you gotta have wise people in your life
[00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:43.180]   speaking into it.
[00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:44.500]   So I wanna invite you, if you're dating someone,
[00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:45.340]   and you're in a community group,
[00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:47.060]   or you're in a small group, or someday if you ever are,
[00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:48.900]   to invite them in and ask them this question.
[00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:50.920]   I wanna hear from each of you.
[00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:54.060]   Does anything that you see in my relationship with him,
[00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:55.740]   or my relationship with her,
[00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:57.820]   give you pause about us moving forward?
[00:22:57.820 --> 00:22:59.600]   Honestly.
[00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:03.420]   Does anything that you see in my relationship with him,
[00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:05.540]   or in him, or in her,
[00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:07.740]   give you pause about us moving forward?
[00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:08.580]   Honestly.
[00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:11.880]   And invite them to speak in.
[00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:15.440]   And the second question being,
[00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:19.340]   do you think that we're good together?
[00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:22.940]   Do you think that we're good together?
[00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:25.060]   If you're in the room, and maybe you're like,
[00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:26.740]   dude, I have a friend that is in a relationship,
[00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:29.860]   it just seems toxic, I'm concerned about them,
[00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:31.780]   I don't think he's a believer, or she's a believer,
[00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:34.820]   just I feel a burden, and maybe I should say something,
[00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:35.660]   how do I do that?
[00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:36.860]   Here's how you do that.
[00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:39.500]   You go to them individually,
[00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:45.020]   and humbly, and prayerfully,
[00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:49.660]   you just say, man, can I just share with you what I see?
[00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:53.340]   I'm concerned about Rob.
[00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:55.980]   I'm concerned about Jessica, I'm concerned about her,
[00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:57.540]   and here's the three things that I've noticed
[00:23:57.540 --> 00:23:58.380]   that could be wrong,
[00:23:58.380 --> 00:24:01.300]   I'm gonna be open to the fact that you may be wrong,
[00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:03.300]   but just communicate, as someone who loves you
[00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:06.580]   and cares about you, is committed to seeing you flourish
[00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:07.980]   like I hope you are for me,
[00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:10.820]   I just felt like I had to bring this up,
[00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:13.660]   'cause I'm concerned, I have so many friends,
[00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:15.700]   or know so many people just in doing this
[00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:17.260]   for the last 10 plus years,
[00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:21.160]   that they didn't have friends in their life
[00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:23.380]   that spoke those truths, and everybody saw it,
[00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:26.060]   'cause here's the deal, dude, most people, we see it.
[00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:30.220]   It's not crazy where it's like, oh yeah, I saw that coming,
[00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:32.700]   and they ended up divorcing one another,
[00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:34.700]   just entirely fell apart,
[00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:37.180]   and nobody ever told them the truth in that dating phase.
[00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:39.100]   And the worst thing you can do, candidly,
[00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:40.380]   is stop being the friend who,
[00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:42.140]   when you don't think a relationship is healthy,
[00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:43.660]   follow them on Instagram together and be like,
[00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:45.220]   oh my gosh, heart, heart, heart, love this,
[00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:47.220]   when they post a picture of them two together,
[00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:49.860]   and you're like, yes, this is so beautiful, I love it,
[00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:51.300]   hope I get in the bridal party,
[00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:53.400]   that you are not being a good friend.
[00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:56.740]   But you can be a good friend,
[00:24:56.740 --> 00:24:59.020]   but it involves you going, if you see something,
[00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:00.360]   and saying something.
[00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:01.500]   So that's the second quality,
[00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:03.940]   is, or second red flag that you should have,
[00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:06.660]   is that people in your life, or other believers,
[00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:08.460]   are not celebrating the relationship together.
[00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:09.300]   The third one,
[00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:12.500]   is really almost personal,
[00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:13.940]   but the best way I know how to put it,
[00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:16.820]   is a red flag of like, whenever you are not okay,
[00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:18.980]   or they are not okay being single.
[00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:19.820]   Why do I say that?
[00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:23.100]   'Cause one of my favorite lines in this first chapter
[00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:25.460]   is what she says to the guy, where she says,
[00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:30.420]   tell me you whom I love, where you graze your flock,
[00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:32.880]   where you rest your sheep at midday.
[00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:34.640]   Why should I be like a veiled woman
[00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:37.540]   beside the flocks of your friends?
[00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:39.620]   She's basically like, hey, where you at, boy?
[00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:41.100]   I wanna come and be around you.
[00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:42.260]   What gym do you go to?
[00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:43.300]   I wanna go to that gym.
[00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:44.140]   Where do you live?
[00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:46.240]   I'm gonna, you know, put myself in your presence.
[00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:47.740]   I want to be around you.
[00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:50.860]   And then she says, and I'm not just looking for any man.
[00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:53.180]   Why would I wanna be like a veiled woman
[00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:54.020]   that's a prostitute?
[00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:55.620]   She's basically like, hey, I'm interested
[00:25:55.620 --> 00:25:56.900]   in waiting for the right person,
[00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:58.500]   and if I don't find the right person,
[00:25:58.500 --> 00:25:59.980]   I'm not just gonna put myself out there
[00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:01.740]   among the flocks of your friends,
[00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:04.080]   or among the flocks of other people.
[00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:05.740]   I'm looking and waiting for the right person.
[00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:09.060]   She was content with being single.
[00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:11.120]   It was okay if she wasn't in a constant state
[00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:13.120]   of being in a relationship with someone.
[00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:17.860]   Are you someone that is okay in this season of singleness?
[00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:20.960]   That you're allowing God to grow your patience,
[00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:23.020]   grow your contentment in him?
[00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:24.220]   You're allowing God to teach you,
[00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:26.300]   and you're believing and seeking to trust,
[00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:27.900]   man, Jesus is enough, I'm okay.
[00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:29.220]   I'm not going from one relationship
[00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:32.140]   to the next relationship to the next relationship.
[00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:33.140]   Are you someone who's like, man,
[00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:35.580]   I've never been single for more than three months?
[00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:39.900]   And it may be that you're not okay being single.
[00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:42.540]   And that may be something that you need
[00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:44.700]   with other people in your life to evaluate.
[00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:47.900]   The second thing I love about that verse
[00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:52.180]   is it answers a question that so many girls ask all the time.
[00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:53.860]   One of the most common things that we got asked this week
[00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:56.100]   was like, hey, is it okay for a girl
[00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:58.260]   to show she's interested in a guy?
[00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:01.180]   And this woman would say yes.
[00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:02.300]   I mean, that's pretty forward, where you're like,
[00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:04.980]   hey, boo, where you gonna be, 'cause I'm gonna be there.
[00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:07.360]   And I may just conveniently show up and be like,
[00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:10.700]   oh, I didn't know that you shopped at this grocery store.
[00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:12.300]   But I followed you here, so now I do.
[00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:15.700]   And this is great, should we go in together?
[00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:19.140]   And he was reciprocating.
[00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:20.340]   He was like, girl, you know exactly
[00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:21.600]   where I shop at this grocery store.
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:24.420]   You followed me here, I saw it, I liked it, okay?
[00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:26.980]   And that's what happened.
[00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:28.940]   It's like it's catty and it's flirty
[00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:30.300]   and it goes back and forth.
[00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:35.740]   But she, she puts herself out there.
[00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:38.140]   And in some ways, I think that's an okay thing.
[00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:39.620]   Generally speaking, guys, step up.
[00:27:39.620 --> 00:27:42.700]   There's a bunch of godly, amazing, beautiful girls
[00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:44.120]   in this room, ask 'em out.
[00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:47.060]   But also, women, I don't think it's inappropriate
[00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:49.900]   for you to put together an event
[00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:51.640]   and strategically try to put yourself
[00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:53.440]   in the presence of godly men.
[00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:56.380]   Be like, hey, we're going to the movies
[00:27:56.380 --> 00:27:57.740]   and I'm inviting these other four people
[00:27:57.740 --> 00:27:59.300]   so I can invite you, wanna ride together?
[00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:02.820]   And I think there's some level where that's okay.
[00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:04.920]   Or throwing it out on the radar.
[00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:08.020]   You probably should realize, and my team told me
[00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:10.220]   not to say this, but I'm going here anyways.
[00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:14.600]   Guys are a lot less intelligent than you think.
[00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:18.960]   So when you throw the event, yeah, claps, good.
[00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:20.280]   When you throw the event, you're like,
[00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:22.120]   oh man, I'm totally putting myself out here.
[00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:23.720]   Like, hey, do you wanna, we go to the movies
[00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:25.260]   with all these people and ride together.
[00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:27.840]   He's going, oh, I love that movie, that sounds great.
[00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:29.440]   I wanna see Avengers.
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:30.560]   For real, you drive?
[00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:32.680]   I love to save on gas, this is cool.
[00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:33.520]   He had no idea.
[00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:37.200]   So you just need to know, it's,
[00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:38.760]   and I know there's some guys that are picking it up
[00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:40.260]   in the room, I was not one of them.
[00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:42.980]   And in fact, I don't know that I would be married
[00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:45.000]   if my wife didn't throw herself on the radar
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.020]   out there to me.
[00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:47.920]   Where we were working at this Christian camp
[00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:51.640]   and I was teaching at the camp over a couple summers
[00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:54.640]   and I remember she wrote these different notes to me,
[00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:55.720]   like just for encouraging.
[00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:56.760]   And I didn't know her well.
[00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:59.240]   I knew that she, we had gone to the same college
[00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:02.000]   and knew of her character, knew positive things,
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.080]   but she wrote these notes and she was like,
[00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:05.680]   I was totally putting myself out there.
[00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:08.040]   And I just read the note like, oh my gosh, that's so nice.
[00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:10.720]   She loved the message, that's amazing, this is great.
[00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:13.740]   But it did put her on my radar in a way
[00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:15.040]   that only continued to grow from there.
[00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:17.120]   So all that to say, point being,
[00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:18.800]   is it okay to strategically put yourself
[00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:20.360]   in the presence of godly men?
[00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:21.200]   Yes.
[00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:23.400]   Hopefully that answers your question.
[00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:24.240]   All right.
[00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:28.760]   Moving on to red flag number four.
[00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:33.920]   When there is lack of clarity in the relationship,
[00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:35.360]   you should be concerned.
[00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:39.140]   When there is lack of clarity in the relationship,
[00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:40.320]   you should be concerned.
[00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:42.920]   This is a couple and the guy leads well
[00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:46.480]   by defining who she is to him,
[00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:48.040]   both to her and everyone else around him.
[00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:49.140]   What do I mean by that?
[00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:51.240]   On multiple occasions, like that mayor,
[00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:53.040]   where he brings up, hey, you're like the mayor
[00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:55.560]   of Pharaoh's chariots, or the mayor
[00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:57.560]   that pulls Pharaoh's chariots.
[00:29:57.560 --> 00:29:58.920]   What does that even mean?
[00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:01.900]   Well, the horses that would line whenever Pharaoh
[00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:03.640]   would go to war, he'd bring all the soldiers out
[00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:06.140]   and they'd go out to war and they'd form this huge line
[00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:07.780]   of all the warriors together and there would be
[00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:10.160]   black stallions that lined, it was an intimidating force.
[00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:12.000]   You'd see black horse, black horse, black horse,
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.080]   except for right in the middle would be Pharaoh
[00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:16.560]   and he would be led by a white mayor,
[00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:19.600]   a white female horse.
[00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:21.560]   So Solomon's basically saying, hey, you're like
[00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:23.740]   the only one for me, you're my bae.
[00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:27.160]   You're before anybody else, you are the only girl for me.
[00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:28.800]   Everything else, I'm not even seeing it.
[00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:30.160]   You're one of a kind, that's how I see you.
[00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:34.240]   And then she says that I am like a rose of Sharon
[00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:35.680]   and a lily of the valleys.
[00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:39.320]   It's an incredibly beautiful verse,
[00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:43.400]   unless you actually study what that verse means.
[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:45.400]   And what I mean is like a rose of Sharon
[00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:47.780]   was an incredibly common flower.
[00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:51.280]   And a lily of the valley was like very, very common.
[00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:52.880]   In other words, she's saying like I'm nobody,
[00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:55.040]   I'm nothing special, I'm just kind of a commoner.
[00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:57.200]   I'm like a dandelion amongst a field of weeds.
[00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:58.720]   That's who I am, I'm nothing special.
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:01.180]   She's almost doing what I feel like girls still do today
[00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:03.440]   where they downplay themselves in hopes that the guy
[00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:05.480]   would be like, no, you're not.
[00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:06.480]   You know what I mean?
[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:09.480]   Where girls are like, oh my gosh, look at this picture.
[00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:12.080]   Oh, I just, oh, this is, ah, I look terrible in it.
[00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:15.920]   And you're hoping the guy isn't like, oh, yeah, yeah.
[00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:18.400]   [audience laughing]
[00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:21.040]   That is not your color for sure.
[00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:22.440]   It's okay, everyone has bad hair days.
[00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:23.720]   I mean, you'll get an accent.
[00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:25.920]   You're hoping the guy is like, are you serious?
[00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:29.960]   You look like Mona Lisa is put to shame right now.
[00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:31.200]   Which is not that hard to do.
[00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:34.200]   [audience laughing]
[00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:36.900]   It's not my notes, I apologize, that one got me, okay.
[00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:39.720]   I lost track of thought.
[00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:41.780]   The point being, you hope the guy is like,
[00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:43.280]   man, you are beautiful.
[00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:45.000]   That's what you look like to me.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.360]   And luckily, our Don Juan responds and says,
[00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:49.480]   hey, this is who you are.
[00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:50.880]   You're not some lily of the valley.
[00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:55.200]   You are like a lily among thorns is my darling
[00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:57.640]   among all the other women.
[00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:00.080]   Like, you are the only girl for me.
[00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:02.600]   Every other woman is like a thorn compared to this lily.
[00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:05.520]   That's how I see you, that he drives for clarity
[00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:06.600]   in the relationship with her.
[00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:09.940]   She does the same in her comment about her myrrh
[00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:10.880]   being around her necklace.
[00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:12.240]   The myrrh would have been the most valuable thing
[00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:13.320]   and possession that she would have,
[00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:15.240]   and she'd be like, hey, this is this incredibly
[00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:17.560]   valuable thing to me, that's who you are.
[00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:19.480]   And you rest, and you are as it were,
[00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:23.180]   resting close to my heart, this thing of incredible value.
[00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:25.180]   In a verse later, a couple of verse later
[00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:28.440]   in chapter two, verse four, so two verses later,
[00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:30.320]   he literally says, hey, let him lead me
[00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:32.320]   into his banquet hall, let his banner over me be love.
[00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:33.160]   What does that mean?
[00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:35.200]   It's incredibly beautiful, whatever it means.
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:36.440]   But here's what it means.
[00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:38.120]   A banner over something would signify
[00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:42.420]   like this is whose this is, or it kind of designates
[00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:44.960]   like this is who I am and whose I am.
[00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:46.920]   Like similar to a flag, you know at the Olympics
[00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:48.800]   when all the teams come in and they carry the flags,
[00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:50.360]   and they're like, oh, there's Jamaica,
[00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:53.080]   and there's USA, and there's just all the different teams.
[00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:54.920]   In the same way, when you went off to war,
[00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:56.920]   people would carry a banner, and it would declare
[00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:58.840]   we're the nation of Israel, we're the people of God.
[00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:00.240]   And she's saying, hey, when I go in,
[00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:02.000]   it's like I went into his banqueting hall,
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.340]   the palace banqueting hall, publicly on display
[00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:07.920]   for everybody, and his banner over me was love.
[00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:09.200]   This is my girl.
[00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:12.800]   He was not ashamed to publicly display, this is my girl.
[00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:14.880]   He brought clarity to the relationship.
[00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:17.040]   The Facebook status was changed.
[00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:19.520]   He was willing to say, I'm in with this girl,
[00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:21.940]   I'm in love, and I don't care who knows it,
[00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:24.080]   is essentially what he's saying right there.
[00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:26.640]   If you're in a relationship, and the guy or the girl
[00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:28.360]   is unwilling, and you've been dating for more
[00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:29.720]   than a couple dates, or you've been dating
[00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:32.740]   for more than a month, and they're unwilling
[00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:36.040]   to acknowledge publicly that there's something
[00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:37.760]   going on there, you should be concerned
[00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:39.960]   that you're not dating, you're getting played.
[00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:44.920]   Because a godly guy with character, and a godly girl
[00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:46.580]   is gonna fight to bring clarity
[00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:48.880]   to that relationship together.
[00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:50.960]   The clarity should mark the relationship together.
[00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:53.220]   Solomon did not leave her wondering.
[00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:54.440]   One of the best things, as we've talked about
[00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:57.040]   so many times, guys, is you will set yourself
[00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:58.760]   ahead of the pack if you will just do this.
[00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:00.640]   If you wanna be a guy who you're like, man,
[00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:03.560]   I wanna wake up and be 10 points more attracted
[00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:06.080]   to women tomorrow, be a guy who leaves
[00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:08.040]   by removing confusion.
[00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:09.760]   Don't leave them wondering, don't leave them going,
[00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:11.560]   man, where's this thing kinda going together?
[00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:14.180]   You bring clarity, I'd like to take you out.
[00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:15.640]   Then at the end of that date, if you wanna continue
[00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:17.720]   moving forward, you say, I'd like to continue
[00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:19.280]   taking you on another date.
[00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:21.100]   I enjoyed our time together.
[00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:23.280]   I'd love to spend time getting knowing you.
[00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:25.920]   When you feel like it's clear in your head
[00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:27.440]   you'd like to do that again, or you'd like
[00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:29.520]   to spend more time, you sit them down,
[00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:31.920]   or you call them, or you communicate to them,
[00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:34.240]   I would love to continue getting to know you
[00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:35.520]   in an intentional way.
[00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:36.760]   I'm not sure we're gonna get married,
[00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:37.920]   I'm not promising any of that stuff,
[00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:41.520]   I just would like to continue spending time with you.
[00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:44.800]   And you just tell and telegraph, or you communicate,
[00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:46.560]   like here's where I see this going.
[00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:49.280]   Is that okay with you?
[00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:51.520]   And girls, when they do that, if you're not in,
[00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:54.420]   don't be like, uh, yeah, and then just ghost 'em
[00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:56.200]   and not ever respond.
[00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:58.040]   You say, I'm not interested right now.
[00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:00.720]   Thank you for honoring me in the way that
[00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:02.440]   you've communicated and spending time with me,
[00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:04.320]   but I'm not interested in moving forward.
[00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:08.000]   You communicate intentionally and drive for clarity
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:08.840]   in the relationship.
[00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:10.840]   You need to be intentional, at the same time,
[00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:12.080]   just don't be intense.
[00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:13.960]   I also have had guys that feel like they need
[00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:15.640]   to telegraph every five seconds when they're
[00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:16.480]   with that person.
[00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:20.760]   Like, I am now going to sit down and use the salt here,
[00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:24.800]   and I would like to spend more time with you,
[00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:28.000]   and I have already chosen six children's names,
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.500]   if you would like, just be intentional.
[00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:31.920]   You don't need to be intense, you don't need to be weird,
[00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:33.560]   just be like, just consistently be like,
[00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:35.520]   here's where I see the relationship going,
[00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:36.840]   and then define the relationship.
[00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:39.360]   See the responsibility on you to define it.
[00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:42.600]   And women, bring clarity on those moments
[00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:44.040]   if you don't want the relationship to keep going,
[00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:46.820]   but if there's not clarity driven around your relationship,
[00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:48.080]   you should be concerned.
[00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:51.040]   You should be concerned.
[00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:54.720]   You shouldn't be spending, and I think the further
[00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:57.280]   implication would be like, publicly,
[00:35:57.280 --> 00:36:00.680]   you should be declaring, if you're in a dating relationship,
[00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:04.440]   like, it should be no mystery to the world around you.
[00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:07.160]   Like, I am with her, she's the one I'm spending time with.
[00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:09.400]   You're not texting other girls, you're not sliding
[00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:12.600]   into DMs and telling them like, oh, it's other random people
[00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:14.040]   just kind of putting feelers out in case
[00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:15.480]   this thing falls apart.
[00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:18.800]   You're not posting a lot of comments on other girlfriends
[00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:21.640]   of like, man, you look so great, good to see ya.
[00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:23.840]   You know, if you make it to town, love to catch up.
[00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:25.120]   You're not spending a lot of one-on-one time,
[00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:27.360]   or maybe any one-on-one time with other girls
[00:36:28.420 --> 00:36:31.220]   that you are bringing clarity to the relationship.
[00:36:31.220 --> 00:36:34.100]   And whatever clarity you have in that moment,
[00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:36.020]   you don't have to say like, I've heard from the Lord,
[00:36:36.020 --> 00:36:37.020]   we're getting married.
[00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:38.820]   (congregation laughing)
[00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:41.140]   In fact, that's probably a miss.
[00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:48.020]   I'm gonna go ahead and say, is a miss, in my opinion, okay?
[00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:52.380]   The point being, bringing clarity as you have it.
[00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:55.100]   And guys, at the same time, and girls, respect
[00:36:55.100 --> 00:36:57.180]   when someone says, no, I'm not interested in moving forward.
[00:36:57.180 --> 00:36:58.420]   You should respect them.
[00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:01.700]   And if you don't listen to that,
[00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:03.420]   and you're unwilling to respect them,
[00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:04.980]   you are disrespecting them.
[00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:07.580]   And let me just, this isn't even in my notes,
[00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:08.580]   but let me just say this.
[00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:11.580]   The picture the Bible paints in 1 Peter chapter three
[00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:13.420]   about the way that you and I are to interact with,
[00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:15.100]   and I'm just talking to guys, with girls,
[00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:17.060]   is kind of terrifying.
[00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:19.700]   Where it says that God is like a heavenly father,
[00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:24.700]   and he sees his daughters like any son sees their daughter.
[00:37:25.060 --> 00:37:27.780]   So you should see, like, man, you're not just treating
[00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:29.780]   this woman, you're responsible for how you interact
[00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:30.620]   and how you treat them.
[00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:32.140]   And you should see, you know that dad who sits
[00:37:32.140 --> 00:37:34.220]   on the front porch with like the shotgun, like,
[00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:35.340]   (imitates gun firing)
[00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:38.140]   take care of my girl, son.
[00:37:38.140 --> 00:37:41.020]   That's how you should see a heavenly father.
[00:37:41.020 --> 00:37:43.380]   And you are accountable and responsible.
[00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:45.020]   Listen to me, you are accountable and responsible
[00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:46.380]   for how you treat them.
[00:37:46.380 --> 00:37:48.860]   And at the same time, women, you're accountable
[00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:50.060]   and responsible for how you interact
[00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:52.700]   and how you're honest with guys.
[00:37:52.700 --> 00:37:54.860]   So the fourth one was that, and the fifth one,
[00:37:54.860 --> 00:37:58.220]   final one, final red flag, is when you are
[00:37:58.220 --> 00:38:01.340]   sexually compromising, or when you're compromising sexually.
[00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:05.660]   She says this in verse three of chapter two.
[00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:08.940]   Like an apple tree, among the trees of the forest
[00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:11.540]   is my beloved among young men.
[00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:13.580]   I delight to sit in his shade,
[00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:15.620]   and his fruit is sweet to my taste.
[00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:17.700]   Scholars disagree on what this verse means.
[00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:19.260]   So I'm gonna give you both,
[00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:21.340]   because it's rated R for romance.
[00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:24.420]   One interpretation, the clearest thing is that
[00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:25.940]   she's at least saying, you're like an apple tree
[00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:28.580]   among all the other forest trees that are all normal.
[00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:30.420]   You're unique to me.
[00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:33.900]   And then the next verse, scholars would disagree and say,
[00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:35.580]   she's either talking about looking forward
[00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:40.100]   to performing oral sex, or she is saying that
[00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:43.540]   I delight to be a part of the protection and provision
[00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:46.660]   that being under his tree brings me.
[00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:49.980]   And scholars will disagree across the board.
[00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:51.060]   You decide for you.
[00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:52.740]   The point being, we at least know
[00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:53.820]   she's getting all hot and bothered
[00:38:53.820 --> 00:38:55.340]   because the next couple verses say that
[00:38:55.340 --> 00:38:57.260]   she is looking forward to increasing amounts
[00:38:57.260 --> 00:39:00.980]   of sexual touch to come in marriage.
[00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:04.060]   'Cause she says this, strengthen me with raisins,
[00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:06.300]   refresh me with apples, I'm faint with love.
[00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:07.980]   Both of those are aphrodisiacs.
[00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:09.900]   King David, when his men came home from war,
[00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:12.500]   he literally gave out raisins and apples to his men,
[00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:14.780]   saying, hey, eat these, go be with your wives,
[00:39:14.780 --> 00:39:16.620]   make some babies, and that's what he handed out.
[00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:18.220]   It was an aphrodisiac that's seen in that day.
[00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:19.660]   So she's basically going, oh my,
[00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:20.700]   (laughing)
[00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:23.220]   (laughing)
[00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:25.780]   oh man, I want this man.
[00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:29.660]   And give me some apples and raisins, I'm faint with love.
[00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:31.020]   His left hand is under my head,
[00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:33.060]   his right hand embraces me.
[00:39:33.060 --> 00:39:35.660]   And then she says, daughters of Jerusalem,
[00:39:35.660 --> 00:39:38.500]   I charge you by the gazelles and the does of the field,
[00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:41.620]   do not arouse or awaken love until it's time,
[00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:44.180]   or until it so desires.
[00:39:44.180 --> 00:39:45.860]   What is she saying?
[00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:47.620]   Do not introduce sex
[00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:52.140]   before you can fully go all the way.
[00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:58.140]   Do not introduce sex biblically until you're married.
[00:39:58.140 --> 00:40:00.780]   And that's what the word arouse means.
[00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:03.620]   I mean, there's a reason why we call it turned on.
[00:40:03.620 --> 00:40:07.180]   God designed you to be turned on in the context of marriage.
[00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:08.100]   You don't need to feel bad about that.
[00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:11.220]   You don't need to feel bad about having sexual desire
[00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:13.460]   for the person that you're dating.
[00:40:13.460 --> 00:40:14.940]   That's called normal.
[00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:18.140]   But you should be aware that that's not something
[00:40:18.140 --> 00:40:20.700]   that you should allow to mark your relationship.
[00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:23.100]   You should be very cautious to not allow that turning on,
[00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:24.380]   'cause you weren't designed to be turned on
[00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:25.340]   and then turned off.
[00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:27.540]   You were designed, and God created sexual intimacy
[00:40:27.540 --> 00:40:29.860]   to be something that you experience,
[00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:31.340]   that the human body is wired
[00:40:31.340 --> 00:40:32.780]   to pursue that intimacy together.
[00:40:32.780 --> 00:40:34.300]   And she just says, hey, look, man,
[00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:37.020]   even though all these desires are here,
[00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:39.340]   we're not going there until we can go all the way,
[00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:41.380]   until we are married, the Bible says.
[00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:44.020]   And if you are compromising sexually,
[00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:47.220]   you should be concerned, should be a red flag.
[00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:49.940]   If the guy that you're dating,
[00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:51.700]   or the girl that you're dating is saying,
[00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:53.660]   I don't care what God says,
[00:40:53.660 --> 00:40:55.220]   I'm gonna do what my body says,
[00:40:55.220 --> 00:41:01.340]   I'm not gonna honor sex inside of marriage,
[00:41:01.340 --> 00:41:03.380]   what do you think is gonna happen someday?
[00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:07.460]   When he is married, he's gonna immediately flip the switch
[00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:09.620]   and be like, now I honor sex inside of marriage?
[00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:12.780]   The Bible says, man, do not arouse,
[00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:14.420]   don't bring that into your relationship.
[00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:16.540]   Don't even put yourself in a position together
[00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:18.060]   where you're laying down, where you're spending time,
[00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:20.820]   where your body is beginning to prepare itself for sex.
[00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:23.460]   It was not designed and created to be that way.
[00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:25.580]   Here's why I think this is so crazy to us,
[00:41:25.580 --> 00:41:26.820]   but so important.
[00:41:26.820 --> 00:41:28.540]   The Bible says, and it's so brilliant, dude,
[00:41:28.540 --> 00:41:30.140]   like God, in his infinite wisdom,
[00:41:30.140 --> 00:41:31.980]   he gave sex, he's all about it, dude.
[00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:34.700]   Like here's an answer to the question
[00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:35.980]   everyone wants to know all the time.
[00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:37.460]   Hey, where is the line?
[00:41:37.460 --> 00:41:39.900]   Where is the line, how far is too far, where's the line?
[00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:42.020]   The Bible doesn't say there's a line.
[00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:43.820]   It says there's a time.
[00:41:43.820 --> 00:41:45.060]   It's not concerned about, oh, man,
[00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:46.340]   this is exactly where the line is.
[00:41:46.340 --> 00:41:49.540]   It says, man, the line is we're gonna explore
[00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:51.500]   is pretty far out there.
[00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:53.140]   It's more concerned about when the time is,
[00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:55.340]   and that's in the context of marriage
[00:41:55.340 --> 00:41:56.580]   for a couple reasons.
[00:41:56.580 --> 00:41:59.260]   One, sex was given as this powerful thing
[00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:01.460]   to glue a man and woman together,
[00:42:01.460 --> 00:42:04.980]   that they would become almost intoxicated
[00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:06.340]   and bonded together.
[00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:08.260]   It even says that sex is intoxicating
[00:42:08.260 --> 00:42:11.540]   and it's like getting drunk, the Proverbs say,
[00:42:11.540 --> 00:42:13.980]   in Proverbs chapter seven, verse 18.
[00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:15.820]   And the reason why that's so crucial
[00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:20.420]   is just like it's bad to drive after you're drinking,
[00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:25.420]   it is bad to date drunk in sex.
[00:42:25.420 --> 00:42:28.300]   And alcohol probably, not even probably, yes,
[00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:29.820]   it's bad to date drunk too.
[00:42:29.820 --> 00:42:33.380]   But it's bad to be intoxicated in sex
[00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:34.340]   because here's what it's gonna do.
[00:42:34.340 --> 00:42:35.900]   It's gonna keep you in a relationship
[00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:38.020]   longer than you should be in.
[00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:40.140]   Just like alcohol, it numbs your inhibitions
[00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:42.220]   of like, oh, man, I was gonna go home,
[00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:44.900]   but now I'm just hanging out for another party.
[00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:47.700]   And you just like quickly, inhibitions go.
[00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:49.660]   So it is with sex.
[00:42:49.660 --> 00:42:52.380]   And it blinds you to like, man, there's character flaws,
[00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:53.900]   and it does what sex is meant to do.
[00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:55.780]   Like this is the amazing thing God's designed.
[00:42:55.780 --> 00:42:57.900]   It's like I'm gonna give you this powerful thing
[00:42:57.900 --> 00:42:59.620]   that's gonna give you the ability
[00:42:59.620 --> 00:43:03.620]   to even overlook offenses because you love them so much.
[00:43:03.620 --> 00:43:07.620]   It's gonna pour this intimacy to bond you together
[00:43:07.620 --> 00:43:09.820]   where you're willing to bear with each other,
[00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:11.820]   which is amazing in marriage.
[00:43:11.820 --> 00:43:13.500]   It's not great when you are dating someone
[00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:15.380]   of really bad character.
[00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:16.620]   It's not great when you're dating someone
[00:43:16.620 --> 00:43:18.980]   and there's clear warning signs that, man,
[00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:20.780]   this is not someone that you should marry.
[00:43:20.780 --> 00:43:24.100]   But sex, just like getting drunk on alcohol,
[00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:26.180]   you're getting drunk and it blinds you from like,
[00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:29.100]   oh, man, this is, I'm no longer able to see as clearly.
[00:43:29.100 --> 00:43:30.540]   You're putting on drunk goggles
[00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:32.060]   as you're dating that person.
[00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:34.220]   And the Bible says when it comes to the selection
[00:43:34.220 --> 00:43:38.340]   of who you're going to marry other than worshiping God,
[00:43:38.340 --> 00:43:40.340]   what else is more important?
[00:43:40.340 --> 00:43:42.100]   And so introducing that is incredibly dangerous.
[00:43:42.100 --> 00:43:44.220]   The second thing and reason why it's dangerous
[00:43:44.220 --> 00:43:47.460]   is think about the just number of scars.
[00:43:47.460 --> 00:43:48.700]   Think about just the guilt and shame
[00:43:48.700 --> 00:43:50.300]   represented inside of this room.
[00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:53.700]   If you're engaging in sexual activity
[00:43:53.700 --> 00:43:56.060]   with someone that you're dating right now,
[00:43:56.060 --> 00:43:59.900]   God has never wanted that for you.
[00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:03.180]   Not 'cause he's angry at sex or angry at you, he loves you.
[00:44:03.180 --> 00:44:05.660]   Think about just the scars that people carry uniquely
[00:44:05.660 --> 00:44:06.740]   from sexual sin.
[00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:10.100]   God didn't give instructions 'cause he's like,
[00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:12.300]   man, I just don't want anybody to have fun with this.
[00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:13.340]   Are you kidding?
[00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:16.780]   We're about to dive in to all types of sexuality
[00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:19.780]   and we're not gonna be able to save it
[00:44:19.780 --> 00:44:21.940]   for everything that they do in the book.
[00:44:21.940 --> 00:44:23.780]   It's very all about it.
[00:44:23.780 --> 00:44:26.500]   But that romance being in marriage
[00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:29.300]   and he gives instruction and context
[00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:32.540]   because this incredibly powerful thing that is sex
[00:44:32.540 --> 00:44:36.260]   is also incredibly destructive if used in the wrong way.
[00:44:36.260 --> 00:44:37.380]   It's like this.
[00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:39.460]   There was a couple months ago where in Dallas,
[00:44:39.460 --> 00:44:43.580]   there was a storm and it marked the,
[00:44:43.580 --> 00:44:45.220]   it basically like ripped up all kinds of trees.
[00:44:45.220 --> 00:44:46.500]   Yeah, welcome to church.
[00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:49.500]   It ripped up all kinds of trees in our neighborhood
[00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:51.580]   and it tore down trees and like, dude, it was just a mess.
[00:44:51.580 --> 00:44:52.420]   If you guys were here in Dallas
[00:44:52.420 --> 00:44:53.340]   or you live in any of the neighborhoods,
[00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:55.060]   there were trees every single place
[00:44:55.060 --> 00:44:58.580]   and while we were looking, I basically was like,
[00:44:58.580 --> 00:44:59.780]   man, I need to get a chainsaw.
[00:44:59.780 --> 00:45:01.020]   One, 'cause that'd be awesome
[00:45:01.020 --> 00:45:03.140]   and two, because we need to cut back some of this brush.
[00:45:03.140 --> 00:45:05.340]   Just is like we're living in a jungle right now
[00:45:05.340 --> 00:45:07.300]   and so what happens when you get a chainsaw?
[00:45:07.300 --> 00:45:09.380]   Well, you go and you begin to examine
[00:45:09.380 --> 00:45:10.740]   and you put it all together
[00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:15.740]   and you begin to look very carefully at the instructions
[00:45:15.740 --> 00:45:17.900]   that Home Depot gives you 'cause you're like,
[00:45:17.900 --> 00:45:20.540]   one thing I know is I like my fingers
[00:45:20.540 --> 00:45:22.620]   and so I'd like to keep them.
[00:45:22.620 --> 00:45:24.380]   So I wanna make sure that I have the right amount of oil,
[00:45:24.380 --> 00:45:26.220]   that I use it in the right way,
[00:45:26.220 --> 00:45:27.540]   that I'm not careless with it,
[00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:28.820]   that I follow the instructions
[00:45:28.820 --> 00:45:31.620]   and I keep it away from the ability to cut off limbs
[00:45:31.620 --> 00:45:32.940]   'cause it's incredibly powerful
[00:45:32.940 --> 00:45:34.820]   but it's also very, very dangerous
[00:45:34.820 --> 00:45:36.460]   and so just like in that scenario.
[00:45:36.460 --> 00:45:39.380]   (chainsaw buzzing)
[00:45:39.380 --> 00:45:49.380]   This thing could tear through, thank you.
[00:45:49.380 --> 00:45:51.300]   (audience laughing)
[00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:53.100]   I've prepared all day for this moment
[00:45:53.100 --> 00:45:56.820]   and this thing could tear through my leg.
[00:45:56.820 --> 00:46:02.140]   It also could remove brush, it'd be an incredible tool
[00:46:02.140 --> 00:46:04.020]   and you know what I didn't think with Home Depot
[00:46:04.020 --> 00:46:05.580]   and you know what nobody thinks with Home Depot?
[00:46:05.580 --> 00:46:08.220]   Is there like instructions.
[00:46:08.220 --> 00:46:11.140]   These guys are a bunch of killjoys over here,
[00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:11.980]   are you kidding me?
[00:46:11.980 --> 00:46:13.380]   I'm gonna use this thing however I want to,
[00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:15.540]   toothpick, juggle it around,
[00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:16.940]   I'll do whatever I want Home Depot,
[00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:18.860]   you bunch of fun killers.
[00:46:18.860 --> 00:46:20.980]   No, I thought, yeah, I'm gonna read every word
[00:46:20.980 --> 00:46:22.900]   and be careful 'cause this thing I know
[00:46:22.900 --> 00:46:27.900]   is incredibly powerful and it is incredibly helpful
[00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:29.780]   and good when it's used in the wrong way
[00:46:29.780 --> 00:46:33.220]   but it is incredibly dangerous
[00:46:33.220 --> 00:46:35.100]   when it's taken out of the context
[00:46:35.100 --> 00:46:38.460]   and used in a way that contradicts
[00:46:38.460 --> 00:46:39.940]   the creator's instructions.
[00:46:39.940 --> 00:46:45.140]   The Bible says this is how sex is.
[00:46:45.140 --> 00:46:46.620]   God created it and he's all about it
[00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:47.780]   and he wants that powerful tool
[00:46:47.780 --> 00:46:49.260]   just like somebody at Home Depot
[00:46:49.260 --> 00:46:51.180]   wants you to use that chainsaw to cut through things
[00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:54.580]   and cut back debris, doesn't want you to use it
[00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:55.700]   to cut off your hand.
[00:46:55.700 --> 00:46:58.620]   And so it gives instructions.
[00:46:58.620 --> 00:47:00.340]   So God says, man, I want you to use
[00:47:00.340 --> 00:47:02.680]   and experience this incredible tool and gift
[00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:04.740]   but I give instructions on how to best do
[00:47:04.740 --> 00:47:05.900]   and best experience that
[00:47:05.900 --> 00:47:09.180]   because I love you and I care about you.
[00:47:09.180 --> 00:47:10.500]   And I'll close here.
[00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:15.420]   In conclusion, things to focus on are red flags
[00:47:15.420 --> 00:47:16.820]   you should be concerned about.
[00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:18.380]   Character is not something that's drawing you
[00:47:18.380 --> 00:47:20.100]   to the other person, you should be concerned.
[00:47:20.100 --> 00:47:24.300]   If others don't celebrate their relationship in your life,
[00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:25.660]   that should give you pause.
[00:47:25.660 --> 00:47:28.680]   If it was formed or is being formed
[00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:31.260]   in a season where you're not okay being single,
[00:47:31.260 --> 00:47:33.160]   you should be concerned.
[00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:36.060]   If clarity doesn't market and purity doesn't market,
[00:47:36.060 --> 00:47:37.280]   you should be concerned.
[00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:41.160]   My heart for this series is that you and I
[00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:43.340]   will begin to experience God's design
[00:47:43.340 --> 00:47:45.740]   for romance and love inside of your relationship.
[00:47:45.740 --> 00:47:49.460]   I had porch leaders, some of our volunteers
[00:47:49.460 --> 00:47:50.940]   that lead different teams over to my house
[00:47:50.940 --> 00:47:53.580]   and over Christmas break and had a Christmas party
[00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:54.740]   and did the whole white elephant here,
[00:47:54.740 --> 00:47:56.900]   tacky sweaters, Christmas party, everything was great.
[00:47:56.900 --> 00:47:58.220]   Whole night was going amazing
[00:47:58.220 --> 00:48:00.420]   and I had a fire pit set up in the backyard
[00:48:00.420 --> 00:48:02.040]   where I was gonna have just fire
[00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:03.360]   and a moment where we'd come together,
[00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:05.500]   kind of family time all together.
[00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:10.380]   And I forgot that I just had wood and lighter fluid.
[00:48:10.380 --> 00:48:12.100]   And I put the wood inside of there
[00:48:12.100 --> 00:48:15.700]   and I forgot to light that wood before everybody came out.
[00:48:15.700 --> 00:48:16.580]   So I was like, oh, I'll just light it
[00:48:16.580 --> 00:48:17.660]   while everyone's out here.
[00:48:17.660 --> 00:48:19.220]   And if you've ever lit a fire,
[00:48:19.220 --> 00:48:23.460]   it takes some time to get that wood to actually burn
[00:48:23.460 --> 00:48:26.060]   unless there's a foundation of kindling
[00:48:26.060 --> 00:48:28.500]   or other things that help it to burn
[00:48:28.500 --> 00:48:30.540]   and to continue to burn long term.
[00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:31.940]   In other words, you can throw a lighter fluid on there
[00:48:31.940 --> 00:48:34.340]   but it's up and then it's gone.
[00:48:34.340 --> 00:48:38.380]   Versus if you have the right foundation burning beneath it,
[00:48:38.380 --> 00:48:40.100]   it's gonna take longer,
[00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:44.940]   but it's gonna burn hotter and burn longer.
[00:48:44.940 --> 00:48:48.540]   The book of Song of Solomon is God writing to you,
[00:48:48.540 --> 00:48:50.580]   to me, to people everywhere.
[00:48:50.580 --> 00:48:53.620]   I want your romance in life to not be something like,
[00:48:53.620 --> 00:48:55.500]   it's up in a moment and then it's gone,
[00:48:55.500 --> 00:48:57.580]   but something that with the right foundation
[00:48:57.580 --> 00:49:00.260]   is gonna burn longer and hotter,
[00:49:01.260 --> 00:49:04.300]   more in a way that you want it to for the rest of your life
[00:49:04.300 --> 00:49:05.300]   because he loves you.
[00:49:05.300 --> 00:49:09.300]   And what I hope for this series more than anything
[00:49:09.300 --> 00:49:12.760]   is that you, if you're dating,
[00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:15.460]   or maybe you just got out of a relationship
[00:49:15.460 --> 00:49:16.900]   and you're just walking through heartbreak
[00:49:16.900 --> 00:49:20.340]   and just all the horrific stuff that it is to break up,
[00:49:20.340 --> 00:49:21.180]   it's terrible,
[00:49:21.180 --> 00:49:24.180]   that throughout this series,
[00:49:24.180 --> 00:49:25.260]   you would not just be focused on,
[00:49:25.260 --> 00:49:26.420]   man, what are some of the red flags
[00:49:26.420 --> 00:49:29.780]   that I should be looking for, but you would be willing.
[00:49:29.780 --> 00:49:31.380]   And even tonight, you wouldn't just leave here
[00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:34.500]   and focus on one individual or maybe those five red flags,
[00:49:34.500 --> 00:49:37.340]   but you would just say, God, I surrender.
[00:49:37.340 --> 00:49:40.940]   I'm waving the white flag over my dating relationship,
[00:49:40.940 --> 00:49:43.340]   over my life, I'm saying, God, I give it all to you.
[00:49:43.340 --> 00:49:45.040]   I'm gonna trust you and I'm gonna do your way.
[00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:47.180]   I'm gonna date like you call me to.
[00:49:47.180 --> 00:49:48.660]   And I hope this series and our team is praying
[00:49:48.660 --> 00:49:51.700]   for this series to just unleash incredible marriages
[00:49:51.700 --> 00:49:52.700]   in the future of our country,
[00:49:52.700 --> 00:49:54.260]   incredible marriages inside of this room
[00:49:54.260 --> 00:49:55.580]   that you would rise up and just say, man,
[00:49:55.580 --> 00:49:56.980]   I'm gonna surrender this to you.
[00:49:56.980 --> 00:49:59.020]   I haven't done it well, I've really messed up.
[00:49:59.020 --> 00:50:00.460]   I've got all red five flags.
[00:50:00.460 --> 00:50:02.140]   I've got 'em here with me if you wanna see 'em.
[00:50:02.140 --> 00:50:04.100]   No matter where you are in the room,
[00:50:04.100 --> 00:50:06.060]   you would say, man, I'm gonna surrender to God.
[00:50:06.060 --> 00:50:09.140]   I'll wave just the white flag, God, I wanna do it your way
[00:50:09.140 --> 00:50:11.420]   because he is crazy about you.
[00:50:11.420 --> 00:50:14.100]   The greatest love story that is contained in the Bible
[00:50:14.100 --> 00:50:20.000]   beyond song of song is the love story of God's love for you.
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:21.860]   He's madly in love with you.
[00:50:21.860 --> 00:50:23.340]   I mean, like insane in love.
[00:50:23.340 --> 00:50:26.460]   Like, we are coming in.
[00:50:26.460 --> 00:50:28.860]   I love my wife so much.
[00:50:28.860 --> 00:50:30.580]   You know what sometimes I think about?
[00:50:30.580 --> 00:50:32.100]   I think about I don't know what I would do
[00:50:32.100 --> 00:50:34.380]   if something ever happened to her.
[00:50:34.380 --> 00:50:37.780]   Both like raising children and operating
[00:50:37.780 --> 00:50:40.220]   and also like I would be so heartbroken.
[00:50:40.220 --> 00:50:43.780]   I sometimes get sad about the day that we're ever separated
[00:50:43.780 --> 00:50:45.020]   if one of us dies first.
[00:50:45.020 --> 00:50:49.860]   And I've said before and I'll say it again,
[00:50:49.860 --> 00:50:52.460]   there is no husband, there is no wife,
[00:50:52.460 --> 00:50:54.780]   there is no person who loves their spouse
[00:50:54.780 --> 00:50:58.260]   more than God loves you.
[00:50:58.260 --> 00:50:59.180]   How do I know that?
[00:50:59.180 --> 00:51:03.380]   Because he already went to the greatest length possible
[00:51:03.380 --> 00:51:06.440]   by sending his son to die in your place,
[00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:09.060]   by God becoming a man in the form of Jesus
[00:51:09.060 --> 00:51:11.140]   and giving his life for you.
[00:51:11.140 --> 00:51:13.500]   And his love for you is so great
[00:51:13.500 --> 00:51:15.140]   and for us to think anything other than man,
[00:51:15.140 --> 00:51:17.560]   I wanna surrender even my dating life.
[00:51:17.560 --> 00:51:19.980]   I'll give it to you, God, 'cause you're crazy about me.
[00:51:19.980 --> 00:51:21.140]   I know you're for me.
[00:51:21.140 --> 00:51:24.380]   You know what's best for me.
[00:51:24.380 --> 00:51:26.060]   I'm gonna follow your instructions
[00:51:27.580 --> 00:51:30.420]   knowing that you love me and you'll lead me in a life.
[00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:33.580]   And I'm praying that some of us in the room,
[00:51:33.580 --> 00:51:36.700]   'cause a lot, maybe not even most of you are gonna do it,
[00:51:36.700 --> 00:51:38.540]   but some of you guys are gonna say,
[00:51:38.540 --> 00:51:40.380]   man, I'm gonna do it God's way.
[00:51:40.380 --> 00:51:41.220]   Go on forward.
[00:51:41.220 --> 00:51:43.380]   I'm gonna date his way.
[00:51:43.380 --> 00:51:45.780]   We're gonna handle sex his way.
[00:51:45.780 --> 00:51:48.700]   We're gonna pursue marriage his way.
[00:51:48.700 --> 00:51:52.060]   It's the best way and it's a way I can trust
[00:51:52.060 --> 00:51:54.400]   because he loves me, he's proved it.
[00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:56.180]   And any love I'm gonna experience on this earth,
[00:51:56.180 --> 00:51:57.820]   if it's disconnected from that love,
[00:51:57.820 --> 00:52:00.940]   will not experience the fullness
[00:52:00.940 --> 00:52:03.020]   of the romance I was made for,
[00:52:03.020 --> 00:52:04.340]   which is a romance first with him
[00:52:04.340 --> 00:52:05.720]   and then that bleeds into other ones.
[00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:06.560]   Let me pray.
[00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:08.900]   Father in heaven, I pray that you would,
[00:52:08.900 --> 00:52:11.820]   oh man, unleash the strongest marriages
[00:52:11.820 --> 00:52:15.780]   our world has ever seen from this group in front of me.
[00:52:15.780 --> 00:52:18.360]   I pray that children would be born
[00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:21.080]   to men and women in this room right now
[00:52:21.080 --> 00:52:22.840]   who love you, who know you, who walk with you,
[00:52:22.840 --> 00:52:26.480]   and they would raise those children to know you.
[00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:29.800]   I pray for any relationship here that needs to break up,
[00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:31.200]   that they wouldn't leave here covered in shame,
[00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:32.200]   they wouldn't leave here covered in guilt,
[00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:34.380]   but the spirit of God would be heavy on their hearts,
[00:52:34.380 --> 00:52:36.520]   that sin would be confessed,
[00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:39.080]   and we'd move in the direction of your love.
[00:52:39.080 --> 00:52:42.560]   You've already, out of your love, moved in our direction
[00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:44.720]   and pursued a relationship with us.
[00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:46.800]   Father, would you bless our time this next six weeks?
