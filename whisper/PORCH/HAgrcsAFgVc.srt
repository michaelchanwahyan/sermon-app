1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:18,060
 - Love it.

3
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,920
 We are continuing a series called Missing Out.

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,960
 If you're just joining us, I would highly encourage you

5
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,860
 to go back and listen to the first couple of messages

6
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:25,660
 so you can be totally caught up

7
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:27,400
 in where we are in the series.

8
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,560
 I'm gonna start by asking a question

9
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,160
 that I'm gonna need a little bit of help

10
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,200
 from kind of the first few rows.

11
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,400
 What is the most entertaining part of a wedding

12
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,800
 or wedding and reception?

13
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,340
 - Cake. - Cake.

14
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:38,540
 - The cake, okay.

15
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:41,140
 (audience laughing)

16
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:43,720
 Okay, bouquet throw.

17
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,040
 I would have said bouquet and garter throw.

18
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,880
 And so I'm gonna tell you why.

19
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:51,420
 And it's really maybe the most entertaining for a long time.

20
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,680
 I feel like before I got married,

21
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,200
 it was like my least favorite part of a wedding

22
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,920
 because it felt like the cattle call

23
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,360
 made up by some married person

24
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,800
 trying to set their son up on a date or something.

25
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,300
 Where it's like, everyone who can't get a date

26
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,460
 on the dance floor right now,

27
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:06,800
 single ladies in the background,

28
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,540
 and maybe the bouquet gods can help you.

29
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:12,280
 And so if that wasn't weird enough,

30
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,580
 and then the garter thing,

31
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:15,540
 I don't know where this tradition came from,

32
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,840
 but it's like, we're gonna have this guy

33
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,320
 take this thigh band off.

34
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,380
 And if you guys would be a little bit more diligent,

35
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:25,260
 you could pull off a thigh band as well

36
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,680
 and fire it off into the air.

37
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,960
 But it's definitely maybe the most entertaining part

38
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:35,600
 of a reception because it seems like at every reception,

39
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,960
 there's always like one person who came game face on,

40
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,360
 headband on, they're like ready to go up

41
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,360
 and they're gonna grab that bouquet or that garter.

42
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,240
 They are getting this one

43
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,240
 as though they think it really may work.

44
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,920
 And then there's others who are like intentionally missing

45
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,200
 'cause they don't wanna send the wrong message

46
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,240
 to their date who's there or something.

47
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,080
 All right?

48
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,720
 And here's what's funny is like now,

49
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,700
 this didn't used to be the case,

50
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,820
 but it seems like you go to weddings

51
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,000
 and people will like intentionally step back

52
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,840
 to stay away from it.

53
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,840
 You've seen this before, anyone?

54
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,080
 I heard a story today from a girl on our staff.

55
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,920
 She said she went to a wedding

56
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,320
 and the bride put a $100 bill in the bouquet

57
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:17,280
 because she knew all of her bridesmaids and girlfriends

58
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,640
 did not want to get married,

59
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,720
 but they would want $100 and she wanted a good photo.

60
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:26,700
 And so they were up there grabbing for this $100

61
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:30,180
 because there's something about our generation

62
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:34,100
 that we may not want marriage for some of us,

63
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,920
 though that may not be the case for all of us,

64
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,620
 but everyone wants $100, right?

65
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:41,780
 And so I think really most of us in the room

66
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:44,540
 probably fall into two camps as it relates

67
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:47,420
 to tonight's topic of missing out on love.

68
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,660
 And the first may be that camp of you going,

69
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:52,860
 hey, I'm great with missing out on love right now.

70
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,260
 I do not want a relationship

71
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:55,580
 that is not in the cards for me.

72
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,140
 I'm great in being in that camp.

73
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,460
 And then there's another camp

74
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,500
 where we are figuratively grabbing

75
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,340
 and we would love to take that bouquet home

76
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,580
 where we are so sick of missing out on love.

77
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:09,500
 And it's Valentine's Day week, which only makes it worse.

78
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,780
 Another thing invented probably by a married person

79
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:15,700
 where it's like, we're just gonna celebrate our love,

80
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,300
 the thing that I don't have

81
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,660
 and is totally absent from my life.

82
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:23,660
 And so this week is only made worse

83
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:27,060
 because it just seems like you wish you had a Valentine's.

84
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,100
 You're sick of watching bridesmaids at home

85
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,660
 with your girlfriends and not getting to hang out

86
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,580
 with a Valentine.

87
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,820
 Lots of blank spaces and no names to write in them.

88
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:40,140
 And so, I mean, it's true.

89
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:44,300
 And we wish we were not missing out on love.

90
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,820
 And so here's why I set up with all of that

91
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:48,500
 because inside of those two camps,

92
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,780
 both of them are in danger of missing out

93
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,240
 on what true love really is.

94
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,060
 Like both of those camps in some ways

95
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:58,120
 probably wrongly define what true love

96
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,060
 because the person who doesn't want it,

97
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:03,280
 if she knew or he knew what true love was,

98
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,600
 she would know it is the thing

99
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,700
 or he would know that he or she desires most.

100
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,400
 And that person who's reaching for it,

101
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,440
 I just want it and I just want someone to love me

102
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,420
 and pursue me and I just want someone to take me on dates

103
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,840
 or to go on dates with,

104
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,860
 that person in some ways has wrongly defined

105
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:22,140
 what true love is because even if she or he

106
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,640
 got all of those things,

107
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,580
 she could still be or he could still be

108
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:29,820
 missing out on love, on true love.

109
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:32,220
 And so that's tonight's topic of missing out

110
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,620
 on this idea of true love.

111
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,320
 And here's kind of the big takeaway

112
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,320
 in case I can't keep you engaged for the next 25 minutes

113
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,760
 and you start counting these wood things up here

114
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:45,760
 is that true love always involves God.

115
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,960
 The source of all true love that you and I

116
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,240
 will ever experience always involves God

117
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,440
 because God is love, we're told.

118
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,600
 And the very thing that you came into this world

119
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,680
 desiring most and the thing that you will die

120
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,160
 on your deathbed desiring most is that true love.

121
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,480
 And the good news for all of us is that God has made a way

122
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,080
 and opened a door so that no one would ever have

123
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,160
 to be missing out on love,

124
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,140
 so that no one would ever have to lack that thing

125
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:22,140
 that they desire most and is found only in him.

126
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:23,840
 And so we're gonna be in Ephesians three,

127
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,240
 we're gonna jump around a little bit

128
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,040
 as we discover this topic of what really the Bible

129
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:31,040
 presents to us about this idea of love,

130
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,000
 what true love really is, what it isn't,

131
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,880
 and what it does inside of our life.

132
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,400
 And so we're gonna be in Ephesians chapter three,

133
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,520
 Ephesians was written by the Apostle Paul.

134
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,940
 If you have a Bible with you, you can open up

135
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,400
 Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Acts, Romans,

136
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,080
 Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians.

137
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,800
 If you hit any books before that, just flip back.

138
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,160
 And we'll be in chapter three where Paul is writing

139
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,640
 to this group in Ephesus,

140
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,560
 and he prays this really unique prayer.

141
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:01,040
 It's one of the only places where we see Paul

142
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,120
 say the things that he says and also start it with,

143
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,880
 this is when I get down on my knees.

144
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,320
 I pray for you guys all the time,

145
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,580
 but when I get down on my knees,

146
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,800
 this is the thing that I pray.

147
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,920
 And here's what he says, we're gonna pick up

148
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,380
 in verse 14 of chapter three.

149
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:20,840
 For this reason, I, Paul speaking,

150
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,020
 kneel before the Father from whom every family

151
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,060
 in heaven and on earth derives its name.

152
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:28,800
 So what's unique about this is in this culture,

153
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,680
 we think prayer, we think, hey, I just,

154
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,120
 I get on my knees to pray.

155
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,600
 And in this culture, you didn't.

156
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,000
 It would be only really, really, really unique occasions.

157
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,600
 Generally, prayer would involve standing

158
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,760
 with your hands raised, and Paul says,

159
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,600
 no, I get on my knees and I get on my face,

160
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,640
 and I pray to the God, and then he tries

161
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,080
 to help us see who he's praying to,

162
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:50,560
 how big God is, before whom every family

163
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,360
 and every person that's ever lived

164
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,760
 and ever existed comes from.

165
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:58,000
 And this is what I pray to that huge God, verse 16.

166
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,740
 And I pray that out of the glorious riches,

167
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:05,320
 out of his glorious riches, he may strengthen you

168
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:08,600
 with power through his Spirit in your inner being

169
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:12,240
 so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith,

170
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,920
 that Christ would dwell in the deepest parts of your heart.

171
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:19,760
 And I pray that you, being rooted and established in love,

172
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:23,160
 may have power, think about this,

173
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,160
 together with all God's people,

174
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,360
 to grasp, here's what I want, and here's what I'm praying,

175
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,480
 here's what I'm begging God to give you power

176
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:36,480
 to be able to do, to grasp, hold onto,

177
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:40,800
 how deep, how wide, how long,

178
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,440
 and how deep is the love of Christ,

179
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,920
 to know this love that surpasses knowledge.

180
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,900
 I want you to be able, here's what I'm praying,

181
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,660
 when I get down, in unique occasions,

182
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:53,220
 I pray for you all the time, but when I really get down,

183
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,880
 if there was one thing I could pray,

184
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,080
 it's not God, will you protect this group,

185
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:00,520
 will you enlarge this group, will you bless them,

186
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,680
 any of those things, if there's one thing I'm gonna pray,

187
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,360
 Paul says, it's that you would know

188
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,760
 how deeply loved you are, a love that is beyond

189
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:12,480
 anyone's ability to understand, a love, he says,

190
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,320
 that is so great, that if God does not

191
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,880
 supernaturally intervene, you will not be able

192
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,180
 to understand it, you will not believe it.

193
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:24,840
 I mean, what a bizarre prayer.

194
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,840
 If you could pray anything in the world,

195
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,860
 why would you pray, I am begging the God of the universe

196
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:33,920
 from whom every family that ever existed has come,

197
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:38,920
 to do one thing for you, Ephesians, for you, Christian,

198
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:44,920
 that he would allow your heart to have strength,

199
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:50,180
 supernaturally, to know how deeply loved you are.

200
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:54,140
 And even this week, as I was thinking about

201
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:57,380
 why would you pray that, why is that such a big deal?

202
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:59,660
 'Cause most of us are like, yeah, I know God loves me,

203
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:02,740
 I know, I know he loves me, why would you spend

204
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:06,380
 your prayer, this big prayer, on that?

205
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:10,780
 And then it kinda hit me.

206
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:13,100
 There's one thing that all of us, including the Ephesians

207
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,580
 and all of us in the room, have in common.

208
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:20,380
 Like, we all share this deep desire to be loved,

209
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:24,980
 even the guys, we all share this deep longing

210
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:28,020
 for someone to love us, and then at the same time,

211
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:34,580
 we all share this resistance, that we don't feel lovable,

212
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:40,060
 we don't feel worthy of being loved, or we feel unlovely,

213
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:42,900
 like there's something inside of all of our hearts

214
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:47,300
 that both longs to be loved, and yet resists

215
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:51,300
 the idea that we're worth loving.

216
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:54,160
 And so Paul says, I'm praying that God would break through

217
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,060
 that resistance inside of your heart,

218
00:09:56,060 --> 00:10:01,060
 that you wouldn't be insecure in how God feels

219
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,700
 and what God feels towards you,

220
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:06,540
 that you would be fully filled, he says,

221
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:10,500
 with a knowledge of how much God loves you.

222
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,820
 And think about it, how much of what you and I do

223
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,860
 is driven by the desire to be loved?

224
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,720
 And we may not call it that in that moment,

225
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,620
 but on a daily basis, how much of social media life

226
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,760
 is driven by a desire to be loved, or to be accepted,

227
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,700
 or to be like, typing out a tweet, no, delete it,

228
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:30,240
 it's not witty enough, or taking a picture,

229
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,500
 but you take 16 times just trying to look casual at home,

230
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,600
 nothing going on here, and you're like,

231
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,900
 yeah, this is just how I woke up, and how much,

232
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,580
 or how many times, I feel like I hear this all the time

233
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:44,160
 from my wife, where we'll be in a scenario,

234
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,780
 and someone will take a group picture, and what happens?

235
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,120
 Hey, can I see that?

236
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,940
 We're gonna delete this.

237
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:55,380
 Or it's, hey, can you send that to me,

238
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,680
 because I am looking good in this picture.

239
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:02,220
 Because we wanna project, we want to influence,

240
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,900
 and project out there, we're worthy of being loved,

241
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,500
 and we wanna control the parts of us that think,

242
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,420
 that's not worthy.

243
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:12,780
 I mean, how much of just the way we dress

244
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:18,380
 is driven by tighter, more stylish, whatever it is?

245
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,500
 Love me.

246
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,040
 Love me.

247
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,580
 The jobs that we work, I mean, I have friends

248
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:28,260
 that became doctors because they wanted to be loved.

249
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,420
 I'm worthy.

250
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:35,180
 Plastic surgery is at an all-time high right now.

251
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:38,160
 It's higher than it's ever been, percentage-wise.

252
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,320
 And in terms of numbers.

253
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:45,180
 Because I hate myself.

254
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,540
 I hate the way that I look.

255
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:50,780
 And Paul says, if there's one thing I could pray and ask

256
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:55,780
 that you would really believe, is how deeply loved you are,

257
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:59,320
 that God sees you as worthy of being loved.

258
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,920
 In the midst of the resistance,

259
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:07,020
 unloveliness, or I feel unlovable.

260
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:10,780
 I mean, this is why shame is powerful.

261
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:13,740
 This is why Adam and Eve in the garden

262
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:18,740
 ran and covered themselves, because I don't feel lovely.

263
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:20,620
 I don't feel worthy of being loved.

264
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:23,460
 I'm gonna cover it to hide it.

265
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:27,540
 This part of our heart, I mean, this is why you see

266
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:31,220
 famous people spiral out of control under addictive habits

267
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,380
 or self-destructive tendencies.

268
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:35,020
 This is why Kesha, in a Rolling Stones interview

269
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,020
 you probably may be familiar with, recently said,

270
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:39,420
 look, I'm a crusader for telling other people

271
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,380
 to love themselves, and I hate myself.

272
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:46,140
 Kesha, who's beautiful, who has all the fame,

273
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,780
 all the money, everything that any 26-year-old girl

274
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:52,900
 would, in worldly terms, want, and she says, I hate myself.

275
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:56,420
 And she's not the only one, because there's something

276
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:59,540
 inside of us that both yearns to be loved

277
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:01,260
 and yet feels that resistance.

278
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:05,380
 And so Paul, to the Ephesian church and to us, says,

279
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:10,380
 I'm praying that you would believe how much he loves you,

280
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:15,180
 that you would know his love, a love that is beyond

281
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:19,140
 human ability to understand how deep, how wide,

282
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:24,140
 how big it is for you, not just the world,

283
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:31,260
 for you, so that no one would have to be missing out

284
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,440
 on love, true love.

285
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:43,260
 I think there's a further kind of problem

286
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:46,900
 with our really thinking as it relates to love,

287
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:50,860
 and it's that we live in a world that's so tarnished,

288
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:52,820
 even what I mean by that word, because people

289
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:55,220
 kind of love everything, I love my dog, I love chocolate,

290
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:57,980
 love my wife, I love, love, love.

291
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:02,500
 And if that weren't enough, there's also influences

292
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,580
 constantly hitting our minds of what love looks like,

293
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:09,620
 whether it's The Bachelor, or whether it is Taylor Swift,

294
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:13,020
 song after song after song, or whether it is any

295
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:15,780
 romantic comedy you've ever seen, like this is what

296
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:19,620
 love looks like, and all of those provide poor definitions.

297
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:22,380
 And so God has given us actually a definition

298
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:25,720
 of what his love, what true love, what he feels

299
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,300
 when he looks at you is.

300
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:32,660
 And it's in 1 Corinthians 13, and I've never thought

301
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,260
 about this before, a lot of you are gonna recognize

302
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:37,280
 this passage, 'cause you've heard it at every wedding,

303
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,100
 or at many weddings that you've been to.

304
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:42,180
 And I've never realized this before.

305
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:45,940
 Like this is not, Paul's writing this passage,

306
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,820
 and if you go read it this week, and I would highly

307
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:51,100
 encourage you to, Paul writes this passage,

308
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,300
 and he says, hey, you need to love one another,

309
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:56,820
 love each other, let me tell you what love is like.

310
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,480
 And then he goes off, and I always thought,

311
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,860
 oh, that's how I'm supposed to react, or relate

312
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,500
 to other people, and that's true.

313
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:08,640
 But this is even more describing how God relates to you,

314
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:14,860
 and to me, the definition of true love for you and for me.

315
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:17,260
 And so that's our second point, the definition,

316
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:20,960
 we're gonna be in 1 Corinthians 13, pick it up in verse four

317
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,780
 of how God feels towards you.

318
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:25,620
 Love is patient.

319
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:29,740
 God is patient.

320
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:34,340
 Some of you need to hear that, that was, for me,

321
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,780
 one of the biggest ones of the next few verses this week,

322
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:38,820
 because here's what my heart runs to.

323
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:41,700
 I think that God thinks like I do, and I wonder

324
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:44,660
 if he just looks at me and goes,

325
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,420
 when are you gonna get it together?

326
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,860
 When are you gonna trust me?

327
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:52,700
 When are you gonna really believe that I'm for your good

328
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,020
 and everything you experience is passed through my hands?

329
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,820
 When are you gonna trust me, David?

330
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:00,680
 Does he ever get tired of me?

331
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:05,580
 And he says, no, my love with you is patient,

332
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:08,580
 in the midst of that addiction you're walking through.

333
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:11,500
 In the midst of that relationship you keep going back to

334
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,960
 that you know is not right.

335
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:16,820
 In the midst of whatever sin and whatsoever struggle,

336
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:19,820
 God says, my love for you is patient.

337
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,780
 Here's what else it is, it's kind.

338
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:25,720
 Everything you experience, it may not feel like it,

339
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:29,640
 but it's passed through my hands, and it's kind.

340
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:34,220
 It does not envy, it does not boast.

341
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:37,320
 It is not arrogant or rude.

342
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:40,660
 It does not insist on its own way.

343
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,820
 That love, you may have the version that says,

344
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:46,780
 seeks the benefits of others,

345
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,860
 or seeks after the welfare of others.

346
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:52,140
 How much would it change a lot of our thinking

347
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,140
 if we really believe that?

348
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,300
 Like when God looks at you,

349
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,340
 when he governs life around you,

350
00:16:56,340 --> 00:17:00,620
 he is seeking not for his own best, but for your best.

351
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:03,860
 And a lot of us have never known a love like that.

352
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:07,380
 As many broken families as we come from, mine included,

353
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:10,640
 where I didn't grow up in a home where I knew love

354
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,640
 from a fatherly figure that I could always trust

355
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,540
 was not self-interested.

356
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:20,520
 And God says, my love for you is always driven

357
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:25,400
 by not self-seeking, but other-seeking.

358
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:32,160
 It says that love is not irritable or resentful,

359
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,260
 or it keeps no record of wrongs.

360
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:37,060
 Your translation may have, that God, when he looks at you,

361
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:39,940
 there's not a clipboard and tallying up

362
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:41,980
 how many times are you gonna do this,

363
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:44,660
 but it keeps no record of wrongs.

364
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:46,580
 God is love.

365
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,660
 Love keeps no record of wrongs.

366
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:51,660
 God keeps no record of wrongs

367
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:54,460
 for those who have underneath his love in Christ.

368
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:57,900
 And somebody, that's the biggest thing

369
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,140
 you need to hear tonight.

370
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:01,860
 That for whatever reason, or the way you were raised,

371
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:05,040
 or your experience of church, when you think about God,

372
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,320
 he's a police officer, he's a judge,

373
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,900
 but he's not someone who says, the slate is clean.

374
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,200
 I love you.

375
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,460
 It does not rejoice in wrongdoing,

376
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,240
 but it rejoices with the truth.

377
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,160
 Love bears all things.

378
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:24,600
 God bears all things.

379
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,240
 It believes all things.

380
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,000
 It hopes all things.

381
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,960
 Love, or God, endures all things,

382
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,440
 regardless of what you're walking through.

383
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,540
 He does not grow weary and tired with you.

384
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:36,940
 He loves you.

385
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:40,060
 His love, verse eight, never ends.

386
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:42,040
 His never fails.

387
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,660
 God cannot stop loving you.

388
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:45,580
 He will not stop loving you.

389
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:49,560
 And I think even the word,

390
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,300
 my biggest fear in this message right now

391
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,040
 is I don't know how to communicate

392
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,520
 how deep and how amazing the love of God is.

393
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,820
 So the spirit will have to root that in your heart

394
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,040
 if anything's gonna take place,

395
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,100
 but here's what I know.

396
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,120
 God will not stop pursuing you.

397
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,800
 He will not stop loving you.

398
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:08,520
 He loves you right now, not some future version of you.

399
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,120
 His love will never fail.

400
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,520
 His love will never bail out on you.

401
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,380
 He is aggressive in his love, and he,

402
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:19,520
 I mean, you can clap, but he is the only source

403
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,080
 of true love that you will ever experience,

404
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,040
 the only love that you will know like that,

405
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:27,240
 and that's when he looks at you, what he feels.

406
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,820
 (audience member whispers)

407
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:38,120
 I think one of the ways that we've seen this so clearly

408
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,240
 is like God has made the first move.

409
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,440
 In any relationship, there's always someone

410
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,360
 who makes the first move, whether it's a guy

411
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:50,000
 who gives some pickup line or asks,

412
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,560
 hey, I've got tickets to this thing,

413
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,320
 just by chance, would you like to go,

414
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:56,920
 and makes the first move, or whether it's a girl

415
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,480
 who just tries to put herself in front of the path,

416
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,080
 and it's like, hey, I made these cookies

417
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,040
 in between memorizing the Bible and working out,

418
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,640
 and so, (audience laughs)

419
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:09,160
 just, it's what I do every day for people,

420
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:12,720
 and so there's always, right, I mean,

421
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:17,440
 there's always someone who makes some sort of first move

422
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,800
 in any relationship, and here's what happened.

423
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,880
 Here's what has happened for you and for me

424
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:26,400
 is that God has made the first move and said, I'm in.

425
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,880
 And he did it in a way that none of us would have predicted,

426
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,360
 none of us would have done it, and here's what he did.

427
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:35,360
 This is the demonstration of the true love

428
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,200
 that God has for us.

429
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,920
 This is Romans 5, eight.

430
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:42,920
 But God demonstrates his love for us in this.

431
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:47,840
 While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.

432
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,080
 That God has made the first move,

433
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,640
 and here's why I think this is so huge.

434
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,760
 It's 'cause most of us, we don't read it like this.

435
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,920
 We read it like this.

436
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,220
 Put the second one up.

437
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:58,200
 But God demonstrates his own love for us in this.

438
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:03,200
 When we agreed to become good, he died for us.

439
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,620
 When I agreed I'm gonna clean myself up,

440
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:07,880
 I'm gonna try harder, I'm gonna be better,

441
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,380
 then Christ died for us, and that's not it at all.

442
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:14,880
 That when we were still sinners, Christ died for us.

443
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,320
 Here's why I love that verse,

444
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,600
 'cause here's what it tells you about me, or about God.

445
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,800
 God is a God who loves bad people.

446
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,560
 He will not stop loving you.

447
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:27,200
 He will not stop, no matter what you ever do,

448
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,960
 for the rest of your life, he will chase and pursue you,

449
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:33,120
 and you can run, but you will not outrun his love,

450
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,600
 and you can reject it, or you can accept it.

451
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,400
 He is a God who loves bad people,

452
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,600
 even bad people who don't think they're bad.

453
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,200
 He loves you, regardless of what you will ever do

454
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,060
 or have ever done, right now,

455
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:49,480
 his perfect love is working inside of you,

456
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,680
 and he loves you if you've trusted in him.

457
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,280
 And he loves you if you haven't,

458
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,760
 but you have a unique place and a unique acceptance

459
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,280
 of his love if you have,

460
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,080
 regardless of what you've ever done.

461
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,980
 And he says, "I love you.

462
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:04,240
 "I will not stop."

463
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,840
 He's reckless.

464
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,480
 I mean, this is crazy, crazy love.

465
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:12,200
 This is why we go, we gotta tell everybody about this love

466
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,880
 of a God who is in love with the human race.

467
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,600
 He can't help himself.

468
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,840
 He cannot stop.

469
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,040
 He will not stop.

470
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,600
 He's crazy about you, and he'll give anything,

471
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:25,920
 including his son, anything.

472
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:31,520
 And Paul looks into his audience and says,

473
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,140
 "If there's one thing I want you to know,

474
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:35,680
 "if there's one thing I believe that could change

475
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:39,220
 "the course of your life, it's that you really believe

476
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:42,040
 "how desperately God loves you."

477
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:45,160
 But he's not a God who loves,

478
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:48,560
 when you clean yourself up, that he is crazy,

479
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:53,180
 insanely obsessed with you, in love with you.

480
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:58,440
 And he looks into all of our pasts

481
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:02,940
 and all of our future failures that he already sees,

482
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:06,760
 and he says, "I love you."

483
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,560
 And if you walked in here tonight and you're going,

484
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,080
 "I don't even know where I stand

485
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,800
 "if there is a God who's there.

486
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,600
 "I don't know what he thinks about me,

487
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:18,340
 "my current addiction, my homosexual relationship,

488
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,720
 "my abortion."

489
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:23,960
 He says, "I love you."

490
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:28,000
 And he wants you to accept his love,

491
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,220
 but he will not force you,

492
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:35,280
 and he will allow you to reject it.

493
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,720
 And it is the thing he wants most,

494
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,840
 and the thing that in all of his power he cannot do,

495
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,400
 which is force you to love him.

496
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,200
 And it is the thing he wants most

497
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,000
 because he's crazy about you.

498
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 Crazy about you, not some, in general, the whole world,

499
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,700
 you, alone in all creation.

500
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:00,240
 He said, "I'll die for you."

501
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:09,420
 I think, as I think about how to,

502
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:13,300
 really what the takeaway for me as I study this text,

503
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,300
 and I think for all of us,

504
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,540
 and the band is gonna come up in just a minute,

505
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:19,960
 and play a song that speaks a lot of these truths over us,

506
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:23,140
 I wanna invite and ask you to do something,

507
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,620
 and it'll be way more beneficial

508
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:26,820
 than anything that I've said for the past 20 minutes.

509
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:30,140
 I want you to pray if you know Christ,

510
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,900
 if you've trusted in him alone,

511
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,340
 and the work he did on the cross,

512
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:35,380
 not because you're a good person,

513
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:37,340
 but because you're not a good person.

514
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:39,340
 And he died, and he rose again,

515
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:41,860
 showing the check cleared.

516
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:43,700
 It was more than enough.

517
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,820
 If you're in that camp,

518
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:47,820
 I want you to pray during this next song,

519
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,760
 God, will you help me to believe how much you love me?

520
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:56,060
 Every addiction, according to leading psychologists,

521
00:24:56,060 --> 00:25:00,900
 is fueled by one lie, I'm not worthy of being loved,

522
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,460
 and I can't find anything to convince me that I am.

523
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:07,740
 So much of what self-destructive tendencies

524
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:11,540
 we all experience are fueled by the lie

525
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:15,300
 that I'm not worthy, I'm ashamed.

526
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:18,340
 And so in the next few minutes as they play this song,

527
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:20,020
 I wanna invite and ask you

528
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:24,220
 to ask God to do what no message could ever do,

529
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:26,580
 which is God, will you help me to believe?

530
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:27,940
 Will you help me, as Paul said,

531
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:32,380
 to know how deep, how wide, how long,

532
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:36,140
 and how much you love me, how much you really love me.

533
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:41,260
 And if you want to,

534
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:45,500
 this actual prayer has repeated itself

535
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,220
 in two times in Scripture.

536
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:49,260
 And so you can pray this next prayer there,

537
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:51,260
 I'm about to show you, that's another verse.

538
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:52,460
 But this idea of like,

539
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,740
 Lord, will you satisfy us in your love?

540
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:59,020
 Ephesians is not the first place it came.

541
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:01,820
 The oldest psalm in the Old Testament,

542
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:04,700
 the book of Psalms, the oldest psalm we have

543
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:07,660
 is a psalm written by Moses.

544
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:11,620
 In the days when Israel wandered in the wilderness.

545
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:12,660
 And it's Psalm 90.

546
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:16,820
 And in it, there's this line that so captures this idea,

547
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,260
 and here's what it says.

548
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:20,260
 Lord, will you satisfy us in the morning

549
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:22,140
 with your unfailing love?

550
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:24,260
 Will you satisfy us?

551
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:26,820
 We just left Egypt, we're gonna be prone to wander,

552
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,620
 prone to chase after other gods.

553
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:31,020
 We don't have a Bible, we don't have a Pentateuch,

554
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,980
 we don't have anything, we're wandering in the desert.

555
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:37,060
 Lord, will you satisfy my heart with your unfailing love

556
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:41,340
 so that we may experience joy and gladness

557
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:42,400
 all the days of our life?

558
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,540
 We will not chase it looking in other places,

559
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:46,220
 in the wells that are dry.

560
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:49,380
 Would you satisfy us?

561
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:50,700
 And so right now, if you're a believer,

562
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,380
 that's just what I wanna ask you to do.

563
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:54,220
 Say that in those words, say it in whatever your words,

564
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:56,500
 but will you just pray to the God of the universe,

565
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:59,020
 God, will you help me to know more deeply

566
00:26:59,020 --> 00:26:59,940
 how much you love me?

567
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:02,140
 And if you're not a believer,

568
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:05,220
 there's two things that we want you to know.

569
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:08,140
 You are more sinful than you even realize.

570
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,500
 As bad as you think you are,

571
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,460
 and I don't say that in jest, so am I,

572
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,860
 you are more broken than you'll ever understand.

573
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:18,100
 But you're more loved than you could ever imagine.

574
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:21,420
 And the God who loves you doesn't wait with a hammer,

575
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:24,660
 he waits with his arms spread out on a cross saying,

576
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:27,660
 I love you, I'll do anything for you.

577
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:31,880
 Will you accept my love, my perfect love?

578
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:36,280
 And will cast out the fear, fear of death,

579
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,980
 fear of being loved, fear.

580
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:44,480
 I was asked to, I got a chance to speak at an event

581
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,040
 we've held this past weekend called D-Town.

582
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:50,600
 And yeah, some either high schoolers who snuck in here

583
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,260
 or leaders, just for high school and junior high,

584
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:56,820
 or if you're in junior high, PG-13.

585
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,720
 It was for our student ministry,

586
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,320
 and it was 1,000 kids, it was awesome, it's unbelievable.

587
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,280
 If you're looking to serve somewhere,

588
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,920
 student ministry's incredible.

589
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,720
 And in the midst of this weekend,

590
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,000
 they had 1,000 kids there,

591
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,440
 and all kinds of just exciting stuff was going on.

592
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,280
 And at one moment throughout the weekend,

593
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:14,360
 one of the directors, a buddy of mine named David Penuel,

594
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,520
 he got up on the stage and he said,

595
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,120
 look, I have $100 for the first person

596
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:21,200
 who's willing to go jump in the watermark pond.

597
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,760
 First person who's willing to do it, 100 bucks.

598
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,400
 And as you can imagine, this is in a room

599
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,400
 of young adults where I have a job.

600
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,080
 This is like high school kids where it's like,

601
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,520
 oh my gosh, $100?

602
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,720
 It's like five years allowance.

603
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,160
 Unless I live in Highland Park.

604
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:39,480
 And I don't know if I could say that.

605
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:42,480
 If you live in Highland Park, will you please forgive me?

606
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,440
 I think, I don't know if I should or not.

607
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,560
 Anyways, so anyways, so of course,

608
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:50,280
 tons of hands went up, and one of the kids,

609
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:53,580
 he said, stretching his arm, you, you can do it.

610
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:56,480
 And he went and he grabbed it,

611
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,100
 and he grabbed his $100 that he so desperately wanted,

612
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,800
 and he totally submerged himself in the water.

613
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:06,800
 And then he came back inside, and he displayed,

614
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,760
 not only, he displayed really two things.

615
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,280
 How desperately he wanted that thing,

616
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:16,000
 and what it was worth to him.

617
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,760
 Totally, I'll do that.

618
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,240
 I'll jump in the pond, it's worth it to me.

619
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:26,180
 When the question of what you were worth,

620
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,680
 how desperately you were wanted, was put in front of God.

621
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:38,460
 His answer was a cross and the brutal murder of his son,

622
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:40,100
 so that you would never have to wonder

623
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,360
 how deeply loved you are.

624
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,260
 It is the thing you were made for.

625
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:46,020
 It is the thing you came into this world

626
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:48,700
 longing to experience, to know and believe,

627
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:52,060
 and the thing you will want to know in your deathbed.

628
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:55,300
 And God has provided a way, provided his son,

629
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,240
 so that no one would have to wonder,

630
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,980
 and no one would have to be missing out on love.

631
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:02,900
 You guys pray with me?

632
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:11,240
 Father, we pray now, and I pray now

633
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,680
 that you would do what I will never be able to do,

634
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,960
 what JP could never do,

635
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,100
 what Shane's singing a million songs could never do,

636
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:22,420
 which is allow us to know how deeply you love us,

637
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:28,480
 how crazy you are about us, how you will not stop,

638
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:33,240
 you cannot stop, and how you have displayed

639
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,460
 that love perfectly.

640
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,580
 You define love perfectly.

641
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:40,380
 Would you convince my heart right now,

642
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,820
 would you convince my friend's hearts in the room

643
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:43,960
 of how deeply they are loved,

644
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:46,100
 would you convince the hearts of those

645
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:48,660
 who maybe don't know you through your son?

646
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:53,020
 They don't know that perfect display of love

647
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,300
 that you've given us.

648
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:57,140
 Would you grab hold of their hearts right now?

649
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:58,880
 We love you, amen.

650
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:08,880
