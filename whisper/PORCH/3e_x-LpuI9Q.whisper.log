[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   [Music]
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   PORCH, how we doing?
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   Come on!
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   Dallas is lively.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   Fort Worth, I hope you got it going on too.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   Houston, anywhere you're listening,
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   tuning in, we're back in 1 Peter 2 this evening.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   And as I think about what Peter is going to instruct us on this evening,
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   I thought about how growing up,
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   I was a kid who asked "why" a lot.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   Anybody else?
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   Like, "Why?"
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   Like, "You gotta do this."
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   "Why?"
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   Like, "Why do I have to do that?"
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   "I don't understand."
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   "Why?"
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   "Can you explain?"
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   "Why?"
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   And the response that I would get that I hated the most,
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   "Hey, you nailed it."
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   "Because I said so."
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   Like nails on a chalkboard, I hated that response.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   "Why do I have to do it?"
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   "Because I said so."
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   I hated that response so much that now that I have three children of my own,
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   I have vowed to personally never tell them that.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   And it's hard.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   Because they ask "why" a lot.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   I got three kids that ask "why" all the time.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   And they kind of come to me and they're like, "Oh, but that's not fair."
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   "I don't understand. Why do I have to do it?"
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   "I'm always tempted."
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   And so I'm just going to give you three examples from this past weekend.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   I mean, from the last three days,
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   here are some what it looks like to be in the Pucluta household.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   And so let's see, it's bedtime, and they've got to take showers.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   And so I tell the girls, "Hey, y'all go take showers.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   Weston, I'm going to give you a bath."
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   Finley, my daughter, said, "But Daddy, I want to take a bath."
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   "No, it's past your bedtime. You need to take a quick shower."
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   "I'm going to give Weston a bath."
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   "But Daddy, I don't understand. Why can't I take a bath?"
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   And I can go into this long explanation.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   "Well, because, you know, here's the deal.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   You're going to be slow, and he's four,
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   and I've got to bathe him because he's four,
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   and you can go take a shower."
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   Or I can say, "That's right, because I said so."
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   And so then here's another one.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   We wake up the other morning.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   We wake up two mornings ago, and Presley takes a vitamin, okay?
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   And my four-year-old says, "But Daddy, can I have one of those?"
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   "Well, no, you can't."
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   "But Daddy, why? Why can't I have one?"
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   "Well, because the Surgeon General warning right here, son."
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   I mean, how do you explain Surgeon General to a four-year-old?
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   And why do they make these vitamins look like Fred Flintstones?
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   My kids don't even know who the Flintstones are.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   And so they're sitting there.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   He's like, "But Daddy, I want one."
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   It looks like candy.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   He's like, "But I want one. Why can't I have one?"
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   "Son, just relax. Come on. No. That's why. No."
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   You know?
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   And then this one just happened.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Taking my little girl home from soccer.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   Good dad.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Let's go get ice cream.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   Go big.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   What do you want?
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   Hit the Dairy Queen up on Coit.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   Only the best.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Get her ice cream.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   "Hey, let me have a bite of that."
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   "No, but Daddy, that's not fair."
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   "But why? You can get your own."
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   "But why? You take such big bites."
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   Which is true.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   "But Daddy, that's not fair."
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   I'm just over the edge.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   You're right, that's not fair.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   It's not fair that you got ice cream
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   and there's 20,000 children today starving.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   They didn't eat anything.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   That's not fair.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   And you're right, when you wanted ice cream,
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   guess who had to pay for that ice cream?
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   I had to buy that ice cream with my money.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   And that's not fair.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   When are you going to buy your own ice cream?
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   That's what I want to know.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   And you know what's really not fair?
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Is when I want to take a bite of the ice cream that I paid for,
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   you're sitting here telling me that I can't have it
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   because I said so!
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   No, I didn't say that.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   It was a whole lot worse.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   Don't judge me.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   So here's what you need to know.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   Life's not fair.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   You've either learned that lesson,
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   or you're learning that lesson,
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   or you're going to learn that lesson.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   And I'm here to tell you,
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   I believe Peter is going to tell you
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   that it's one of the most important lessons
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   that you can possibly learn.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   Because if you grasp this lesson,
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   it's going to set you well up for the rest of your life.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   If you do not believe that life is not fair,
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   and you leave here and you expect life to be fair,
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   it is going to set you up for tremendous disappointment,
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   even despair, potentially depression.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   Deep, dark depression as you wait
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   for fairness to come your way
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   in a broken world that is not fair.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   But if you leave here,
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   and you say, "You know what? I know that life's not fair.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   "There are going to be things that happen to me
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   "that just don't add up.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   "Sometimes A plus B equals getting your butt kicked.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   "And that might happen, and I'm going to leave here,
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   "and I'm going to believe that, and I'm going to embrace that."
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   Then your future's bright.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   You're set up for potentially some tremendous success.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   But life's not fair.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   And an aspect of the unfairness of life
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   is that you're subject to authority.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   Here's what that means.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   You're not in charge.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   And I don't mean like, "I know I'm not in charge.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   "God's in charge."
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   I mean there are people who are in charge of you.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   And you're expected to do whatever they ask you to.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   And that's not fair.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   And if you leave here resisting that reality
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   that you are under authority on earth,
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   earthly authority,
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   like police officers and teachers and bosses
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   and parents if you're still at home,
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   or if they pay your cell phone bill,
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   that you are expected to obey and do what that asks.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   So let me just talk about how life's not fair for a minute.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   Sometimes you do all the work,
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   and your boss takes credit for it.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   And sometimes you work harder than everyone else,
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   and someone else gets promoted.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   Sometimes the person who gets promoted cheated to get there,
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   and you know it.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   And sometimes everyone is passing you on the highway,
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   and somehow you get stopped for a ticket.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   Sometimes you abstain from sex,
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   you dress modestly,
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   you meet a guy who seems to be a good Christian man,
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   and not only does he not pay attention to you,
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   he starts to like the girl that's constantly showing off her body
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   and doesn't even read the Bible.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   Life's not fair.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   Sometimes you have teachers that don't like you,
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   sometimes you have bosses that just don't like you.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   Maybe you remind them of someone they don't like.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   Life's not fair.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   Sometimes you do everything right,
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   but things go so painfully wrong in life.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   And even as I say that, doesn't it hurt just thinking about it?
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   Is that not just painful thinking about it?
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   And some of us,
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   there's something deep inside of us that desperately desires
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   to believe that life is fair.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   But if we believe that,
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   it's going to set us up for this disappointment.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   And so, I'm gonna say this up front
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   when I'm talking about being subject to authority.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   I've heard someone say this, and I think it's really helpful.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   When someone tells you what to do,
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   it's not the what, but the who.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   When someone tells you what to do,
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   it's not what they're asking you to do
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   that you need to grade how fair it is,
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   it's who's asking you to do it.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   Are they in a position of authority over you,
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   and are you expected to obey them,
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   even if it doesn't make sense in your logical brain?
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   You just do what they ask.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   And so, we're going to look here in 1 Peter 2
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   about three unfair facts.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   And this message will be exposed in increasingly unfairness.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   And it will end with the most unfair reality.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   And so the first one is that we should submit under authority,
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   that we will suffer under authority,
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   and that our authority will treat us unfairly.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   And so Peter wrote this book about 30 years after
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   being with Jesus for three years.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   He spent three years of his life.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   He wrote it about 64 AD.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   Nero is the emperor. Nero is a crazy man.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   This is important because he's going to talk about the government.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   Nero is crazy. He killed his mom.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   His wife exits the picture.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   He marries his manservant, has him dressed like a woman.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   He burns down Rome and blames Christians.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   He's persecuting Christians.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   This guy's crazy.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   And so, he says this, verse 13.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   "Submit yourselves for the Lord's sake to every human authority,
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   "whether to the emperor as the supreme authority,
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   "or to governors who are sent by him
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   "to punish those who do wrong and to commend those who do right."
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   See, even in a corrupt government,
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   there are people who enforce laws.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   "For it is God's will that by doing good,
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   "you should silence the ignorant talk of foolish people.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   "But do not use your freedom as a cover-up for evil.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   "Live as God's slaves," he says.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   "Show proper respect to everyone,
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   "love the family of believers, fear God,
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   "and honor the emperor."
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   Let me summarize that little passage right there.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   He's saying, "I want you to submit to every human authority
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   "as an example to others of the ultimate authority
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   "that you are under, which is God."
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   And so, my first unfair fact, unfair fact number one,
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   is that we should submit under authority.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   Our job under authority is to submit.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   And the idea of submission is unfair, right?
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   It says that not only are you not in charge,
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   but it says that someone is in charge of you.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   What a reality check.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   Not only am I not in charge,
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   but there are people in positions of authority over me.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   It says this idea of submission,
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   whether we're talking about wrestling or bosses
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   or marriage or anything, right?
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   It says that someone is stronger, more skilled,
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   more powerful, or just plays a different role than you.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   And verse 13 says that,
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   "Submit yourself to every human authority."
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   Who does that include?
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   Every human authority is the right answer.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   So if we're talking about the IRS, right,
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   you're not thinking about how do you scheme the IRS.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   You're thinking about how do you give to Caesar?
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   What is Caesar?
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   Even if no one knows about it,
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   even if no one knows about the capital gains,
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   you don't go and get the goodwill receipt
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   and even though you gave a pair of shoes,
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   write $500 on it.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   Like, that's not what you do.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   You're not trying to look for the max deductions.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   You're trying to do what is right and true.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   And you think about police officers, right?
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   Ever pled not guilty to a ticket?
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   You knew you were guilty of?
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   Ever tried to talk yourself out of a ticket
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   you knew you were guilty of?
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   Ever had the police officer walk to your car
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   as you slipped on the seatbelt
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   trying to trick him that you had it on?
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   Some of you, okay, right?
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   You know, ever been like,
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   "Ah, but I wasn't speeding,"
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   when you knew you were?
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   Somebody asked me,
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   "Is it wrong to speed if you're willing to pay the ticket?"
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   Is it wrong to disobey your parents
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   if you're willing to get a spanking?
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   Is it wrong to reject God if you're willing to go to hell?
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   It's wrong to do what's wrong.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   It's right to do what authority asks you to do.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   That's what this text is saying.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   Whether it's a landlord or your boss
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   or your parents if you're on their payroll,
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   government, right, this is really what it's talking about.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   We as believers, we don't bash Donald Trump.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   We don't bash President Obama.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   It's not okay.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   That's not submission.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   You cannot read this text,
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   say, "God, I believe in you.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   "I believe this word is true.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   "I want to apply it to my life, leave here,
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   "then get on Facebook and blast the president."
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   You can't do that.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   It leaves no room for you to do that.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   There's no submission there.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   That's not what this text is saying.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   You say, "Yeah, but he's crazy."
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   Some of you, half of you will be like,
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   "Yeah, but President Trump's crazy."
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   The other half, "But President Obama's crazy."
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   Nero is crazy.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   That's what's crazy about this text.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   Nero's way crazier, right?
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   And so this verse, it really nods its head
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   to what Paul writes in Romans 13.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   And so I'll read verse one to you.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   "Let everyone be subject to governing authorities,
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   "for there is no authority
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   "except that which God has established."
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   The authorities that exist have been established by God.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   He says the same idea over and over and over.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   All authority is established by God.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   And here's what you need to know.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   No authority is perfect.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   And let me say it a different way.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   No authority is perfectly fair.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   So what the reality is,
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   the reality is you're subject right now to unfair authority.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   That's the truth.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   And it begs the question, like,
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   what about Hitler or Saddam Hussein
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   or Joseph Stalin or Mussolini or Mao Zedong?
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   Even them, yes, even Nero.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   Even Nero.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   It's crazy to present the sovereignty of God like that.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   It could not be more explicit.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   All authority is established by God.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   Why would he ask this of us?
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   It seems so, I feel the tension that you feel right now.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   It seems, JPR, you sure, it seems so crazy.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   Here's why, verse 15.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   "For it is God's will that by doing good
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   "you should silence the ignorant talk of foolish people.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   "Live as free people, but do not use your freedom
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   "as a cover-up for evil.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   "Live as God's slaves.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   "Show proper respect to everyone.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   "Love the family of believers.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   "Fear God and honor the emperor."
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   And so as an example to the watching world,
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   that we don't belong here,
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   that's what we talked about last week.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   We silence the talk of foolish people.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   And so Christians, we're the most free of all people.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   The very best citizens on earth are citizens of heaven.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   Citizens of heaven are the best citizens on earth.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   But as we live as free people,
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   we do not use that liberty to sin, to do what is wrong.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   The fact that we're going to heaven
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   doesn't mean we can do whatever we want here.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   I think this is displayed most beautifully
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   when we feel that the rule
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   or the person who made the rule is not for us
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   and that they're unjust.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   I think about, back to kind of my BC days,
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   before I was a follower of Christ,
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   there was this specific experience
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   where I left my trash at the door of my apartment
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   and you couldn't do that.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   There was an explicit rule against that
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   and they said, "Hey, if you do that, you gotta pay a fine."
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   And so of course I get a fine.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   And I remember how unjust I felt this was.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   Like I went and argued this.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   I even lied.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   Like they did exactly what they said they were going to do.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   But I'm like, "Man, I don't know where that trash came from.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   "Like you can't do this to me.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   "Like how unfair is it that I come out
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   "and not only is there trash in front of my door,
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   "I got a fine on top of it.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   "This is so unjust."
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   I'm using my freedom to cover up evil.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   How wicked is that?
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   How wicked as followers of Jesus Christ
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   do we feel like it's okay to say,
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   "I wasn't speeding.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   "I didn't roll through that stop sign.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   "I was wearing my seatbelt."
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   How wicked is that?
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   I compare that to Joseph in Genesis 39
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   who worked very hard to please his authority.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   And as a consequence of working hard to please his authority,
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   he was thrown into prison for a crime he didn't commit.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   True story, woke up every day in prison
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   for a crime he didn't commit.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   Sounds like a Netflix special or something, right?
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   He's there.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   And you gotta be, I mean, he's gotta be like,
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   "God, have you turned your back on me?"
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   But it says the Lord was with Joseph
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   and he was patient and he waited
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   and he was subject to the authority that was over him.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   And so it says, "Show proper respect to everyone,
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   "love the family of believers,
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   "fear God, and honor the emperor."
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   And this is easy when we trust authority,
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   but what about when the authority over us is crazy?
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   What about when they're bad authority?
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   Verse 18.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   "Slaves, in reverent fear of God,
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   "submit yourself to your masters,
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   "not only to those who are good and considerate,
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   "but also to those who are harsh,
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   "for it is commendable," underline that word,
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   "for it is commendable if someone bears up
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   "under the pain of unjust suffering
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   "because they are conscience of God.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   "But how is it to your credit if you receive a beating
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   "for doing wrong and endure it?
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   "But if you suffer for doing good and endure it,
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   "this is commendable before God."
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   What's the summary here?
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   Let me summarize.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   It is commendable before God to suffer for doing good
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   under unfair authority.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   We don't like that.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   And we don't do what is right because we're afraid
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   of what will happen, that they might be harsh to us,
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   they might treat us harshly.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   We do it because we believe God is our ultimate authority,
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   that he's in control of all authority,
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   and he's the authority that we submit to,
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   really the only authority that we submit to,
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   and as him, as our ultimate authority,
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   has asked us to be subject to every authority on earth.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   So my second unfair fact, unfair fact number two,
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   we will suffer under unfair authority.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   Let me give you a couple things right up front
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   to understand this text.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   One has the word slays.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   Don't think Django Unchained or Roots.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   Think more like Doughton Abbey or the Nanny Diaries.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   Think household employee.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   This was not a racial slavery.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   Don't think civil rights.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   It was more of a class system.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   True story.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   I've heard that before.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   I've heard preachers say that.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   I'm like, really?
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   Let me go study that for myself.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   Go study it for yourself.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   And so we live, here's another thing
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   that I have to say up front.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   How do I apply this to my life?
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   We live in a higher fire at will state.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   What that means is you can leave your job,
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   this is applicable to your job,
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   employer-employee relationship,
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   you can leave your job at any time.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   Like if they ask you to do something sinful,
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   you can say, I'm not going to do that.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   You will have to fire me, but I'm not going to sin.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   If they ask you to do something
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   that compromises your conscience,
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   you can say, I'm not going to compromise my conscience.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   You're going to have to fire me.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   I'm not going to sin.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   You can leave.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   You can get fired for doing what is right.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   But I will tell you, having done ministry now for 10 years,
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   most of the times I'm talking to somebody
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   that they're like, yeah man, I'm not going to do that.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   He's trying to make me go to the strip club.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   I've gone a couple times,
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   and really what's happening
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   is you're looking for an excuse to leave,
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   to villainize your boss,
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   and even though you sinned every step of the way,
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   this is kind of your righteous reason to leave.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   And that's not okay.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   Because just consider this for a moment.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   That's the job you took.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   In a higher at-will state,
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   you looked at all the jobs,
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   you said, I'll take that job,
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   and I would just ask you to be a little more prudent,
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   like maybe in the interview.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   Hey, am I going to have to go to strip clubs?
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   Because I'm not in on that, you know?
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   But we don't do that.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   We just get kind of, oh man, anything,
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   you'll pay me to what?
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   Okay, I'm in.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   And then we get there, and we're like,
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   oh, I hate my boss, I hate this place,
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   I hate my coworkers, I hate everything about it.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   Give me some excuse to leave
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   that I can pretend is righteous.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   So you don't have to sin.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   You can get fired.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   You can share your faith.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   You can get fired doing the right things.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   Absolutely you can.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   And you shouldn't sin.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   You should always obey your ultimate authority,
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   which is God.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   It is commendable, verse 19 says,
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   if someone bears up under the pain of unjust suffering
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   because they are conscious of God.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   You read this, and you're like, man, is that?
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   Okay, so maybe Peter just
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   kind of goes crazy as you're writing this.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   This is really repeated throughout the New Testament.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   Ephesians 6, Colossians 3, 1 Peter 3, Titus 2,
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   and 1 Timothy 4 all repeat this exact same idea,
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   that it is commendable to bear up
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   under the pain of unjust leadership, unjust authority.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   Here's what you need to know, guys.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   Every person in authority over you
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   for the rest of your life
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   till you go home to be with God is a sinner.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   And so they might be kind of 30,000 foot view,
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   big picture corrupt,
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   or they may have moments of corruption
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   that rub you the wrong way
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   or ask you to do something crazy.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   But every person that you will ever work for
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   is absolutely a sinner.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   I work with some of the most amazing people,
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   and still every person I work with is a sinner.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   I work for one of the most amazing leaders I've ever met,
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   probably one of the most amazing leaders
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   on the planet Earth.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   And he loves God and walks with Him every day.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   He's the greatest example I have to date
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   of a Christ follower, and still he's a sinner.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   Still there's times where I say,
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   "Hey, can we talk about that?"
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   And I work in an environment with believers
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   where we can do that.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   We can go through a Biblical conflict resolution model.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   You may not.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   You may work for a pagan.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   You may work for someone who doesn't know your God,
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   doesn't claim to know your God,
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   and you can't hold them accountable
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   to Biblical conflict resolution methods, right?
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   You can't call them to be reasonable.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   They are controlled by an unreasonable spirit.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   That's the reality that you live in.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   You should not expect them to be reasonable
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   if they do not have God's spirit in them.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   And every person that works for me
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   works for a sinner.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   This week was a busy week,
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   and I can procrastinate, true confession.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   And I saw the week, and I have teaching here,
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   teaching at Summit next week,
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   and I have this Bible study video thing
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   that's happening, which is like six mini messages
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   in between, and I'm like,
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   "Man, I've got to work on that."
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   And so I do one, and I realize how much time
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   it takes me to do one.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   It took me about an hour and a half to do one of them.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   I'm like, "I've got to do six of them.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   "How am I going to do this?"
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   And so on Sunday night, I divvied up to people
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   who I'm in authority over.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   I said, "Hey, can you guys do this?
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   "Can you each take one of these?"
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   Now, their week is full.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   They could come back and say,
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   "JP, man, you don't understand.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   "I don't have a spare hour and a half.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   "I have my whole week planned out.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   "You're coming in fourth quarter."
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   I'm like, "Hey, can you have it Wednesday by one?"
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   And mind you, between Monday and Wednesday is Tuesday,
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   and our whole team's pretty deployed
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   on making this happen.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   And I'm like, "Hey, can you do this?"
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   That's an unreasonable ask.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   Some might say that's an unfair ask.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   I love what Garrett, shout out to Fort Worth, responded.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   "I will have it to you Wednesday before one.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   "I love serving you."
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   I read that, and I'm like,
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   "How applicable to what I'm studying right now
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   "in God's Word."
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   That's God's servant.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   He knows who his ultimate authority is,
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   and it ain't me.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   "I'll have it to you Wednesday by one.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   "I love serving you."
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   To which I responded,
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   "You just became a sermon illustration."
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   (congregation laughing)
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   And so, when someone tells you what to do,
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   it's not the what, but the who.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   When they ask you to change the rows to columns,
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   and it seems completely pointless,
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   and it's gonna take you hours, you do it.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   When they ask you to change a font,
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   or the color of a font,
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   or spin around and jump, you do it.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   When they ask you to come in on Saturday, get early,
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   start over,
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   and when they take credit for your work,
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   you pray for them, you work hard,
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   and you trust God, or you can leave.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   But you cannot, you absolutely cannot slander them.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   You cannot go to lunch with everybody else on the team
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   who's talking about how crazy and big and ugly and mean
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   and worthless and ungrateful and ungrateful
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   and worthless and evil and wicked,
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   and you wouldn't believe, and they made me come in,
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   and Saturday, what's he thinking?
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   You can't jump in on that, you keep your mouth shut.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   You do not say anything slanderous against them.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   'Cause Jesus is your example, Christ is your example.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   Let me show you in just a second.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   It's not what they're asking to do, it's who they are.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   Are they in authority over you?
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   I worked in corporate America,
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   and I had my eye for years on this promotion,
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   and it was a global account manager position,
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   and it was all I wanted.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   It was a position I could have retired from.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   My peers would be in their 40s and 50s,
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   and I had worked really hard for this position,
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   and it had been offered me, you know,
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   and I'm really excited, like my dreams just came true.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   And then we went on a hiring freeze,
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   and I don't know exactly what that is,
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   but something Satan invented,
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   but so it's this hiring freeze,
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   and so I'm just sitting there waiting
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   for HR to lift this freeze,
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   and they do, ultimately, a couple months go by,
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   six months go by, and they lift the freeze,
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   but they say I have to interview for the position again.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   Great, re-interview for the position.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   So I drive up to this interview, and I'm excited.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   I'm almost thinking like this is just a formality,
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   'cause the job had already been offered me,
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   and I show up to the interview,
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   and this hiring manager is interviewing me,
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   and he's angry, and he's having a bad day,
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   and as he's interviewing me,
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   he tells me that I wrote an email
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   that he would call, at best, less than unprofessional,
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   and that's how the interview started,
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   and I'm like oh, this is gonna be great,
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   and so I'm sitting there, power suit on,
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   red tie, white shirt, let's go, let's do it,
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   and he just starts yelling at me
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   and kind of taking his bad day out on me,
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   and there were a couple curse words thrown my way,
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   and I'm sitting there, and I'm just like
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   this whole thing is a sham.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   Like this guy, he's not actually interviewing me.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   He just brought me up because he's angry
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   about some email I wrote,
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   and so kind of at the end of it, I'm like hey,
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   I've gotta figure out why he's so mad,
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   and as the interview is wrapping up,
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   my entire dreams are sitting in this guy's hands.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   I'm thinking I'm gonna leave that parking lot,
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   and I'm gonna have the job that I had always dreamed of,
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   the job that I'll have for the rest of my life,
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   the job that I'll retire from,
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   and I'm seeing it vanish right before my eyes,
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   and at the end of the interview,
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   I realize that he thinks I'm somebody else,
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   that he has completely taken out his anger
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   and frustration at somebody else on me.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   My name's JP, this guy's name was AJ,
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   and this guy was really mad at AJ,
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   and it wasn't fair.
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   There's nothing about that that's fair,
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   and as you can see, I'm no longer in telecom.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   God had a plan.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   He had a plan for Joseph in jail.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   He had a plan for JP as I'm getting cussed at
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   in an interview for something I didn't do,
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   and he had a plan for Jesus as he hung on a cross,
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   punished for crimes he didn't commit,
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   that his name would be exalted above every name,
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   that at his name, every knee would bow,
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   that he would be at the right hand
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   of the creator of the universe.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   So be patient.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   When it's not fair, be patient.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   Verse 21, "To this you were called
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   "because Christ suffered for you,
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   "leaving you an example that you should follow
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   "in his steps."
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   What is this example?
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   What did it look like?
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   Ready? Verse 22.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   "He, Jesus Christ, committed no sin,
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   "and no deceit was found in his mouth.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   "When they hurled their insults at him,
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   "he did not retaliate.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   "When he suffered, he made no threats.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   "Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly.
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   "He himself bore our sins in his body on the cross
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   "so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   "By his wounds you have been healed,
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   "for you were like sheep going astray,
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   "but now you have returned to the shepherd
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   "and overseer of your souls."
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   What does this mean?
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   Jesus was treated remarkably unfair.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   He suffered for us,
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   and now, having risen from the dead,
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   he draws near us and leads us and guides us.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   So my third unfair fact,
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   the most biggest unfair fact of the evening,
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   is our ultimate authority has treated us eternally unfair.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   Our ultimate authority has treated us eternally unfair.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   In this passage that I just read,
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   there are two very unfair realities.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   Let me point them out to you.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   The first one is that Jesus, who did nothing wrong,
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   was tortured and killed undeservedly.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   Let me help that hit home.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   I want everyone listening right now
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   to think of the best person you know.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   Maybe it's your mom or your grandmother.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   Maybe it's that friend that always writes those notes,
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   that person that always shows up to help
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   even before you ask,
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   the person always baking you cookies
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   or the one that's the most there for you,
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   the kindest person you've ever met.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   You're convinced that they wake up
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   thinking about the good they can do.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   Everybody have somebody, you have a name in your mind?
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   Give me a head nod if you're thinking of somebody.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   If you don't, I'll wait, but hurry up.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   You got somebody?
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   You got somebody?
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   You guys got somebody?
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   Fort Worth, you got somebody?
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   All right.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   Now when you think that if up here
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   I had this wicked person,
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   serial killer, murderer, pedophile,
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   person who wakes up thinking about
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   how they're gonna rip someone off,
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   the person who has no regard for the wrong they do,
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   and then I say, take your person,
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   your kind person that you thought of,
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   and now they will suffer for the sins of this person.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   They will endure the punishment for that person's sins.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   They will serve the life sentence.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   They'll go to the electric chair for them.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   That's not fair.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   What Jesus did was so much bigger
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   than that little analogy.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   So much crazier.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   See, the second unfair statement in this text
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   is that you who are sinful,
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   who deserve eternity in hell,
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   because you have to grasp that that is what you deserve.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   Your sins are against an almighty, perfect God.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   No one deserves heaven.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   We started this series how he chooses some.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   Nobody deserves to be with God forever and ever and ever and ever and ever.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   Your sins, your self-righteousness,
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   your desires to be God
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   have earned you eternity in hell,
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   but you get a reward that you could never deserve.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   You get to be with God forever in his kingdom
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   because of what Jesus did.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   And then it says that Christ is not only your provision of forgiveness,
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   but he's also your example.
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   So that when you think about that boss who's so unfair,
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   it says, verse 23,
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   when they hurled their insults at him,
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   he did not retaliate.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   When he suffered, he made no threats.
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   He didn't sit there,
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   "This isn't fair. This isn't fair.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   "Do you see what's happening to me right now?
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   "It's not fair."
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   He entrusted himself to him who judges justly.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   What does that mean?
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   It means that God demands justice different than fairness.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   Justice is that every sin will be paid for.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   Every single sin.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   Every time you slept with them,
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   looked at that, did that by yourself,
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   got too drunk, smoked that, snorted that, went there.
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   Your self-righteousness,
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   you posting that so everyone would see how righteous you are.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   All of those things have to be paid for.
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   But what's so scandalously unfair
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   is that God's son paid for them
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   so that you don't have to.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   Just in a payment, unfair in application.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   And so when you feel treated unfairly,
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   you can remember that God is your avenger,
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   that God is in control,
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   that God can handle your harsh boss, your landlord,
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   and even a corrupt government.
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   Your job is to be faithful.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   Try to illustrate this with a story.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   When I was in college, not a believer,
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   we went to a party late into the evening,
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   my closest friend and I.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   And when we got there,
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   it was clear that the party was shutting down.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   My buddy walks in and says a few words
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   to the person who had the house,
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   and they get in this skirmish that kind of goes outside.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   And before I know it, some blows were thrown,
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   and the other guy ends up on the ground and hurt.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   And it wasn't looking good.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   Someone in the midst of that had called the police,
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   and my friend was in the back of a cop car, handcuffed.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   And as I'm sitting there trying to defend him,
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   I learn that the person that he's hurt
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   is the grandchild of the district judge of Waco.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   This happened in Waco.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   So my friend is gonna stand before their grandfather
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   to learn his fate.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   Crazy, right?
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   Because here's why I'm thinking,
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   this is not good for him,
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   because the person who gets to determine his fate
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   has tremendous authority and deep, deep love
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   for the person that he hurt.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   Now, think about that if that guy hit the ground,
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   hit his head, and died,
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   just hypothetically, that's not what happened,
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   but if they didn't just get hurt, they died.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   And now my friend has to stand before that judge,
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   and that judge says, "You took a life
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   "of someone that I love dearly, someone close to me.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   "You're going to pay a life for a life.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   "You're going to spend a life in prison
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   "because of what you did."
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   That would be the headlines of the paper,
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   and everyone would read, "Justice.
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   "He got what he deserved."
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   Now, if that judge looked at my friend and said,
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   "You know what?
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   "I'm deeply, deeply grieved by what happened,
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   "but I see you have no record.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   "I'm going to assume it was an accident.
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   "I'm going to let you off.
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   "Leave. I don't want to see you back here.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   "Mercy. That's what we want.
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   "God, don't hold me accountable to my sins.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   "Mercy. He got off. Mercy. That's what mercy is."
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   But friends, if that judge
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   looked at my friend who took the life
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   of someone dear to them,
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   steps down from that platform,
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   places his robe around my buddy,
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   and says, "I will serve life in prison for you
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   "for what you've done, and not only that,
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   "but I'm going to adopt you as my own,
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   "and you can go live on my estate.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   "Everything I have is yours."
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   That's grace.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   It ain't fair.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   It's grace.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   It's scandalously not fair,
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   beautifully not fair,
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   incredibly, amazingly, fantastic not fair.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   Grace.
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   You and I, we deserve hell,
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   eternity in hell,
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   but if you've trusted that Jesus unfairly
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   suffered in your place,
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   you get heaven.
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   We think that we want God to deal with us fairly,
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   but we don't.
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   We think we want justice.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   We settle for mercy,
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   but a God who loves you deeply
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   gives you grace.
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   So tonight, in summary, Peter,
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   as he's written this letter to the church,
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   he's reminded us that
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   three unfair facts
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   that we should submit under authority,
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   that here in this broken world that we'll live in
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   for just a moment of time,
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   it's not very long compared to eternity,
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   that we will suffer under unfair authority,
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   and that our ultimate authority, who is God,
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   he's treated us eternally unfair
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   in the most beautiful, incredible way.
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   Grace.
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   That's what Peter's reminding us of.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   I started telling you about my kids.
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   They're good kids, by God's grace.
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   He's given us good kids.
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   But one day, my daughter Presley, the oldest,
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   was arguing with her sister Finley,
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   and I sat there as her father,
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   and they're kind of working it out,
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   and I'm sitting back, I'm letting them work it out,
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   and I don't know what got into her.
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   She's never done anything like this.
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   She clenched her fist, went back,
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   and just cold-cocked her sister.
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   I mean, just laid her out.
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   And she hits the ground, and she starts screaming and crying,
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   and I'm sitting there, and they didn't teach me this,
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   and the parents, and I'm like, I don't know what to do.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   Like, I don't know what, okay.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   I'm just thinking, like, what do I do?
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   And I go, and I pick Presley up,
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   and I carry her outside,
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   and I take her to my truck,
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   and I put her inside,
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   and I start driving down the road,
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   and she's thinking he's gonna give me away.
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   [congregation laughing]
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   What I do is I turn right on the street,
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   and I go to this place that we sometimes go to
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   on special dates, this donut place,
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   it's her favorite, and we go inside,
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   and I sit her down at this table for two,
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   and I go, and I get her favorite.
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   It's the chocolate eclair filled with cream,
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   and I sit it in front of her,
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   and we hadn't said a word,
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   and I break the silence with this.
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   What'd you do?
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   She said, I hit my sister.
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:27.000]   What do you deserve?
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   Spanking?
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   Oh, girl, do you ever?
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   Like, spanking of all spankings.
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   That's what you deserve.
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   I mean, what's that?
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   A donut?
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   She's thinking, last supper?
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   No, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   No, that's grace.
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:01.000]   That's grace.
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   What God has given you,
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   he's not dealt with you as you deserve.
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   The truth is, in this world,
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   you're going to experience a harshness
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   that you don't deserve
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   for a little bit of time.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:22.000]   Really, just a little bit of time.
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   And if you've trusted that Christ has gotten
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   what you deserve on the cross,
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   and that he's defeated death in the grave,
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   then for the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest,
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   600 billion years from now,
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   you're with God in paradise,
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   where there's no weeping, no sadness,
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   no darkness, no hurt, no pain,
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   no cancer, no breakups, no heartbreak.
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   Only pleasure and goodness forevermore,
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   forevermore, forevermore.
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   You couldn't ever deserve anything that good.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   Like when she takes the bite of that donut,
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   realizing that she didn't have to pay for her sins.
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   But the truth in the gospel is that
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   someone did pay for your sins.
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:19.000]   Someone paid for your sins in your place.
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   It's the great exchange.
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:23.000]   He got what you deserve,
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   and you get what he deserves.
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   How are you going to live this life?
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.000]   Are you going to look for every opportunity
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   to bow up and call out some injustice
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   because you think that you're right?
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   Are you going to serve as Christ served,
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   displaying the God that you love and that you trust,
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   showing the world who he is,
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   working faithfully, living for him
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.000]   to the point when you're with him
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   in his perfect kingdom forever and ever and ever and ever.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   Never, never, never.
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   Let me pray.
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   Lord, we love you.
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   God, we don't deserve grace, the essence of grace.
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   We can't deserve it.
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   And Father, would you just show us,
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   would you stir our hearts, please, God,
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   around how good you have been to us.
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   Would you show us as we sing
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   just how good you've truly been to us,
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   that you've given us a kingdom
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   that we could never deserve at the cost,
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   a great, a tremendous cost,
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   at the life of your son, Jesus Christ.
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   That it literally happened.
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:43.000]   It's not just a story, God.
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   Would you renew our minds around the reality
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   that it's history.
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   And you could give us justice,
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   and we'd settle for mercy.
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   But you've given us grace.
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   Father, thank you for grace.
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   In Jesus' name, amen.
