 You know how intentional I am.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 Intentional's your middle name.

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 I just wanted to... I don't know what I'm going to ask you here.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 [laughter]

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 Pull that blanket back. It's getting chilly in here.

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 It's getting a little cold.

9
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 I think I'm going to sit closer to him and check out the Irish Springs.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 Like his deodorant?

11
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 [laughter]

12
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 Ah!

13
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 [laughter]

14
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 That was a great one.

15
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 That was a good trip.

 I'm Cody.

19
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 Oh, Sylvia. Nice to meet you.

20
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 I don't know what we're doing now.

21
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 [laughter]

22
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000

44
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000

55
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 That was exciting.

56
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 Oh my gosh.

57
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 I love it.

58
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 Welcome.

59
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 My name is David.

60
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 We're so glad that you're here.

61
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 We've been going through this dating series called Save the Date.

62
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 And as you know if you were here last week, we extended the opportunity to allow you to

63
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 get involved by sending in questions that we wanted to answer tonight.

64
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 So over the past really seven days, we've had tons of questions that have come in.

65
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 So tonight, I'm going to sit down with our very own Jonathan Pakluta, who is sincerely

66
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 the big fan favorite here.

67
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 And we're just going to walk through a lot of those questions, as many as we can get

68
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 through probably actually 20.

69
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 And we'll just roll through those as we just begin a dialogue about what God's word would

70
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 say to inform those.

71
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 So I'm just really going to allow an interview and somewhat of a dialogue to take place as

72
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 we go through some of these questions that were asked this past week.

73
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 How you doing?

74
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 I thought you were going to say the smartest person I've ever met.

75
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

76
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 I thought about that and I couldn't say it with integrity.

77
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 Okay.

78
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 So I decided, no, no.

79
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 You're up there though.

80
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 You are up there.

81
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 And you no longer have a job.

82
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 Well, man, I'm looking for employment.

83
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 All right.

84
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 So the first question, we'll just roll through as many of these as we can and we'll kick

85
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 it off.

86
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 I'm going to start with my favorite question.

87
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 All right.

88
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 It's a question that came in and I'm going to ask it just like it was asked.

89
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 And so are you ready?

90
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 Is David Marvin single?

91
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 No, no, no.

92
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 I'm very much married.

93
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 Kid on the way.

94
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 And it was asked.

95
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 It was this question.

96
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 Good.

97
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 I'm glad it was your favorite.

98
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 It's so memorable.

99
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 Oh, before I start, #DatingFAQ.

100
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 If you want to follow some of the, we'll be live tweeting during this, tweet out some

101
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 of the stuff that comes from this.

102
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 If you want to search later, #DatingFAQ, or you can post along with that.

103
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 So jump into the conversation with us.

104
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 We'll be using that the whole night and afterwards tonight.

105
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 So the first question came in related to dating and it was, who should pay?

106
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 Really?

107
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 Nice.

108
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 That's literally how it came in.

109
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 Who should pay?

110
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 Really?

111
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 Some angry guy or girl, I guess out there who didn't get paid for it.

112
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 Who should pay, JP?

113
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 The guy should pay.

114
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 Depending on how long they've dated, depending on what she's doing.

115
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 Maybe she wants to plan something special for him.

116
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 Is that sexist?

117
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 No.

118
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 1 Timothy 5 says that a man should provide for his family.

119
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 If he doesn't, he's worse than a non-believer.

120
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 He's denied the faith.

121
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 But wait a minute, that's not his family.

122
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 They're not married.

123
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 Who is that?

124
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 Well, remember why you're dating.

125
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 You're trying to get to know him.

126
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 You're trying to find out, hey, is he a good father, a good provider?

127
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 Is he these things?

128
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 And then 1 Peter 3 says that a husband should live with his wife in an understanding way.

129
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 That he should cherish her.

130
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 That he would treat her like something fragile.

131
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 And so you're trying to find out, is this the way that he's wired up?

132
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 And so for those reasons, I'd say, and there's certainly exceptions, but generally speaking,

133
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 he should pay.

134
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 So, the guy.

135
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 The guy.

136
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 Second question on a more serious note.

137
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 I'm glad that was your favorite, though.

138
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 I just love the really.

139
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 Callie.

140
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 Really, who should pay?

141
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 This question came in several times in different formats.

142
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 Can a girl ask a guy out on a date?

143
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 Or can she nudge him and let him know that she is interested?

144
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 Can a girl ask a guy out, take the lead, and initiate?

145
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 So the question is, can she?

146
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 And so, yeah, yeah, sure you can.

147
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 Should you?

148
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 No, I would say no.

149
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 Well, I would say it depends on what you want.

150
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 What you're looking for.

151
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 Like, so if you're like, hey, I'm a really strong leader and I'm looking for a super

152
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 passive guy that I can kind of boss around for the rest of my life.

153
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 But yeah, I mean, ask him out and.

154
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 And I'm sure that won't go very well for you.

155
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 But if you're looking for a leader, an initiator, if you're looking for the definition, the

156
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 way the Bible defines masculinity is someone who brings order and initiates.

157
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 And so if you're looking for that person, then I wouldn't start the relationship on

158
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 that foot.

159
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 I think Genesis revelation, the scripture teaches that men and women are equal in rank,

160
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 but play different roles.

161
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 And we have to be okay with that.

162
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 That's God's order.

163
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 And so read first Corinthians 11, Ephesians five, first Peter three, Colossians three.

164
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 All of these kind of paint this picture, even Genesis two and three, paint this picture

165
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 that, hey, this is the role that God wants the man and the woman to play.

166
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 And so I would just say, treasures don't do the hunting.

167
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 Women, you are valuable to God.

168
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 You are a treasure to God.

169
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 And so treasures don't look for someone to find them.

170
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 A treasure's wait to be found.

171
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 And so.

172
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 That's good.

173
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 Is it wrong?

174
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 It's another one came in.

175
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 Is it wrong to pray for God to bring me a spouse?

176
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 No, no.

177
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 Jesus says in Matthew six to ask, to go to God.

178
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 It says in Philippians four to present your request to God.

179
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 And so if that's the desires of your heart, you go to God and you say, Hey, this is what

180
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 I want.

181
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 You can even be specific.

182
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 God, I hope he's this tall.

183
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 I hope he's this smart.

184
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 I hope he runs this fast.

185
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 I hope he makes this much money.

186
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 Now wait, wait.

187
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 And God, while I'm asking you these things, would you conform my heart to your desires?

188
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 Cause, cause these are the things that I want.

189
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 They may not be the things that you want.

190
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 And so while I present my request to you, will you make my requests your requests?

191
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 And so as you're asking God for a spouse, make sure you don't overlook the wonderful

192
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 people that he has in your life that would make an incredible spouse while you're sitting

193
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 there and you're praying and you're begging him, would you please bring me someone?

194
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 And he's like, Hey, wake up.

195
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 They're all around you.

196
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 So sure.

197
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 Just while you're asking, make sure you're looking.

198
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 Love it.

199
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 Uh, here's a little bit more serious one too.

200
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 Is it okay to date someone who has been divorced?

201
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 Yeah, certainly.

202
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 It's okay to date someone.

203
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 Here's what I would say.

204
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 I would answer it like this.

205
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 It's okay to date anyone who is free to date.

206
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 And so now the question is, well, how do I know if they're free to date?

207
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 And so, um, there's two simple ways we could spend the entire night.

208
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 In fact, you taught on this, uh, um, when to break up, when not to battle the sexes,

209
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 an amazing message.

210
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 David taught it.

211
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 It's an incredible resource.

212
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 I point people to all the time.

213
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 And so it's powerful.

214
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 Yeah, it's powerful.

215
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 And, and so, um, okay, so how do I know if they're free to remarry?

216
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 That's really the question.

217
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 Are they free to remarry?

218
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 And so here, here's the answer.

219
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 And some of you aren't going to like this.

220
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 And so as I say this, as you leave here, just wrestle with these scriptures I'm about to put in front of you.

221
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 If their ex spouse is dead or remarried, then they're not available to remarry.

222
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 Now that their ex spouse is, is, uh, still alive and single, then they could pursue reconciliation.

223
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 And there's a chance that that would be God's best.

224
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 Well, wait a minute.

225
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 What if their ex spouse is not a believer?

226
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 You're telling me God can't save them?

227
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 What if their ex spouse is a Satan worshiper?

228
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 You telling me God can't change that?

229
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 I don't know the narrative that God wants to write.

230
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 And so to read on this in Matthew 19, I think it's verse six.

231
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 Jesus says, what man has brought, uh, what God has brought together, let man not separate.

232
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 So we have grown up in a culture where divorce is normative.

233
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 Divorce was not normative when God, the author of marriage brought two people together.

234
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 What if God, what if they weren't married in the church?

235
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 It doesn't matter.

236
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 Like when they got married, most likely they promised to each other, I'm going to be married to you until death do us part.

237
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 And people say all the time, well, but they, my spouse really changed.

238
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 I didn't know them.

239
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 Okay.

240
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 But you went into a covenant relationship before God with them.

241
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 And so that was a path you chose and we want to help you.

242
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 And maybe you should separate, you know, uh, maybe there's crazy situations going on.

243
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 Maybe there's abuse present.

244
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 You go to the church for help.

245
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 We'd love to help you walk in and through that.

246
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 But we have seen God doing incredible work in those marriages.

247
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 And so if they are free to remarry, absolutely.

248
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 God's the God of second chances.

249
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 I mean, he's sure, um, you can date assuming that, you know, they're running hard after God.

250
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 They haven't committed the unforgivable sin by any stretch of the imagination.

251
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 That's the short answer.

252
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 Okay.

253
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 Um, that, that's going to stir up a lot of questions for some of you.

254
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 Check out that resource and then reach out.

255
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 We'd love to talk with you.

256
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 Uh, in that same pool of thinking, is it okay to date someone who's not a Christian?

257
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 Is it okay?

258
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 Yes.

259
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 As long as you're not a Christian.

260
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 Um, so second Corinthians, let's close in prayer.

261
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 Yeah.

262
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 Second Corinthians six 14 says, do not be unequally yoked to unbelievers.

263
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 Uh, what does, what does light and darkness have in common?

264
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 What does wickedness and righteousness have in common?

265
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 You say, wait a minute, they're not wicked.

266
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 They're, they're just not a Christian.

267
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 Well, you know, the scriptures say they're an object of wrath at that point.

268
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 He said, well, what if I, if I break up with them, they're going to be turned off to God.

269
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 Let me tell you something.

270
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 God's a huge guy.

271
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 Okay.

272
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 He can handle your mistakes.

273
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 In fact, he's really in the business of handling your mistakes.

274
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 And so he can handle whatever fallout is going to happen as you walk in obedience and don't define obedience by the outcome.

275
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 Okay.

276
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 If you start to think, well, if I break up with them, then they're going to hate God forever and ever and ever.

277
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 Well, let's just be honest.

278
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 They already don't love God.

279
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 Okay.

280
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 And if God wants to save them, he will.

281
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 And so you break up and you pray like crazy for them that, that they would come around.

282
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 But, um, God's people choose God's people.

283
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 God's people date God's people.

284
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 Love it.

285
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 God's in the business of dealing with your mistakes.

286
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 It was good.

287
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 So that's what I do.

288
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 Is that right there?

289
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 That's right.

290
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 Right off the top of my dome.

291
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 I like it, man.

292
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 All right.

293
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 Next one is, uh, also similar.

294
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 The same pool of thought is, uh, it okay to date someone who is Catholic or if I am dating someone who is Catholic and I'm Protestant, is that okay?

295
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 You want these people to hate me?

296
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 I'm just trying to give people what they want.

297
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 I think you should take that one.

298
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 Here's what I would say.

299
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 You jump in.

300
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 Um, so let's think about this.

301
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 Are you going to go to separate churches?

302
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 Are you, so if you, if you're a Protestant, they're Catholic, are you guys going to go to separate churches?

303
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 Now, I came from a family that my mom was Lutheran.

304
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 My dad was Catholic.

305
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 They still, to this day, go to separate churches.

306
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 And I think a lot of times that's the way we define obedience.

307
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 We look around and we're like, well, it worked for them.

308
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 It must be God's will.

309
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 That's a really awful way to discern God's will.

310
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 Um, and so I would say, does, do they believe that we are saved by grace through faith alone?

311
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 And if you said, well, yes, they absolutely believe that we are saved by grace through faith alone.

312
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 Then I would say, well, then why are they Catholic?

313
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 Because to the best of my knowledge, that, that flies in the face of, uh, the Catholic catechism or the Catholic doctrine.

314
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 And you say, well, how do you know?

315
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 Well, here's how I know I was Catholic for nine years.

316
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 I'm sorry.

317
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 I was Catholic for 20 years.

318
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 I was, went to Catholic school for nine years, went to Catholic seminary for two weeks.

319
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 Uh, and, uh, and so, um, and so, yeah, I mean that just think, consider those things and, um, you know, do they believe we're saved by grace through faith alone?

320
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 And if so, you know, they might reconsider their commitment to the Catholic church.

321
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 I'm sure that is going to bring lots of people up to talk to me afterwards.

322
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 And David's cell phone number is.

323
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 That's good.

324
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 That's a great answer.

325
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 Um, here's a, uh, uh, one outside of that realm.

326
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 Uh, does physical attractiveness not matter?

327
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 Does physical, I'm not smart enough to answer the question.

328
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 Not matter or you take the knot out and just say, does it matter?

329
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 Is physical attraction important?

330
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 Yeah.

331
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 Yeah.

332
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 Physical attraction is important to the, uh, it's good.

333
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 Your Aggie friends wrote in some questions.

334
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 That's good.

335
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 Uh, he only made it in Catholic seminary two weeks.

336
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 He's still bitter.

337
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 Rejection letter still stings.

338
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 It hurts.

339
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 It hurts.

340
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 Physical attraction.

341
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 Here we go back on track.

342
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 I told you we should have let somebody else do physical attraction does exactly that.

343
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 It attracts.

344
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 And so to the point where you see someone and you want to walk up to them and you want

345
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 to engage with them.

346
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 But, uh, what I said earlier in a lot of people wrote in and said, Hey, explain that.

347
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 So I'm going to say it again.

348
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 Let's say you're dating someone and they're a really godly person, God honoring person,

349
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 God fearing person.

350
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 And you say, well, I'm not just, I'm not physically attracted to them.

351
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 Should I continue to date them?

352
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 And I would say, no, you're not spiritually mature enough to.

353
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 And people say, well, wait a minute.

354
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 Wait, what are you saying there?

355
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 I said, well, listen, I've read in the scripture, uh, first Samuel 16, where it's actually where

356
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 he says God looks at the heart.

357
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 Yeah.

358
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 Yes.

359
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 And so I'm almost positive.

360
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 It's first Samuel 16.

361
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 He says, Hey, God looks at the heart of a man.

362
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 He does not look what's on the outside.

363
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 And so you're saying, Hey, what is important to me is different than what's important to

364
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 God.

365
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 But as we pursue God, uh, we, we develop and grow the desires of God.

366
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 And so what am I saying?

367
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 Am I, am I saying you should find the ugliest, most godly person you can think of?

368
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 No, I, I, that's not what I'm saying at all, but I am saying that you should pray to be

369
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 attracted to what God's attracted to.

370
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 And he will do that.

371
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 And a lot of times you've got to understand what has, uh, what has given you the ideas

372
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 that you're attracted to?

373
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 Like what, what has given you the desires of your heart?

374
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 What is informed the desires of your heart rather.

375
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 And if you're looking at pornography or if that's a part of your past sin struggles,

376
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 if you're watching, you know, soap operas or the like, um, you know, depending on what

377
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 magazines you subscribe to, all of those are informing your heart and telling it what to

378
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 look to.

379
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 And so that may be why you're not attracted to what God is attracted to.

380
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 You may have bought into some lies in Dallas or Fort Worth or wherever it is you live.

381
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 So, um, yeah.

382
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 And last thing, beauty is a depreciating asset.

383
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 And so Proverbs 31 30 says charm is deceitful and beauty is what fleeting.

384
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 And so is beauty a bad thing?

385
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 No, man, I pray my girls are beautiful.

386
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 I pray they are beautiful.

387
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 Okay.

388
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 But I just pray that one, they don't know they're beautiful.

389
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 And two guys don't think they're beautiful.

390
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 No, um, uh, beauty is a good thing.

391
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 It's just a depreciating asset.

392
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 And so we're all getting uglier and you're like, Oh no, that's not, Oh my goodness.

393
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 I can't believe he said that.

394
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 Here's the deal, man.

395
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 None of you are attracted to 80 year olds.

396
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 All right.

397
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 And you're all going to look, you're all going to look in the mirror one day, God willing,

398
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 and every gravity is going to have taken its toll and everything's going to be wrinkly

399
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 and, and you know, you're gonna have less teeth and less hair.

400
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 And, uh, and so I'm just saying you're getting uglier.

401
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 Preach.

402
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 I know.

403
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 Hashtag preach.

404
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 Oh man.

405
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 I love it.

406
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 You can only do so much Botox.

407
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 Get scared face stuck in surprise everywhere you go.

408
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 Um, okay.

409
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 This one, uh, is going to only be more relevant and more important.

410
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 Is it okay to use apps like Tinder?

411
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 Is it okay to use apps like Tinder?

412
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 I don't know.

413
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 I don't know.

414
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 The Bible doesn't talk about dating apps.

415
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 Ruth and Boaz.

416
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 Tinder, swipe right.

417
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 I'm scared to speak.

418
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 Um, I haven't heard a lot of good things about Tinder, honestly, also known as the hookup

419
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 app.

420
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 And so, um, is it okay to use online dating or the like or technology?

421
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 Here's what I would say.

422
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 Don't date strangers.

423
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 And so the scripture really speaks to this idea, even in song of Solomon, where it says

424
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 their friends praise their love more than wine.

425
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 It's that the whole community is looking on what they have.

426
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 And in the biblical example is arranged marriages.

427
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 And so it's people coming together and say, man, you two really, really make sense.

428
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 Okay.

429
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 It's not like technology saying, Hey, you two are compatible.

430
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 There's no such thing as compatibility in relationships.

431
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 Sinners aren't compatible with centers.

432
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 Um, but, uh, and so here's the, what's the wisdom principle in this don't date strangers.

433
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 Friends don't let friends date strangers.

434
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 And so how are you going to know somebody just through an app?

435
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 I mean, and also profiles lie.

436
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 I mean, people did not present the truth on the profile.

437
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 So I don't care if he says I graduated from seminary and I love Jesus with all my heart.

438
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 And I, you know, care for the widows and the orphans.

439
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 I mean, he could be a con and I would just look around you guys.

440
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 Look, look where you're at.

441
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 Look around you.

442
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 I mean, I'm looking at, I'm seeing men and women and just because they're at the porch

443
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 doesn't mean they know God.

444
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 Okay.

445
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 Not at all.

446
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 I mean, they may be a predator of sorts, a wolf if you will, but, but here's the deal.

447
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 There's, you don't need to go on an app.

448
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 I mean, look around you.

449
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 And so is it, whether it's Tinder or something else, I would just be really, really wise.

450
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 And I wouldn't do it in isolation.

451
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 And if you're addicted to it, if you can't stop it, clearly that's a bad thing.

452
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 But the scripture says everything is lawful.

453
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 Not everything is beneficial.

454
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 This falls into one of those categories for me that I don't think is beneficial.

455
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 And frankly, I don't think is necessary.

456
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 It's good.

457
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 Am I prepared to say it's absolutely wrong?

458
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 No.

459
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 And there may be a difference between Tinder and the other apps.

460
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 Sure.

461
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 You can't group them all together.

462
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 Can you date, this came in a couple of times.

463
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 Can you date or go on dates with several people at once?

464
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 Like if you're in a polygamous cult?

465
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 Like Johnny asked Sally out on Monday.

466
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 Sally goes on a date.

467
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 Sally gets asked out by Steve on Wednesday.

468
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 And, um, and can't she go on a date with Steve and Johnny?

469
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 At the same time?

470
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 No, not at the same night.

471
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 Not like the bachelor.

472
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 Like different nights.

473
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 Different nights.

474
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 Different people.

475
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 What would you say?

476
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 I would say, uh, honesty is your best friend in any relationship context.

477
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 And so as honest as you can be with anybody.

478
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 So if Johnny asks you out and then two days later and he says, Hey, I'd love to take you on a second date.

479
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 And you would like to go on that second date.

480
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 Say, I'd love to go on that second date.

481
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 And then if two days later, Steve asks you out, I would say, tell him, Hey, Steve,

482
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 I'd love to go out.

483
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 I'm going on a second date with Johnny.

484
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 Here's the entirety of our relationship right now.

485
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 Just so you know, that's a really complicated answer.

486
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 I would just be upfront and honest about it.

487
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 I think honesty is going to be your friend in all scenarios.

488
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 Romans 12, nine says, love must be sincere.

489
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 And so here's what I would tell you.

490
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 If you have to hide anything, if you feel like you're sneaking around at all, if you can't look someone in the eyes and say, I was on a date with, was it Johnny or Steve or someone?

491
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 I was on a date last night with someone else and Hey, I may be going on a date with someone else tomorrow.

492
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 If you can't just put it, if it's not okay, that it's on the front page of the paper, then in any scenario for the rest of your life, you probably shouldn't do it.

493
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 And so first John one talks about walking in the light of Ephesians, talk about walking in the light.

494
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 There's an element to Christianity that we're just fully transparent.

495
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 Our lives are open books.

496
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 There's nothing.

497
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 I'm not, there's nothing I'm afraid of that you're going to find out about me.

498
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 And that should really mark your dating life.

499
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 There's, there's nothing that I need to hide from you.

500
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 I don't need to brain dump everything on you the first night either, but there's nothing that I need to need to hide from you.

501
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 And so Romans 12, nine, love must be sincere.

502
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 It's a good word.

503
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 And I think that's huge because honesty is like contagious.

504
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 Honest people tend to attract honest people.

505
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 And so dishonest people, deceitful people, or people that tend to hide things tend to attract people that tend to hide things.

506
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 Yeah, that's good.

507
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 Jacob and Laban.

508
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 Yeah.

509
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 Okay.

510
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 So number 10.

511
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 What if I'm dating someone and we, and this came in four or five times.

512
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 What if I'm dating someone and we have had sex, but are now pursuing purity and a Godly relationship together?

513
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 Are we doomed because of our sin?

514
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 No.

515
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 Proverbs 10 verse 12 says love covers a multitude of wrongs.

516
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 Romans 8, one says there's now no condemnation for those who are in Christ.

517
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 Second Corinthians 5, 17 I think, says that the Lord is no longer counting his sins against you.

518
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 And so no, God, as I said earlier, God's a God of second chances.

519
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 But here's the deal.

520
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 Now you may need to put new boundaries in place because it's very difficult to go backwards.

521
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 And so God can absolutely heal you.

522
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 He can absolutely restore you, but you need to be honest.

523
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 And you need, the community needs to be involved.

524
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 Others need to be looking in on that relationship.

525
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 And if that's you and you hear this and you're stirred with hope right now, like hear me say this, it's time to stop right now to do whatever is necessary to cease that physical element of your relationship to stop like right now.

526
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 And so that may mean that you're not alone together anymore until you're married.

527
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 That's good.

528
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 In that same category as it relates to physical boundaries, how far is too far?

529
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 That's the question.

530
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 The question on every Q&A of all time.

531
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 Yeah.

532
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 How far is too far?

533
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 A couple of things.

534
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 I'm just going to give you some wisdom principles on this.

535
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 If I want you to consider for a second how far you want to go before you're married in a relationship.

536
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 So what's the end result?

537
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 Like what do you hope?

538
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 Hey, we don't go.

539
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 I hope we don't go past this.

540
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 And so some of you would say, well, I'm okay with making out.

541
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 And so let's just say hypothetical.

542
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 Hypothetically speaking, that's okay.

543
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 Well, it's okay.

544
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 You know, well, if that's the end goal before you're married, I certainly wouldn't start there.

545
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 Like I wouldn't start there on third date that because you're starting at the finish line.

546
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 And so consider that.

547
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 Hey, what all do I want to do before I'm married?

548
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 What do I think is okay?

549
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 And and then like pace yourself, if you will.

550
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 And so we know at the altar that there's this beautiful moment where I say to everyone there.

551
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 And the reason it's a part of the ceremony, I don't know if you ever thought about this.

552
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 The reason this is a part of the ceremony, because for so long tradition would have it.

553
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 That's the first time that couple would kiss and everyone would see it.

554
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 And so it's like, hey, it's a big deal.

555
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 Everybody look on.

556
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 Hey, ready?

557
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 You ready?

558
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 You may kiss your bride.

559
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 Well, now it's like, well, yeah, you can kiss him again.

560
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 I mean, you were kissing him last night.

561
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 Y'all did more than that.

562
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 You might, you know, and so it's a much less of a big deal now, but you've got to consider

563
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 where that tradition comes from.

564
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 And so here's what I would tell you.

565
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 Here's the really practical answer.

566
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 If your body is preparing itself for sex, you've gone too far.

567
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 Do I need to explain myself further?

568
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 Like, do I need to get graphic?

569
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 You sure?

570
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 I think I think they got it.

571
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 If your body, men, men, if your body is preparing itself for sex, ladies, if your body is preparing

572
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 itself for sex, you've gone too far.

573
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 Well, wait a minute, JP, dude, that means I can't even be in the same room with her.

574
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 Man, you don't understand how hot she is.

575
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 Listen, it might mean you can't be in the same room alone.

576
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 You know, you're probably not going to have sex at Starbucks, you know, and so it may,

577
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 it may mean tweet that.

578
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 Yeah, it may mean, um, it may mean that you guys can't be alone together.

579
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 I don't know.

580
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 And so that's not crazy.

581
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 I mean, just like as quickly and effectively as you can, efficiently as you can get married

582
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 and have all the sex you want.

583
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 Um, last thing I would say, I've said this before is, is like when somebody says, Hey,

584
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 how close to the edge of the building can I get?

585
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 I just say, Hey, do you want to jump off?

586
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 Because if you want to jump off, I wouldn't even get on the elevator.

587
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 I wouldn't even go up to the roof.

588
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 If you want to jump off the building, stay on the ground.

589
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 And if we're honest, when it comes to sex and intimacy, we want to jump off.

590
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 Our body is naturally wired to go all the way.

591
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 That's why it's preparing itself for sex so that you can have sex.

592
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 And if you can't have sex, it's unloving to go there.

593
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 The scripture says in Salaam Salomon, do not awaken love before it's time.

594
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 How much better off would we be if we waited, you know, and went with God's design on this deal?

595
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 It's really good.

596
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 Can I, this is another one came in, can I travel with my boyfriend and stay in a hotel if we're committed to purity and both of our community groups hold us to that?

597
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 Here's what I would do.

598
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 I would start by going to your community groups.

599
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 And I would say, hey guys, I need to let you know I think you've sinned against me.

600
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 Because you have not held me accountable to what is appropriate.

601
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 And when you said that we can travel together and you were just going to check in with us, that was what you guys should have done is pulled your resources together so that I could get my own hotel room.

602
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 What you should have done is chipped in on this little trip, you know.

603
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 And here's what I would say, if the only option is staying together, don't go.

604
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 It's his brother's wedding, who cares?

605
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 You don't go to his brother's wedding if that's what it means to honor God.

606
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 You say, well wait a minute, I thought what was sinful is sex.

607
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 I would say, hey, you were not meant to stay in the same hotel room with the opposite sex and not have sex.

608
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 You should have sex.

609
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 You were wired to.

610
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 And so you're training your body, hey, I'm teaching you, whenever I'm alone with this man or whenever I'm alone with this woman, don't have sex, don't have sex, don't have sex.

611
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 You're putting pathways in your brain.

612
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 Hey, whenever we're alone together in a hotel room, I want you to know that you can't have sex.

613
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 You know what, I just read a statistic the other day that said 30 to 40% of married couples sleep in separate beds.

614
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 Did you hear that?

615
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 30 to 40% of married couples today sleep in separate beds.

616
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 People who sleep in separate beds in hotel rooms when they're single sleep in separate beds when they're married.

617
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 And so I would just, man, I would say that's not, that's not God's best practice for you, man.

618
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 You were meant, why play with evil?

619
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 The scripture says, 1 Corinthians 6, 18 through 20 says, flee sexual immorality.

620
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 All other sins a man commits are outside his body, but whoever sins sexually sins in a very special and unique way.

621
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 It says, do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit who's in you, whom you've received from God?

622
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 You are not your own.

623
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 You've been purchased.

624
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 You've been bought at a price.

625
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 Therefore, honor God with your bodies.

626
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 And so when you say, hey, can we, you know, let's just both go have these on this motel six, you know, for your brother's wedding.

627
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 You know, that does not sound like running from as fast as you can sexual immorality.

628
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 That sounds like, hey, let's poke sexual immorality or, or, you know, see how close we can get.

629
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 And so it, you know, that, that feels, that feels like the how far is too far.

630
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 That's too far.

631
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 And if you're asking how far is too far, you've gone too far.

632
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 I would say in nine years of vocational ministry, the person who asked how far is too far has gone too far.

633
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 And they're asking the wrong question.

634
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 I know I went back one, but I had more to say on that.

635
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 Hey man, you, you be you, you be you.

636
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 How can you, this is another one that came in multiple times.

637
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 How can you guard your hearts, guard your heart?

638
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 You have multiple hearts.

639
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 How can you guard your heart or the person's heart that you're dating?

640
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 How can you guard your heart or the person's heart?

641
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 Whose heart are we guarding?

642
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 Just like, just read the question.

643
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 Practically.

644
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 I feel like there's some spelling errors.

645
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 Okay.

646
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 How can you guard your heart practically or the person who you were dating's heart?

647
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 The heart's always going somewhere.

648
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 Okay, man.

649
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 We are sensitive, fragile, emotional beings.

650
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 And so be careful what you say, be careful what you do.

651
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 That proverb in Proverbs 4.23, guard your heart for it is the wellspring of life.

652
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 Everything you do flows from it, it says.

653
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 And then it says, be careful where you let your eyes go.

654
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 Be careful how you talk.

655
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 Do not let perversity come out of your mouth.

656
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 And so that proverb is just a great description of how to guard a heart.

657
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 And what I would say is, guys, girls are wanderers.

658
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 They wander a lot.

659
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 So don't let them wander.

660
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 That's that whole, the genius behind the DTR, the define the relationship.

661
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 You need to anticipate what her questions are and answer them.

662
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 Say, hey, this is what I'm doing.

663
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 Don't be intense, you know, but be intentional.

664
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 Say, hey, this is what we're doing here.

665
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 This is what I'm thinking.

666
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 This is where I see this going.

667
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 Hey, I'm really glad we're here together.

668
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 This is what's going on in my mind.

669
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 As much as you can, unveil your thoughts to her so she doesn't leave there and go,

670
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 are we just friends?

671
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 What is this?

672
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 Is this a friend-ation ship?

673
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 What's the deal here?

674
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 How, you know, or is he going to propose tomorrow?

675
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 You know, what's that?

676
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 That's those are things girls should never ask us.

677
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 Are we just friends or is he going to propose?

678
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 That's a bad thing.

679
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 And so I think being honest, that whole Romans 12, 9, your love must be sincere.

680
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 And then I would just say something we've said in the past that I really like is,

681
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 and this is what I think Proverbs 4, 23 is saying.

682
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 Don't follow your heart, but inform your heart.

683
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 Tell it where to go.

684
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 And so, ladies, don't let your heart wander 10 years down the road.

685
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 I mean, if you're on your first date, don't be naming children.

686
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 Okay, it's not, that's not in good practice.

687
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 Don't let it just, you know, get, don't let it progress further than what is reality.

688
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 What's in front of you right now.

689
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 It's really good.

690
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 You keep saying that.

691
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 That one was okay.

692
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 Is it wrong to pray together?

693
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 This one came in surprisingly several times.

694
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 Is it wrong to pray together before getting married?

695
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 What would you say?

696
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 Better than sex.

697
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 I would say, I would say.

698
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 You disagree.

699
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 I didn't even step into that ring.

700
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 I would say, I mean, it depends on what you're talking about.

701
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 If you're talking about at a meal, here's like why, where that comes from.

702
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 So if you went to A&M or you went to Texas or you went to some of the bigger schools that have what's called Bucks,

703
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 there's an organization there and different organizations.

704
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 And you may have heard that if you grew up in the church where it's like, hey,

705
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 you shouldn't pray together before you get married.

706
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 The reason behind that is not necessarily a verse that informs it,

707
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 but it's just such an intimate act.

708
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 Anytime you move into the realm of spirituality,

709
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 there's a really intimate thing that involves your soul at a deep level.

710
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 So that's why they say, practically speaking, to guard your heart,

711
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 you should be leery of stepping into that, of praying consistently and having like private prayer time,

712
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 just the two of you in a closet together praying.

713
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 And so that's the reasoning behind there.

714
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 So it depends on what you're asking.

715
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 If you're praying before a meal, I'd say, no, that's fine.

716
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 But if you're praying at a more, they're your prayer partner, that may be unwise.

717
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 So that's how I'd answer.

718
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 Yeah. Bless this food. Probably okay.

719
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 Lord, please help me not rip off his clothes because he's so hot right now.

720
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 You know, probably not okay.

721
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 [Laughter]

722
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 I agree.

723
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 You got to bring specifics to it, man.

724
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 People will have questions.

725
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 Dude, that was great, man.

726
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 I'm trying so hard to stay focused right now and not step into that ring.

727
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 Okay. When to say those three little words, I love you.

728
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 Want to break up. Oh.

729
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 [Laughter]

730
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 This is why we only made it two weeks in that Catholic seminary.

731
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 Four little words to want to break up.

732
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 Your words hurt me.

733
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 When to say I love you.

734
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 I would be slow to say it and quick to prove it.

735
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 And what I mean by prove it, I'm not talking flowers and doors.

736
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 I'm talking, you know, you read Ephesians 5.

737
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 Husbands lay your lives down for your wives as Christ did the church.

738
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 So what does it look like to prove that you love?

739
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 It looks like holding boundaries to purity.

740
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 It looks like sacrificing your own flesh, your own selfish desires for the good of a relationship and to honor God.

741
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 And so as you're proving that, as you prove that constantly, you know, and you're moving towards the altar, I think it's a great time to say it.

742
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 We grew up in a culture where that was just, you know, you're in the sixth grade.

743
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 You're talking to some girl that you're never going to have a chance of marrying.

744
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 You're like, hey, girl, I love you.

745
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 You know, you're singing boys to men song to her.

746
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 And that's just me.

747
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 Anyways. And so, you know, that's just not in good form.

748
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 It's not sincere. It's not Romans 12.9, if you will.

749
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 And so, yeah, I would just say, hey, prove it before you say it.

750
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 Show it before you say it.

751
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
 You can be slow to say it.

752
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 I was going to say something else there and I forgot.

753
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:47,000
 You want me to have him talk amongst themselves for a second?

754
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 How do I know this one came in multiple times to how do I know if they are the one?

755
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 How do I know if they are the one?

756
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 Usually that knowledge comes right at about this time.

757
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 Someone like me is standing with you saying, I now pronounce you husband and wife.

758
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 And at that point, they're the one.

759
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 And so let me say it like this.

760
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 I'm married. I'm married.

761
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 I married Monica. I've said this before. It always upsets people.

762
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 So my wife, is there anyone else out there for her?

763
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 I mean, could she be happily married to someone else?

764
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 Is there someone even more right for her than me out there?

765
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 And the answer is absolutely yes.

766
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 My wife is 5'3". I'm 6'7".

767
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 I mean, God just has a sense of humor.

768
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
 I like guns and motorcycles.

769
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 I mean, there's a dude out there that would be home right now.

770
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 I'm here with you guys.

771
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 There's a guy there that would be home at 5.30 on Tuesdays.

772
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 And so there's lots of guys out there that would be great for her.

773
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 Now, I'm the one for her because we went to the altar together.

774
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 There's not one for you.

775
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 There's not this magic random when you were born somewhere around the same year some guy was born.

776
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
 And you two are star-crossed lovers wandering somewhere around the world.

777
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,000
 And you're aimlessly hoping that you find each other and Tinder may be the answer.

778
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 That's not the case.

779
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 Okay, that's crazy.

780
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
 That's crazy. There's lots of ones for you.

781
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 Lots of ones.

782
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
 I mean, love God with all your heart.

783
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
 Find someone who loves God with all their hearts.

784
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
 That you enjoy being around.

785
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
 That's going to be a good spouse, a good parent.

786
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 And spend the rest of your life with them.

787
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 And it's going to be hard.

788
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
 And work it out.

789
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 And they're going to change.

790
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
 And you're going to change.

791
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
 And you're going to mature.

792
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
 And they're going to mature.

793
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
 And things are going to happen.

794
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 And life circumstances are going to happen.

795
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
 You may miscarry.

796
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 He may lose his job.

797
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
 You may go through depression.

798
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
 He may get cancer.

799
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 Okay, you don't think about those things when you're 25 years old and single.

800
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 All you're thinking about is, "Well, where's the one out there?"

801
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:54,000
 Man, marriage is so much more practical than you ever hope to admit.

802
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 You know where you've taken marriage advice from?

803
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
 I'm angry now.

804
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
 You made me angry.

805
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
 I can see that.

806
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
 We all see that.

807
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 We've got our marriage advice from Hollywood.

808
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
 Hollywood has the worst divorce rate ever.

809
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
 They're awful at marriage.

810
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 The people who are telling you how to have a marriage suck at marriage.

811
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
 They're not good at it.

812
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
 And they're saying, "Hey, listen.

813
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 This is how you need to be compatible.

814
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
 You need to have this."

815
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 And then you look at their divorce rate, and it's through the roof.

816
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
 They're the worst people in marriage giving us marriage advice.

817
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 Take marriage advice from the Scriptures.

818
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
 Okay, from the Bible.

819
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
 And so much of what we learn, we have to unlearn.

820
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
 And I know you're hearing some radical things right now.

821
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 Just get by yourself.

822
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
 Open the Word.

823
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
 Begin to read the Scriptures that you're here to learn.

824
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
 David could answer these questions.

825
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 Anyone here with any knowledge of the Word can answer these questions.

826
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
 This is not JP's dating advice.

827
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
 As much as I can, I'm saying, "Hey, these are things.

828
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
 These are principles that the Scripture says.

829
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
 This is where it informs that."

830
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:58,000
 And so the one for you is the one that you covenant before God with,

831
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 that you're going to spend the rest of your life.

832
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
 Because if not, then you're going to get in that relationship,

833
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
 and you're going to say, "Man, I may have married the wrong one."

834
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
 And lo and behold, your neighbor is going to be amazing,

835
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
 and you're going to think, "Maybe he or she was the one for me.

836
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
 And maybe I made a mistake, and maybe I need to undo that mistake."

837
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
 And people do it all the time, and it's always a mistake.

838
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
 That is always a mistake.

839
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
 And so let me say this right here.

840
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
 We just wrote a blog on this.

841
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
 Every single question, to the best of my knowledge, that came in,

842
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
 we have written blogs on.

843
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
 Go to theportsdallas.com/blog.

844
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
 Use it like Google.

845
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
 There's a search box there.

846
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
 You can search these questions, and there's entire papers written on them

847
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
 for further resources.

848
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
 - Love it.

849
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:45,000
 What if I'm having doubts, but they meet all the criteria of a godly spouse?

850
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
 - Yeah, I would just say it depends on what your doubts are in.

851
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,000
 Are you doubting that they're hot enough for you,

852
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:58,000
 or are you doubting that they actually have a legit relationship with Jesus?

853
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
 Or do doubts mark you?

854
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 Like, are you someone that you look backwards, and you're like,

855
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
 "You can't even choose what bread to buy,

856
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
 much less who you're going to spend the rest of your life with."

857
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
 And so it's like, if that's your problem, you need to heal from that issue.

858
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
 If you're kind of this paralysis by analysis,

859
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
 "I just overthink everything,"

860
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
 I mean, this may just be a case of cold feet.

861
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
 You know, who knows?

862
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
 But if there's legitimate doubts, if you're like,

863
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 "Man, I don't even know if they're a Christian,

864
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
 or I'm seeing some behaviors in their life that are really questionable,"

865
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
 then you know what you need to do.

866
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
 Proverbs 3, 5, and 6 says, "Trust in the Lord with all your heart,

867
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
 and lean not on your own understandings,"

868
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
 not trusting your doubts, not trusting your understanding,

869
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
 "but in all your ways, acknowledge God."

870
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
 Look and pursue God, and he will make your path straight.

871
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
 He will direct your path. He will show you where to go.

872
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
 - Okay, so four more.

873
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
 - Come on.

874
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
 - When it comes to getting engaged,

875
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,000
 how long should you date before you get engaged?

876
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:00,000
 - All right, Leviticus 17 in the Hebrew says

877
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:06,000
 that two Christians should date three months, two weeks, and four days.

878
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
 No, I'm lying.

879
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
 How long should you--

880
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
 - Two days?

881
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
 - Four days.

882
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
 So why are you dating?

883
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:22,000
 You're dating to find out if they would make a godly spouse and godly parent.

884
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,000
 And so as soon as you know they'd make a godly spouse or godly parent, marry them.

885
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
 You're incompatible.

886
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
 You're not dating to find out if you're compatible.

887
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
 You're incompatible. You're two sinners, okay?

888
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,000
 You're male and female. You're completely incompatible.

889
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
 But marriage is two selfish people coming together,

890
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
 agreeing to be selfless towards one another for the rest of their lives.

891
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
 Sometimes I always have this insecurity in these messages that people are like,

892
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
 "Man, his marriage must be awful."

893
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
 I'm not speaking from my own experience.

894
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
 I'm speaking from what the Scriptures say

895
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
 and meeting with literally hundreds of people

896
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
 and meeting this right before the altar, after the altar,

897
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:03,000
 10 years into marriage, 30 years into marriage, 50 years into marriage.

898
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,000
 And so I just remember being on the other side of the altar

899
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
 and being really naive to these truths,

900
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
 and so I'm putting them in front of you.

901
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
 And so as soon as you can effectively know,

902
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
 now listen, if it's five years, if you've been dating for five years,

903
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
 I'm like, "What did you hope to learn?

904
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
 "You're three, you're four, you're five.

905
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
 "What were you hoping to find out?"

906
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
 And you're like, "Well, I just wasn't ready for marriage."

907
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
 That's a very American idea.

908
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
 It's like, "Oh, I need to be rich before I can,

909
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
 "I need to afford a wedding before I can get married."

910
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,000
 These are very Western cultural ideas.

911
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
 Just be careful not to fall into that trap.

912
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
 You need to process this with a biblical worldview, okay?

913
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:43,000
 Not a materialistic worldview, if you will.

914
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
 - And something you've said before is

915
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
 if you're enjoying dating long-term,

916
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
 you're probably doing it wrong.

917
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
 In other words, you're probably having sex--

918
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
 - Dating's awful.

919
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
 - You're probably sleeping together, yeah, it's terrible.

920
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
 - Right, I mean, dating's not, I mean, marriage is fun.

921
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
 Dating's like, I mean, it's emotional highs and lows,

922
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
 lots of tears, you know, there's joys

923
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,000
 that are matched by lots of frustrations

924
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
 and sleepless nights and what is he thinking?

925
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,000
 And so, like, get married already, man.

926
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
 - That's true.

927
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
 (audience laughing)

928
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
 Engagement is worse, I think.

929
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
 Emily Walker, you know what I'm talking about.

930
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
 - That's true.

931
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
 - Emily is engaged--

932
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
 - Emily, come up here and tell 'em.

933
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
 - Yeah, Emily, get her a microphone.

934
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
 All right, last three.

935
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
 I am a woman who doesn't--

936
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
 - No, you're not.

937
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
 (audience laughing)

938
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
 - Hey, this is how you were gonna break this news to me.

939
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
 - Oh, man, it's all coming out now.

940
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
 I am--

941
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
 (laughing)

942
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
 - Oh, wow.

943
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
 - This is from a woman who wrote this.

944
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
 She says, and I quote,

945
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,000
 "I am a woman who doesn't necessarily

946
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
 "want kids in my future.

947
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,000
 "Does it freak guys out more if women don't want kids

948
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,000
 "versus if women do want kids?"

949
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
 Tell us what freaks out the men, baby.

950
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
 (audience laughing)

951
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
 The women out there wanna know.

952
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
 - I wanna be, like with the divorce one and this one,

953
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
 these heavy, heavy questions,

954
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
 and I don't wanna be trite or cliche,

955
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
 but I do wanna be direct.

956
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
 And so just know that I know there's a sensitivity here.

957
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
 And so let me just start here.

958
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
 Who cares what you want?

959
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
 You tracking with me?

960
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
 Like when was this ever about what you wanted?

961
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:22,000
 And so I say that intentionally with some bite to it.

962
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,000
 'Cause Proverbs 127 says that children

963
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
 are a blessing from the Lord.

964
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
 And so if you don't want children,

965
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
 I'd question, like why do you want marriage?

966
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
 Why do you want companionship?

967
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
 Well, that sounds like, you know,

968
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
 the scriptures all say do nothing out of selfish ambition

969
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
 or vain conceit.

970
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000
 And so, and as you're thinking about guys,

971
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
 I mean, you don't wanna run a strategy based on,

972
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
 well, what is the guy like?

973
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
 And that's what I wanna give to him.

974
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
 You wanna say, hey, what does God value?

975
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
 And how do I live that out?

976
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
 Whether I'm single the rest of my life or not.

977
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,000
 What does God Almighty, the creator of the heavens

978
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
 and the earth, who formed me in my mother's womb

979
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
 and has a plan for me and a purpose for me,

980
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
 what's important to him and how do I live that out?

981
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,000
 And I would tell you that children are important to him.

982
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
 Now, let me say this.

983
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
 What if I can't have children?

984
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
 That's a different question.

985
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
 You can always adopt, you can always disciple.

986
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,000
 I mean, some of the godliest couples I know,

987
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
 they never had children because they were unable to

988
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
 and yet they turned their lives out

989
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
 and made disciples out of dozens and dozens of people.

990
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
 And so you can always do that.

991
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
 You may not be able to have children biologically,

992
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
 but you can make disciples.

993
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
 I would say marriage, a key part of marriage,

994
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
 the reason God invented marriage was,

995
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
 or one of the two primary reasons I believe

996
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,000
 God invented marriage was for procreation.

997
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
 He says in Genesis, be fruitful and multiply,

998
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
 fill the earth and subdue it.

999
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
 He says that to Adam and Eve.

1000
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
 He says it again to Noah, I think in Genesis 9.

1001
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
 And so be fruitful and multiply,

1002
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
 fill the earth and subdue it.

1003
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,000
 Psalm 127, children are a blessing of the Lord.

1004
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
 Children are a blessing of the Lord.

1005
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
 Blessed is a man whose quiver is full of them.

1006
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
 And so if you don't see children as a blessing,

1007
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
 then you don't see children in the same way

1008
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
 that God sees them.

1009
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
 - So in essence, it's like you're asking the wrong question

1010
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
 and you're saying, hey, it's not what I want

1011
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
 and I wanna do what guys want,

1012
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
 so tell me what guys want.

1013
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
 And you're saying focus on what God wants.

1014
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
 - Focus on what God wants, absolutely.

1015
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
 - Inside of your life, it's good.

1016
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
 - There you go.

1017
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
 - That was succinct, I like that.

1018
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
 - It was, it was powerful, another one.

1019
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
 (audience laughing)

1020
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,000
 I've been having feelings for a girlfriend for a while now.

1021
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
 I feel like these are like confessionals.

1022
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
 (audience laughing)

1023
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
 I love it, I love it, people trust us.

1024
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
 I've been having feelings for a girlfriend of mine

1025
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
 for a while now and I'm certain

1026
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
 she's starting to have feelings for me too.

1027
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
 How can I approach this situation

1028
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
 and tell her how I feel about her?

1029
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,000
 (audience laughing)

1030
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:40,000
 - This is a tough one.

1031
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
 (audience laughing)

1032
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,000
 I want you all to get a pen and paper, okay?

1033
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
 (audience laughing)

1034
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,000
 I'm serious, so I want you to write this down.

1035
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
 I

1036
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,000
 like

1037
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,000
 you.

1038
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
 (audience laughing)

1039
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
 (audience applauding)

1040
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:11,000
 And parenthetically,

1041
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
 I would say,

1042
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
 look her in the eyes

1043
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:19,000
 and tell her I'm really interested in you.

1044
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
 I'd like to spend more time with you.

1045
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
 My son,

1046
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:26,000
 my son, we're through, right?

1047
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
 I can stand up now?

1048
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
 - One more, but you're welcome to stand.

1049
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
 - Okay, okay.

1050
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
 (audience laughing)

1051
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
 - Stretch him out, man.

1052
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
 - Okay, stretch it out.

1053
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
 (audience laughing)

1054
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
 My son,

1055
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,000
 we would call him Caveman 'cause he's just kinda grunt

1056
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
 and moan and make these noises

1057
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
 and he would just kinda throw a fit

1058
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
 whenever he didn't get his way

1059
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
 and we would always say, "Use your words.

1060
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
 "Weston, use your words."

1061
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
 And so guys, that's what I would exhort you in this.

1062
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
 (audience laughing)

1063
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,000
 Use your words, all right?

1064
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
 (Weston laughing)

1065
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,000
 Like you think in English, you know?

1066
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
 You think in a language.

1067
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
 And so turn your thoughts to words

1068
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,000
 and present them as clearly as you can to a young woman.

1069
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
 And so ask her out, man.

1070
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
 I mean, if you are ready to date

1071
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
 and she's ready to date and you're interested in her,

1072
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
 like go to her and just say,

1073
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:15,000
 "Man, I would love to spend more time with you intentionally.

1074
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,000
 "I'm really interested in dating you.

1075
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
 "I like you.

1076
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,000
 "Let's go."

1077
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
 - All right, lovely.

1078
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
 All right.

1079
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
 - One more, ladies and gentlemen.

1080
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
 - One more and then I'm gonna let you close it out

1081
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
 and close this out.

1082
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
 What should I do while I wait for God

1083
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
 to bring about the right person?

1084
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
 What should I do right now in this season

1085
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,000
 while I wait for God to bring about the right person?

1086
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
 - Wait for God to bring about the right person?

1087
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
 Let's pray.

1088
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
 No.

1089
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
 (congregation laughing)

1090
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
 I would just say like,

1091
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
 we had this like mantra for the porch forever,

1092
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
 like you're becoming something, right?

1093
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,000
 And so, you know, Andy Stanley says,

1094
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
 be the someone that the someone you're looking for

1095
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
 is looking for, all right?

1096
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
 Or become the someone

1097
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
 that someone you're looking for is looking for.

1098
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
 And so here's what I would tell you

1099
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:04,000
 is become the someone that God has planned for you to be,

1100
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
 that God has intentions for you.

1101
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
 Like you're, like develop.

1102
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,000
 And so if you wanna be a good wife, right,

1103
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
 then just think about, hey, what makes a good wife

1104
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
 and how do I become that?

1105
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
 Now ladies, let me say this, really important,

1106
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
 'cause this is really important, okay?

1107
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
 It's not like an if-then statement.

1108
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
 It's not voodoo.

1109
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,000
 It's not like, well, as soon as I learn to bake and clean,

1110
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
 then God's gonna, you know,

1111
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
 drop a husband through the roof.

1112
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
 That's not what's gonna happen, okay?

1113
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
 And that's not even what I'm saying, all right?

1114
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
 And guys, it's not like this if-then,

1115
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
 well, you know, she's magically gonna appear, okay?

1116
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,000
 So if you're looking for someone, one, look for someone.

1117
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
 You can pray, we covered a lot of these things.

1118
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
 You can pray for them.

1119
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
 But at the same time, like it is fine to desire marriage.

1120
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,000
 It's not okay to need marriage.

1121
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
 It's not okay.

1122
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
 Your heart is an idle factory.

1123
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
 And if it's grabbed something so tight

1124
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
 that you're completely discontent,

1125
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
 I mean, you know the answer to that question.

1126
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
 What do I do if I'm waiting on someone?

1127
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
 One, like stop waiting.

1128
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
 You're not in a waiting room.

1129
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
 You're not in a holding tank.

1130
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,000
 Like you're an able-bodied, amazing gift

1131
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,000
 that God created for himself.

1132
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
 And so begin to unleash your gifts

1133
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,000
 and serve him with radical abandonment,

1134
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,000
 reckless abandonment, and love him with all your heart

1135
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
 and learn his word.

1136
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,000
 I know you feel so busy.

1137
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
 I know you do, okay?

1138
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
 I get it.

1139
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
 I know you do, all right?

1140
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,000
 But when you have kids that depend on you

1141
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
 and someone, a roommate, that you've entered

1142
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
 in a covenant relationship with,

1143
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
 that you're gonna care for them

1144
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
 and help them and provide for them,

1145
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,000
 you're going to have a lot less time.

1146
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
 And so as busy as you feel like right now,

1147
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
 life only gets busier.

1148
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
 So right now you create margin to know God

1149
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
 and to love God so that you can continue

1150
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:43,000
 for the rest of your life to know God and love God.

1151
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
 Okay, we covered a lot of questions.

1152
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
 And I liken it to this.

1153
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
 I just got back early this morning

1154
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,000
 from speaking in Waco.

1155
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
 I had two speaking opportunities there.

1156
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
 And if I'm totally transparent with you,

1157
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,000
 what freaks me out the most about these opportunities,

1158
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
 what concerns me the most,

1159
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,000
 what causes me the most stress on the front end, okay,

1160
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
 is not what I'm gonna say.

1161
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
 It's not the scriptures I'm gonna cover.

1162
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
 It's not the illustrations.

1163
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
 It's actually getting to the locations.

1164
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
 Like I never know where they are.

1165
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
 I never know how to get there.

1166
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
 I don't know how early I need to be.

1167
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
 And then when I get to the property,

1168
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
 I don't know if I just like show up

1169
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
 and someone magically finds me

1170
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
 and tells me where to go.

1171
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
 And so these are the questions that I have.

1172
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
 So a lot of times I'll spend the front end of the time.

1173
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
 You know, I've prepared the message.

1174
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
 That's there.

1175
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
 I know that God's gotta speak through me.

1176
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
 Like if it's me, you know, it's gonna fall flat anyways.

1177
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
 And so I'm not worried about that.

1178
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
 I'm just like, hey, I need to make sure I get there

1179
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
 and I'm there on time and I know where it is.

1180
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,000
 And so what happens is I get directions.

1181
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
 And when I get directions, I follow them closely

1182
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
 and I say, okay, I need to exit here.

1183
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
 I need to turn here.

1184
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
 I need to go down this road and just stop at this light

1185
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
 and then it's gonna be three miles down here.

1186
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
 And if I don't know where I'm going,

1187
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
 I'm following these directions really closely

1188
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
 and I'm looking at them.

1189
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
 Now the directions don't tell me everything.

1190
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,000
 Like sometimes there's a car driving in front of me

1191
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
 really slow.

1192
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
 The directions don't tell me I need to pull over and pass it.

1193
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
 I've gotta use common sense.

1194
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
 I've gotta use wisdom.

1195
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
 Likewise, we covered a lot of dating ideas,

1196
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
 a lot of dating questions.

1197
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
 The scripture doesn't tell you everything.

1198
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
 It doesn't say, hey, where you should go on a date

1199
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
 or those sorts of things.

1200
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
 It doesn't answer all of your questions,

1201
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
 but it gives you a big picture framework, a map.

1202
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,000
 And your destination we defined in this series is marriage.

1203
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
 We date for marriage.

1204
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
 We date so that we can find someone

1205
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
 to spend the rest of our life with

1206
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
 and do ministry with, serve God with,

1207
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
 raise children with.

1208
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
 And so that's the destination.

1209
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
 And so you follow the framework

1210
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
 that is outlined in the scriptures.

1211
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,000
 And so that was the first location that I went to.

1212
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
 I was really following the directions

1213
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
 and then I had the second speaking engagement

1214
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
 yesterday night and I didn't know how to get there.

1215
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
 And so I called the guy and said,

1216
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
 hey, can you just tell me how to get there?

1217
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
 I know this sounds silly.

1218
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
 I'm just really bad at directions.

1219
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,000
 And he goes, hey bro, just follow me.

1220
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,000
 And that's what I wanna tell you

1221
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,000
 is in dating, if you're following Christ,

1222
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
 see when you follow someone,

1223
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
 you're no longer thinking about the play by play.

1224
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
 Do I turn here?

1225
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
 Do I go here?

1226
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
 Do I do this?

1227
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
 Do I do that?

1228
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
 You're just saying, hey, at every turn,

1229
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
 hey, where is he?

1230
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
 Where is God?

1231
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,000
 How do I, I wanna keep my eyes on him

1232
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
 and I wanna go the direction that he's leading.

1233
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
 And so I'm watching Christ constantly

1234
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
 and you're asking all of those questions

1235
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
 could be answered with another question.

1236
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
 What would honor God the most?

1237
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
 God, what would honor you the most?

1238
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
 Should I stay in a hotel room with my significant other?

1239
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
 God, what would honor you the most?

1240
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
 How far is too far?

1241
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
 God, what would honor you the most?

1242
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
 Can I date someone who's divorced?

1243
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
 God, what would honor you the most?

1244
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
 Let me dive into the scriptures

1245
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
 and seek to understand for myself.

1246
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
 You guys live in the information age.

1247
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,000
 You've never had more resources than this.

1248
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
 And you know, so I got to that place.

1249
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
 We were gonna meet at a restaurant

1250
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,000
 and I was gonna follow him to the location.

1251
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
 And he said, you know what, bro,

1252
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
 just jump in with me, I'll drive.

1253
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,000
 I'll drive, I'll take you there.

1254
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:50,000
 And that's what I really hope happens tonight.

1255
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
 That there's a surrendering in your soul.

1256
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
 That you look at your dating relationships

1257
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
 and you say, you know what,

1258
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
 if the end goal is marriage,

1259
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,000
 I may not be great at this.

1260
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
 I may be doing something wrong.

1261
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
 I'm not saying you are emphatically.

1262
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
 I'm saying it's a possibility.

1263
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
 I may be doing something wrong.

1264
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,000
 You say, hey, God, you drive.

1265
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,000
 You're the God, the creator of the heavens and the earth.

1266
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
 If I'm gonna spend the rest of my life with someone,

1267
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
 you see them right now in your mind's eye.

1268
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:19,000
 You invented them, you made them,

1269
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
 you know their family.

1270
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
 You know everything about them.

1271
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
 God, would you make my path straight?

1272
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
 Would you drive?

1273
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
 Would you help me to trust you

1274
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,000
 in every way that I possibly can?

1275
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
 Guys, you were made to be

1276
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
 in a right relationship with Christ.

1277
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
 Two sinners are incompatible.

1278
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
 The only compatible relationship

1279
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
 that you're gonna have is you and Jesus.

1280
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
 That's it, period.

1281
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
 That's the biggest thing in your life.

1282
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
 It's not something that you just add to your life.

1283
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,000
 It's the biggest thing in your life.

1284
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
 So let me pray right now

1285
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
 it'd be the biggest thing in your life.

1286
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
 Father, thank you just for a fun night

1287
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
 to get to hang out with one of my closest friends

1288
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
 and talk through scriptures

1289
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
 with a couple thousand other friends

1290
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:04,000
 and laugh and dive into ancient truths

1291
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,000
 that still apply to our lives today.

1292
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,000
 Father, would you direct our hearts right now?

1293
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
 Would you convict us where we're missing it

1294
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:16,000
 and stir our affections towards what is right and true?

1295
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
 And Father, as we trust in you with all our hearts,

1296
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
 as we lean not on our own understanding

1297
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
 but in everything that we do,

1298
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
 look your direction,

1299
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,000
 knowing, being completely and soberly aware

1300
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
 that you're God,

1301
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,000
 would you make our paths straight?

1302
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,000
 Father, would you direct us?

1303
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,000
 So God, we pray that you would take over our lives,

1304
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,000
 that you would jump in the driver's seat,

1305
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,000
 that we would forfeit the will,

1306
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,000
 not just our will, but the will,

1307
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,000
 that you would direct us, God.

1308
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
 Give us holy relationships.

1309
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:54,000
 Father, I pray that marriages would be produced

1310
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
 in this place tonight.

1311
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
 Truly, I really do.

1312
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
 That people that desire to be married

1313
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:02,000
 would find someone that would spend the rest of their life with them

1314
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
 pursuing you together,

1315
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
 that you would do that.

1316
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
 For my friends here tonight that feel forgotten,

1317
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,000
 Lord, would you let them know they're not forgotten,

1318
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,000
 that their hope would be firmly in you,

1319
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,000
 that you love them, that you have plans for them,

1320
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,000
 that they would not just sit waiting for their desires

1321
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
 to come be fulfilled,

1322
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:26,000
 that they would actively fulfill your desires for them.

1323
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,000
 In Jesus' name, amen.

1324
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:35,000
 JP is my favorite person to listen to on the topic of dating,

1325
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,000
 and it's because he's someone who has said,

1326
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,000
 "I surrender, Lord. There's nothing I want more.

1327
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,000
 I want to know you, and I'm offering my life to you."

1328
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,000
 JP would be the first to admit, "I did not do it perfectly right."

1329
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:51,000
 And I would be the first to admit, "I did not do it perfectly right."

1330
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:54,000
 But both of us have found that dating, though it is hard,

1331
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,000
 does not have to be as hard as the world around us wants to make it.

1332
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
 And so if you're in a relationship right now,

1333
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
 walking through just pain,

1334
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
 or you're coming out of a relationship

1335
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:07,000
 that didn't end the way you saw it ending,

1336
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
 and it hurts,

1337
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:13,000
 and there's no--you can't get around it, it just--it sucks,

1338
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
 we'd love to talk to you.

1339
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,000
 We'd love to pray with you. We'd love to come alongside of you.

1340
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
 We'd love to share and just talk with you.

1341
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
 If you've never had the moment where you said,

1342
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,000
 "Lord, I surrender all. I want to put aside every kingdom that I have,

1343
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,000
 and I want to just place that inside of your hands,"

1344
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
 we'd love to talk to you.

1345
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
 We'll have an entire team down front to pray with,

1346
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
 to just speak with.

1347
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
 Can we thank JP?

1348
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,000
 He spoke on Sunday and last night at Vertical,

1349
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,000
 and I was like, "Dude, we're going to do this. It's going to be awesome."

1350
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
 And he agreed to do it, and he's such a hero.

1351
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
 It's so fun to get to do ministry with friends

1352
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,000
 and people that love Jesus and who you love.

1353
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:52,000
 And so I personally--the question about finding the one,

1354
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
 I don't know that I would be married right now to my wife

1355
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
 if we didn't walk through that.

1356
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:01,000
 And JP, who did our wedding, also walked through that conversation and question with us.

1357
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:06,000
 So if there's any of those questions we can follow up with, serve you, speak more into,

1358
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,000
 we'll have an entire team down here, and we'll have porch late night.

1359
