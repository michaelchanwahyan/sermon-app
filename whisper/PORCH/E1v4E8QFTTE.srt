1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:24,220
 All right, how we doing, Parch?

3
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:25,560
 (audience cheering)

4
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:26,840
 Yeah.

5
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,720
 Last week of the Insta-Theology series

6
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:30,680
 that we're in the middle of,

7
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,160
 and let me just tell you, man,

8
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,600
 the internet, it's not reliable.

9
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,120
 You just can't trust it, as is evidenced by the fact

10
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,960
 that we're joining all our Ports locations

11
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,360
 a little late tonight, so we apologize.

12
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,340
 There's been some technical stuff.

13
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,760
 That's why we did a little more worship here

14
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,640
 in the Dallas area and kind of drug ourselves

15
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,800
 through the announcements, and JD, if you weren't here,

16
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,340
 all these other locations gave himself a dating shout-out,

17
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,920
 which was totally out of bounds, but he did it anyway.

18
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,880
 (audience laughing)

19
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,400
 So, but anyway, man, it's great to finally be hooked up

20
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,120
 with you guys and all the other campuses,

21
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,640
 and we're gonna talk about how to hook you up

22
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,160
 with some truth tonight.

23
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,000
 That's what we're doing.

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,680
 We love that we're diving in together.

25
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,840
 We've been talking about Insta-Theology,

26
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,320
 these little phrases, these slogans that are thrown at us

27
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,520
 that can inform us in so many ways,

28
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,200
 and tonight, we're gonna be talking about the phrase

29
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,600
 kind of follow your dreams, right?

30
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,840
 Follow your heart, follow your passions.

31
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,000
 You gotta go for it, right?

32
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,920
 Live your life.

33
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,920
 You do you.

34
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,880
 There's a thousand ways to say it,

35
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,320
 but what we're gonna talk about tonight

36
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,560
 is this is a really wisdom in there.

37
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,760
 Should we follow our heart?

38
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,120
 Should we follow our genes?

39
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:35,200
 Should we trace what seems right to us?

40
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,040
 Well, let me just start with just a few of these little

41
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:38,960
 posts that are out there.

42
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,320
 You've seen 'em, right?

43
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,120
 But here's a few that you're gonna run into

44
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,120
 when you go along the way, man.

45
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,560
 Follow your dreams, right?

46
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,240
 And the universe will open for you

47
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,360
 where there previously were only walls.

48
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,220
 Man, you gotta read that, and you're like, yes.

49
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:54,240
 That's what I'm saying right there.

50
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,640
 I'm down with that, okay?

51
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,000
 Or how about this one, follow your dreams.

52
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 They know the way.

53
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,040
 That makes sense, right?

54
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:03,880
 How about this?

55
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,680
 Hey, sometimes, sometimes life is about

56
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:11,680
 risking everything for a dream no one can see but you.

57
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,080
 Right, man, you're sitting there,

58
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,000
 you're scrolling through your phone,

59
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,160
 you're like, yes, yes, I believe that.

60
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,240
 I'm down with that.

61
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:20,480
 The biggest, this is Oprah, Oprah's gonna chime in,

62
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,920
 the biggest adventure you can take

63
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,440
 is to live the life of your dreams.

64
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,240
 Oprah is on Instagram, okay?

65
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,720
 And so she apparently saw this other post

66
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,560
 and she's laying it on you.

67
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,520
 It's Oprah now, so it's not just some random post out there.

68
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,080
 That's Oprah.

69
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,080
 Walt Disney, if you can dream it, you can do it.

70
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,880
 Tinkerbell, come on, you can do it.

71
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,760
 Just flap those little fairy wings

72
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,920
 and we're gonna go somewhere.

73
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,560
 How about this one, Barbara Shurer, she says,

74
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,480
 as soon as you begin to pursue a dream,

75
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,780
 your life wakes up and everything has meaning.

76
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,320
 I mean, that's just like, yes.

77
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,080
 Say that to me again, give it to me.

78
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,120
 Steve Jobs, okay, that's coming to the practical,

79
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,000
 coming to reality.

80
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,680
 Have the courage to follow your heart.

81
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,000
 Steve Jobs famously, in a way that impacted a generation

82
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,800
 when he was at Stanford, kind of gave a message

83
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,640
 and he just talked about, I mean,

84
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,400
 you find a job that you love

85
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,560
 and he didn't finish it with a phrase,

86
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,880
 you'll never work a day in your life,

87
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,800
 but that's what he was implying right there.

88
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,240
 He just told them, have the courage

89
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,000
 to follow your heart and intuition.

90
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 Then somehow know, they, you know,

91
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,280
 your dreams, your intuition, somehow it knows,

92
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,600
 he says, what you truly want to become.

93
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:28,120
 I don't know, is that true?

94
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,000
 How about this one?

95
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,080
 You know, this guy follows dreams.

96
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,200
 Yesterday I really wanted tacos,

97
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,040
 and now I'm eating tacos.

98
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,360
 Follow your dreams.

99
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,280
 Oh, now that one, okay, that one I'm gonna endorse

100
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,480
 right there, okay?

101
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:43,480
 Dream about tacos and have yourself a taco.

102
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,160
 That one will work.

103
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,440
 Everything else, though, might need a little help.

104
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,660
 Listen, some of those ideas, you know,

105
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:50,960
 they are a bit inspiring.

106
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,120
 They might get you, you know, wondering a little bit

107
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,680
 to where you get out of your just kind of

108
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,960
 little work-a-day world or just kind of believe

109
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,840
 that all I can be is all anybody's ever told me.

110
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,360
 And what I want to share with you tonight

111
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,120
 is you don't need insta-theology.

112
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,720
 I mean, you need real theology.

113
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,080
 There's a real God, and he's really there,

114
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,920
 and he really loves you, and he's not looking

115
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,320
 to rip you off.

116
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,580
 He is looking to set you free.

117
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,120
 This God loves you so much that he came to rescue you

118
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,680
 from a way that seems right to you,

119
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,640
 but in the end, it leads to death.

120
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,280
 Those are his words, not mine.

121
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:25,440
 He wants to rescue you from having to learn

122
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,280
 through experiencing, from having to kind of

123
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,440
 make your way through the dark.

124
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,840
 Plato, I mean, this is not new to your generation.

125
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,560
 This has been going on for a long time.

126
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,160
 Plato, okay, the great philosopher, he said,

127
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,200
 "Listen, man, until we hear a still more sure word

128
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,080
 "from God," this is what philosophers,

129
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,240
 philosopher, philo means love, you know, Sophia, wisdom,

130
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,160
 lovers of wisdom, that's where the word philosophy

131
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,120
 comes from, lovers of wisdom have always said

132
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,440
 what Plato said, "Until we hear a sure more word

133
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,760
 "from God, we're gonna be like two barks,"

134
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,640
 is the word he used, but it's the word that means ships,

135
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,200
 "We're gonna be like two ships, you know, making its way

136
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:02,120
 "through an ocean at night in the middle of a storm."

137
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,800
 What's Shakespeare, what's Plato saying there?

138
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,000
 Plato's saying, look, if you're a ship on the ocean

139
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,300
 at night in a storm, I mean, there's nothing to guide you.

140
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,320
 There's no truth anchored in the heavens, right?

141
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,720
 Because if you're on the ocean at night and you're in a ship,

142
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:23,440
 and you're gonna look up at the stars, okay?

143
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,760
 And not the planets, planets, the word planet

144
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,740
 comes from the word that literally means wanderer.

145
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:32,640
 Don't fix your future course on what wanders, what moves,

146
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,440
 but fix your future on what is anchored and true.

147
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:40,200
 And you follow what's up there, but if it's a storm

148
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:44,360
 at night and it's dark, Plato ends his quote by saying,

149
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,000
 "All we can do is trust in the best opinions of men."

150
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,800
 And he goes, that's trouble.

151
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,520
 Every philosopher, lovers of wisdom, would love

152
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,280
 a more sure word from God.

153
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,560
 You don't need instant theology

154
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,320
 when you can get real theology.

155
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,680
 When you can get literally God's word,

156
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,860
 that's what that means, theos, God, logos, word,

157
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,000
 the word of God.

158
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,500
 And so what we're trying to do is just lovingly share

159
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,320
 with you so you don't have to kind of pick your way

160
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,240
 through life.

161
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,320
 I've got lots of folks, you know, now that are kind

162
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,600
 of my generation and we're a lifetime and a half ahead

163
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,240
 of you, most of the folks that are dropping in on this.

164
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,600
 And I can now tell you with a little bit more experience

165
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:35,160
 that insta-theology, we didn't have Instagram,

166
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,800
 we didn't have any even social media, it wasn't around,

167
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,960
 but man, there were slogans that they fed us

168
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,760
 and that many of us formed our life on.

169
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,820
 I've got lots of buddies that have succeeded

170
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:51,340
 in following their dreams or attaining success

171
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:54,180
 and doing things at the highest pinnacles of life.

172
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:57,580
 I used to walk the class with Brad Pitt, all right?

173
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,900
 He and I went to college together.

174
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:02,300
 We lived next to each other and I can remember, you know,

175
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,460
 Brad kind of making his way.

176
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:06,660
 Cheryl Crowe and I hung out in college and we were friends.

177
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,580
 We were at a concert together on a date

178
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:11,100
 and I was sitting there, she looked at me,

179
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,820
 she just elbowed me, she goes, "Man, I'm gonna do that.

180
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,500
 "I'm gonna do that one day."

181
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,340
 And she did.

182
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:18,940
 But she did a lot of other things

183
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:21,620
 because following the dreams and Cheryl was gifted

184
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:25,340
 and Brad had talent, even then, I can just tell you,

185
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:27,620
 I've watched a lot of their journey through life

186
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:30,340
 and getting the success of their dreams and their visions,

187
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:33,500
 it doesn't always work out in the way

188
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,540
 that you think it will.

189
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:38,460
 I mean, this is my friend Brad, this is what he says to you.

190
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:39,280
 Listen to him.

191
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,300
 He says in an interview with Rolling Stone,

192
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,460
 "Man, I know all these things are supposed

193
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:47,140
 "to seem important, car, the condo, our version of success,

194
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:50,480
 "but if that's the case, why is the general feeling

195
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:55,160
 "out there reflecting more impotence and isolation

196
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,220
 "and desperation and loneliness?

197
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:00,700
 "If you ask me, I say toss it all.

198
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,540
 "We gotta find something else.

199
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,380
 "Because all I know is at this point in time,

200
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:07,020
 "we're heading for a dead end, a numbing of the soul,

201
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,480
 "a complete atrophy of the spiritual being

202
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,660
 "and I don't want that," he says.

203
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,700
 So the Rolling Stone Magazine interviewer said this,

204
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,840
 "So man, if we're heading toward this kind of existential,

205
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,460
 "dead-ended society, if the follow our dreams

206
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:22,980
 "and follow your heart's desires isn't the thing,

207
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,140
 "then what's the thing?"

208
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:24,980
 They ask him.

209
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,280
 What do you think should happen?

210
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,180
 This is Brad Pitt.

211
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,300
 Listen, you need to know something.

212
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,380
 Brad danced with spiritual truths.

213
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:38,240
 He was around theology, but it never became his theology.

214
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:44,060
 But watch what happens when you don't learn

215
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:46,060
 by humbling yourself.

216
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:48,620
 You're gonna learn by being humbled.

217
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:52,620
 And so here's my humble friend.

218
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,380
 He says, "Hey man, I don't know.

219
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,340
 "I don't know."

220
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:01,920
 But the emphasis now is so much on success and personal gain,

221
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,580
 I'm sitting in it.

222
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:06,380
 I'm telling you, it's just not it.

223
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,660
 I'm the guy who's got everything.

224
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:10,640
 I know, but I'm telling you, once you've got everything,

225
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,420
 then really all you've got left is yourself.

226
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,380
 I've said it before and I'll say it again.

227
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:18,040
 It doesn't help you sleep any better.

228
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,380
 And you don't wake up any better because of it.

229
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:23,940
 It's just a humble truth right there.

230
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:28,860
 Michael Jordan, who's also of my generation,

231
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:32,200
 Michael Jordan was told at one time by GQ Magazine

232
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,600
 that when all the guys who subscribed to that magazine,

233
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,620
 when it was at the zenith of its being a big deal,

234
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,500
 they were asked the question,

235
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,500
 "If you could be anybody for a year, who would it be?"

236
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,540
 And all the guys that subscribed to that magazine

237
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,500
 put all their answers in, they compiled them all up,

238
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,740
 and the answer was Michael Jordan.

239
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:48,860
 I wanna be Michael Jordan.

240
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,060
 And they went to Michael Jordan, they go,

241
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:50,900
 "Hey bro, what do you think?

242
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,740
 "What's that like to be the guy that if guys

243
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,740
 "could be any guy they wanted to be for a year,

244
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:59,740
 "that they could be me, be you?"

245
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:03,180
 And Jordan said, "Well, that doesn't surprise me."

246
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,480
 He goes, "But make them be me for five years."

247
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,380
 And you know, after a while, they're gonna find out

248
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,720
 that all the restaurants, all the doors opening,

249
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,820
 all the women opening to you, all the things you want,

250
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:15,940
 it just doesn't satisfy.

251
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,860
 Make them be me for longer.

252
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:20,100
 Let's see what they want.

253
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,340
 You see, here's the thing.

254
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:24,580
 You're going to be you your entire life.

255
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:26,300
 And so what you gotta figure out is,

256
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:29,020
 is there something I can follow that's a blessing to me?

257
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:31,540
 Let me just let you read from one of your own generation

258
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:36,540
 who experienced a whole lot of success early on in life.

259
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,580
 My man, Justin Bieber, right?

260
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:42,140
 You've heard Justin, did you see his Insta post recently?

261
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,920
 All right, just watch this.

262
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,460
 I mean, it's a little long, but I want you to hear

263
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,380
 from the philosophers of your day.

264
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:53,520
 Said it's hard to get out of bed in the morning

265
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,180
 with the right attitude when you're overwhelmed

266
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,000
 with your life.

267
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,840
 You ever felt like that?

268
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,700
 This is Justin Bieber.

269
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,980
 How's he overwhelmed with his life?

270
00:10:58,980 --> 00:10:59,820
 Well, listen.

271
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:03,460
 Man, your past, your job, your responsibilities,

272
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:06,620
 your emotions, your family, your finances and relationships,

273
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:08,140
 when it feels like there's trouble after trouble

274
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:10,580
 after trouble, you start foreseeing the day

275
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:12,380
 through a lens of dread.

276
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,220
 Wow.

277
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:18,700
 And sometimes, just all you can do is anticipate

278
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:21,580
 another bad day, a cycle of feeling disappointment

279
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,420
 after disappointment.

280
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,340
 Sometimes it can get you to the point

281
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,540
 where you can't even want to live anymore.

282
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:26,980
 Can you believe that?

283
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:30,860
 That life, where you feel like it's never going to change.

284
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:34,500
 He says, well, I can fully sympathize with you.

285
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,860
 I could not change my mindset.

286
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:36,700
 I was stuck.

287
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,780
 I was following my dreams.

288
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,420
 I was actually living your dream.

289
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:42,420
 I got sucked up, he's gonna go on to tell you,

290
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:45,180
 in a vortex of the world exploiting me,

291
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,880
 and I was living what you guys thought was your dream.

292
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,940
 He goes, but I'm fortunate now to have people in my life

293
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,820
 that continue to encourage me to keep me going.

294
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,720
 You see, I got money, I got clothes, I got cars,

295
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,740
 I got accolades, I got achievements, I got awards,

296
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:59,860
 and I was still, listen to this, 30 years before Brad,

297
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:02,940
 in the same interview, I still didn't have it.

298
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:05,240
 'Cause I had this insta thing that was promising me

299
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,620
 something that doesn't give you anything.

300
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,420
 Have you noticed the statistics of child stars

301
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,460
 and the outcome of their life?

302
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,940
 There's an insane pressure and responsibility

303
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,660
 put on the child's brain, emotions,

304
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,700
 and frontal lobes, decision-making abilities

305
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,620
 aren't developed yet.

306
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,860
 No rationality, they're defiant, they're rebellious,

307
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,900
 things all of us have got to go through to learn,

308
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,180
 but when you add the pressure of stardom,

309
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:24,020
 it does something to you that is quite unexplainable.

310
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:26,300
 Listen, you see, I didn't grow up in a stable home.

311
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:29,400
 My parents were separated when I was young,

312
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,260
 with no money, still young and rebellious as well.

313
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,100
 Because why?

314
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:37,100
 Because my dad's passion wasn't to stay committed to my mom.

315
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:41,400
 He followed his heart right away from being my dad.

316
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,800
 And there was a vulnerability, a wound there.

317
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,300
 As my talent progressed, he said,

318
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,440
 I became ultra-successful.

319
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,200
 It happened within a strand of two years.

320
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,240
 My whole world was flipped on its head.

321
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,080
 I went from a 13-year-old boy from a small town

322
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,720
 to being praised left and right by the world

323
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,320
 with millions saying how much they loved me

324
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,420
 and how great I was.

325
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:58,640
 Isn't that your dream?

326
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,040
 I don't know about you, but humility comes with age, man.

327
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:01,880
 It sure does.

328
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,320
 You do these things enough as a young boy

329
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,360
 and you actually start believing it.

330
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,800
 Rationality comes with age

331
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,640
 and so does your decision-making process.

332
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,120
 One of the reasons you can't drink until you're 21.

333
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,280
 Just in search right there.

334
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,560
 Everyone did everything for me,

335
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,320
 so I never learned the fundamentals of responsibility.

336
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:18,120
 So by this point, I was 18 with no skills in the real world,

337
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,680
 with millions of dollars and access to whatever I wanted.

338
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,800
 And this can be very scary.

339
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,000
 You're like, wait a minute, that's my dream.

340
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,520
 And what he's gone through to say

341
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,800
 is don't make it your dream.

342
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,840
 I'm just gonna fast forward.

343
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,780
 You can go back and find it.

344
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:34,560
 I think this was around Labor Day he posted this

345
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,560
 to 119 million followers.

346
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,200
 And I hope they followed him

347
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,920
 because here's what he says in the last paragraph.

348
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,200
 He said, "I started doing pretty heavy drugs at 19

349
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,560
 "and abused all of my relationships.

350
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,600
 "I became resentful, disrespectful to women and angry.

351
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,240
 "I became distant to everyone who loved me.

352
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,520
 "I was hiding behind a shell of a person that I'd become.

353
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,060
 "I felt like I could never turn it around.

354
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:53,520
 "It's taken me years to bounce back

355
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,680
 "from all these terrible decisions,

356
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,240
 "fixed, broken relationships, changed relational habits.

357
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,480
 "And luckily, man, God blessed me

358
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,840
 "with extraordinarily kind people who love me for me.

359
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,900
 "And now I'm navigating the best season of my life.

360
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,380
 "It's marriage, which is an amazing,

361
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,140
 "crazy new responsibility, but watch this.

362
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:08,980
 "It ain't easy.

363
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:11,060
 "It takes patience and trust and commitment

364
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:13,240
 "and kindness and humility

365
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:17,340
 "and all the things it looks like to be a good man."

366
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:18,540
 Watch.

367
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,940
 All this to say, keep fighting.

368
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,620
 Jesus loves you.

369
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:26,620
 Now, isn't that amazing?

370
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:30,820
 Isn't that amazing that one of your contemporaries

371
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:35,820
 who frankly isn't chasing a dream, he has lived the dream.

372
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,780
 I'm just living the dream.

373
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:41,100
 He's saying, "Listen, man, you gotta wake up

374
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,240
 "'cause the dreams that we're chasing

375
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,040
 "sometimes turn into nightmares.

376
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,540
 "Some of you guys are experiencing that

377
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:48,700
 "and you wish you could just wake up and get out of it,

378
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:51,300
 "but you're stuck in the same way that Justin was stuck

379
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,160
 "and there's just something there

380
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,500
 "that's not working out for you."

381
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,100
 And I gotta tell you, I know why.

382
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:58,380
 It's because there's an insta-theology out there

383
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:02,780
 that doesn't work, that you've just been sucked into.

384
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:03,620
 I'm gonna tell you another.

385
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,540
 Here's some real theology, okay?

386
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,660
 This is some theology.

387
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,400
 This is God who loves you.

388
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,860
 This is the one that Justin said,

389
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,980
 "Listen, man, don't chase what I chased."

390
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:15,180
 It doesn't mean don't use your talent.

391
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,080
 It doesn't mean don't believe

392
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,060
 that maybe you can go out there and get a break.

393
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:22,620
 He's just saying, "Don't count on that break making you."

394
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:25,960
 (congregation laughing)

395
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,420
 Because stardom doesn't make you.

396
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:31,100
 God makes you and God loves you and he's good.

397
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,320
 And the reason your life is as hurting as his was

398
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,300
 with all that success is because it doesn't matter

399
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,780
 if you have success or no success.

400
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:38,940
 The question is, do you know God?

401
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:41,920
 Do you have good words from God that inform you?

402
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,620
 I got some good news for you, man.

403
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,780
 It's not like this is a mystery.

404
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:49,540
 You gotta climb, you know, go rent a yak and find a Sherpa

405
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,060
 and climb up some mountain

406
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,820
 and find some mysterious cave somewhere

407
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,140
 where you can sit down with a wise man

408
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,420
 who might give you a little bit of time.

409
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:57,100
 This is amazing.

410
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:01,260
 God is more anxious to reveal to you his heart

411
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,860
 than you'll ever be to seek him.

412
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:09,380
 He wants to give to you as a loving father

413
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:12,180
 what you need and what you can follow.

414
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,940
 You don't need a slogan, you need a savior

415
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:18,620
 because all of us are born into this rebellious little,

416
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:21,620
 I got this, I don't need you life.

417
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:27,140
 And when we see that there's a way that seems right to us

418
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:29,780
 that leads to death, we finally humble ourself and go,

419
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:32,580
 hey God, could you love me still?

420
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:37,060
 And his answer is yes.

421
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,260
 I've demonstrated my love for you

422
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:41,020
 and that while you were still a little rebellious,

423
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:45,380
 insta-spontaneous, self-absorbed, no-theology individual,

424
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:48,300
 I gave my life for you so you could see a word from God.

425
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,060
 This is who his word is, he's love.

426
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:52,420
 And he cares for you.

427
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:55,620
 And he's not gonna just dismiss your sin.

428
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,740
 And so he had to figure out a way to deal with that

429
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:01,060
 and he dealt with it by himself becoming sin for you

430
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:03,300
 that you could be reconciled to him

431
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,220
 and this is what he says.

432
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:06,380
 I want you to remember the words of Justin

433
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,820
 and the words of Brad and now listen to the words

434
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:13,780
 of a guy who knew God and the wisdom that comes from God.

435
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:15,500
 This is in Proverbs three.

436
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,420
 I'll just pick you up right there

437
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,620
 in the middle of the chapter and in verse 13,

438
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,540
 do you remember what they both said?

439
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:24,060
 It's despairing, it's depressing and I can't sleep well.

440
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,740
 It's just not the key.

441
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:28,580
 Watch this, how blessed is the man who finds wisdom.

442
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:34,100
 The man, the woman, the human that gains understanding

443
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:37,420
 for the profit of wisdom is better than the profit of silver

444
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:38,900
 and her gain better than fine gold.

445
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,340
 How amazing would it have been for Brad

446
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,860
 to use all of his acting talent

447
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:47,940
 and known this instead of thinking

448
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,980
 that maybe his acting talent and his good looks

449
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,780
 and his fame could have gotten him peace.

450
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:56,500
 See, he had the chance, okay?

451
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,940
 He wasn't around anything exactly like the porch

452
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:01,620
 but he was around this.

453
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:07,500
 But this never sunk in here and so he had to learn, man.

454
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,580
 He had to learn by climbing mountains

455
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:12,060
 and realizing that in the mountain,

456
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,540
 the air was thin and it chokes you,

457
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,740
 there's no life there.

458
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:18,860
 And I think if he was here, he'd tell you,

459
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:19,780
 why don't you learn, man,

460
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:22,020
 before you start climbing the wrong mountain.

461
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:26,860
 Watch this, long life is in her right hand

462
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:29,940
 and in her left hand are real riches and honor.

463
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:36,260
 Her ways are pleasant ways and her paths are peace.

464
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,940
 See, can I just ask you this?

465
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:41,100
 I mean, I can tell you by the grace of God about your age,

466
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,820
 I mean, I was all in with Jesus

467
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,060
 and so life wasn't easy.

468
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:47,100
 I didn't get married till I was 27.

469
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:50,380
 It wasn't like it was just all falling right in or 28.

470
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,740
 You know, but some of you guys are like,

471
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:52,820
 well, I'm 32, Todd.

472
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:53,940
 I'd say it doesn't matter.

473
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:56,460
 I can tell you that it can still be a pleasant way

474
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:59,140
 and peaceful way when you know the way

475
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:01,660
 you're supposed to live and who you're supposed to live with.

476
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:04,940
 I mean, Jesus is enough, he's sufficient.

477
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:08,220
 Watch this, wisdom that God gives is a tree of life

478
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,340
 to all those who take hold of her

479
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:11,180
 and happier all who hold fast.

480
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:13,300
 The Lord by wisdom founded the earth.

481
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,660
 By understanding, he established the heavens.

482
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,260
 By his knowledge, the deeps were broken up,

483
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,260
 the skies were due.

484
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:22,740
 Watch this, so my son, listen, don't let,

485
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:26,660
 don't let them vanish from your sight.

486
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,660
 Keep sound wisdom and discretion

487
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,340
 so there'll be life to your soul

488
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,780
 and adornment to your neck.

489
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:34,020
 It's just, it's the most beautiful thing

490
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:36,780
 that somebody could wear, which is to live life

491
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,360
 the way God wants you to live life.

492
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,700
 It's beautiful, it makes you beautiful.

493
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,200
 And you'll walk securely.

494
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,380
 Watch this, your foot won't stumble.

495
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:45,620
 Do you remember what Brad said?

496
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:47,220
 Remember what Justin said?

497
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:51,480
 When you lie down, you won't be afraid.

498
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:55,820
 And when you lie down, your sleep will be sweet.

499
00:19:55,820 --> 00:20:01,060
 Don't be afraid of sudden fear and of the onslaught

500
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,380
 of the wicked when it comes, no.

501
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,220
 For the Lord will be your confidence

502
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:06,740
 and will keep your foot from being caught.

503
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:09,880
 I mean, that's some theology for you.

504
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,360
 I'm just gonna tell you that that isn't just words

505
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,360
 from a guy who had also kind of done

506
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:17,560
 what Brad and Justin had done later in his life.

507
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,620
 And he came back to saying, I just wish I would have,

508
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:22,100
 I wrote those words and I deviated from 'em.

509
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:25,000
 I was around this truth and I didn't walk in those ways.

510
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,280
 And so the guy who wrote that wrote another book

511
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,160
 called Ecclesiastes where he lived the life of our dreams.

512
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:34,640
 He was a hedonist, he was wealthy, he was a womanizer.

513
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,740
 I mean, he had power, he had it all.

514
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,900
 And he said, vanity, it's all vanity.

515
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,060
 There's no life there.

516
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,320
 And he came back and he said,

517
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:44,220
 this is the secret of wisdom in your youth.

518
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:49,620
 Learn to fear God.

519
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,860
 That doesn't mean like be scared of God.

520
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:56,140
 Learn to know how good God is that it would just horrify you

521
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:58,820
 that you wouldn't let him inform your 20s.

522
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:03,740
 Because he makes 20s beautiful.

523
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:07,800
 And 30s beautiful, and 40s beautiful, and 50s beautiful.

524
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:12,900
 That's who our God is.

525
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:13,940
 Let me just give you one more thing

526
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,940
 and I'm gonna give you some real practical stuff tonight too.

527
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:19,560
 And I was thinking about this as a guy

528
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,780
 who is part of Gen Y.

529
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,020
 So just a reminder, Gen Y are anybody that's born

530
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,860
 between 1980 and 1994.

531
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:27,500
 That's most of the folks that are tracking with me right now

532
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,340
 and listening.

533
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:30,420
 This guy is a computer science prof

534
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:31,820
 at Georgetown University.

535
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:35,340
 And he was just watching how a bunch of your contemporaries

536
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,900
 and your peers were struggling at work.

537
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:41,420
 Because we think that, man, I'm supposed to chase my dreams

538
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:43,220
 and live my passion and find what I love.

539
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:47,020
 If I don't love my work in year one or month one,

540
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,780
 then this must not be where I'm supposed to work.

541
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:52,000
 And we're jettisoning careers and we're not satisfied

542
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,200
 because we thought work would make us happy.

543
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:58,780
 And work is good, work doesn't make you happy.

544
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:02,500
 Can I tell you something else?

545
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,960
 I mean, happy is good, but happy doesn't make you happy.

546
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:13,620
 Happy is what you experience

547
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:16,020
 when it's generally going well with you.

548
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:19,180
 And what I wanna offer you is not insta-happy,

549
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:21,180
 I wanna offer you blessedness.

550
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:23,240
 That word blessedness is the word be happy.

551
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,180
 It's a deep and abiding happy.

552
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:28,480
 But here's the thing, the world is lying to you

553
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,500
 and it's giving you a false theology.

554
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:34,940
 And it's not your fault because your society,

555
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:37,360
 your world, the one that my generation

556
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:41,060
 largely has offered to you is a world

557
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:46,700
 that has jettisoned the basic teachings of God who loves you

558
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:49,140
 which is called the Judeo-Christian ethic.

559
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:51,020
 Even people who don't know God

560
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:54,460
 but who do what God wants them to do generally do better.

561
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:58,060
 This is not health, wealth, and prosperity,

562
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:01,940
 but it is, it's going to be a better life.

563
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:06,940
 And part of that betterness is when trouble hits you,

564
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:09,860
 you're not haunted by the thought

565
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:11,700
 that I brought this on myself.

566
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,820
 You know, the very first week of the Insta series

567
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:17,020
 where we kind of talked about the good vibes,

568
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:20,220
 health, wealth, and prosperity, nonsense, and lie.

569
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:22,420
 I was up here, I went to teach at the porch that night,

570
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:24,220
 but I was walking back through and some of you grabbed me

571
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:26,780
 and they go, "Man, I just wish I could know

572
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:27,660
 "that it was gonna be okay."

573
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,900
 And I kind of like that offer of good vibes,

574
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,260
 health, wealth, and prosperity gospel

575
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:34,140
 because if I just live the way that they tell me to live,

576
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,160
 I wanna know it's gonna work out well for me.

577
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,200
 I go, "But listen, it's a lie.

578
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:42,420
 "It's a lie that if you give God 1,000,

579
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,660
 "he'll return it to 10,000.

580
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,360
 "It's a lie that if you have enough faith

581
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,960
 "that cancer will go away or that man will come

582
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,240
 "or that woman will say yes.

583
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,340
 "It's a lie, it doesn't always happen.

584
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,840
 "It's not a faith problem.

585
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,140
 "It's just part of being in a world

586
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:58,940
 "where sometimes things that you want to go a certain way

587
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:01,160
 "don't go the right way, but here's the peace.

588
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,380
 "You want promised peace?

589
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,680
 "Here's how you can get it.

590
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:07,860
 "You can order your life in humility before God

591
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:10,020
 "so in this world still wracked with trouble,

592
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:12,680
 "when trouble comes, you're not laying in bed

593
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,300
 "kicking yourself because you brought

594
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,960
 "the trouble on yourself.

595
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,300
 "In fact, God's even told you

596
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,180
 "that in him you'll have peace,

597
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,920
 "but in the world you'll have trouble.

598
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:25,060
 "The world will offer you fleeting moments of peace,

599
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:26,360
 "but then trouble's gonna come,

600
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,460
 "and if you don't have something to explain the trouble

601
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,500
 "that's here in this world,"

602
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,880
 and guess why there's trouble in the world?

603
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,200
 Because our world lives according to an insta-theology.

604
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,740
 Our world lives according to lies.

605
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:40,480
 And when you expect lies to deliver

606
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,520
 something truly wonderful, you're gonna be disappointed.

607
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:48,680
 And so God calls you to follow him and believe in him,

608
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:51,760
 and what gives you peace is that if you live your life well

609
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,720
 and things don't break out,

610
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,520
 you know that this life is not your home.

611
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:57,320
 You know that God's gonna reward those who are faithful.

612
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,800
 And worst case scenario,

613
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,440
 you're talking about a few decades

614
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,940
 that will have you standing before the one

615
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:05,920
 whose opinion matters and he's gonna look at you

616
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,820
 and goes, "Look, I know it was hard.

617
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,000
 "I know health didn't come your way.

618
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,600
 "I know you spent your life in a wheelchair.

619
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,820
 "I know you never were met with somebody

620
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:15,780
 "who told you they loved you and cherished and nourished you,

621
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:18,160
 "but you were satisfied in me,

622
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:21,000
 "and you showed others the sufficiency of who I am,

623
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,280
 "and welcome, my beloved."

624
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:27,120
 You might go, "Todd, I'm not interested in that."

625
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,320
 And I'm telling you, you ought to be,

626
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,040
 because there's all kinds of folks

627
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:33,600
 who have that ring in their left hand,

628
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,120
 who bought the lie that, man,

629
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:39,520
 if a great relationship is 100, right?

630
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,880
 And so I'm single, that's a zero.

631
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,360
 So even a bad marriage, a four,

632
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,320
 is four degrees better than where I'm at.

633
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,440
 Hey, that's a lie.

634
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,680
 Being single is not a zero.

635
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:54,120
 You need to realize that if you're gonna do that,

636
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,200
 what you gotta realize is that being single

637
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:59,640
 and sufficient with God is just zero, okay?

638
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,540
 A bad relationship is a negative 100,

639
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:04,840
 and you don't want that pain.

640
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:08,400
 But it's not a zero.

641
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,520
 He's enough.

642
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:13,000
 And what you want is to learn to walk with him

643
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,200
 and be satisfied in him, and you find somebody else

644
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,000
 who walks with him and is satisfied with him,

645
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,400
 and even though they're frail and they make mistakes,

646
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,640
 when they make mistakes, they own it

647
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,280
 and they repent of it, and together,

648
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,400
 you guys are working towards the 100,

649
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,120
 which is being home with Jesus,

650
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,880
 the only one that won't disappoint.

651
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:31,640
 You don't need to follow your passions,

652
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,120
 you need to follow Jesus.

653
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,400
 Here's what happened in your generation.

654
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,960
 You kind of bought the lie.

655
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,080
 There's a thing called Google's Ngram Viewer.

656
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,720
 I'm gonna show you a chart in just a minute.

657
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,000
 Google's Ngram Viewer, I don't even know this existed,

658
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,200
 but Google, which is just an amazing processor

659
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,880
 of information, it tracks words and phrases

660
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,520
 that make their way into literature,

661
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,600
 into print, into human discourse.

662
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,840
 And what I want you to see, remember,

663
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:01,040
 Gen Y was born in 1980, and then, you know,

664
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:04,160
 or through 1994, which means your formative years,

665
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:07,600
 okay, for most of you, were early 2000s,

666
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,200
 late '90s, early 2000s.

667
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,180
 Okay, so watch this.

668
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:15,180
 This is the Google Ngram Viewer for the phrase,

669
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,020
 follow your passion.

670
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:19,320
 Take a look at this.

671
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,280
 This phrase, throughout human history,

672
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,120
 was used at a very minuscule level.

673
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,440
 And then, along about 1994, all the way to 2008,

674
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:30,480
 follow your passion, we started saying that all the time

675
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,080
 to you.

676
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:33,900
 Why?

677
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:36,640
 Because your parents worked hard,

678
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,480
 and they had to get in the, you know, workaday world,

679
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,880
 and now they prospered, and they go,

680
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,920
 so now, we want you to live your dreams.

681
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,360
 You do you.

682
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:51,720
 And what you're finding is that doesn't work.

683
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,540
 Do you know this?

684
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:55,720
 For the first time since the Spanish influenza,

685
00:27:55,720 --> 00:28:00,020
 life expectancy in America has gone down

686
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:01,080
 three years in a row.

687
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:07,920
 We are the wealthiest and most prosperous country

688
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:11,480
 we have ever been, and life expectancy is decreasing.

689
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,320
 Do you know why?

690
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,960
 Because there has been a spike in deaths of despair.

691
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:22,040
 There's more suicides, there's more liver disease,

692
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,680
 which we know comes from alcohol abuse,

693
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:27,280
 and there's more deaths from opiate overdoses.

694
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:34,160
 In this successful, follow your passion-infused world,

695
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,120
 you don't need a slogan.

696
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,620
 You need a savior.

697
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:41,880
 Do you know why you need a savior?

698
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,280
 Here's why, Jeremiah chapter 17, verse five.

699
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,760
 This is what it says to you

700
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,280
 in that little section of Scripture.

701
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,240
 It says, "Thus says the Lord."

702
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:55,720
 Theos, God, the one who loves you,

703
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,960
 and he wants to set you free,

704
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,680
 and he's not looking to rip you off.

705
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,920
 This is what he says.

706
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,900
 "Cursed is the man who follows their dreams,

707
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:07,960
 "their passions, their heart."

708
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:10,160
 We say around here all the time,

709
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,600
 don't follow your heart, inform your heart.

710
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:16,000
 "Cursed is the man who trusts in mankind

711
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,480
 "and what seems right to men."

712
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:20,300
 The one who makes man and the best opinions of men

713
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,480
 his strength, whose heart turns away from the Lord.

714
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,400
 The people who don't lean on their own understanding

715
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,240
 and in all their ways acknowledge him,

716
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,840
 their paths aren't straight.

717
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:35,720
 It says, "For that person will be like,"

718
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,200
 and haven't this been so many of your experience?

719
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,320
 Some of you guys that haven't, by the kindness of God,

720
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,480
 learned his ways.

721
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:44,100
 "The person who trusts in mankind and follows their heart

722
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,180
 "and doesn't inform their heart with God's gracious word

723
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:47,840
 "will be like a bush in the desert

724
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:51,480
 "and will not see when prosperity comes.

725
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,680
 "Their sleep won't be sweet, there will be no rest,

726
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:57,480
 "but they'll live in a stony wasteland in the wilderness,

727
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,400
 "a land of salt without inhabitant."

728
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,440
 Oh, man.

729
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:05,120
 But verse seven, "Blessed is the man who trusts in the Lord

730
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,880
 "and whose trust is the Lord."

731
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,960
 You ever seen people like this?

732
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,520
 I mean, I mention her to you all the time

733
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,120
 because just as a guy who was an athlete

734
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:19,260
 and who delights in physical activity

735
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:21,360
 and competition and all that, I can remember,

736
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,460
 I thought the worst thing that would ever happen to me

737
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:26,040
 would be if I was in a wheelchair.

738
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:30,440
 And about the time I was in my teenage years,

739
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:33,360
 I bumped into a gal that had just pushed through her.

740
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,840
 She was a great athlete.

741
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,000
 Name's Johnny Erickson-Tata.

742
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 I just can't encourage you enough to sit at her feet.

743
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,240
 Johnny, through a freak accident in the ocean,

744
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,360
 severed her spinal cord, has been in a wheelchair now

745
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,760
 for over five decades.

746
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:51,080
 But she's not in a stony wasteland.

747
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,040
 It's not in a world filled with salt.

748
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:56,560
 I mean, she is a tree firmly planted by a tree of water

749
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,820
 that extends its root, as it says in verse eight,

750
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:01,560
 by a stream, and she doesn't fear when the heat comes.

751
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:04,160
 She's not wild about her wheelchair.

752
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,760
 She struggles with the same things you and I struggle with,

753
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,480
 but I'm telling you, man, that life is green

754
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,780
 and it is beautiful, and I look at her.

755
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:12,320
 She's not anxious about the things

756
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,400
 that we're all anxious about.

757
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,680
 There's no year of drought.

758
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,720
 There's no lack of fruit in her life,

759
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,580
 like we're promised in verse eight and nine,

760
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:22,760
 because Jesus says, listen, man, you need to know

761
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,560
 she's not following her passions and her dreams.

762
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,560
 She's not living her best life now.

763
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:30,520
 She is actually trusting in the only God who's ever lived,

764
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,480
 and because of that, because she's not following

765
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,280
 her deceitful heart, but she's trusting

766
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,300
 in a good and kind king.

767
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:41,940
 There's a beauty to her story.

768
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:45,800
 I can remember saying to God when I met Johnny,

769
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:49,460
 I just said, Lord, if you gotta put me in a wheelchair

770
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:51,040
 to teach me that you alone are sufficient,

771
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,920
 put me in a wheelchair, but oh, Lord, please.

772
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,520
 This is a prayer I would encourage you to pray,

773
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:57,440
 but oh, Lord, please, give me enough humility

774
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,640
 that I can learn it without having to go that direction.

775
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,080
 Let me live my life in such a way

776
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,160
 that if I end up in a wheelchair,

777
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,800
 I won't think this is the only way

778
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,300
 I could've learned that lesson.

779
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:09,760
 But God, if you're who you say you are,

780
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,460
 take me to the wilderness quickly.

781
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,300
 Give me pain quickly.

782
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:16,840
 Strip me from everything I would love

783
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:20,680
 other than you quickly so I can learn who you are.

784
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:24,840
 So here's the beautiful thing.

785
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:27,960
 What a humble person does is a humble person

786
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,660
 looks up in their strength, right?

787
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,640
 Don't be the kind of person that the first time

788
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,520
 you look up is when you're flat on your back

789
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,360
 because you've been run over

790
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,920
 by another illicit relationship,

791
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:40,120
 another moment of stupidity.

792
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:44,280
 But in your strength, while you're young,

793
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,560
 look to your God.

794
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:50,740
 This is what God does.

795
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:54,040
 He doesn't leave you out there waiting for a slogan.

796
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,780
 He comes in the form of a savior.

797
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:58,100
 I'll just give you a few things.

798
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:59,440
 I could go on a list.

799
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,440
 I, one time, I sat down with my kids

800
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,760
 and I just, every now and then,

801
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,740
 tried to give 'em just some simple things to do

802
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:11,440
 throughout their day that if they wanna follow Jesus

803
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,120
 and learn his ways, that these are some things

804
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,600
 that they can do, right?

805
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,320
 So if you will, these were just little, in effect,

806
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,080
 moments that I, as a loving father,

807
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,920
 who learned from my loving father,

808
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,800
 was trying to tell my young sons and daughters,

809
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,680
 look, this is some things that you can do.

810
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:31,580
 And when you follow Jesus and don't follow your heart,

811
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:33,960
 these are things that will be true of you.

812
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,800
 And this is the life.

813
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,000
 And so, one of the things,

814
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,960
 and I just kinda put 'em together in L, you know, in Ls.

815
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,840
 I just used Ls, like get the L out of you, right?

816
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:45,120
 So let's just learn truth

817
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:49,280
 by putting the right L in our life.

818
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:53,800
 The first thing I just told 'em is I just said, man, listen,

819
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:57,160
 the reward of humility and the fear of the Lord

820
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,400
 are true riches, not the riches that Brad Pitt

821
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:02,080
 would tell you don't satisfy, honor and life.

822
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,400
 And so just be a learner.

823
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:09,320
 Look, can I tell you how relevant this book is?

824
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:12,800
 2,000 years ago, a brother said this,

825
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,120
 have nothing to do with instant theology,

826
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:19,760
 with worldly fables, fit only for old women,

827
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:23,240
 the people who sit around and make Pinterest posts.

828
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:26,240
 It's in the Greek, believe me, just trust me, it was there.

829
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,640
 (congregation laughing)

830
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:31,000
 But on the other hand, then discipline yourself

831
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,600
 for the purpose of godliness.

832
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,280
 I mean, it's just the fact that discipline, guys,

833
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,920
 is the price of freedom.

834
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:43,600
 You have to go to work and discipline yourself.

835
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,600
 The precious possession of a man,

836
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,120
 the Scripture says, is diligence.

837
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:50,400
 And you gotta be diligent to learn at the foot of truth

838
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,360
 and the foot of someone wiser than you.

839
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,920
 My kids say this to me all the time, you know,

840
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:54,760
 I can remember it.

841
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,640
 I said the same thing when I was their age,

842
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,920
 like, this is stupid, I'll never use this stuff.

843
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,840
 Why are they making me read it?

844
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,560
 Right, you ever said that?

845
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:06,040
 Especially when you were in high school, right?

846
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,160
 And you just kinda, so we can look back together,

847
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,800
 'cause we're all beyond that.

848
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,360
 And we all said it.

849
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,200
 And you know what I said to them?

850
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,300
 I go, hey, listen to me, look.

851
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,320
 You know what you are gonna use?

852
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,680
 What you're gonna use is you're gonna learn

853
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,080
 that all of life isn't easy and life isn't about you.

854
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,800
 You're gonna learn to submit to authority.

855
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,600
 You're gonna learn to have an assignment

856
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,440
 and perform the assignment with excellence.

857
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,040
 You're gonna learn to discipline yourself

858
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,720
 to not just play Xbox all night

859
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:32,640
 and then cram and hope you get by.

860
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,200
 But no, you're gonna do the work you're supposed to do

861
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,920
 so you can show yourself as a trustworthy individual.

862
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:41,160
 And that learning to be faithful and disciplined

863
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,320
 and to work when you're supposed to work

864
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,800
 and to play when you're supposed to play,

865
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,280
 it's going to lead to prosperity later in your life.

866
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,000
 So you're absolutely correct.

867
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,360
 You may never, ever use this equation.

868
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,840
 You may never use this trivial fact

869
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,440
 they're trying to teach you about Texas history.

870
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,240
 But what you're gonna use

871
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,300
 is what you're forming in your life now,

872
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:03,520
 which is personal integrity and responsibility and diligence.

873
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,540
 That will set you on the course of greatness and peace.

874
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:10,000
 Discipline is the price of freedom.

875
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,120
 But let me just tell you something.

876
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:13,600
 Freedom is the reward of discipline.

877
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:16,840
 Right?

878
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,300
 You're free.

879
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,920
 You're not burned and shackled by addiction

880
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:24,160
 and depression and despair and regret.

881
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,820
 You're free from those things

882
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:28,100
 because you've lived your life with honor

883
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:29,440
 that your Father in heaven

884
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,280
 doesn't just tell you to suck it up and do it,

885
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,600
 but even enables you to do it

886
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,200
 when you humble yourself before him.

887
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,600
 So learn his ways, I told my kids.

888
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:39,520
 I would ask him, what have you done today

889
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,920
 to grow in wisdom and stature?

890
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,280
 Let me just ask you, what did you do today?

891
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,720
 Jesus grew in wisdom and stature

892
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,200
 and favor with God and man.

893
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:51,920
 What did you do today to grow a little bit more versed

894
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,000
 in true theology?

895
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:58,200
 I would ask him, what did you learn today about God?

896
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,800
 What one truth about God were you reminded of in his word

897
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,980
 or his purposes that you didn't know yesterday?

898
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:04,220
 Was there anything you did today?

899
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:05,800
 You might go, well, Todd, that's why I'm at the porch.

900
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,720
 Okay, so Tuesday's covered.

901
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,540
 I'm glad you're here.

902
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:10,720
 But what are you gonna do tomorrow?

903
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,260
 Not wait till next Tuesday.

904
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:15,200
 That's a bad program.

905
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:20,120
 Every day you wanna learn more of this God

906
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:22,640
 who has your best interests in mind.

907
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,720
 And then I always would tell him,

908
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:24,840
 what are you gonna do differently today

909
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,800
 because of what you learned?

910
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,520
 Okay, that's what I wanna ask you tonight.

911
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,120
 I mean, it's great that you're gonna learn some facts

912
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,920
 about God and some places you can go in Proverbs 3, 13,

913
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:35,920
 you know, down through roughly the end of the chapter,

914
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,960
 but if you're not gonna learn his ways

915
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,160
 and do something with it and say,

916
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:42,280
 I'm gonna seek God more than I am riches,

917
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,520
 then it doesn't really help you.

918
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,340
 What are you gonna do with this guy that you've heard?

919
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:47,760
 He's not trying to rip you off.

920
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,960
 He's trying to set you free.

921
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,760
 He's not trying to get you to do good work

922
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,080
 so you can turn in a resume.

923
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:54,320
 He's trying to show you that he's the good God

924
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:57,960
 that wants to provide for you the life you've wanted.

925
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:58,800
 What have you learned today?

926
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,520
 Secondly, how have you led?

927
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:05,320
 Right, I mean, I just would ask my kid,

928
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:08,620
 how is this world or others better today

929
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:09,880
 because you've stepped up?

930
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,320
 And if you follow Jesus, by the way,

931
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,680
 you're gonna be a learner.

932
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:16,040
 Jesus calls us to be his disciples.

933
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,520
 The word disciple literally means learner.

934
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:22,060
 And so don't follow your heart, follow Jesus.

935
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:24,120
 Jesus says this, follow me.

936
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:26,240
 It's one of his most off-spoken words.

937
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:29,260
 Follow me, be a disciple, learn my ways,

938
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:30,440
 and it will be pleasant to you.

939
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:34,280
 For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.

940
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,120
 Man, are you heavy?

941
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,100
 Are you burdened?

942
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:40,420
 I mean, are you burdened and lacking peace?

943
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:42,760
 It's probably because your program, your dreams,

944
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,680
 your heart, you're not informing it,

945
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,600
 you're following it and you're laying in bed,

946
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,880
 I'm about to be exposed, I might be pregnant.

947
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:52,600
 I might not get a date.

948
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:55,720
 I might not make enough money.

949
00:38:55,720 --> 00:39:01,080
 You know, you'll never have to say,

950
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,860
 God might not love me enough.

951
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:06,700
 Man, don't put that on him.

952
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:08,040
 Listen to what he's saying.

953
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:12,360
 Let somebody explain to you how much he really does love you.

954
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,560
 (sighs)

955
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,440
 So follow Jesus.

956
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:19,320
 When you follow Jesus, you're gonna be a leader of men.

957
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,960
 You're gonna be a leader of women.

958
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:25,160
 You're gonna learn that great leaders are great servants.

959
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:28,160
 And so I just ask my kid, man,

960
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,080
 have you been a servant today?

961
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,480
 When you showed up, how was evil restrained

962
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,620
 because you were there?

963
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:35,800
 Right, how was some girl not exploited

964
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,800
 'cause you were at that party

965
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,320
 when you started to drink so much

966
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,800
 and you saw the predators, you go, uh-uh, no,

967
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,220
 not on my watch, not this girl, not tonight.

968
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:50,980
 How was injustice conquered?

969
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:53,920
 How was love multiplied because you were there?

970
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,560
 How were captives rescued?

971
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,040
 How was joy increased?

972
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,300
 Let me ask you a question.

973
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:01,080
 Wouldn't it be awesome if when you were at the party,

974
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,540
 women go, I'm gonna be safe tonight.

975
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:06,120
 It's not a license for them to be foolish and drunk

976
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,240
 'cause you'll drive 'em home,

977
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:10,060
 but there's a guy here that isn't gonna look

978
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:11,080
 to exploit me.

979
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:16,600
 Wouldn't it be awesome if your friends

980
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,800
 who would just go, hey man, you know what?

981
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,880
 You make everything we do better.

982
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,640
 Not more riotous fun, maybe.

983
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:25,060
 But man, you know what?

984
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:26,520
 I never have regrets the morning

985
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,080
 after I'm hanging out with you.

986
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:34,080
 Proverbs 29, two says, when the righteous increase,

987
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:36,220
 the people rejoice.

988
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:38,180
 But when a wicked man rules, people groan.

989
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:39,580
 I've got a friend, Lee Strobel,

990
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:43,040
 who used to be the legal editor for the Chicago Tribune.

991
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,120
 He's written a bunch of books called

992
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:46,160
 The Case for Christ, The Case for Easter,

993
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,760
 The Case for Creation, and he's just a brilliant

994
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:51,480
 legal mind who was an atheist.

995
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:54,220
 And while he was working for the Chicago Tribune,

996
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:56,560
 he was an alcoholic, he was a rager.

997
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:59,940
 His wife actually had come to faith, but Lee hadn't yet.

998
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:02,400
 And he said, I used to come home and my little girl

999
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,760
 would be sitting there on the floor of the living room

1000
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,560
 when I would come home, and she'd be playing

1001
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,840
 with her toys, and he said, I'd come home,

1002
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:12,560
 and she'd look up and she'd go, hi, Daddy.

1003
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,760
 And she would always gather her toys

1004
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,280
 and get up and go in her room.

1005
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,960
 And he used to think that she was respectful

1006
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:21,720
 of my hard day of work, but no, she knew

1007
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:24,480
 that peace was no longer in the home when Dad walked in.

1008
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:29,840
 And he realized people didn't rejoice when he showed up.

1009
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:33,040
 It was like there's a predator here.

1010
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:36,040
 That's not what a daddy wants.

1011
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:38,920
 I can tell you by the kindness of God, I can remember.

1012
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:43,840
 There was a day that I had kind of let my kids,

1013
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:47,920
 like we try and regulate when they can just dive in

1014
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,680
 on certain stuff, the young mind is informed.

1015
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,200
 Justin Bieber endorses that.

1016
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:56,200
 And so we just don't let them, just kind of a carte blanche

1017
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,080
 on video games and things like that,

1018
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:00,680
 when they were younger, and Xbox stuff.

1019
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:02,560
 But one day we just said, man, you can go after it, right?

1020
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,400
 Just go play.

1021
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,680
 So they were playing for like an hour and a half,

1022
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:08,240
 and I got home because they had done well through a week

1023
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,560
 and they had performed well in discipline

1024
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:10,880
 so they had some freedom.

1025
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:14,680
 But I can remember, I got home and I walked in the door

1026
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:18,200
 and I can remember that I could hear them up there

1027
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,840
 playing Madden, and they were talking.

1028
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:22,120
 At the time, my youngest was nine.

1029
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,120
 And he was playing with his brothers,

1030
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,840
 and they were going, oh no, I can't believe it!

1031
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,160
 And the nine-year-old heard me.

1032
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,440
 He goes, time out, time out, time out, no, stop, stop, stop!

1033
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,160
 Time out, time out, time out!

1034
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,000
 And they go, what, what?

1035
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,480
 He goes, just time out, hit time out!

1036
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:35,480
 And then I heard his little feet

1037
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:38,880
 run across the upstairs room, come down the back steps,

1038
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:43,520
 open the door, and run to me and go, Daddy!

1039
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,440
 And give me a hug.

1040
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:47,160
 I said, I'm so glad you're home.

1041
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:52,080
 And I just looked at him and I realized he just left Madden.

1042
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:54,560
 (congregation laughing)

1043
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,000
 At an intense moment,

1044
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,060
 just because he was so glad I was home.

1045
00:42:58,060 --> 00:43:02,000
 And I thought about my friend Lee, and I just go, man,

1046
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,100
 that's what happens when you follow Jesus.

1047
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:06,920
 And you're a dad that's other-centered,

1048
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:09,920
 and you bring a blessing into the home and not a curse.

1049
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,040
 And I gave him a hug and I said, man, go win your game!

1050
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:13,480
 And he ran up the steps.

1051
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:15,680
 His two dumb teenage brothers just sat up there

1052
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,480
 and go, you're back, all right, here we go, right?

1053
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:20,200
 (congregation laughing)

1054
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,840
 But now those brothers have pushed through those years,

1055
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:24,040
 you know, and they're the same way.

1056
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,680
 We have an amazing relationship.

1057
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:32,260
 You know, I just, when you follow Jesus, not your heart,

1058
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:35,160
 and you learn his ways, man, you can lead,

1059
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:37,800
 and when you lead, you lead in a way it's a blessing.

1060
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:42,320
 And I just ask my kids, love, man, how'd you do today?

1061
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,240
 'Cause when you follow your heart,

1062
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:44,880
 you follow lustful thoughts, right?

1063
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,200
 It's desperately sick and it's evil above all else.

1064
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,720
 But what have you done today to make someone else know

1065
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,160
 of God's great love for them?

1066
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:56,360
 What have you done so that somebody out there

1067
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:57,840
 who maybe was at the end

1068
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:01,500
 of believing that their life mattered,

1069
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,340
 they know that there's a God that cares for them

1070
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:04,900
 because you cared for them in Jesus' name.

1071
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:07,240
 One of the things I would do with my kids a lot,

1072
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:09,160
 you know, grocery stores or something at times,

1073
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:11,880
 I would just, you know, let, and see people behind me.

1074
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:13,160
 We had more than they did sometimes.

1075
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:14,120
 I'd say, hey, but just put this stuff,

1076
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:16,400
 in fact, put this stuff ahead of mine, right?

1077
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:17,560
 And they'd check it out, check it out.

1078
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:18,440
 I'd go, hey, just bag that.

1079
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:20,440
 And I'd just go, and they'd go, you know.

1080
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:24,080
 I can remember one time we were at Target around Christmas,

1081
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:26,800
 and I just looked at what appeared to me to be a person

1082
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,920
 who didn't have the provision, you know, that we had.

1083
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:33,040
 And I was, you know, in line.

1084
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,040
 I watched the way the mom was saying,

1085
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:35,720
 no, we can't get that, no, we can't get that.

1086
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:38,200
 And I just said, hey, let them go in front of me.

1087
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:39,160
 She goes, oh, thank you so much,

1088
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:40,840
 'cause she had a bunch of kids that were kind of crazy.

1089
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:44,160
 And I go, and by the way, put that back on the thing.

1090
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,760
 And I let them get in front of me,

1091
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,720
 and I let them check out,

1092
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:50,280
 and the mom was kind of digging through her cash.

1093
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:53,880
 And I just go, hey, this is gonna be part of ours tonight.

1094
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:54,720
 Bless you.

1095
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:58,260
 And she looked at me, and she was like, what are you doing?

1096
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:00,200
 This is a great story,

1097
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:01,680
 because it was one of the most encouraging things

1098
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,240
 of my life, and I just said, well, look,

1099
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:04,840
 I pray, and I use this line a lot.

1100
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:07,700
 I pray this small act of kindness, and it's small,

1101
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:09,860
 just reminds you of God's great love for you.

1102
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:13,000
 It happened to be around the Christmas season, you know?

1103
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,420
 And she goes, man, how could I thank you?

1104
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:15,260
 I go, well, you know what?

1105
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:16,500
 You don't have to do anything to thank me.

1106
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:18,880
 I just want, maybe just realize that what I'm doing,

1107
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,680
 it's just a reminder that God loves you,

1108
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:21,520
 that I haven't forgotten about you.

1109
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,520
 I mean, that's what Christmas is all about.

1110
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:24,600
 I mean, if you really wanna do something,

1111
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:25,820
 I would love for you to come and celebrate

1112
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:28,040
 who my Jesus is this Christmas.

1113
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:31,000
 Would you please consider maybe just coming

1114
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:31,960
 and hanging out with your kids,

1115
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:33,360
 and being at Christmas Eve service?

1116
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:36,120
 She goes, oh, I can't do that.

1117
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:39,240
 And I just said to her, I go, I get it.

1118
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:40,080
 And she goes, no, I can't do that.

1119
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:41,160
 I would really like to.

1120
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:42,480
 She goes, but there was somebody else

1121
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,680
 that was just so kind to me, and I promised them,

1122
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:47,440
 I promised them that I would go to church with them.

1123
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:50,200
 And I go, I go, that's amazing.

1124
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:52,040
 Well, go to church.

1125
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:52,880
 What church did she invite you to?

1126
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:55,720
 She goes, it's a church called like Water something,

1127
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:57,880
 Water, kid goes, Watermark.

1128
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,160
 She goes, we're gonna go to Watermark.

1129
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:01,860
 I go, oh, definitely, you should do that.

1130
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:03,660
 (congregation laughing)

1131
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:04,660
 And I just thought to myself,

1132
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:09,380
 how great is it that I'm out there with other folks

1133
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:11,420
 that are following Jesus and just loving it,

1134
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:13,420
 and done something to her that made her,

1135
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:16,100
 for a second, realize maybe life is worth

1136
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:17,800
 having a little bit of hope in it.

1137
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:20,140
 Amen.

1138
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:22,860
 You know how often you can do that?

1139
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:26,340
 Maybe this, I just say to people all the time,

1140
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:28,900
 maybe this small act of kindness,

1141
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:31,100
 just remind you of God's great love for you.

1142
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:36,700
 Don't follow your stinking heart, right?

1143
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:39,420
 I mean, can you imagine a guy, and he's with a girl,

1144
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:41,660
 it's Netflix and chill time,

1145
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:46,660
 and before he chills, he looks at her,

1146
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:48,580
 and he gets up and go, we gotta chill.

1147
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:52,220
 And maybe this great act of discipline

1148
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:53,980
 can be a reminder of God's great love for you,

1149
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:55,740
 'cause you're his daughter and you're precious,

1150
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:57,980
 and I love you and I respect you.

1151
00:46:57,980 --> 00:46:59,060
 I'll see you tomorrow.

1152
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:03,060
 (audience laughing)

1153
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:08,040
 That made me like the guy, all right?

1154
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:13,500
 Love.

1155
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:15,940
 I got so many of them here, man.

1156
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:16,780
 I'm not gonna give them all to you,

1157
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:18,380
 I'll just give you one more.

1158
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:19,300
 You know what I do with my kids?

1159
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:21,020
 One of the things I did, I'll give you two more,

1160
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:23,580
 but one was just, what the L, right?

1161
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:26,180
 Here we go, so it's laugh.

1162
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:29,820
 I just, I said to my kids, have you laughed out loud today?

1163
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:30,980
 Have you laughed uncontrollably?

1164
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:31,940
 Have you laughed 'til you cried?

1165
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:33,900
 Have you made others laugh much today?

1166
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:37,660
 Proverbs 17, 22 says a joyful heart is good medicine.

1167
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:39,820
 Man, we're not uptight, you know,

1168
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:41,500
 we're not pilgrims and Puritans,

1169
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:43,860
 and by the way, before you throw them under the bus,

1170
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:44,860
 go look at their life.

1171
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:47,480
 Man, there was some amazing richness of life

1172
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:50,300
 back when those people lived a good life,

1173
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:53,520
 but a broken spirit is what dries up the bones.

1174
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,900
 I mean, we gotta learn to laugh.

1175
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:58,140
 A joyful heart is good medicine.

1176
00:47:58,140 --> 00:48:01,780
 My family, we laughed together a ton.

1177
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:03,860
 We played games, we compete.

1178
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:06,220
 I mean, I'll tell you a quick story

1179
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:07,340
 of just like stuff we would do,

1180
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:09,300
 like with our kids, our kids just watch us have fun.

1181
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:10,900
 We play games and there's consequences.

1182
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:12,380
 I can remember one Thanksgiving,

1183
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:13,960
 we were playing a game and the loser,

1184
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:16,300
 my neighbor's next door that we'd just started

1185
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:17,700
 to build a good relationship with,

1186
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:20,020
 they actually built a pool and it was in the fall,

1187
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:21,820
 and so it got to November and the pool was done,

1188
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:23,520
 so Thanksgiving weekend was the big opening

1189
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:25,620
 of their pool in their backyard.

1190
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:27,660
 And it's Thanksgiving night, we're playing games,

1191
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:29,300
 and so we played a game and the loser,

1192
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:32,260
 the consequence was you had to go over to their house,

1193
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:33,660
 it was almost 10 o'clock at night,

1194
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:36,220
 and knock on the door, okay?

1195
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:37,380
 And then when they answered,

1196
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:38,640
 because we knew they were up,

1197
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:39,940
 and when they answered, we just said,

1198
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:42,140
 "Hey," whoever lost had to say,

1199
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:43,320
 "What's the pool record?"

1200
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:44,380
 Well, they'd just opened the pool

1201
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:47,300
 and that's just a stupid question anyway.

1202
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:48,140
 What's the pool record?

1203
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:48,980
 And then we just said,

1204
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:49,820
 "Well, what do you mean the pool record?"

1205
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:52,620
 He goes, "Listen, I used to swim in high school."

1206
00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:54,580
 None of my kids swam in high school, none of us did.

1207
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:56,660
 But you had to say, "I used to swim in a high school

1208
00:48:56,660 --> 00:48:59,340
 "and I would like to set the pool record."

1209
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:02,900
 Which is just nuts, 10 o'clock at Thanksgiving night.

1210
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:05,180
 But this guy, this buddy goes, "Oh, okay."

1211
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:07,140
 And so anyway, what you had to do is go out to the pool,

1212
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:08,220
 you had to get there next to the pool

1213
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:09,140
 and kind of do the Michael Phelps,

1214
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:10,780
 you know, kind of thing like this.

1215
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:12,980
 Then you had to dive in and you had to swim

1216
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:15,060
 as absolutely poorly as you could,

1217
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:16,780
 you know, like just kind of flailing your arms

1218
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:18,180
 after three, (grunts)

1219
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:20,340
 just like this, touch the other side,

1220
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:21,180
 go, (grunts)

1221
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:23,820
 and then just come back and do the exact same thing.

1222
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:25,460
 It wasn't a very big pool.

1223
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:26,380
 And get to the other side,

1224
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:27,500
 and when you got to the other side,

1225
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:28,580
 touch it and just kind of go,

1226
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:30,220
 "What was my time, what was my time?"

1227
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:32,380
 And no matter what they said, you had to go, "Yes!"

1228
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:34,300
 And then get out and walk out of their backyard

1229
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:35,140
 and not say a word.

1230
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:36,380
 (audience laughing)

1231
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:37,740
 That was the stakes.

1232
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:40,620
 And my wife lost.

1233
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:42,860
 (audience laughing)

1234
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:45,060
 And we were all upstairs, my kids and I,

1235
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:48,860
 we're looking out the back window and it was hilarious.

1236
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:50,620
 And my wife kind of came back in the house,

1237
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:53,780
 dripping wet, like, "I am not doing that."

1238
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:55,820
 But we laughed with our neighbors the next day,

1239
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:58,180
 go, "Hey, what was that last night?"

1240
00:49:58,180 --> 00:50:01,180
 (audience laughing)

1241
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:05,460
 Besides the turkey, what else was going on over there?

1242
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:07,220
 (audience laughing)

1243
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:09,340
 But we just do that kind of crazy stuff,

1244
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:10,180
 and we laugh about that.

1245
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:11,340
 It's one of the favorite memories

1246
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:13,820
 that we have as neighbors together.

1247
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:15,980
 Silly, crazy stuff, we just laugh.

1248
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:18,940
 We have a little, a joyful heart is good medicine.

1249
00:50:18,940 --> 00:50:21,780
 Man, who'd you bring joy to today?

1250
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:24,980
 Do you remember the last time you laughed till you cried?

1251
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:28,100
 The last time I laughed till I cried was today,

1252
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:30,700
 in our staff meeting.

1253
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:32,780
 And I don't have time to explain it to you,

1254
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:34,940
 but it was amazing.

1255
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:36,580
 It was amazing, all right.

1256
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:37,540
 Last one.

1257
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:41,740
 When you follow Jesus, man, you lean on others.

1258
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:42,980
 You don't go at it alone.

1259
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:45,940
 And so I'd ask my kids, man,

1260
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:47,420
 who are you relying to spur you on?

1261
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:48,780
 You're not a lone ranger.

1262
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:50,940
 Who are the friends in your life,

1263
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:55,380
 'cause Jesus wants you, right, to not be at this alone.

1264
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:57,140
 Wise men seek solitude.

1265
00:50:57,140 --> 00:50:57,980
 Wise men learn.

1266
00:50:57,980 --> 00:51:01,300
 Wise men sit at the feet of Jesus, but fools isolate.

1267
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:03,940
 Fools isolate.

1268
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:06,580
 Wise men and women will walk out of here tonight

1269
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:08,820
 and go to open group and start to assimilate

1270
00:51:08,820 --> 00:51:12,260
 and get grafted in with other Christ followers,

1271
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:14,260
 not heart followers.

1272
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:18,700
 And those friends will encourage them and sharpen them

1273
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:19,980
 and love them.

1274
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:22,340
 And shepherd them.

1275
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:25,220
 I'd ask my kids, man, who's got access to your heart?

1276
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:26,580
 Who's informing your heart?

1277
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:28,860
 Are they truth tellers?

1278
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:30,700
 Are they Christ followers?

1279
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:32,180
 Who faithfully reproves you?

1280
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:33,900
 Who admonishes you when you're unruly?

1281
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:36,220
 When's the last time you repented and changed

1282
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:39,100
 because someone who loved you told you the truth?

1283
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:43,860
 See, Christ followers have that.

1284
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:48,140
 I've got friends that sit with me and just go,

1285
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:50,820
 Todd, this is an area that you can strengthen.

1286
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:53,860
 How great is that?

1287
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:56,340
 How great is that?

1288
00:51:56,340 --> 00:51:59,180
 Guys, you don't need a slogan.

1289
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:00,140
 I need a savior.

1290
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:02,820
 You don't need insta-theology 'cause you got real theology.

1291
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:04,900
 Don't be around it like some people

1292
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:07,020
 and have to learn it through experience.

1293
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:09,600
 Drink deeply of the kindness of God.

1294
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:14,340
 I'll just close by reading Scripture.

1295
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:16,420
 It's in Colossians 3, and I gotta tell you,

1296
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:19,060
 this is what happens when you follow Jesus.

1297
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:20,500
 You can really look forward to something.

1298
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:21,980
 You don't have dread.

1299
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:24,540
 So in Colossians 3, it says,

1300
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:26,900
 "Therefore, if you've been raised up with Christ,"

1301
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:28,620
 I'm just gonna quote it, just the idea that

1302
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:32,980
 if you are identifying that sin is wicked

1303
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:35,060
 and is an offense to God because he loves people

1304
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:37,620
 and sin hurts people, you just,

1305
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:39,380
 I've been crucified with Christ,

1306
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:40,500
 the life which I live in the flesh,

1307
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:41,900
 I live by faith in the Son of God,

1308
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:44,540
 so the resurrection power of Christ is at work in me.

1309
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:45,900
 He says, if that's who you are,

1310
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:48,540
 if you're a Christian, then quit following your heart.

1311
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:49,380
 Inform your heart.

1312
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:51,860
 Your heart is desperately sick and deceitful above all else.

1313
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:52,700
 Don't be surprised.

1314
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:53,980
 Don't beat yourself up.

1315
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:55,420
 Temptation isn't sin.

1316
00:52:55,420 --> 00:53:00,620
 Not following the God of creation is sin.

1317
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:03,660
 So keep seeking the things above where Christ is.

1318
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:05,220
 He's seated at the right hand of God.

1319
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:09,420
 Set your mind on the things above,

1320
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:10,900
 not on the things that are of the earth,

1321
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:13,460
 the worldly fables, the insta-theology.

1322
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:15,460
 Set your mind on God, good theology.

1323
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:16,300
 Watch this.

1324
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:18,460
 For you have died, which means not really,

1325
00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:19,900
 but you've died to yourself.

1326
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:22,000
 I know my heart is sick.

1327
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,700
 I don't wanna be in a land of salt.

1328
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:27,600
 I wanna be like a tree firmly planted by streams of water.

1329
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:29,660
 And so watch this.

1330
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:31,500
 This is what you've got to look forward to in verse four.

1331
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:33,740
 When Christ, if you follow him,

1332
00:53:33,740 --> 00:53:37,300
 you can look forward, there's an L for you,

1333
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:38,540
 you can look forward to this.

1334
00:53:38,540 --> 00:53:41,660
 When Christ, who is our life, is revealed,

1335
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:42,740
 in other words, the day is coming

1336
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:44,780
 when the clouds will be rolled back like a scroll

1337
00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:46,220
 and your king is gonna reveal himself,

1338
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:49,020
 that this wasn't just a wisp of an idea,

1339
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:51,040
 this is truth anchored in history.

1340
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:52,780
 When Christ, who is your life, is revealed,

1341
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:55,500
 then you also will be revealed with him in glory.

1342
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:58,980
 And the world's gonna go, how did you know?

1343
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:02,220
 How did you know he was the one worth serving?

1344
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:04,820
 And by the way, so it worked out well for you then,

1345
00:54:04,820 --> 00:54:07,160
 it's gonna work out well for you now.

1346
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:08,000
 And so watch this.

1347
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,380
 You're not gonna fall insta-theology.

1348
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:11,940
 And so verse five, therefore,

1349
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:14,160
 since you know that God is there and you know he's good,

1350
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:15,000
 you know there's gonna be a day

1351
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,460
 when he's gonna wrap this thing up,

1352
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:18,460
 consider the members of your earthly body

1353
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:20,120
 not as worth a following.

1354
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:25,180
 Don't just be dead to that insta-pull towards immorality,

1355
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:27,260
 to that insta-pull to impurity.

1356
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:29,660
 Don't follow your passions, you're dead to it.

1357
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:31,760
 Don't follow evil desires and greed.

1358
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:33,000
 It amassed to idolatry.

1359
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,380
 Listen to Brad Pitt, listen to Justin Bieber,

1360
00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:36,600
 listen to Jesus.

1361
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:41,900
 Father, I thank you that you love us

1362
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:43,820
 and we don't have to scroll through Instagram

1363
00:54:43,820 --> 00:54:45,700
 or Pinterest hoping we find a slogan.

1364
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:47,300
 We've got a savior.

1365
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:50,180
 He is kind and he is good and he is right and he is true

1366
00:54:50,180 --> 00:54:52,700
 and he cares for us and his name is Jesus.

1367
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:54,660
 And we don't have to wonder if he loves us.

1368
00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:55,860
 He's shown us he loves us.

1369
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:57,660
 We don't have to try and make it up.

1370
00:54:57,660 --> 00:55:04,260
 We just gotta make up our minds,

1371
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:06,420
 not be conformed to the world,

1372
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:08,700
 but be transformed by the renewing of our mind

1373
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:12,660
 that we might get to experience, prove out with our life

1374
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:17,080
 what is good and acceptable and perfect and life-giving.

1375
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:20,700
 And so I just pray for my friends that tonight

1376
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:21,980
 they go home having just learned

1377
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:23,260
 and being reminded of these things

1378
00:55:23,260 --> 00:55:25,000
 and they would execute on it.

1379
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,260
 And they would start to be people

1380
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:29,620
 who learn more of your ways

1381
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:31,860
 and who lead as a result of that.

1382
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:36,860
 And who love, whose life brings laughter and joy to others,

1383
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:42,180
 who lean on other people and who look forward to the day.

1384
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:45,100
 When you come and you come quickly,

1385
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:47,140
 you rendered a man according to their deeds.

1386
00:55:47,140 --> 00:55:49,500
 Thank you, Father, that even now

1387
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:51,180
 our deeds can lead to sweep, sweep.

1388
00:55:51,180 --> 00:55:54,160
 It can lead to forgiveness if we'll just trust you.

1389
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:58,740
 But having been forgiven, let us not follow our heart.

1390
00:55:58,740 --> 00:55:59,700
 Let us inform it.

1391
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:03,200
 In Jesus' name, amen.
