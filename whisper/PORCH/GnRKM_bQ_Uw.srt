1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,080

 If we haven't met, like you said, my name is JD.

6
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,400
 I serve here every Tuesday night

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,240
 as the creative director of our young adult ministry.

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,080
 We call it The PORCH.

9
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,160
 I just wanna welcome my friends tuning in

10
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,360

15
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,680

17
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,900

00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,960
 my friends in the room in Dallas, Texas.

19
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,880
 So excited, so pumped.

20
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:59,120
 We are heading into night three of our summer series,

21
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,520
 Hot Takes Summer.

22
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,840
 We're just going all in,

23
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,040
 talking about some controversial topics, some hot takes.

24
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,560
 You might like them, you might not.

25
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,680
 It's been getting spicy.

26
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,320
 We are in night three tonight.

27
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,520
 And what David kinda did,

28
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,280
 he kinda set this like thing in motion.

29
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,720
 We didn't even really plan it,

30
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,120
 but the speaker now is supposed to get up

31
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,320
 and just start off the message

32
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,840
 with just giving off some personal hot takes.

33
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,120
 And so take them or leave them.

34
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,400
 Here is JD's hot takes.

35
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,520
 Spent some time on these, so hope you like them.

36
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,760
 Hot take number one,

37
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:32,960
 girls slide into guys' DMs

38
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,120
 way more than guys slide into girls' DMs.

39
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:40,640
 I'm just saying, especially Christian girls.

40
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:47,040
 Y'all can't wait for him to post that story

41
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,580
 so you can reply.

42
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:51,960
 That's sliding into DMs, all right?

43
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,000
 Hot take number two,

44
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,640
 there is no one in this room

45
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,880
 that could beat me in Nintendo 64,

46
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,480
 not Nintendo Switch, get that out of here, I'm a millennial.

47
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,840
 Nintendo 64, Mario Kart, or Super Smash Bros,

48
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,720
 you can't beat me.

49
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,200
 Challenge me, bro, all right?

50
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,640
 Come at me.

51
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,960
 You think you got, okay.

52
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,960
 I'll meet you outside after, all right?

53
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,320
 With Kirby, all right, with Kirby.

54
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,640
 Hot take number three,

55
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,800
 LaCroix, it's trash.

56
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,800
 (audience cheering)

57
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:34,280
 The first time I ever tried it,

58
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,000
 I said, this tastes like someone got

59
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,920
 one of them little coffee styrofoam cups,

60
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,040
 dropped some Skittles in it,

61
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,840
 and left it outside for a day.

62
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,520
 That's what it tastes like.

63
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,080
 Waterloo is where it's at.

64
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,880
 If you've had Waterloo, get some Waterloo, try it out.

65
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,920
 That's where it's at.

66
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,760
 Hot take number four, last but not least,

67
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:57,120
 you should never, ever, ever, ever, ever,

68
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,080
 under any circumstance,

69
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,920
 listen to Christmas music before December 1st.

70
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,360
 (audience cheering)

71
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,680
 Never, never.

72
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:14,120
 And when you do, when it finally gets to December 1st,

73
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:18,280
 your first song must be Mariah Carey's classic,

74
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,200
 ♪ All I want for Christmas is you ♪

75
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,000
 That's that, right, front row got it.

76
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,080
 But that's not what we're talking about tonight.

77
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:32,080
 Tonight's porch hot take summer number three is this.

78
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,200
 Sin is really, really fun until it's not.

79
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,360
 Sin is really, really fun until it's not.

80
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,040
 And I think some of you right now are like,

81
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,720
 oh Lord, here goes the church guy

82
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,840
 talking about how I shouldn't sin.

83
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,800
 And the reality is,

84
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,200
 is I don't even wanna start off by assuming

85
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,920
 that some of you even understand what I mean

86
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,080
 when I say the word sin.

87
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,680
 And so let me just define it really quick.

88
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,440
 Here's the definition, a quick definition of sin.

89
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:04,040
 Sin is anything, anything that you think,

90
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,360
 say, or do that dishonors God.

91
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:10,840
 Sin is anything that you think, say, or do

92
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,720
 that dishonors God.

93
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,680
 And the reason why we would say this is a hot take

94
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,480
 is because it's so normal to think

95
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,560
 that when you come into church, like places like tonight,

96
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,000
 it's so like classic to hear people say,

97
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,960
 hey, don't sin, don't sin, don't sin.

98
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,840
 And you might be looking about like,

99
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,180
 hey, like of course, like the young Christian guy saying,

100
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,640
 hey, you shouldn't sin, do better.

101
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,240
 But the reality is, is like sin,

102
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,480
 the reason why we do it is because deep down,

103
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,040
 we know it's fun.

104
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,080
 And my problem is, is I'm not out here like,

105
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,520
 hey, don't sin.

106
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,820
 My problem is, is I know deep down, like I want sin.

107
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:46,240
 Like I actually think sin is too fun.

108
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,620
 Like there was a time in college

109
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:52,300
 where sin really marks my life.

110
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,640
 Like I've always been a sinner, like we all have.

111
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,520
 Romans 3, 23, for all have sinned

112
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,280
 and fallen short of the glory of God.

113
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,640
 But there was this time in college

114
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,000
 where sin really just marks my life.

115
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,920
 I followed it and not God.

116
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,360
 And I was always jealous of those guys

117
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,720
 that could like go to the club.

118
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,280
 Like my vice is partying.

119
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,560
 It's my, that's just me, okay.

120
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,480
 I like to go out.

121
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,680
 I know a lot of you probably aren't surprised.

122
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,080
 I like to go out, have a good time, have some drinks,

123
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,980
 hang out with people, work the room.

124
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,560
 Honestly, I'll do that sober.

125
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,380
 But after I get a few drinks in me,

126
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,340
 I was always just those guys that could like drink

127
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,180
 with like the beer.

128
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:27,100
 I don't like beer, I'll say it.

129
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,440
 I'm like a margarita guy.

130
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,880
 And they have the beers,

131
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,240
 they're just chilling the whole night on the side,

132
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,440
 like watching everyone else

133
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,240
 and like just talking, looking all cool.

134
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,520
 I was never that guy.

135
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,920
 Like I was totally the guy that got a few drinks in me,

136
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,240
 tabletop, like get in there.

137
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,280
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

138
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,320
 Like that was me.

139
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:50,000
 Like I was that guy every single night of the week.

140
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,160
 Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday,

141
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,040
 recoup on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.

142
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,400
 Like that's what marked my life

143
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,200
 and what was so fun at first.

144
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,820
 Like, I mean, it was truly fun.

145
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:10,000
 Quickly, like that pattern of living my life,

146
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,520
 'cause I was following God before that,

147
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,340
 but then I kind of went on my own way for a season.

148
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,920
 And like my life suddenly started to get more predictable

149
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,720
 and more boring deep down

150
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,480
 and more lonely and more stressful.

151
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,680
 And I could tell you what I was gonna do

152
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,680
 every single night of the week.

153
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,640
 And I looked around and I'm like, we're all miserable.

154
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,240
 Like we're all like fooling ourself

155
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,480
 and we're like doing it in the name of fun.

156
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,280
 And some of you are like, no, trust me, bro.

157
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,320
 Like I'm still having fun,

158
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:42,080
 but I'm telling you tonight, sin is really fun

159
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,080
 until it's not.

160
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,000
 And you wanna make sure that you take care of sin

161
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,400
 before it takes care of you.

162
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:51,140
 You wanna get out of ahead of it.

163
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,500
 And I think some of us tonight, you're like,

164
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,720
 well, I'm not like really that deep.

165
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,020
 And this talk is for everyone,

166
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,680
 whether you're like deep in it,

167
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,160
 whether you're like thinking about it,

168
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,520
 whether you're toying with it,

169
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,600
 this message is for everyone

170
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,880
 because we all have something in us that wants sin.

171
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:10,000
 And the reality is if sin is actually fun,

172
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,280
 why doesn't it stay fun?

173
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,340
 Like if we're going out chasing the high,

174
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:18,520
 why do we have to keep striving to get higher

175
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,880
 and higher and higher?

176
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:23,660
 And why is every single high accompanied by a low?

177
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:27,260
 Like if it was truly just for a good time,

178
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:29,720
 why doesn't it stay a good time?

179
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,120
 Like if you think about your life,

180
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,920
 I bet if right now I sat down with each one of you

181
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,660
 and pinpointed the most painful thing

182
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,360
 that's ever happened to you,

183
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,960
 I bet in some way I could trace it back to its origin.

184
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:47,960
 And the beginning of that result

185
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,820
 began with what the Bible would define as a sinful action.

186
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:56,160
 Like so much that is hurting us in the world

187
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,840
 is because of sin, divorce, STDs,

188
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,020
 school shootings,

189
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:10,640
 it's because sin became fun for a short while for someone,

190
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,300
 but then it grew and grew and grew

191
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,440
 and that sin was fun until it wasn't.

192
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,720
 And I just wanna address something like this talk tonight,

193
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,060
 like David got the sex talk, I got the sin talk.

194
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:24,480
 Great, like, thank you, David.

195
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,320
 But the reality is,

196
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,620
 is like this is gonna be a very sobering message.

197
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,760
 But I also wanna go ahead

198
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,580
 and give you some hope and relief right up top.

199
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:36,780
 Like, if you will sit in the weight of your sin,

200
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:40,960
 you then get to sit in the beauty of the cross.

201
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,960
 And that's where we're heading tonight.

202
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,800
 But we gotta get there.

203
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,500
 We gotta sit in the weight first of what sin is

204
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,760
 and what it means for us,

205
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,880
 that it's fun until it's not.

206
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,280
 We say this quote around here a lot.

207
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,120
 It says this,

208
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,520
 "Sin will take you further than you ever wanted to go,

209
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,440
 "keep you longer than you ever wanted to stay,

210
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,040
 "and cost you more than you ever wanted to pay."

211
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,540
 Let's say that one more time.

212
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,640
 "Sin will take you further than you ever wanted to go,

213
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,780
 "keep you longer than you ever wanted to stay,

214
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:12,540
 "and cost you more than you ever wanted to pay."

215
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,080
 And tonight I wanna explain,

216
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,300
 I wanna just like do a deep dive on this quote

217
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:19,480
 and rip it apart into three different sections.

218
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,660
 And I wanna talk about the reality of sin in our lives

219
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:26,680
 and the effects it can have to us and on us.

220
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:31,560
 And just talk about what we can do to get ahead of it.

221
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,120
 And so here we go.

222
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,300
 "Sin is really fun until it, one,

223
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,240
 "takes you further than you ever wanted to go."

224
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,400
 What do I mean by that?

225
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,600
 When I was thinking about how this point,

226
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,060
 I was thinking about this time in college

227
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,960
 where I was walking out of this basketball game.

228
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:51,080
 It was like nine o'clock and my three college roommates,

229
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,840
 they knew that I was kind of in a pity party.

230
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,880
 They were like, "JD needs to pick me up."

231
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,460
 So they drive up and they're like,

232
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:58,080
 "Hey, get in the car, we're gonna go eat

233
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,000
 "some jalapeno tree down the road, get some fajitas."

234
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,360
 And I'm like, "That sounds good."

235
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:06,800
 So I get in the car, they start driving, they're chilling.

236
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,640
 And I look over and I'm like,

237
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:11,760
 "Hey guys, we just passed the jalapeno tree."

238
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,120
 And they look at me and they'd have this like

239
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,560
 sly smile on their face.

240
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,320
 They hit the lock button.

241
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,400
 And then they did the weirdest thing.

242
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,440
 They crank up that song, what's it called?

243
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,260
 It's like,

244
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:23,800
 ♪ Coming out of my cage and I'll be doing just fine ♪

245
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,080
 What's it called?

246
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,160
 Mr. Brightside, thank you.

247
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,540
 They start playing Mr. Brightside as loud

248
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:32,120
 as the car will get and they just put it on repeat.

249
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:35,440
 So they just keep driving and it's like jealousy.

250
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,760
 And I'm like, "Where are we going?"

251
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,360
 And they just keep driving and keep driving.

252
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,340
 They won't answer me.

253
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,920
 Next thing I know, we start in Texas and we're passing,

254
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,360
 "Welcome to Louisiana."

255
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,000
 They just keep driving and driving and driving.

256
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,160
 And they pretty much just kept driving through the night

257
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,360
 until we ran out of gas.

258
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,720
 And they thought it was fun.

259
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,740
 They're like, "Wasn't this awesome?

260
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,120
 "Wasn't this an adventure?"

261
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,080
 I'm like, "Get me back home.

262
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,660
 "I have class tomorrow."

263
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,240
 So we have some fun in Louisiana.

264
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,880
 We head back, we come back.

265
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,640
 We get back at like 4.30 in the morning.

266
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,480
 I thought I was getting in the car to go to Jalapeno Tree

267
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,940
 and eat some fajitas for two.

268
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:16,620
 They had another plan.

269
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,280
 They trapped me against my will and take me further

270
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,580
 than I ever wanted to go.

271
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:22,520
 To Louisiana of all places in the name of fun.

272
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,980
 And I say that because I think that Satan

273
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,680
 does the same to us.

274
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:31,400
 He convinces us, "Hey, hop in the car.

275
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,400
 "We're just gonna go on a little joy ride."

276
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,520
 And he takes you further than you ever thought you'd go.

277
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,560
 That's what he does with sin.

278
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,140
 He convinced you that it's just for a quick little ride.

279
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,300
 You'll be back tonight.

280
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:46,940
 Just come in, try this out, try out this sin.

281
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,060
 Just take a little joy ride.

282
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,300
 We'll come right back.

283
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:56,260
 The reality is, is his main goal is to take you

284
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:59,060
 and let that sin produce something in you

285
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:02,060
 where you want more and more and more.

286
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:05,460
 And you go further and further and further

287
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:07,020
 than you ever thought you were.

288
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:10,560
 Like, think about like you,

289
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,500
 like you might need a pick me up every now and then

290
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,540
 and you go searching.

291
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:17,760
 And then Satan says, "Hey, go out tonight.

292
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,300
 "Go out with your friends, hop in the car.

293
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:23,220
 "Come enjoy just a little ride around town."

294
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,520
 And so you're like, "Yeah, I can just go out

295
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,020
 "and I'll just control, I'll just have one drink."

296
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,580
 And then your friends are like, "Get another

297
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:29,420
 "and get another."

298
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,840
 And they're like, "How about we go over here?"

299
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,460
 Go to another place.

300
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:36,140
 Some girls join, like, "How about we go over here?"

301
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:38,100
 You're at a house, you're drinking more the whole time

302
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,360
 because people are like, "Let's just keep going,

303
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,000
 "let's just keep going."

304
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,900
 As you're sitting there and you're drunk in state,

305
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,260
 you're like, "Hmm, what should I do?

306
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,340
 "I guess, redownload Snapchat."

307
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:50,480
 You get on Snapchat, you start snapping that girl

308
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,900
 that you only use.

309
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:55,420
 You go over there, you hook up

310
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,380
 after you said you were done with that.

311
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:59,580
 And you're laying there the next morning

312
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:02,720
 and you're like, "I thought I was just going out.

313
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,780
 "Like, how did I get here?"

314
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:07,420
 And it's because your sin took you further

315
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,820
 than you ever wanted to go.

316
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:11,260
 Like, so for some of you ladies,

317
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,860
 I know that body image can be a really big struggle.

318
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:17,100
 You got, like, hot girl summer coming up,

319
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,380
 you got vacations coming up,

320
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,700
 you got all this pressure to look good in a swimsuit

321
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,440
 for the 'gram.

322
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,340
 You get on Instagram, you see workouts,

323
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,940
 you do one workout, you do two workouts.

324
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,340
 Oh, what do you know, vacation's getting here

325
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,740
 before you know it.

326
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:34,060
 I'll skip one meal, I'll skip just two meals.

327
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:37,760
 I'll pick it back up when I get to vacation.

328
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,420
 And you're starving yourself so you can look a certain way

329
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:43,120
 and feel a certain way about yourself.

330
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,500
 And you're experiencing such a low quality of life,

331
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,420
 you don't actually feel comfortable and confident

332
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,440
 in your skin.

333
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,740
 And you're just sitting there bound in this eating disorder

334
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,580
 and you're like, "How did I get here?

335
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,880
 "How did I get here?"

336
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,780
 And what started as just like,

337
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:02,780
 "Man, I wanna make sure I just feel good in a swimsuit,"

338
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:05,540
 led you further and further and further

339
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:07,660
 because that's what sin does,

340
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:10,060
 is it convinces you that you're getting in the car

341
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,540
 for just a short while,

342
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:14,500
 but it keeps driving and driving and driving.

343
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:20,500
 And the reason why is because sin's ultimate destination

344
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,980
 is separation.

345
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:27,060
 Sin's destination is ultimate separation.

346
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:30,780
 Sin's main priority, the father of sin,

347
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,340
 the creator of sin, Satan,

348
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:36,680
 his job is to convince you it's just fun

349
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:39,460
 to get some happiness for just a little bit,

350
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:40,600
 but he has a plan.

351
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,200
 And you're going in with no plan,

352
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,400
 but he has a plan, it's to ruin your life.

353
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:49,120
 John chapter 10 talks about how his only objective

354
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,620
 is to steal, kill, and destroy.

355
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:55,060
 He wants to rob you of life and life to the full,

356
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,600
 the life that God wants to offer you.

357
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,080
 He wants to trap you in the ride

358
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,480
 and take you further than you ever wanted to go.

359
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,640
 Think about this.

360
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:11,120
 When that now alcoholic got offered that first drink

361
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,500
 in a moment of weakness at the age of 16,

362
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:17,280
 they didn't take that drink and think,

363
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,600
 I'm gonna one day be an alcoholic

364
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,320
 and not be able to find love because I'm so obsessed

365
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,040
 and I need alcohol so bad.

366
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:29,080
 Like that person that looked at Playboy for that first time

367
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,000
 when they were 10, 11, 12,

368
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,920
 like they didn't think, I'm gonna look at this.

369
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,240
 So one day in college,

370
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,200
 when my friends invite me to go out for the weekend,

371
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,440
 I'm gonna tell them I'm too tired

372
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,440
 so I can plan my weekend around watching enough porn.

373
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:48,480
 Like sin does not tell you its destination for you.

374
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,840
 It just tells you to get in the car for a quick ride.

375
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,440
 But the reality is, I mean, it's sobering.

376
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,960
 It wants to take you so much further.

377
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,220
 I taught in the James series,

378
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:03,040
 this verse in James chapter one, verse 14, it says,

379
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,240
 "Temptation comes from our own desires,

380
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,840
 which entice us and drag us away.

381
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,720
 These desires give birth to sinful actions.

382
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,720
 And when sin is allowed to grow, it gives birth to death."

383
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,760
 What James is basically saying here is that,

384
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,920
 hey, sin never ends where it begins.

385
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:24,120
 It never ends where it begins.

386
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,960
 Yeah, sure, it just starts as a momentary thought,

387
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:30,260
 but then that thought gives into your own evil desires.

388
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:32,480
 It entices you, it calls you out,

389
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,400
 and you try that thing, and then that sin, you try it again,

390
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,400
 and you keep going back to it and back to it

391
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,760
 for momentary fixes, but you have to keep searching

392
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,200
 and searching and reaching for the next high.

393
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,200
 And then eventually that sin leads you down death,

394
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,520
 to a path of death.

395
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:52,520
 Because sin's destination is ultimate separation.

396
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,300
 That's always been its destination

397
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,360
 since the very beginning of sin.

398
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,920
 You guys know when sin was created,

399
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,400
 it happened in Genesis chapter three,

400
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,760
 the third chapter in the Bible.

401
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:04,720
 We see this moment where Adam and Eve

402
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,080
 were placed in the garden with the creator God himself.

403
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,720
 He gave them so much fruit to enjoy,

404
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,960
 and he asked one thing out of trust and faith.

405
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:18,560
 He said one thing, "Don't eat of that fruit.

406
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,640
 Would you trust me?"

407
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:24,160
 But then the father of sin, the serpent comes in,

408
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,000
 and what does he tell them?

409
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,920
 Hey, hey, hey, don't trust God.

410
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,080
 God isn't good.

411
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:30,920
 You know what he's doing?

412
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,520
 He's withholding from you.

413
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,720
 He's holding you back.

414
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,200
 He knows that if you eat that fruit,

415
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,240
 you're gonna be like him.

416
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,040
 And it says, "When Eve saw that the fruit

417
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:44,320
 seemed good to the eyes,

418
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,880
 and they had the ability to make one wise,

419
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,960
 she took of it and she ate,

420
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,920
 then she gave it to Adam and he ate."

421
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,140
 And then boom, separation.

422
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:58,360
 There was a separation between a holy God

423
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,680
 that once got to dwell with his creation,

424
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,280
 and now because his creation rebelled against him,

425
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,160
 there was a separation.

426
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:08,200
 And then death was implemented into our world

427
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,200
 because of sin.

428
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,520
 Look what it says in Genesis chapter three, verse 19.

429
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,640
 "God comes down after this action,

430
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,160
 and he looks at the serpent, he curses it.

431
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,920
 He looks at the man, he curses,

432
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,360
 or the woman, he curses her,

433
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,560
 and then he looks at the man, and this is what he says.

434
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,120
 "By the sweat of your brow will you have food to eat

435
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,960
 until you return to the ground from which you were made,

436
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,800
 for you were made from dust, and to dust you will return."

437
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,880
 Satan said to Eve, "Hey, get in, get in.

438
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,080
 The destination, we're gonna go be like God.

439
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,840
 We're gonna have a lot of better things

440
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,360
 than we have right now, get in."

441
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,160
 But the reality was, is he took Adam and Eve

442
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,840
 so much further than they ever thought

443
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,080
 that they were gonna go.

444
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:52,720
 He took them to separation from their creator,

445
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,880
 a God that loved them, and he wants to do the same to you.

446
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,240
 He will do anything he can to convince you

447
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,560
 that sin is worth it, and that sin is fun,

448
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,920
 and that sin is your solution,

449
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,800
 but the only solution is God.

450
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:10,640
 And if tonight you are someone

451
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,000
 that has been in the car with Satan,

452
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,920
 and you've gone so much further

453
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:17,200
 than you've ever wanted to go, I've got good news.

454
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,360
 God wants you back.

455
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,920
 Like you haven't gone too far.

456
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,720
 God wants you back.

457
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,440
 He wants you to turn around and come back to him,

458
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,920
 and he's made a way for that.

459
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,080
 We're gonna get there.

460
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:32,880
 But the reality is, is most people keep riding in the car,

461
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,960
 and we keep going further and further,

462
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,320
 believing that we're trapped,

463
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,680
 believing that sin is better,

464
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,240
 and since we feel trapped,

465
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,560
 we think that we have to stay trapped,

466
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,160
 which leads me to point number two.

467
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,000
 Sin is fun until it keeps you longer

468
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,880
 than you ever wanted to stay.

469
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,800
 What do I mean by that?

470
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,400
 Sin keeps you longer than you ever wanted to stay.

471
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,800
 A lot of times when you first start interacting

472
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:00,200
 with a certain sin, what it does is that it convinces you

473
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,120
 that you have the freedom to interact

474
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:07,920
 and come and go with that sin as you please, as you see fit.

475
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:12,080
 Like that sin tells you, hey, if you wanna get high,

476
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,720
 you get to pick and choose when you get high.

477
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,160
 If you wanna get high tonight, get high.

478
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,280
 If you don't, don't.

479
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,360
 Come and go as you please.

480
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,760
 You're a free man.

481
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,720
 This is what sin promises you.

482
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,560
 It says that you get freedom,

483
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,280
 but it's lying to you.

484
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:29,240
 Just like in the first point, sin said, get in the car.

485
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,840
 We're just going for a quick joy ride,

486
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,400
 and it took you further than you ever wanted to go.

487
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,520
 This one says, hey, come and go as you please,

488
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:37,680
 and you believe that you're free, but really you're trapped.

489
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:41,080
 Like the reason why we all love our house,

490
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:41,920
 I don't know about y'all,

491
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,880
 but I love the comfort of my home.

492
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,600
 Like I get to come and go as I please.

493
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,440
 I get to walk in, I get to cook when I want,

494
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,120
 do laundry when I want, walk around how I want,

495
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,320
 wearing what I want.

496
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,960
 I get to...

497
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,480
 (laughing)

498
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,320
 Anyways.

499
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:02,120
 And the reason why I feel like I can do that,

500
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,880
 because it's my home.

501
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,760
 It's my house.

502
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,800
 Y'all parents ever say to you growing up,

503
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,000
 my house, my rules.

504
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:08,840
 Y'all ever got that?

505
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:11,240
 Or hey, house rules, playing ping pong.

506
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,080
 Rules that don't even make sense.

507
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,360
 But the reality is, is if it's your house,

508
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,240
 you think my house, my rules.

509
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,840
 And that's what sin convinces you.

510
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,640
 It's like, come and stay, your house, your rules.

511
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,880
 Interact with sin how you want,

512
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,600
 but that's never what happens.

513
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,640
 It tells you you're a free man,

514
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,360
 but really you're a slave if you're obeying sin.

515
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:37,160
 Paul articulates that better than I do.

516
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,880
 In Romans chapter six, verse 16, he says,

517
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,360
 "Don't you realize that you become the slave

518
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,520
 of whatever you choose to obey?

519
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:48,140
 You can be a slave to sin, which leads to death,

520
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,560
 or you can choose to obey God,

521
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:53,360
 which leads to righteous living."

522
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,520
 Paul's saying here that, hey,

523
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:58,200
 you must see that if you choose to obey sin

524
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,700
 and it's desires for you to go and chase it

525
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,740
 whenever you want, however you want,

526
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,780
 you're actually a slave to it.

527
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:09,220
 You're a slave to the master that is sin.

528
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:14,920
 I was thinking about when I was writing this talk,

529
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:18,760
 and I was thinking about just like the idea of searching

530
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,440
 and staying with my sin and going further with my sin,

531
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,180
 I thought of the song "Amazing Grace."

532
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,020
 We all know it.

533
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:26,400
 Like we heard it at funerals, we've heard it at church.

534
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,300
 And there's a line in there that says,

535
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:31,160
 "Amazing grace, how sweet the sound

536
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,720
 that saved a wretch like me.

537
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:37,440
 I once was lost, but now I'm found,

538
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,420
 was blind, but now I see."

539
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:43,640
 And I was thinking about what sin wants to do,

540
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,260
 because what Jesus does,

541
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:48,320
 Jesus is in the business of taking lost people

542
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,880
 and making them found people,

543
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,440
 taking deaf people and making them hearing people,

544
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,880
 taking blind people and making them seeing people,

545
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,960
 but sin will do whatever it can to get in the way

546
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,360
 of the second half of those phrases.

547
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,880
 He wants to find people and go,

548
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:05,600
 "I once was lost and I stayed lost.

549
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,680
 I once was blind and I stay blind."

550
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:13,680
 Sin doesn't want you to experience Jesus.

551
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:16,400
 Sin doesn't want you to experience freedom.

552
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,200
 It wants you to think you're having fun,

553
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,700
 but really you're a slave.

554
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,760
 And then when I was thinking about,

555
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,000
 okay, this is how I write my talks.

556
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,920
 It's like, I once was lost, but now I'm found.

557
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,120
 Hey, remember lost and founds?

558
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,080
 That was like the best day of the year

559
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,400
 when all the people who didn't come

560
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,360
 get their lost and found stuff,

561
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,100
 you got to go get whatever you wanted.

562
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:37,240
 Lost and found, hey, that'd make for a good illustration.

563
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:40,400
 Because here's the purpose of the lost and found.

564
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,720
 The lost and found, as you know,

565
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:47,800
 its intention is, hey, if someone loses something,

566
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,680
 like we have something in us that wants it

567
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,760
 to go back to where it belongs.

568
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,080
 That's why we create things like lost and founds.

569
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,680
 And so if I lost my watch,

570
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,880
 hopefully someone would not be like,

571
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,840
 "Hey, sweet watch."

572
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,040
 They would take it and go somewhere.

573
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,520
 We have a section over there in the other offices

574
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,160
 and go, "Hey, I need to return this to the lost and found."

575
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,320
 And they put the watch inside the lost and found

576
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,360
 because the reason that this exists

577
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:13,480
 is to restore things back to their original owner

578
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:16,560
 so they can fulfill their original purpose.

579
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,900
 That's the goal of a lost and found.

580
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:22,260
 But here's what Satan does.

581
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,160
 This is how he convinces you to stay longer

582
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,060
 than you ever wanted to.

583
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:27,480
 When something in your life comes,

584
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,580
 a trial comes in your life,

585
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:31,680
 say someone unexpectedly dies or that breakup comes,

586
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,520
 all of a sudden your heart is broken.

587
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,360
 You feel so lost.

588
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,840
 You feel so confused.

589
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,360
 You don't know if God is actually good.

590
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,560
 And you're out here wondering,

591
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,520
 and God wants you to come to Him,

592
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:49,300
 but sin, its job is to present itself in front of you

593
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:52,360
 right in the midst of the hardest times of your life.

594
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:56,960
 When you feel most lost, you need to watch out

595
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,480
 'cause that's when you're most susceptible to fall to sin.

596
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,440
 And so sin comes and it's like,

597
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,200
 "Hey, you're looking for some life?

598
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,760
 You're looking for some answers?

599
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:09,960
 You're looking for some solutions to your problems?

600
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,760
 I've got answers.

601
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,600
 You wanna be found?

602
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,680
 I can find you some happiness.

603
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,560
 I can find you some pleasure.

604
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,560
 I can find you some affirmation.

605
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,800
 Come over here."

606
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:26,240
 And it convinces you that you're in the lost and found

607
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,400
 and that you'll find answers.

608
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:32,180
 But the reality is, is you're actually lost and bound.

609
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:34,760
 That's what sin wants to do.

610
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:38,460
 It wants to convince you that you found the answer,

611
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:40,100
 but really you found nothing.

612
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,160
 You're actually just really bound

613
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:45,360
 because you've come over and it's like this.

614
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:49,480
 This is Hannah, okay?

615
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:54,640
 Hannah's come over here because she has lost her sense

616
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,600
 of self-worth and she feels super lonely.

617
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,980
 She feels so lonely and she's looking for anything.

618
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:03,800
 And so sin has brought her over.

619
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,920
 He said, "Hey, I've found an answer to your loneliness.

620
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,400
 Tinder."

621
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,280
 And so Hannah downloads Tinder.

622
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,640
 The reason why I named Hannah Hannah

623
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,200
 is because I Googled number one name on Tinder.

624
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,200
 (audience laughing)

625
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:26,200
 And so she's looking on Instagram.

626
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:30,360
 She sees more engagements.

627
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,680
 Sorry, Hannah.

628
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:36,540
 She sees more weddings, more relationships.

629
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:40,320
 And then she sees Jessica out having fun

630
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,620
 and she didn't invite her.

631
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:45,700
 It's always Jessica.

632
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:49,000
 (audience laughing)

633
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 And so Hannah X's out of Instagram and she does it.

634
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,980
 She hits Tinder.

635
00:26:55,980 --> 00:27:01,200
 And she gets on Tinder and she starts to swipe right,

636
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,580
 swipe right, before you know it.

637
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:06,040
 She thinks all hope is lost.

638
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,680
 She's brushing her teeth.

639
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,080
 Someone swipes right on her.

640
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,480
 So she's like, hmm.

641
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:16,560
 She looks, his profile is full of red flags.

642
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:19,200
 He's like, definitely not a Christian.

643
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,360
 But she's like, could he fix my loneliness tonight?

644
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,800
 I think so.

645
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:32,540
 The reality is, is Hannah thought she was lost and found,

646
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,360
 but her actions show me that she's been deceived

647
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,720
 and she's lost and bound.

648
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:41,440
 And if she continues this,

649
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,840
 Hannah is gonna find herself going to all the wrong sources

650
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,720
 to fix her loneliness.

651
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,400
 And it's actually gonna make her more and more and more

652
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,040
 of a slave to sin.

653
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:59,880
 Let's try Jake.

654
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,680
 Nice Jake.

655
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,740
 We all know a Jake.

656
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,560
 Jake's broken some of your hearts.

657
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:12,640
 Jake never got the atta boy from his father.

658
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,560
 And every guy was like, hmm.

659
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:19,320
 And so Jake has been searching for significance

660
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,520
 his whole life.

661
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:25,800
 And so he's searching and searching and searching.

662
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:31,280
 And he thinks, oh, significance maybe could lie within,

663
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,960
 I'm a young adult now, I've graduated from college.

664
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,640
 I've got my master's in business.

665
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,840
 And so I'll work really hard.

666
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,400
 And so Jake starts working 80 hours a week.

667
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,240
 And he thinks, okay, it's just for a quick moment.

668
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,760
 It's just for now, when I get married, I'll chill out.

669
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,680
 Because he hasn't felt significant in a long time,

670
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:53,000
 he keeps going and then he gets married.

671
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,560
 And then he has kids.

672
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,820
 Those kids, they cost a lot of money.

673
00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:00,320
 And so he keeps going and they want more things.

674
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,720
 So he's buying more things.

675
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:05,040
 He keeps getting bigger homes, nicer cars.

676
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,520
 He keeps everything he can to maintain this image

677
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,280
 of significance and that, hey, look at me, I matter.

678
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:14,120
 He keeps going and going and going.

679
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:17,040
 And what started off with just, hey, I can keep doing it.

680
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,600
 I can keep working hard.

681
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,880
 I can keep, you know, he's like,

682
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,320
 oh, every time I get that paycheck,

683
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,660
 every time I start that new thing,

684
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:27,120
 every time I make that new purchase and my kids are happy,

685
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:32,120
 my wife is happy, I feel like I've found the answer.

686
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:38,400
 But the problem was, is that his kids aren't actually happy

687
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:42,080
 because he's never around.

688
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:46,460
 His wife isn't actually happy.

689
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:50,320
 She's faking it for her friends because he's never around.

690
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,880
 Why is he never around?

691
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,720
 Because he hasn't found the answer to significance.

692
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,440
 He's bound.

693
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,660
 He's a workaholic.

694
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:03,200
 And sin convinces you in your most lonely times,

695
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,240
 in your darkest times, hey, come with me.

696
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,120
 I'll find your answer.

697
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:10,360
 And it drops you off.

698
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,480
 It leaves you bound.

699
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,440
 It closes the lid.

700
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:18,140
 You find yourself trapped and still searching.

701
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:22,200
 You've been there longer than you ever wanted to

702
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,760
 because sin keeps us longer than we ever wanted to stay.

703
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,680
 And we give just about anything to get out.

704
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:31,440
 We seem like we've lost everything.

705
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,880
 We don't have enough to give, which is my third point.

706
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:38,640
 Sin cost us more than we ever wanted to pay.

707
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,800
 Sin cost us more than we ever wanted to pay.

708
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,760
 When I was writing this point,

709
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,860
 I couldn't help but think about a story in the Bible

710
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,880
 that we've all heard, we're very familiar with,

711
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,140
 especially if you've been coming here,

712
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:49,520
 it's called the story of the prodigal son

713
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,920
 or the runaway child.

714
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,360
 It's in Luke chapter 15.

715
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,080
 And what happens is there's this young adult,

716
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,120
 just like you and I,

717
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,460
 his story has so many parallels to our life

718
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,880
 where he had everything that he could ever want,

719
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:06,240
 a loving father, affirmation, gifts, a house, money,

720
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,120
 all these different things, but it wasn't enough.

721
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,160
 He wanted to go his own way.

722
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,040
 He wanted to do his own thing.

723
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,160
 So he comes to his dad and says,

724
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,060
 I don't want to wait any more for my inheritance.

725
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:16,720
 Give me all my money now.

726
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,400
 I'm going to go make a living for myself.

727
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,600
 I'm going to go have fun.

728
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,000
 I'm going to go spend my young adult years

729
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,120
 how I want to do it.

730
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,500
 Forget what you say, dad, I'm out.

731
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,960
 And this is what happens as a result of that.

732
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,100
 In verse 13,

733
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:31,800
 a few days later, this younger son

734
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,480
 packed all of his belongings and moved to a distant land.

735
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:39,040
 And there he wasted all his money in wild living.

736
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,440
 About the time his money ran out,

737
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:44,200
 a great famine swept over the land and he began to starve.

738
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,720
 And he persuaded a local farmer to hire him.

739
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,680
 And the man sent him into his fields to feed the pigs.

740
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:52,920
 The young man became so hungry that even the pods

741
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:56,320
 he was feeding the pigs looked good to him,

742
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,180
 but no one gave him anything.

743
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:02,280
 This is the definition of someone who gave into their sin

744
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,440
 and it took them further than they ever wanted to go.

745
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,520
 It was keeping them longer than they ever wanted to stay.

746
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,240
 And then lastly, it was costing them more

747
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,760
 than they ever could pay.

748
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,520
 He lost everything.

749
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,360
 He had nothing.

750
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,160
 He did not even have enough money to buy his own food.

751
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,400
 He lost his family.

752
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,920
 He lost people who loved him.

753
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,120
 He lost his job.

754
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,320
 He lost his health.

755
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,080
 And he went searching for life.

756
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,880
 And on the end of wild living,

757
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,480
 going out and living for the high,

758
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,760
 and it got him nowhere.

759
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,840
 And he spent everything he had and now he had nothing.

760
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:33,860
 That's what sin does.

761
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:39,800
 Sin is a master at revealing pleasure,

762
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,900
 but concealing consequence.

763
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:48,560
 Sin reveals pleasure, but it conceals consequence.

764
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,960
 Another way of saying that is sin convinces you

765
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,040
 that you can have a lot of fun for free.

766
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:56,440
 Y'all like, you see my bar tab?

767
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,280
 I don't think so.

768
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,320
 That's what sin does.

769
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:02,200
 It convinces you that you can have so much pleasure

770
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,480
 and it will cost you nothing.

771
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,280
 And that's wrong.

772
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,560
 That's not true.

773
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,520
 I can testify.

774
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:12,200
 Sin leads to so much unnecessary pain.

775
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:16,280
 It might be fun for a short while, but it hurts forever.

776
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,800
 Like there are people in this room

777
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,480
 that could raise their hand and say,

778
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,000
 I'm still experiencing the consequences

779
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,040
 of my decisions and my choices.

780
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,200
 But sin doesn't show you that before you commit it.

781
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,120
 It only reveals the pleasure.

782
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,820
 It conceals the consequence.

783
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:35,160
 That's what it did to this guy.

784
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,400
 And this story, it convinced him,

785
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,240
 hey, look at all the world out there.

786
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,160
 It's your oyster, go.

787
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,080
 If he knew what was on the end of this story,

788
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,160
 that in just a short time of famine would come

789
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,320
 and he'd be laying with pigs,

790
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,120
 not even to get to eat what they're eating,

791
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,840
 I don't think he would have done it.

792
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:56,520
 But sin only revealed pleasure.

793
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,040
 It's like this.

794
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,840
 Anyone else ever been trapped by a seven-day free trial?

795
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:05,920
 This is so embarrassing.

796
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:10,400
 One time I was on YouTube and those ads,

797
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:13,120
 they're getting heavy with them ads, I'll say it.

798
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,200
 When an ad pops up in the middle of my videos,

799
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,080
 I'm like, who do you think you are?

800
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:20,600
 But I was sitting there

801
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,920
 and they have like five seconds to grab you.

802
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:23,880
 You know, the whole hook,

803
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,520
 they got five seconds because you can click the skip ad

804
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,200
 in five seconds.

805
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:31,760
 And that guy, that guy that so many of you know,

806
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,620
 I think they said his name was V Shred or something.

807
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:37,320
 You know what I'm talking about if you know.

808
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,780
 He's sitting there shirtless.

809
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:40,040
 He just got done having a workout.

810
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,360
 And he's like, want these?

811
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:46,160
 And I'm like, yeah, I'm hooked.

812
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:48,240
 He's like, you can get these things really quick

813
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,840
 with just one simple thing.

814
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:52,480
 And the whole time you can eat cheeseburgers and pizza.

815
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,360
 And I'm like, tell me everything.

816
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,440
 I'm here.

817
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,380
 I'm at your mercy V Shred.

818
00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:01,360
 And he starts talking.

819
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,420
 And next thing I know, I'm seven minutes deep,

820
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:05,960
 learning about this new supplement.

821
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,680
 And he's like, you don't believe me?

822
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,500
 That's okay.

823
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,500
 I got a quick free trial for you.

824
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,540
 Just click this button, type in your email,

825
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:13,620
 bada bing, bada boom.

826
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:16,020
 We'll send a sample to your whatever, yada, yada, yada.

827
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:18,180
 And I'm like, I'm in, I'm about to be looking better.

828
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:20,420
 The best of my life, new year, new me.

829
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:22,540
 I'm typing in my email, click.

830
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:26,100
 I talked to like one fitness friend after,

831
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:28,100
 and he's like, tell me you didn't do it.

832
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,180
 Like, tell me you didn't listen to that guy.

833
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,060
 And some of you are like, what do you mean?

834
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:32,860
 I've been listening to him, but no.

835
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:35,780
 And I'm like, what do you mean?

836
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:38,080
 He starts informing me about all those different things.

837
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,620
 And he's like, it's just not gonna work.

838
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:40,460
 Like the way you decided.

839
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:42,580
 And I'm like, oh no.

840
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:44,540
 And I forget, like I forget I even did it.

841
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:46,760
 I try to push that away as fast as I can.

842
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:49,940
 And then the eighth day comes.

843
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,900
 I look at my bank account and I'm like, oh, just a number.

844
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,620
 What in the?

845
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:57,460
 And it took out the whole year's worth of,

846
00:35:57,460 --> 00:36:00,500
 as if I'm buying the supplement.

847
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,860
 And I am like, these shred, I am about to.

848
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:05,300
 So I go and I'm like, oh, well,

849
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:07,100
 if I just subscribe by clicking a button,

850
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:11,060
 like I can just go and click the button, unsubscribe.

851
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:15,000
 They make it such a pain to go and rewrite your story.

852
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,800
 I go on there and like, there's this small print

853
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,060
 that's like to unsubscribe, call our help desk

854
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:20,900
 at blah, blah, blah.

855
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:23,240
 And I'm like, oh, so I can just click a button to subscribe,

856
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,160
 but to unsubscribe, I got to call somebody.

857
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,280
 Okay, don't think I will.

858
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,880
 And so then I go and I call and they're like,

859
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,320
 while you're waiting a quick questionnaire

860
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,320
 as to why you're leaving us.

861
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,320
 And I'm like, just get me to the operator.

862
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,120
 They give me the operator and they're like, please hold.

863
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:36,080
 And I'm holding, I'm holding, I'm holding.

864
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,540
 And finally I talked to somebody.

865
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:39,060
 They take me through this strenuous process

866
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:41,040
 to finally unsubscribe.

867
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,100
 And they're like, but hey, I don't know if you saw the clause

868
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,360
 but you got to pay for at least six months.

869
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,160
 Like there's not, you can't have the money back.

870
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,200
 And I'm like, just take it.

871
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,720
 I don't want it anymore.

872
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:50,840
 Like just have my money.

873
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,960
 I just don't, I just don't want the pills

874
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,760
 and I'm just done, I'm embarrassed.

875
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:58,240
 (congregation laughing)

876
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,760
 And I'm going to get so many emails.

877
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,400
 Hey guys, like man, if you want to really try

878
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,880
 and get serious with Jim, like.

879
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,640
 (congregation laughing)

880
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,680
 You can save it, pal.

881
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:07,980
 I've been trying forever.

882
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:11,720
 (congregation laughing)

883
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,380
 But here's the thing.

884
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:14,760
 Sin is the same way.

885
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:18,600
 Sin convinces you to hop in the car for the joy ride.

886
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:22,320
 Sin convinces you to come over here and find life

887
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:26,280
 and come into the house, but you're really in a prison.

888
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:29,600
 And sin convinces you, it's just like a day free trial.

889
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:33,000
 It's a seven day free trial and it snatches you

890
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,380
 and it costs you more than you ever wanted to pay.

891
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:38,880
 And when I see those emails,

892
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:42,080
 I still haven't subscribed from the newsletter things.

893
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,860
 When I see them, it reminds me of that moment

894
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:48,400
 in the same way, like your sin will remind you of itself

895
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:53,320
 and heap guilt and shame and consequences on your life.

896
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,680
 And you thought you were just signing up for a free trial

897
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,700
 and it's cost you so much more.

898
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:01,380
 It might've cost you your mental health.

899
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:02,640
 It might've cost you a virginity

900
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,960
 and someone that just used you.

901
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:05,920
 I'm so sorry.

902
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:09,720
 Like, I don't know what your sin has cost you,

903
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,760
 but there is something that can fix that.

904
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:15,640
 But I want you to think about something.

905
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:16,640
 I was thinking about this,

906
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:20,420
 like what if we got ahead of sin?

907
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:26,760
 Like picture if Satan was a car salesman, okay?

908
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:31,440
 And he brings out sin before you.

909
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,680
 And instead of lying to you by only revealing the pleasure

910
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,080
 and concealing the consequence,

911
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:39,880
 he has to tell you everything you're paying for it.

912
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,080
 It would look something like this.

913
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,520
 Like, I thought this was so insane.

914
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,240
 I was, it's like, hey,

915
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,880
 for just the price of a future divorce,

916
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:50,720
 you can have all the hot steamy sex you want in your 20s.

917
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,760
 Sign up now.

918
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:57,200
 Hey, for just the price of your mental health,

919
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:01,280
 you can go try to climb the corporate ladder of success

920
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,720
 and sure you'll get more anxious every day

921
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,400
 and you'll have to keep climbing and climbing

922
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,680
 and climbing and striving and it'll never be enough,

923
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,520
 but come on, money.

924
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:16,960
 He's like, hey, for just the price of being chained to debt

925
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:22,440
 for the rest of your life, right now,

926
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:25,480
 you can get that new outfit.

927
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,200
 You can swipe the credit card.

928
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,720
 You can get the new car.

929
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,420
 You can live in downtown Dallas.

930
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:32,340
 You can do all these things.

931
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:39,080
 Like, what if Satan had to reveal the consequence?

932
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,000
 Would you do it?

933
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:47,280
 Think about that.

934
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,720
 Because sin is never free.

935
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,500
 Pleasure is never free.

936
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:55,500
 Doing things Satan's way and not God's way

937
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,560
 always comes at a price.

938
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:03,980
 So ask yourself, am I willing to pay what my sin cost me?

939
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:11,380
 Wrapping up, the beauty of this whole message,

940
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:14,580
 like this just, I was sitting alone in my room

941
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:17,380
 and just, I got chills when I was thinking about this.

942
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:19,580
 One of my favorite verses in the Bible,

943
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:24,020
 like, 'cause it really helps someone who has sat

944
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:27,180
 and chosen to follow sin over God time and time again.

945
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:29,100
 One of my favorite verses, it's a simple verse,

946
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:30,580
 but it's so profound.

947
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:32,780
 It's everything we believe here at The Porch.

948
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:35,060
 This isn't a place to come and make you feel shameful

949
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:36,580
 and guilty for your decisions.

950
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:38,100
 This is a place where we desire

951
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:40,280
 to let the Holy Spirit set people free.

952
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:47,140
 In Romans 5:8, it blows my mind every single time I read it.

953
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:53,740
 It says, "But God showed His great love for us

954
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:59,580
 by sending Christ, His one and only Son,

955
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:05,960
 to die for us while we were still sinners."

956
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:14,380
 While we were still in the car,

957
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:17,080
 letting Satan control our life,

958
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:20,300
 going further and further and further

959
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:22,740
 and choosing sin and not Him,

960
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:27,740
 while we were trapped in the prison

961
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:31,820
 of our own addiction and shame and guilt,

962
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:36,500
 while we were going and spending everything that we had

963
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:40,820
 for our own ability to have control and significance

964
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:44,220
 in everything the world had to offer except for God,

965
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:48,200
 that is when Jesus came.

966
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:53,500
 The Bible says that the blood of Jesus

967
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,660
 pays for every sin we commit,

968
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:57,260
 no matter how far you've gone,

969
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:58,940
 no matter how long you've been staying in it,

970
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:00,780
 no matter how much you've spent,

971
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:05,060
 every single sin, past, present, and future,

972
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:09,100
 He has wiped as far as the East is from the West.

973
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:13,320
 And as I was thinking about this message,

974
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,780
 I'm like, man, God, this is such a downer.

975
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:19,420
 Like this sin is just like, it's not fun.

976
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:21,340
 It's not fun to talk about sin.

977
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:24,380
 And this is what He said to me.

978
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:31,060
 Hey, JD, when you let your sin take you further

979
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:33,940
 than you ever wanted to go,

980
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:36,660
 that is when Jesus said yes to leaving heaven,

981
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:39,580
 leaving perfection, leaving His Father,

982
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:42,340
 leaving the throne, seated at the right hand of God,

983
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:45,280
 He chose to go further than He ever had to go.

984
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:48,660
 And He left heaven and He came down to earth.

985
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:52,140
 And He walked like you and talked like you

986
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:53,900
 and lived like a man.

987
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:55,900
 He was fully God and fully man.

988
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:59,780
 The only difference is He didn't sin.

989
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:01,260
 He didn't choose fun

990
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:05,780
 because He knew that you and I would choose fun over faith.

991
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:08,820
 So He didn't choose fun.

992
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:11,740
 He chose faith in God.

993
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:16,060
 And that faith, because He saw that, JD,

994
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:18,380
 you would stay in your sin

995
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:20,220
 longer than you ever thought you would.

996
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:21,860
 I'm gonna stay on this earth.

997
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:24,460
 He could have came down in a roaring fire,

998
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:26,420
 done everything He wanted to accomplish just like that,

999
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:27,700
 but He stayed on earth.

1000
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:29,900
 And He said, I wanna feel everything you're gonna feel.

1001
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:31,580
 I wanna be tempted in every way.

1002
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:35,420
 Guys, He was tempted, the Bible says, by Satan himself.

1003
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:37,740
 Yet He remained perfect for you and I.

1004
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:41,380
 And He stayed on earth

1005
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:43,140
 because He knew He'd stay in our sin.

1006
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:46,340
 Not only did He stay on earth, but because He was perfect,

1007
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:49,140
 that took Him and they led Him and they beat Him

1008
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:51,620
 and they mocked Him and they spat on Him.

1009
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:53,780
 And then they hung Him on the cross.

1010
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:56,420
 The Bible says like a sheep led to a slaughter.

1011
00:43:56,420 --> 00:44:02,980
 He hung there on the cross and He stayed there.

1012
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:06,260
 Wow, we stayed in our sin.

1013
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:07,860
 He stayed on the cross.

1014
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:12,700
 But the beauty is, is He stayed on the cross,

1015
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:14,660
 but He didn't stay in the grave.

1016
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:15,820
 He didn't stay in the grave.

1017
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:17,460
 Three days later, He rose up

1018
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:19,740
 because He knew that He had a mission

1019
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:22,700
 and that mission was set to take lost and found people

1020
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:24,660
 and make them lost and found people.

1021
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:27,140
 He wanted to say, come and find life in me,

1022
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:28,540
 experience life with me.

1023
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:30,100
 I don't care how far you've gone.

1024
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:31,540
 I don't care how long you stayed.

1025
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:34,620
 The worst thing that you have done, I will pay for it all.

1026
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:37,100
 Because He knew that our sin would take us so far

1027
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:39,500
 and that we would give everything we can to have it,

1028
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:42,500
 that we would have nothing to pay Him back.

1029
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:44,020
 Because the Bible says in Romans 6,

1030
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:47,340
 that the wages of our sin is death.

1031
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:53,500
 But the gift of God is eternal life through the death,

1032
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:56,360
 burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ, our Lord.

1033
00:44:56,360 --> 00:45:00,180
 So now He says, I know you spent it all for your sin,

1034
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:02,100
 but I paid it all for your sin.

1035
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:05,500
 When I rose from the grave, Jesus paid it all.

1036
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:08,060
 So now that lost people can be found people,

1037
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:10,500
 blind people can be seeing people.

1038
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:13,260
 There's nothing that you've done,

1039
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:15,420
 the blood of Jesus has not paid for.

1040
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:18,900
 There's no twisted thought you've had.

1041
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:21,580
 There's no action you've committed.

1042
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:24,220
 Anything that's been done to you that you're so ashamed of,

1043
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:26,820
 Jesus has paid for it all.

1044
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:29,260
 Your sin might've cost you everything,

1045
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:31,900
 but sin cost Him everything, His very life.

1046
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:33,300
 And He did it gladly.

1047
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:36,640
 He said, I didn't, you can't take my life.

1048
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,280
 I'm gladly laying it down.

1049
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:43,060
 And He died and He rose again

1050
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:44,660
 so that we didn't have to keep going

1051
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:46,040
 and listening to our sin.

1052
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:48,060
 We didn't have to keep searching for the next high.

1053
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:49,020
 We didn't have to keep living

1054
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:51,140
 for the momentary pleasures of this world.

1055
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:55,020
 We could find all that we need in Jesus.

1056
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:59,060
 But you gotta stop searching for fun

1057
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:00,740
 and start living for faith.

1058
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:04,060
 And some of you, the most faithful thing

1059
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:06,500
 that you can do tonight is believe what I'm telling you,

1060
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:10,140
 that your sin, sure, it might be fun right now,

1061
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:11,460
 but one day it won't be.

1062
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:14,780
 You're anxious, you're tired, you're exhausted.

1063
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:16,220
 It's time to give it up.

1064
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:19,380
 And I'm telling you, He's ready.

1065
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:21,420
 He paid it all so you could come tonight

1066
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:25,540
 and you could stop being a slave to sin

1067
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:28,260
 and a son and a daughter of the King of Kings

1068
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:29,640
 who's obsessed with you.

1069
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:33,380
 And you could come down tonight

1070
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:37,800
 and forsake fun and start living in faith

1071
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:40,860
 and begin a relationship with this Jesus.

1072
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:43,540
 Some of you, you don't need to come

1073
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:45,620
 to the porch next Tuesday.

1074
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:48,220
 You need to come to those doors next Monday

1075
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:50,940
 and be a part of what we call regeneration

1076
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:51,780
 here at Watermark.

1077
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:55,020
 It's a 12-month program designed to help people

1078
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:57,720
 be discipled to experience freedom in Christ,

1079
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:00,660
 not just people that experience with drugs and alcohol

1080
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:02,060
 and addictions and all those things.

1081
00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:03,820
 But I mean, if you struggle with searching

1082
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:05,940
 for your identity and things other than Christ,

1083
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:09,500
 if you struggle with pride, lying, gossip,

1084
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:12,940
 this place is designated to help you find freedom.

1085
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:16,400
 You can walk in any Monday and they are ready for you

1086
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,600
 right here at Watermark.

1087
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:20,120
 Some of you need to take the step

1088
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:23,020
 of going up to First Step tonight up in the loft

1089
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:25,020
 and saying yes to going deeper in your faith

1090
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:28,340
 and no more doing life on your own and living for yourself,

1091
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:30,460
 but going all in with people who don't wanna live

1092
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:33,340
 for the fun and the highs, but live in faith with Jesus

1093
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:35,820
 and lock arms with other brothers and sisters in Christ

1094
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:38,180
 and become a member here and join our family

1095
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:39,500
 in what God is doing here.

1096
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:44,080
 Some of you may be like, I don't even know,

1097
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:45,600
 I'm so deep in this stuff, man.

1098
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:47,180
 Like I don't even know what to do.

1099
00:47:47,180 --> 00:47:48,580
 And I would say this to you,

1100
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:53,620
 God is enough and he wants you tonight.

1101
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:58,120
 You just have to simply start and start simply,

1102
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:00,220
 whatever that looks like.

1103
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:03,700
 We're about to sing a song that just beautifully

1104
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:07,140
 just is like a prayer and a conversation

1105
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:10,300
 of the reality of someone who's been saved by grace

1106
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:11,500
 through faith in Jesus.

1107
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:13,320
 And you might just need to simply start

1108
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:15,700
 by opening up your hands tonight and saying,

1109
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:19,360
 Jesus, I don't want my sin anymore, I want you.

1110
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:24,120
 I don't know what it is for you,

1111
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:27,740
 but what I do know is that sin might be fun,

1112
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:29,020
 but it's not worth it.

1113
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:34,340
 But a life with Jesus, it'll change everything.

1114
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:35,260
 He's worth it.

1115
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:36,180
 You can trust him.

1116
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:37,000
 Let's pray.

1117
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:44,420
 God, thank you that you loved us so much

1118
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:46,100
 that while we were still sinners,

1119
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:48,500
 you came and you died for us.

1120
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:51,960
 You rescued us from the grip of sin in our life.

1121
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:58,580
 Thank you for being a God who can rewrite stories,

1122
00:48:58,580 --> 00:49:03,580
 who can take pain and evilness and bad decisions

1123
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:06,100
 and take our mess and make it a message

1124
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:08,780
 because of the blood of Jesus.

1125
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:10,600
 Thank you, Jesus, for going further

1126
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:11,980
 than you ever had to go,

1127
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:15,980
 for staying on the cross longer than you ever had to stay

1128
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:18,180
 and paying more than you ever had to pay

1129
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:20,580
 so that we could be free,

1130
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:22,460
 so that we could come here tonight

1131
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:26,440
 being children of God, not slaves to sin.

1132
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:32,220
 For the person tonight that needs you,

1133
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:34,060
 would you meet them?

1134
00:49:34,060 --> 00:49:36,300
 Would you show them that you're not afraid of them

1135
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:39,220
 and their sin, that you love them?

1136
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:42,380
 Thank you for coming to us exactly as we are.

1137
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:45,860
 Nothing more, nothing less.

1138
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:48,220
 May we respond accordingly in light of that.

1139
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:49,780
 In your name that I pray, amen.
