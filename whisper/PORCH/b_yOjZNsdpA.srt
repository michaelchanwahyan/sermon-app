1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
 (eerie music)

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:15,880
 - Porch, how we doing?

3
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:16,720
 Come on!

4
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,480
 Come on!

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,080
 Man, I'm pumped to be with you guys,

6
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,920
 pumped to be with you guys as we continue this series.

7
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,800
 If you're listening somewhere around the world,

8
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,560
 you're tuned in, you're at another campus

9
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,200
 in some other city, we're so glad you're with us

10
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,280
 this evening as well.

11
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,840
 Hey, who knows what this is?

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,040
 I heard it, I heard it, I heard one.

13
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:44,140
 I heard, I heard magic band.

14
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:47,560
 That's what that is, magic band!

15
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,700
 You're like, I still don't know what that is.

16
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:55,700
 This is how you get into Disney World, right there.

17
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,000
 Just got back.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,760
 It's not just how you get into Disney World,

19
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,520
 this is like your credit cards on here,

20
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,240
 it's how you buy things at Disney World,

21
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,100
 it's how you get in your hotel room at Disney World,

22
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,740
 it's how you get on rides at Disney World,

23
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:10,320
 your Fast Passes, this is the all-access pass

24
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,700
 to Disney World, and guess who just got to go?

25
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:16,120
 Yes, I did, and so I was there for a conference

26
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,920
 and I got to take somebody with me.

27
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,000
 So that meant I had to choose which child was my favorite.

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,700
 No, I'm kidding, but I took my daughter Finley with me

29
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,160
 and we just had this amazing time,

30
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:32,280
 this sweet daddy-daughter date to Disney World.

31
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,120
 And what that meant is I knew I was gonna go

32
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,640
 like six months ago, and so I told her, sat her down.

33
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,280
 Her birthday was around this time,

34
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,820
 and I just said, guess what?

35
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:44,880
 You're gonna go on a trip with daddy to Disney World.

36
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,800
 Like this is, and so every day for the past six months,

37
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,160
 she's come up, it's like, daddy, we're going to Disney World

38
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,480
 and what is it gonna be like and tell me about it,

39
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,320
 are we gonna do this, are we going there?

40
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,880
 And when she would be sad in the past six months,

41
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,340
 like something would happen, she'd be like,

42
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,240
 hey Finley, we're going to Disney World.

43
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,560
 You don't need to be sad, we're going to Disney World.

44
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,500
 Everything is going to be okay.

45
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,960
 And so she would start asking me these questions,

46
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,480
 come home every day and whatnot,

47
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,120
 and then sometime in that process,

48
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,220
 Disney's genius 'cause you start getting emails,

49
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,380
 hey, you need to choose your hotel,

50
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,720
 choose what parks you're gonna go to, choose your rides,

51
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,480
 and then you get this box in the mail, you open it up,

52
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,280
 there's the magic bands, and so it's just like

53
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,740
 this long six month celebration, and then we go,

54
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:31,000
 we fly out to Orlando and we're driving to the park,

55
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,760
 and as we get there, we see this sign,

56
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,920
 here's the, it's like the welcome to Disney World sign,

57
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,660
 and so, but from that sign, so we're in my truck,

58
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:41,160
 from that sign, you're still like five miles out,

59
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:45,240
 the property's so big, and so you drive to a parking lot,

60
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,360
 and then on that parking lot,

61
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,600
 you get on this like golf cart trolley thing,

62
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,820
 and so that takes you to this other place

63
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:55,480
 where you get on a monorail, that's cool,

64
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,800
 and then you take the monorail to this other gate

65
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,880
 where you walk about 27 more miles to another gate,

66
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:05,720
 and you get in the park, and so lots of anticipation

67
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,600
 to build up, and so with every change of vehicle,

68
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,600
 it's just like the anticipation, are we there,

69
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,160
 or is it gonna be, hey, are we there yet,

70
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,760
 okay, oh no, we gotta take this, okay, are we there,

71
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,600
 and the anticipation just keeps building

72
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,920
 and building and building, and I'm looking at my little girl

73
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,680
 and she is so excited about going to the magic kingdom,

74
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:29,160
 and I thought, why am I not that excited

75
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,660
 to get into God's kingdom?

76
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:35,380
 Like why do I not every single day,

77
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:38,160
 in the same way that she's been consumed with the thoughts,

78
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,300
 that she's going to the magic kingdom,

79
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:43,740
 this temporary place with some roller coasters,

80
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:47,660
 and I'm going to eternity with God in paradise

81
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,400
 where there's no pain, there was a lot,

82
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,520
 there's no crying, there was a lot of children crying

83
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,300
 in Disney World, in the magic kingdom,

84
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,240
 the happiest place on earth was not so happy,

85
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,720
 and I get to go to heaven with God,

86
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,060
 why am I not as excited as she is, what's wrong with me?

87
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:07,460
 In the same way that it could just make her feel better

88
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:10,420
 in a moment, why don't I find that much relief

89
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:13,060
 that I'm gonna be with God?

90
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:17,220
 And so we're in this series, the afterlife,

91
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:22,960
 and tonight I want to talk about a right response to heaven

92
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,660
 because sometimes I think there's things that we want here

93
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:29,540
 more than we want heaven, maybe you want a relationship

94
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:32,180
 more than you want heaven, maybe you want to get married

95
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:34,900
 more than you want heaven, maybe you want a job

96
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,900
 or success here or to build your life here

97
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,500
 more than you want heaven, some people say,

98
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,980
 they're like, yeah, I want to go to heaven,

99
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:45,500
 but not right now, to which I think is crazy,

100
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,420
 like if we truly understood it, and I'm like,

101
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:50,180
 no, I want to go right now, and I've even had conversations

102
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,660
 with guys where they're like, yeah, but J.P.,

103
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,460
 don't you want to walk your girls down the aisle first,

104
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,220
 you know, don't you want to see them walk down the aisle?

105
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,380
 I'm like, yeah, yes, I'd love to see my girls

106
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:01,460
 walk down the aisle, I'd rather be with Jesus, you know,

107
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:04,500
 like do I want to be at a wedding that I'm paying for

108
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,620
 or his wedding, you know, I mean, the wedding

109
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:10,940
 of the bridegroom, I'd rather be there,

110
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:13,900
 like I want to live with that anticipation,

111
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:16,980
 that affects, that impacts everything I do.

112
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:21,100
 I want to think about eternity like that,

113
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:24,340
 and I think if we really understood what it was,

114
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:28,940
 we would do that, and so just a quick review,

115
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,420
 we're in this series, The Afterlife,

116
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:34,140
 the first week we talked about hell out of Luke 16.

117
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:37,020
 We talked about how it was like eternal FOMO

118
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:40,140
 with severe pains, the worst thing imaginable,

119
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,380
 and then we talked about heaven two weeks ago.

120
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:44,660
 David talked about how heaven is the realization

121
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:47,620
 of everything you've ever wanted in this world,

122
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:50,300
 that that is just a really a yearning for heaven,

123
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,660
 and then Todd talked about living for eternity last week,

124
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:57,540
 and I want to talk about today a right response to heaven,

125
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,060
 that when we understand what it is,

126
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:03,340
 we leverage our resources, we want others there,

127
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,180
 and we will build the kingdom,

128
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,620
 we're committed to building the kingdom here,

129
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:07,740
 so those are the three things we're gonna cover.

130
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,300
 It's gonna be more topical in nature,

131
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,580
 but I want to give you this one verse

132
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:11,620
 out of Matthew to set it up.

133
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,740
 It's the words of Jesus,

134
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,420
 because he says this in Matthew 13.

135
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:17,460
 He says, "The kingdom of heaven is like,"

136
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,860
 now what's he gonna say?

137
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,820
 If you got that on a test,

138
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,580
 it was like the kingdom of heaven is like blank,

139
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,580
 and you had to fill in the blank,

140
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,900
 what would you say?

141
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:28,700
 What's Jesus, who's been there, right, eternity past,

142
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,340
 he's gonna tell us what heaven is like.

143
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:32,380
 Is he gonna say, "The kingdom of heaven is like

144
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,800
 "the most beautiful place you've ever seen.

145
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,140
 "The kingdom of heaven is like

146
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,260
 "an amazing, all-inclusive vacation.

147
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:39,840
 "The kingdom of heaven is like sex.

148
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,000
 "The kingdom of heaven is like some earthly pleasure.

149
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,400
 "The kingdom of heaven is like chocolate."

150
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,960
 What's he gonna say?

151
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,560
 Well, how would he fill in the blank?

152
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,700
 This is what he says.

153
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:50,280
 "The kingdom of heaven is like

154
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,360
 "a treasure hidden in a field.

155
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,920
 "When a man found it, he hid it again,

156
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,460
 "and then in his joy,

157
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,080
 "went and sold all that he had,

158
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,560
 "and he bought that field."

159
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,360
 That's a confusing answer to,

160
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,400
 what is the kingdom of heaven like?

161
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,240
 What's heaven like?

162
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,120
 Well, it's like a man who found a treasure chest

163
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,760
 in a field, and he goes and he sells everything

164
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,280
 that he has in his joy, and he goes and he buys that field.

165
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,200
 I'm confused.

166
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,400
 Jesus, when he tells us what heaven is like,

167
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,460
 he's like, "There's no words to describe heaven.

168
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:25,880
 "Let me just explain your response to heaven,

169
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,340
 "that if you really understood what heaven was like,

170
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:31,480
 "you'd do anything you could to get there.

171
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,400
 "You would lose everything in this world

172
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,580
 "for the sake of getting there.

173
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:40,560
 "You would want to get there at all costs."

174
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,840
 I like this analogy because

175
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:49,080
 I understand real estate investing.

176
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,520
 Dallas is not a pretty place.

177
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,200
 Lots of pretty people, but we've got no ocean,

178
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,180
 we've got no mountains, and so we just kind of

179
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:00,120
 invest in businesses and property,

180
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,160
 and real estate is the big thing here.

181
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,960
 And so, as you think about real estate investing,

182
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,440
 I read this article this past week.

183
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,520
 This is really the metaphor Jesus is giving us.

184
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,880
 It's like, "Hey, heaven is this place

185
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:15,120
 "that if you could buy it, you would take great joy

186
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,160
 "to doing whatever you could to buy it."

187
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,280
 There was an island, the most eastern island of Japan,

188
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,320
 it's called Marcus Island.

189
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,400
 I saw it in the news this week.

190
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,060
 Anybody see this?

191
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,800
 Here's a picture of it.

192
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,480
 It's only one square kilometer.

193
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,120
 It's a rather small island.

194
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:35,120
 About 350 acres there, Marcus Island.

195
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,960
 And so maybe you could have bought that a couple weeks ago,

196
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,940
 maybe for a million dollars, if you had a million dollars.

197
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:43,600
 You could maybe buy that piece of land for a million dollars.

198
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:47,880
 But last week, they found out that there are

199
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:52,880
 500 billion dollars of natural elements on that island.

200
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:59,720
 500 billion dollars of natural resources.

201
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:03,000
 Natural resources on that island.

202
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,120
 Here's what that means.

203
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,720
 That if you could have bought it for a million dollars,

204
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,900
 you'd now be the wealthiest person

205
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,080
 on the planet Earth by five times.

206
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,820
 Bill Gates is worth about 90 billion.

207
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,380
 You'd be worth 500 billion.

208
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:21,360
 And so if you could buy that island,

209
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,640
 even though you don't have a million dollars,

210
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,800
 you would go beg, borrow, and steal,

211
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,080
 and do everything you can to get there.

212
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,320
 And Jesus says, "This is what heaven's like."

213
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,920
 Let me talk about your response to it.

214
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,520
 And so the first thing that I want to bring

215
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:39,560
 to your attention is a right response to heaven.

216
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,680
 You would leverage your resources.

217
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,960
 You would leverage your resources.

218
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,020
 What do I mean by resources?

219
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:48,480
 I mean your time, your talents, your treasures,

220
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,680
 your money, the things you know,

221
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,520
 relationships that you have,

222
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,920
 and stuff that you've purchased.

223
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,600
 You would leverage it all for the sake of the kingdom.

224
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,840
 Right?

225
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:03,900
 Jesus says this in Matthew 6, verse 19.

226
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:07,400
 "Do not store up for yourselves treasures on Earth."

227
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,700
 What if I just stop there?

228
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:16,000
 What if we just took that command at face value?

229
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:22,680
 "Don't store up for yourselves treasures on Earth."

230
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:27,800
 Wonder what that means.

231
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,400
 I don't think it's complicated.

232
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,640
 "Do not store up for yourselves treasures on Earth,

233
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,160
 "where moths and vermin destroy,

234
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,840
 "and where thieves break in and steal.

235
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,080
 "But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven

236
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,960
 "where moths and vermin do not destroy,

237
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,880
 "and where thieves do not break in and steal.

238
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,440
 "For where your treasure is,

239
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,920
 "there your heart will be also."

240
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:53,320
 My friend was visiting England.

241
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,400
 This was a while ago,

242
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,640
 and he brought back 100 English pounds.

243
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,840
 Worth about 100 American dollars at the time,

244
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,880
 and he did so because he wanted

245
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,800
 to kind of play the exchange rate.

246
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,560
 And several years go by,

247
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:10,560
 and that 100 English pounds became worth 180 American.

248
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,340
 That's an 80% return on his money.

249
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,360
 So his friends were laughing at him

250
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,280
 when he brought the 100 English pounds back,

251
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,600
 but now he's laughing at them

252
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,520
 because he's made an 80% return on his investment.

253
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,640
 So he goes, he's going back over there overseas,

254
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,640
 and so he's gonna take it with him to get his money back.

255
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,200
 And he goes in the drawer,

256
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:33,200
 and literally the bills had been eaten by moths, literally.

257
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,480
 And so I reached out to him last night,

258
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,340
 and I just said, "Hey, can I tell this story?

259
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,180
 "Is that true?"

260
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,480
 And he said, "Yeah, let me go in the drawer

261
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,960
 "and see what I can collect for you."

262
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:44,960
 Here is pictures of what he had left in his drawer

263
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,620
 of 100 English pounds.

264
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:49,000
 It literally was eaten by moths.

265
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,120
 I mean, can you live more the words of Jesus?

266
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,200
 And I think we think, hey, we're gonna save our money

267
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:02,540
 for a rainy day, or we're going to buy things that we want,

268
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:05,560
 shoes and bags and trinkets and treasures.

269
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,720
 And some of you are like, man,

270
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,680
 I don't have anything to invest.

271
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,880
 I've just got like $100,000 in student loans.

272
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:16,400
 And to you, I would say, right,

273
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,060
 but what's your plan to get to a place

274
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,040
 where you can be generous?

275
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,600
 'Cause right now you're a slave to the borrower.

276
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,440
 How are you moving toward,

277
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,840
 what's your plan to get to a place

278
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,920
 where you can begin to invest in eternity?

279
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,160
 And some of you, you're like,

280
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,120
 yeah, I've got a bunch of student loans,

281
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,380
 but I also got an iPhone.

282
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:37,620
 Oh.

283
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:40,320
 Wow.

284
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,740
 You know, how many shoes are in your closet?

285
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:47,240
 How many bags do you have?

286
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,640
 What do you drive?

287
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,680
 Why that car?

288
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,440
 What are you trying to tell the world about you?

289
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,480
 I'm the most generous person that's ever lived.

290
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,800
 I believe in another world.

291
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,640
 I believe I'm here temporarily,

292
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:04,520
 and God is gonna take me somewhere forever,

293
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:09,280
 or I'm someone who has accessorized my life.

294
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:14,820
 I understand this.

295
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:18,340
 I want you to know it's never gonna get easier.

296
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,680
 The way that you spend now is how you're gonna spend later.

297
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,880
 The way that you save now is how you're gonna save later,

298
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,160
 and the way you invest now

299
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,960
 is how you're going to invest later.

300
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:32,120
 And I am like a master at justifying saving money.

301
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,720
 I'm really, really good at it,

302
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,800
 because I can think about,

303
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,240
 like, I've got three kids now.

304
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,020
 You know, wow, like, they showed up on the scene,

305
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,760
 these three, like, three, I can just think,

306
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,680
 hey, college, for each of them,

307
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,360
 there's gonna be like 100 grand each,

308
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,640
 so that means that I at least need to be,

309
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,120
 have 300 grand in the bank.

310
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,040
 Like, that's gonna take me forever to save that,

311
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,920
 and certainly that's a responsible dad,

312
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:55,760
 because I've got three kids,

313
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,640
 and they gotta go to college,

314
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,160
 and I don't want them to have student loans.

315
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,800
 I can easily justify that, right?

316
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,280
 And then I can think of retirement.

317
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,440
 I'm not always gonna be able to work.

318
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,480
 Like, what if something happens to me,

319
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,600
 and I can't work, and I become,

320
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,640
 get to retirement age,

321
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,280
 and then I'm gonna have to have something to live on

322
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,600
 so that my kids don't have to support me,

323
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,060
 so I can justify it that way.

324
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,800
 And then there's this thing called an emergency fund.

325
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:20,280
 I should have six months salary in the bank,

326
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,440
 and so I can get to hundreds, and hundreds,

327
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,280
 and hundreds of thousands of dollars

328
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,880
 that I need to have in the bank

329
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,600
 just because I'm a good Christ follower.

330
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,240
 I can justify it.

331
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,480
 Can I ask you a question?

332
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,400
 Under the banner of that emergency fund,

333
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,840
 whose emergency?

334
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:42,440
 Whose emergency am I saving for?

335
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,620
 Are there not emergencies all around me?

336
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:53,160
 Are there not people with needs all around me,

337
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,340
 and yet they have nothing, and I have,

338
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:57,340
 and I'm saving 'cause I've got these,

339
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:01,720
 I'm hoarding God's resources at Wells Fargo, right?

340
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,680
 Like, and people all around me have needs.

341
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,520
 I'll just give you some.

342
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:10,160
 Like, 7.6 million people die every year from malnutrition.

343
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,120
 That's 21,000 brothers and sisters,

344
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,960
 God's children died today, 21,000.

345
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,800
 Why?

346
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,880
 Because they didn't have food to eat.

347
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:23,720
 I've got an emergency fund just in case I get in a bind.

348
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:28,840
 Just in case I get in some trouble.

349
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:32,020
 UNICEF said that 1.2 million children

350
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,940
 are trafficked every year.

351
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:35,220
 Is that an emergency?

352
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:42,000
 1.2 million children sold for labor forces.

353
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,280
 Or raped for profit.

354
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:51,960
 But I might have an emergency.

355
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:56,920
 Not to mention that there are about 60 million abortions

356
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,920
 worldwide every year, 60 million.

357
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,760
 Those numbers are like made up.

358
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:05,600
 They're like fantasy numbers, 60 million.

359
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,640
 Children dying.

360
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,640
 Maybe there's an emergency, like sirens going off.

361
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,120
 Like maybe followers of Jesus should be like,

362
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,960
 okay man, I'm just gonna start living my life.

363
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,720
 Like I'm gonna go home and be with God forever

364
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,800
 and start having a lot of fun meeting the needs

365
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:27,040
 around me in the name of Jesus Christ.

366
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,800
 Can't go on with closets full of shoes

367
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,040
 and our brothers and sisters go shoeless.

368
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,040
 Investing in bags and in clothes.

369
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:39,160
 Shoeless, investing in bags and in guns

370
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:42,280
 and in hobbies and vehicles and clothes and toys.

371
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:46,820
 And missed out on what I call the adventure of generosity.

372
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,440
 That's what you're missing out on.

373
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:52,480
 The fun of giving away God's money.

374
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,960
 Holding it like this.

375
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:57,360
 After that first day in the magic kingdom

376
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,200
 with my daughter Finley, we were coming back.

377
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,920
 It was about 9 p.m., it was after her bedtime.

378
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,000
 But we hadn't eaten dinner yet.

379
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,240
 I know, dad of the year.

380
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:07,200
 And so I asked her, I'm like, where do you wanna eat?

381
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,920
 And we passed a waffle house.

382
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,440
 And the word waffle got her.

383
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,600
 And so she's like, I'd like to eat there.

384
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,560
 They serve waffles.

385
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:16,960
 And so I U-turn and we go back to the waffle house.

386
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,160
 And I had never been to one.

387
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,040
 And we sat down and it was a wonderful, delightful place.

388
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,320
 [congregation laughing]

389
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,160
 And the lady, you know, the server,

390
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,600
 the waitress, Evelyn, comes over and she sits down.

391
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,640
 I mean, not sits down, she didn't sit down.

392
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,560
 But she stood up.

393
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:37,040
 And she was kind and we had dialogue with her.

394
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,000
 And I was praying for the meal.

395
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,960
 And she brought our food and she stood there

396
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,800
 and prayed with us.

397
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,720
 And I said, amen, and she said, amen.

398
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,160
 And I got to talk to Evelyn about her faith.

399
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,240
 And then it came time to pay, you know.

400
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,920
 And our bill was like $11.

401
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,480
 Waffle house is the bargain of the century.

402
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,480
 And I go to the counter.

403
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,560
 And there's two other women behind the counter.

404
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:01,000
 One of them's kind of jail tattoos all up her arms.

405
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,360
 Had a rough life and I got to engage her.

406
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,840
 And we got to talk about the gospel.

407
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,520
 And I'm sitting there with Finley.

408
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,720
 And she's like, daddy, are you ready to go?

409
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,560
 And I look at Finley, I'm like,

410
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,380
 hey, you wanna have some fun?

411
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,480
 And she's like, yeah, I always wanna have fun.

412
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,960
 We're going back to Disney World, what are we doing?

413
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,840
 And I'm like, watch this.

414
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,480
 And so I go and I write down on the tip,

415
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,520
 I write down $100.

416
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,440
 And I write down, Jesus loves you.

417
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,660
 And we get to, and I just like, okay, come on, let's go.

418
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:23,880
 And leave it on the counter.

419
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,840
 And we're leaving.

420
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:28,280
 But as we leave, Finley turns around.

421
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:31,560
 And she's like, oh, daddy, you should have seen her face.

422
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,000
 You should have seen her face.

423
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 Like, and she kept like making the face.

424
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,600
 She goes, daddy, she goes like this.

425
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,240
 And then she, and I was like, oh, that's awesome.

426
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,760
 Daddy, you should have seen her face.

427
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,480
 She just kept saying that over and over.

428
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,960
 It was funny 'cause I learned something about my daughter

429
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,360
 'cause she didn't know how this tipping thing works

430
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,200
 since we got in the car.

431
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,440
 And she's like, so what is that?

432
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,840
 Like, you're just telling her how good.

433
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,180
 And I was like, well, no, that's money.

434
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,020
 She's like, whose money?

435
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:52,840
 I'm like, our money.

436
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,600
 She's like, our money, where are we gonna get that money?

437
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,440
 I don't know.

438
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,400
 (congregation laughing)

439
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,000
 We'll borrow it from David or something, I don't know.

440
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 (congregation laughing)

441
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,880
 And here's the crazy thing.

442
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,280
 She comes home, she returns back to Dallas

443
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,920
 to see my wife, her mom, Monica,

444
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,400
 and her siblings, Weston and Presley.

445
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:15,600
 And they're like, Finley, how was Disney World?

446
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,480
 And she's like, guys, you should have seen this lady's face.

447
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,760
 (congregation laughing)

448
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,600
 That's what she wanted.

449
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:24,120
 The flight of the Avatar, you know, Animal Kingdom.

450
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,160
 Do you see the animals?

451
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,480
 You go on the ride, you meet the princess of the parade.

452
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,760
 Guys, you should have seen this lady's face.

453
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,200
 We got to tip her $100.

454
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,120
 (congregation laughing)

455
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,340
 And it was so much fun as an adventure.

456
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,640
 What do I do?

457
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,520
 JP, what are you asking me to do?

458
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,360
 Here's what I'm asking you to do.

459
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,200
 You ready?

460
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,020
 I'm gonna make it as clear as I can.

461
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:44,620
 Do something with your resources

462
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:47,440
 that would be completely irresponsible

463
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,680
 if there was no heaven.

464
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:51,760
 Do that.

465
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,960
 And do that today.

466
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,000
 And do that tomorrow.

467
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,560
 And do that the next day.

468
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:00,320
 Until you wake up there

469
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,960
 and you get to enjoy those investments forever

470
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:07,600
 and ever and ever and ever.

471
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:11,080
 And the reason we shared with those ladies

472
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:14,540
 is because we want them there with us.

473
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,360
 And that's the second thing,

474
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,000
 when you have a right response to heaven,

475
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,200
 you want others there with you.

476
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,040
 That's my second point.

477
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,800
 You want others there with you.

478
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,120
 Let me read you from the scriptures.

479
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,760
 Philippians chapter one, verses 21 through 24.

480
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:31,320
 Paul says, "For to me, to live is Christ

481
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,900
 "and to die is gain.

482
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,780
 "If I'm going to go on living in the body,

483
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:36,540
 "this will mean fruitful labor for me.

484
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,740
 "Yet what shall I choose?

485
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,000
 "I don't know.

486
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,280
 "I'm torn between the two.

487
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,840
 "I desire to depart and be with Christ,

488
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,800
 "which is better by far,

489
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,820
 "but it is more necessary for you

490
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,160
 "that I remain in the body."

491
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,580
 Here you have Paul saying,

492
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,200
 "I want heaven, but not yet."

493
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:54,160
 But not because he wants to go visit Thailand or Hawaii

494
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,640
 or he wants to get married or experience sex.

495
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,920
 He's saying, "Hey, I don't want to go to heaven yet

496
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,920
 "because I don't want you to go to hell.

497
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,260
 "I don't want to go to heaven yet

498
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:06,720
 "because I'm going to stay here in fruitful labor,

499
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,280
 "ministering according to the gospel

500
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,600
 "so that others can be there with me."

501
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,640
 He says this in his letter to the Corinthians,

502
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,260
 first Corinthians chapter nine,

503
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,760
 "To the weak I became weak.

504
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,160
 "To win the weak, I have become all things

505
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,700
 "to all people so that by all possible means,

506
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:25,360
 "I might save some."

507
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,640
 If you can go to Disney World

508
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:31,800
 and you can invite someone with you, that's a good day.

509
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,960
 Like for me to get to know

510
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,000
 that I'm going to sit my children down

511
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,960
 and I'm going to, to one of them, I can say,

512
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,840
 "Hey, you get to go with me."

513
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,080
 That's a good day.

514
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,800
 Like who doesn't want to go to the magic kingdom?

515
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,440
 And likewise, you have an invitation

516
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,200
 far better than the magic kingdom.

517
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,520
 Why don't you use it?

518
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,760
 When did you stop believing it was good?

519
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,960
 When did you stop believing

520
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,980
 that the good news was actually good news?

521
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,520
 That you can go to someone and say,

522
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,720
 "Hey, do you want to go and be with God

523
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,040
 "forever in paradise with me?"

524
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,860
 And you can invite them.

525
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:10,440
 And you can do it all the time.

526
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,120
 It's free to invite people.

527
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:15,480
 And you think, "But they're going to think I'm crazy."

528
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,840
 No, they're going to know you're right.

529
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:22,840
 One day, one day, they're going to know you were right.

530
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,940
 Even if they think you're crazy,

531
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:27,200
 every knee is going to bow

532
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,360
 and every tongue is going to confess.

533
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,840
 So you can share with the confidence,

534
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,920
 with your coworker and with that family member

535
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:37,080
 and with that neighbor and that guy across the hallway

536
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,860
 and that one that you play softball with.

537
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:44,640
 You say, "Hey, I want to invite you somewhere."

538
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,000
 Where? Heaven.

539
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,320
 Yo, bro, what do you mean?

540
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:52,760
 No, no, no, not like that.

541
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,340
 I mean, one day.

542
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:57,740
 Can we talk about Jesus?

543
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:02,460
 And it's the same, it's more fun.

544
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:07,640
 It's more fun than looking your third grader in the eyes

545
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:10,640
 and saying, "You want to go to Disney World with Daddy?"

546
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,540
 It's more fun.

547
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:14,040
 It's far better.

548
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:17,240
 And you're going to see some fruit.

549
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,320
 Most likely, you're going to see some return

550
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,560
 on that investment.

551
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:27,160
 What would you do to get everyone you love to heaven?

552
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:31,120
 See, I think we're like, "Yeah, but man,

553
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,320
 "I don't have the gift of evangelism."

554
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:36,840
 I'd encourage you to read this book,

555
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:39,040
 you know, because it doesn't just say like,

556
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:43,400
 "Hey, share if you have the gift of evangelism."

557
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,640
 Like, it's not like, "Hey, if you're gifted in evangelism,

558
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,680
 "those are the people I want to share in the gospel

559
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,520
 "and no one else."

560
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,720
 That's not what the book says.

561
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,400
 It makes it much more like, "Hey, anyone who is going

562
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,320
 "to heaven is constantly inviting others there too."

563
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,000
 That you're bringing them in.

564
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,800
 Like, it's like if I see you standing in the road

565
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,400
 and there's a car headed for you,

566
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,840
 and I'm going to push you out of the way to save your life,

567
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:14,480
 but I'm like, "I don't really have the gift of saving lives.

568
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,840
 "It's not really where I'm gifted."

569
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,840
 You know, and so I would watch you die

570
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,560
 because that's not my gifting.

571
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:24,800
 I don't have to have the gift of saving lives.

572
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,500
 I just have to believe you're going to be hit by a car

573
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:30,040
 if I don't push you out of the way.

574
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:33,840
 And all you have to believe is that they might go to hell

575
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,460
 if God hasn't chosen to use you to save them.

576
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:38,960
 And you can share with them,

577
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,800
 with the confidence that they're knowing.

578
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,960
 Hell is a motivator.

579
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,780
 It's a real thing.

580
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:47,600
 It's a real motivator for us in evangelism.

581
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,220
 And I'm okay with that.

582
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:51,060
 We talked about hell the other day,

583
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:53,460
 how it's like eternal FOMO with pain.

584
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:55,600
 In Luke 16, the rich man sees Lazarus

585
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,320
 and he sees that Lazarus is in heaven

586
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,620
 and he wants to be there.

587
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,620
 And he's like, "Hey, go tell my family."

588
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:05,280
 And I forgot about a story

589
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,440
 that I should have shared that night,

590
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,280
 but I'm gonna share it right now.

591
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,240
 See, I've actually been to Disney World before.

592
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,800
 I went in the fifth grade.

593
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:15,280
 The church group that I was going to,

594
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,480
 they went to Disney World.

595
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,000
 So I had never been out of Texas.

596
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,080
 This is my first time out of Texas.

597
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:22,000
 We got on a bus and we're going to Disney World.

598
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,700
 Amazing for a fifth grader.

599
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,920
 And we get there and I'm standing in line

600
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,840
 for a roller coaster

601
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,760
 and something terrible happened in my stomach.

602
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,320
 I can't explain it, but I mean,

603
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:34,380
 the worst pain that you could ever imagine right here.

604
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,680
 And I doubled over.

605
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:38,040
 In fact, I collapsed on the ground

606
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,800
 and I'm in the fetal position

607
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,680
 in the middle of Disney World.

608
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,120
 It's okay to laugh.

609
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,080
 And so they come in, you ready?

610
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,560
 This is where it gets kind of crazy.

611
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:50,240
 They come in with a stretcher in Disney World

612
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,000
 and they take me out.

613
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,560
 And not out of the park.

614
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,440
 See, they've got a hospital in Disney World.

615
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,120
 I know, I've seen it with my own eyes.

616
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,240
 It's under the ground.

617
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,120
 I'm serious right now.

618
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,760
 I'm not making this up.

619
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,960
 You're underground.

620
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,960
 I'm in this hospital bed in Disney World,

621
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,200
 in Mickey's place, in the Magic Kingdom,

622
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,880
 and I'm looking out the window

623
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,480
 and I can hear the laughter of children

624
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,400
 and I can hear the rides and the screams of excitement

625
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:18,280
 while I'm screaming in pain in Disney World.

626
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,680
 I can't enjoy it.

627
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,800
 I'm hurt there.

628
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,800
 Hell is way worse than that forever.

629
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,420
 Don't let anyone go there.

630
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:29,440
 Do whatever you can.

631
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,940
 Say whatever you can.

632
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:35,680
 Go wherever you need to

633
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,240
 so that they don't go there.

634
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,120
 And we share with them.

635
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:47,780
 And so I say that because they're gonna see you in heaven.

636
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:52,320
 You know, that's what Luke 16, it paints this picture

637
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,480
 where it's like they're gonna know

638
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:56,280
 and they're gonna be like, why didn't you tell me?

639
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,840
 Or they're gonna be like, man, I'm so,

640
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,400
 I wish I would've listened.

641
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,680
 I wish I would've listened.

642
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:07,000
 I was in the gym two weeks ago

643
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,800
 and I met a guy named Pablo.

644
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:12,000
 He had just moved here from Puerto Rico.

645
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,760
 And Pablo's a big, kinda scary guy.

646
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,160
 Again, tatted up and he's no stranger to the gym.

647
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,200
 Dude was yoked and we're talking.

648
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,520
 And I was like, what did you eat for breakfast?

649
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,560
 But dude, and so we're talking

650
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:29,400
 and I'm asking him about a faith, his faith,

651
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,600
 and I use the Kennedy questions when I share the gospel.

652
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,640
 I say, between one and 10,

653
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,280
 10 being certain, one being not so sure.

654
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,600
 If you were to die today, how certain are you

655
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,600
 that you'd go to heaven?

656
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,560
 And he said a two.

657
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:42,220
 and I said, "Well, why a two?"

658
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:44,440
 And he said, "Man, I've just done some things, bro.

659
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,140
 "I've just done some things."

660
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,760
 And I always think, when I ever hear,

661
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,860
 when somebody looks at the terrible things they've done,

662
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,700
 I always think about the Apostle Paul,

663
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:52,540
 who's killed people,

664
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:53,860
 and so what I always do in response to that,

665
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:55,600
 I'm like, "Hey, let me ask you a question.

666
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,860
 "How many people have you killed?"

667
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,620
 And to which he's like.

668
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:01,860
 (congregation laughing)

669
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:02,840
 I'm like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

670
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:03,760
 "Hold on, hold on, hold on!

671
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,160
 "No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

672
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,260
 "Okay, stop, stop, don't count.

673
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,100
 "Okay, hold on.

674
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,060
 "How many women and children?"

675
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,580
 And I'm like, "Oh, that backfired."

676
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,020
 And so, "Okay, you're a bad guy.

677
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:14,360
 "You've done some things.

678
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,720
 "Wow, okay, okay, all right.

679
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,020
 "Let me rethink this, let me rethink this."

680
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:23,400
 And I start to talk about Jesus's payment,

681
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,680
 and that's how we get in.

682
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,720
 It's Jesus's payment.

683
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:31,660
 And so, as I'm sharing the gospel with him,

684
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:35,200
 he's like, this is what he says,

685
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,880
 he goes, "That's amazing."

686
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,900
 I'm like, "Jesus paid."

687
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:43,460
 See, if Jesus paid your way to get in,

688
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:47,320
 then the only thing you can do in hell is pay for your sins.

689
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,700
 If Jesus paid for your sins,

690
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,260
 then you can't pay for your sins.

691
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:53,100
 You can be a 10 because Jesus paid for your sins.

692
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:58,100
 He's like, he goes, "JP, that's amazing, that's amazing."

693
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,500
 I was like, "Awesome."

694
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:03,140
 So I left there like, dude, I'm the best evangelist ever.

695
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:07,280
 And I went back, I went back last week,

696
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,440
 and I saw Pablo.

697
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,360
 Pablo, what's up, man?

698
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,080
 Hey, let me ask you a question, bro.

699
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,560
 Between one and 10, 10 being certain,

700
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,880
 one being not so sure, if you died today,

701
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,720
 how certain are you that you'd go to heaven?

702
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:20,920
 He said, "Mm, I think I'd be a two."

703
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:23,480
 Pablo, what?

704
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:26,400
 I'm like, what's up, man?

705
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,840
 And he goes, I said, "Why?"

706
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,600
 I said, "Let me ask you a question, why a two?"

707
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,280
 He said, "Man, I've just done some things, man.

708
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,040
 "I've done some things.

709
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:33,880
 "I've done some things."

710
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,580
 I said, "I know you've done some things, Pablo,

711
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,760
 "but Jesus paid for those things.

712
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,700
 "That's what I need you to do.

713
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:41,000
 "I need you to understand, Jesus paid for those things,

714
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,040
 "so you can't pay for those things.

715
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,440
 "The only thing you can do in hell is pay for those things,

716
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,100
 "but Jesus already paid for those things."

717
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,580
 Pablo, let me tell you a story, man.

718
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,460
 The other day I was getting my hair cut.

719
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:51,900
 I was getting my hair cut, I was at the barber shop,

720
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:55,700
 I was getting faded up, and he was done, and I paid him.

721
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,260
 I paid him, and then I walked out.

722
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:59,780
 And as I walked out, someone was walking in.

723
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:01,860
 And it was a porchy, it was somebody that goes to the porch.

724
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,800
 We're walking in, and they go to the barber,

725
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,220
 and they say, "Hey, let me ask you a question.

726
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,340
 "Was that JP?"

727
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:08,300
 And the guy's like, "Yeah, yeah, his name was JP."

728
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:11,460
 And they said, "Oh, I wanna pay for his haircut."

729
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:14,060
 I said, "Pablo, what do you think the barber said?"

730
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:19,740
 And he said, "He probably said it was paid for."

731
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:21,980
 And what if that guy said,

732
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:23,300
 "No, but I wanna pay for his haircut."

733
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:25,300
 I'm sorry, it's already been paid for.

734
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:28,460
 You can't pay for something that's already been paid for.

735
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,300
 What are you gonna do in hell?

736
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:34,500
 It's already been paid for, Pablo.

737
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,700
 It's already been paid for, friend.

738
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:40,500
 You get to leave this place and tell people

739
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:43,200
 that their sins have been paid for.

740
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,820
 Everything they've done wrong has been paid for.

741
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:51,820
 That's amazing, great, fantastic, incredible, good news.

742
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:54,400
 Leave here and tell them that.

743
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,240
 Who do I tell?

744
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,740
 Everyone, tell everyone that.

745
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:59,860
 Everyone you can, everyone you talk to,

746
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:00,820
 everyone you see.

747
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:02,060
 You just want me to tell everyone?

748
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,380
 Why not?

749
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:05,140
 Go to heaven and let God be like,

750
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:07,620
 "Hey, you were a little overzealous down there.

751
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:10,500
 You didn't have to tell everybody."

752
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:13,080
 I mean, that would be the best correction ever,

753
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,620
 but I don't think it's gonna happen.

754
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:17,180
 You know what I think he's gonna say?

755
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:18,980
 I bet a hunch he's gonna look you in the eyes.

756
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:19,860
 He's gonna say, "Hey, well done,

757
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:22,420
 good and faithful servant, you got it.

758
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:23,860
 You knew this place was real.

759
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:27,820
 You lived like this place was real.

760
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:32,020
 It's almost like you believed you were gonna come here.

761
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:33,120
 It's almost like you believed

762
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,780
 that I paid for you to get here."

763
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:38,380
 And so we're ambassadors of Jesus's kingdom.

764
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:41,140
 We're representatives, the scripture calls us,

765
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:43,060
 of that kingdom here in this world.

766
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:47,840
 The third thing that you do

767
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,420
 when you have a right response to heaven

768
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:51,820
 is you build the kingdom.

769
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:57,420
 Like you begin literally, literally,

770
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:58,780
 like this is why you're like,

771
00:31:58,780 --> 00:31:59,620
 "Why am I alive?

772
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:00,860
 Why am I here?"

773
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:04,100
 You get to bring heaven here.

774
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:06,620
 You get to display it in your life

775
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:09,380
 as an ambassador from that place in this place.

776
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:12,860
 You get to display it through your good deeds

777
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:15,180
 done in the name of Jesus Christ,

778
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:16,020
 through your sharing.

779
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:16,900
 Let me read a scripture to you.

780
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:19,340
 It's 1 Corinthians 3, verse 10 through 15.

781
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:21,820
 "By the grace God has given me,

782
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:24,460
 I laid a foundation as a wise builder

783
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:26,540
 and someone else is building on it.

784
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:28,500
 But each one should build with care

785
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,600
 for no one can lay any foundation

786
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,740
 other than the one already laid,

787
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:34,540
 which is Jesus Christ.

788
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:36,260
 If anyone builds on this foundation

789
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:38,380
 using gold, silver, costly stones,

790
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:39,980
 wood, hay, or straw,

791
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:43,260
 their work will be shown for what it is

792
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:45,840
 because the day will bring it to light.

793
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,740
 It will be revealed with fire

794
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:51,460
 and the fire will test the quality of each person's work.

795
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:53,120
 If what has been built survives,

796
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,900
 the builder will receive a reward.

797
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:55,960
 If it is burned up,

798
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,700
 the builder will suffer loss,

799
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,260
 but yet will be saved

800
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:03,700
 even though only as one escaping through the flames.

801
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:08,700
 One day, all of our investments and expenditures

802
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:12,100
 and use of times will be seen for what they are,

803
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:15,420
 either earthly investments or eternal investments.

804
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:17,660
 They will be things that we get to enjoy forever

805
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:19,180
 in eternity with God,

806
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,780
 or they will be things that are burned up

807
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:22,920
 as God destroys the world by fire.

808
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:28,280
 And the things that you've done in the name of Jesus

809
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,800
 as representations, as evidence of your faith,

810
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:34,080
 you living out your faith will last forever.

811
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,280
 And you will get to enjoy those things forever.

812
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:39,900
 You get to display the kingdom here.

813
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:42,720
 Let me explain it like this

814
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,480
 because so you remember that God destroyed the earth

815
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,500
 one day by what?

816
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,320
 Remember in the past?

817
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,920
 By water, by a flood.

818
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,560
 It was in the day of Noah.

819
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,920
 And remember there was this crazy man who built an ark

820
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,920
 and everyone thought that he was crazy.

821
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:59,100
 He's building an ark, it's never rained.

822
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,520
 Most likely it had never rained.

823
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:03,000
 He's building a giant boat in the middle of nowhere.

824
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,880
 And everyone thinks he's a madman.

825
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,240
 And he gets to invite people on that boat,

826
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:10,400
 specifically God's chosen people, his family.

827
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:14,080
 And God's wrath comes down in the form of water.

828
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:17,400
 And everyone on that boat, which Noah built,

829
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:20,760
 they were lifted up and preserved.

830
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,940
 And then when God's wrath was finished,

831
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:26,040
 they were set back down and they existed.

832
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:30,840
 What he had built in the name of God lasted.

833
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,480
 And in the same way,

834
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,040
 and I can't explain exactly how this is gonna happen,

835
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,480
 the things that you do here in Jesus' name,

836
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:40,840
 God's wrath is gonna come down in the form of fire now.

837
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,520
 Your works are gonna be lifted up.

838
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,960
 People that you've shared the gospel with will be preserved

839
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,120
 or who have trusted in the gospel will be preserved.

840
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,240
 The good things that you've done in Jesus' name,

841
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,440
 they will be preserved.

842
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,940
 And then they'll be set back down.

843
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,980
 And then Jesus, King Jesus will come back

844
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:56,460
 and he will finish the job.

845
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:59,220
 And heaven will be here on this earth.

846
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,900
 This is where heaven will be.

847
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,340
 This is where we'll be forever.

848
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:04,980
 But it will be a perfect place.

849
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:07,780
 It will be a place of no weeping, no mourning, no tears,

850
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:10,200
 no cancer, no sadness, no death, no breakups,

851
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,220
 no broken hearts.

852
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:16,820
 And it will be beautiful, perfect in every way.

853
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:19,980
 And so this is where we'll be.

854
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:24,280
 And you get to begin to build that place with your life.

855
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:29,140
 Today you can leave here and begin to build heaven here.

856
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:32,780
 You remember,

857
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:38,100
 remember how people thought Noah was crazy?

858
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,400
 They're gonna think you're crazy.

859
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,360
 When they see the way that you spend your money

860
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,220
 that's different than the world,

861
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:44,320
 they're gonna think you're crazy.

862
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,000
 When you're sharing the gospel everywhere you go,

863
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,840
 they're gonna think you're crazy.

864
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,140
 When you're building the kingdom,

865
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:50,360
 they're gonna think you're crazy.

866
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,680
 But they're gonna know one day.

867
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:55,280
 And Jesus said in Matthew chapter six,

868
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,520
 you remember this, he said,

869
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:59,060
 "Don't store up for yourselves treasures on earth.

870
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:02,400
 "Store up for yourselves treasures in heaven."

871
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,800
 Guys, Jesus was an amazing financial advisor.

872
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:10,080
 Like anybody here have a degree in finance?

873
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,200
 Show of hands.

874
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,480
 Degree in finance.

875
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,360
 Raise your hand wherever you're at if you're listening.

876
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,320
 Degree in finance, okay.

877
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,260
 There's like three of you here.

878
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:17,520
 Wow, we're really poor.

879
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:19,860
 Okay.

880
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:24,040
 You guys know then, at least the three of you know,

881
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:29,040
 that if you can invest in something that lasts forever

882
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:33,880
 and you earn eternal dividends,

883
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:36,040
 like that's just a great investment, right?

884
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:39,120
 Or you can invest in something temporary.

885
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,600
 That's a foolish investment.

886
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,720
 Let me show you what I mean.

887
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:46,920
 Like if, let me just, like this thing right here,

888
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,040
 this robe.

889
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:52,500
 Can we pretend for a moment that this is a timeline?

890
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:55,340
 And let's just, let's imagine that it goes on forever,

891
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:56,540
 this timeline.

892
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:58,580
 It doesn't, I mean, it's tied to this beam over there.

893
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:01,080
 But imagine with me, use your imagination

894
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,400
 that this thing lasts forever.

895
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,440
 That it goes on forever and ever.

896
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,500
 And so like right here, this is the Garden of Eden,

897
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:09,160
 Adam and Eve, you know, and you move on.

898
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:12,180
 You have Noah and Moses and Abraham

899
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:13,940
 and like George Washington.

900
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:16,240
 And then here you get to this dot.

901
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:19,480
 You see with this, that's your 76 years.

902
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,720
 That's what you got.

903
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,920
 That's your 80 years.

904
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,180
 I don't know how long you have.

905
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:26,120
 60 years, maybe 100 years.

906
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,320
 That's you.

907
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:30,840
 This is where you're born and this is your tombstone.

908
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,160
 This is where you die.

909
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,240
 And this in between, that's your life.

910
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:37,080
 And so you have a decision as you leave here.

911
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:39,360
 Are you gonna live your life for your life?

912
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,520
 Are you gonna live your life for that line?

913
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,320
 For the forever?

914
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,720
 You get to choose.

915
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:46,960
 It's not crazy though.

916
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,980
 You're not crazy to begin to take this life

917
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:52,120
 and invest in that place.

918
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:54,800
 In the forever and ever and ever.

919
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,480
 I know you got real problems today.

920
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,280
 You know, boy problems or girl problems

921
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,120
 or work problems or boss problems.

922
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:03,140
 But I gotta tell you, 100 years from now,

923
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:04,940
 those aren't gonna be your problems.

924
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:10,980
 And you can live for what really matters right now.

925
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,940
 I mean, just tell me logically I'm wrong.

926
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:18,260
 Like tell me I'm crazy.

927
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:21,960
 I mean, here's what you can tell me,

928
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,360
 the best thing you got.

929
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:26,420
 Would you be nobody lives like that?

930
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:28,780
 Fine.

931
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:30,580
 You know, only Noah lived like that.

932
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:32,640
 There's only one.

933
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,260
 Be the only one.

934
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:38,020
 What do you want me to do?

935
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:42,420
 I want you to live a life that appears to the world

936
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:47,340
 to be completely irresponsible if there is no eternity,

937
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:48,500
 if there is no heaven.

938
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:52,500
 I want you to go all in with Jesus.

939
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:55,000
 Like not any kind of lukewarm madness,

940
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,140
 no like my life and church.

941
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:58,780
 You know, I know some of you, your biggest problem

942
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:00,140
 is you love the bar, you love the club,

943
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:02,460
 you love coke, you love alcohol,

944
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:04,620
 you love the party, you love sex, you love pornography,

945
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:06,260
 you're stuck in sin, you can't even imagine

946
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:08,620
 this life I'm presenting to you.

947
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:10,980
 I promise you it's better than your silly life.

948
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:14,100
 It's better than your silly life.

949
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,740
 I know what I said, I said it intentionally.

950
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:17,380
 It's better than your silly life.

951
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:26,980
 Some of you, you get it, you inspire me.

952
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:29,540
 Let me just say that, I'm so proud of some of you.

953
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:33,940
 It would be a miss not to just encourage

954
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:35,220
 the brothers and sisters in the faith

955
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:37,260
 that are getting after you, serving at brother bills,

956
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:39,380
 you're going on unashamed weekend every chance you get,

957
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:41,340
 you're giving away your money, you're sharing the gospel

958
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:43,020
 with coworkers and family members,

959
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:45,060
 and you've lost it all for his sake.

960
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:51,340
 What does it gain a man, what does it profit a man

961
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:53,780
 to gain the whole world and yet forfeit his soul?

962
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:56,540
 If anyone wants to come after me,

963
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:59,540
 he must first deny himself, take up his cross and follow me.

964
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:05,180
 Must lose his life for the sake of the kingdom.

965
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:07,140
 Some of you have lost your life for the sake of the kingdom.

966
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:09,020
 I'm so proud of you, you inspire me.

967
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:12,140
 I want to follow Jesus like you do.

968
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:13,540
 Thank you for your example.

969
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:18,020
 And some of you, you need to flip the switch.

970
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:19,580
 You need to realize that your biggest problems

971
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:21,700
 aren't your biggest problems, you got much bigger problems

972
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:23,140
 you haven't even anticipated,

973
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:24,820
 and Jesus paid for your problems.

974
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:26,980
 But live like that.

975
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:29,700
 And so a right response to eternity

976
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:32,300
 is to leverage your resources.

977
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:33,740
 When you have a right response to eternity,

978
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:35,820
 you want others there, and when you have a right response

979
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:39,420
 to eternity, you build the kingdom.

980
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:44,540
 We got the magic bands, you know, they came in the mail,

981
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:48,340
 such a big fund, like just to look at the way they do this.

982
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:49,780
 We got the magic bands, we're getting in,

983
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:50,900
 we got the magic bands.

984
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:52,820
 You know what we didn't do when we got the magic bands?

985
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:56,540
 We didn't sit on our hands and let the moment come and go.

986
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:57,860
 Like this was just the beginning.

987
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:59,900
 What we began to do when we got the magic bands

988
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:03,620
 is we began to look into hotels and resorts on the property,

989
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:04,460
 choose where we're gonna go,

990
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:05,520
 which parks we're gonna go to.

991
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,980
 There's several parks there.

992
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:07,860
 Which one do we wanna go to?

993
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:10,160
 We got to look into this thing called fast passes.

994
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:13,100
 Like this is crazy, you basically gotta go to a college

995
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:15,140
 and able to go, to be able to go to Disney

996
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:17,700
 to like learn how to do it, 'cause it's really complicated.

997
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:20,580
 And so you start booking these fast passes,

998
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:22,940
 and so we started to do that,

999
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:26,220
 and then we bought our airfare, and we planned our flights,

1000
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:28,820
 and I start to pull up maps to see how far we were

1001
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,740
 from the resort was from the park,

1002
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:32,660
 and we began to plan the trip.

1003
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:35,780
 We began to, you know what we began, we began to prepare.

1004
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:40,780
 We began to prepare for what we were going to, right?

1005
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:42,520
 Like that's what we started to do.

1006
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:45,480
 This is what it means to know that you're going

1007
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:48,000
 to the kingdom, to God's kingdom.

1008
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,080
 You begin to prepare.

1009
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,760
 He's prepared a place for you there,

1010
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,080
 and you're preparing to go to it.

1011
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,420
 Every day of your life, it consumes your thoughts.

1012
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:59,080
 You think about it, and it impacts the conversations

1013
00:41:59,080 --> 00:41:59,920
 that you have.

1014
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,760
 When you really believe that you're going to heaven,

1015
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:04,220
 you really, literally believe you're going to be there

1016
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:07,080
 forever and ever, it impacts everything that you do here,

1017
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,960
 the way that you spend, the way that you share,

1018
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,000
 the conversations you have, what you do

1019
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,600
 at the Thanksgiving table, everything.

1020
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,520
 What you do for fun, the way that you date,

1021
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,320
 what you look at, everything.

1022
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:21,120
 You prepare.

1023
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:26,400
 We get there, and you put this little thing,

1024
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,960
 there's a circle, we're going into the park,

1025
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:30,600
 and you put this on there, on that little circle,

1026
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,000
 and it turns green, and you're going in,

1027
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,560
 but let's just say that guy said to my little girl,

1028
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,900
 hey little girl, hey little girl, Finley,

1029
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:41,900
 wait, wait, why do you think you can go here?

1030
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:45,040
 Why should I let you in?

1031
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:50,620
 'Cause I got a magic band.

1032
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:54,600
 Did you pay for it?

1033
00:42:54,600 --> 00:43:00,140
 Not my daddy who loved me paid for it.

1034
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:02,940
 My daddy paid for it.

1035
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:05,020
 My daddy paid my way in.

1036
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:07,700
 That's all I got.

1037
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:10,940
 My daddy who loves me paid my way in.

1038
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:11,820
 Can I tell you something?

1039
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:13,180
 The only way you're going to get into heaven

1040
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:15,380
 is by acknowledging that your father in heaven

1041
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:17,140
 who loves you paid your way in with the death

1042
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:18,660
 and the resurrection of his son Jesus.

1043
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:21,480
 That's all you got to boast in, period, nothing else.

1044
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:24,020
 As you say, by grace alone.

1045
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:27,340
 (congregation applauds)

1046
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:31,140
 You know what you can't do in heaven?

1047
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:37,680
 You can't leverage your resources to get others there.

1048
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:42,620
 You can't invite anybody there

1049
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:45,060
 because they're already there.

1050
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:48,080
 You can't build the kingdom that's already been built.

1051
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:51,020
 These are three things you can't do in heaven,

1052
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:52,320
 but you can do them today.

1053
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:54,920
 You can do them tonight, and you can do them tomorrow,

1054
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:57,140
 and you can do them every day for the rest of your life.

1055
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:59,100
 I'm going to pray that you would.

1056
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:01,540
 Lord, would you give us that courage?

1057
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:03,420
 Help us to live with that purpose.

1058
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:08,020
 Help us to understand what you called us to do.

1059
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:11,260
 Help us not to live for the mark on the line,

1060
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:13,160
 but for the line.

1061
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:16,380
 Help us to invest in your kingdom, in your eternity.

1062
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:18,100
 Help us to leverage our resources

1063
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:19,060
 to get other people there.

1064
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:21,380
 Help us to invite them with our words

1065
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:23,140
 that we would share the gospel.

1066
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:24,740
 Lord, would you help us with our hands,

1067
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:25,860
 and our feet, and our hearts?

1068
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:28,300
 Would you help us to build the kingdom here, God?

1069
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:32,500
 Would you please, would you raise up an army?

1070
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:33,980
 We're not an audience, God.

1071
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:35,920
 We're an army of your followers.

1072
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:39,500
 In the name of Jesus Christ, would you use our lives, God,

1073
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:42,700
 for your glory, for your honor, because of your power,

1074
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:47,100
 forever, and ever, and ever, and ever, and ever.

1075
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:50,100
 In the name of Jesus, we worship you now.

1076
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:50,940
 Amen.
