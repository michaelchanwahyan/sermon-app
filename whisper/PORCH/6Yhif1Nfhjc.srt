1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,420
 Hey Porch, join me as we read God's word together from the

2
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:10,000
 gospel of Matthew chapter 14 verses 22 through 33.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,520
 Immediately he made the disciples get into the boat and

4
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:18,080
 go before him to the other side while he dismissed the crowds.

5
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,360
 And after he dismissed the crowds he went up to the mountain

6
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,640
 by himself to pray.

7
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,160
 When evening came he was there alone but the boat by this time

8
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,800
 was long away from the land beaten by the waves for the wind

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,560
 was against them.

10
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,320
 And in the fourth watch of the night he came to them walking on

11
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:35,760
 the sea.

12
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,920
 But when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were

13
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,280
 terrified and said it is a ghost.

14
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,520
 Then they cried out in fear but immediately Jesus spoke to them

15
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,160
 saying take heart.

16
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,400
 It is I.

17
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,640
 Do not be afraid.

18
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:55,760
 And Peter answered him Lord if it is you command me to come to

19
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,600
 you on the water.

20
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,240
 He said come.

21
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,960
 So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water and came to

22
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:02,640
 Jesus.

23
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,360
 But when he saw the wind he was afraid and beginning to sink he

24
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,000
 cried out Lord save me.

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,680
 Jesus immediately reached out his hand and took hold of him

26
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,600
 saying to him oh you of little faith why did you doubt.

27
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,960
 And when they got into the boat the wind ceased and those in the

28
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,120
 boat worshipped him saying truly you are the son of God.

29
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,920
 Now our sixth message in our series called Disciple.

30
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:36,320
 Porch how we doing?

31
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,560
 We doing OK tonight?

32
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,000
 Man it's always great to be with you.

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,920
 Great to see you.

34
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,320
 Special shout out to our Porch Live locations all over the

35
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,960
 nation that are tuning in with us tonight and a special special

36
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,880
 shout out to Porch Live Fort Worth and Tulsa and Scottsdale.

37
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,200
 Love what God's doing there and grateful that we get to be a

38
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,160
 small part of it.

39
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,800
 Well earlier this year I was convinced into attending a

40
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,400
 George Strait tribute concert.

41
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:06,920
 And I say convinced because it's not that I don't love George

42
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,160
 Strait.

43
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:11,000
 I do love George Strait and I wasn't sure that anyone less than

44
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,760
 the king of country would actually suffice for this

45
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,200
 concert.

46
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,560
 You see I had grown up listening to all of George's music in the

47
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,200
 back of my granddad's pickup truck driving through East Texas

48
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,120
 singing his music out loud.

49
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,000
 I'd seen George perform live several years ago at the Houston

50
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,680
 Rodeo and I had seen just how great he actually was in

51
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,120
 concert.

52
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,600
 So the idea of a cover artist concert really didn't excite me

53
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,120
 all that much.

54
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,440
 It left me a little bit reluctant and yet I decided you

55
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,480
 know what hey let's go for it.

56
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,040
 So we're at the concert.

57
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,360
 It's an outdoor venue.

58
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,480
 We're setting up our lawn chairs.

59
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:47,960
 We're getting ourselves we're getting ourselves accommodated

60
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:52,960
 whenever the emcee comes up and the emcee announces to us the

61
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,000
 artist that's going to be performing and begins to give us

62
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,960
 some of the credentials to support the fact that they're

63
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,440
 really quite the act.

64
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,480
 Credentials like they were the number one international George

65
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,120
 Strait tribute band in the world which is quite the claim

66
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,120
 because as I've done some study in the music impersonation

67
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,320
 business there's a big difference between being a cover artist

68
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,160
 and a tribute artist.

69
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,800
 I don't know if you know this.

70
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,320
 I didn't know it and yet the differences are this that the

71
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:24,280
 cover artist is one that performs a wide variety of music

72
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:28,960
 whereas a tribute artist focuses singularly on the music of one

73
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,520
 specific artist or band.

74
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,720
 So while a cover artist may perform a song really well it's

75
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,720
 the tribute artist that proves they actually know the individual

76
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,120
 behind the song themselves.

77
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,440
 And our George Strait tribute artist proved he knew everything

78
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:49,600
 about George Strait because when he came out on stage he walked

79
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,640
 like George and he talked like George and he sang like George

80
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,040
 he played like George and he looked like George.

81
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,600
 I was I was confronted by the fact that this guy had to have

82
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,880
 spent several hours studying George Strait.

83
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:04,640
 Like as I process it I wonder to myself like how long has he sat

84
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,640
 watching game tape of the way that George moves on stage or

85
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,080
 how long has he actually spent listening to George's music so

86
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,160
 that way he can actually understand all of the unique

87
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,880
 inflections in Mr.

88
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,360
 Strait's voice or how much money has he spent on the George

89
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,080
 Strait collection at Cavendish.

90
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:22,640
 You know what I mean.

91
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:26,720
 Like this guy is fully invested into the person of George

92
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,040
 Strait like he had mastered every mannerism of George like

93
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,760
 he was the guy that could tip his hat at the appropriate part

94
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,200
 of the song so that way the crowd knew he was singing not

95
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,040
 just to a broad room but to very specific individuals.

96
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,120
 He would rest his arms on the top of his guitar as he would

97
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,280
 break into chorus.

98
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,320
 He would smile that big Texas smile to warm everybody's hearts

99
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,720
 to him that way he could thank them for their applause.

100
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,760
 He was in that moment of time in that particular place with all

101
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,960
 of those people George Strait.

102
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:01,240
 Like by all accounts he was the closest thing we could get and

103
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,040
 many people didn't even realize he wasn't the genuine article.

104
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,960
 Like people came up to him at the end of the show and they

105
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,320
 were asking for autographs and wanted to get selfies and having

106
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:12,200
 him sign merchandise and he would tell them I'm not the

107
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,520
 real guy I'm just a tribute artist and yet people would go

108
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:20,440
 nuts anyways because he was so indistinguishable from the real

109
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:20,840
 thing.

110
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:25,720
 You see he may not have been the king of country himself but he

111
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,320
 sure looked a lot like the king regardless.

112
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,520
 Why do I tell you that?

113
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,520
 Because that's actually a really good picture of discipleship

114
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,800
 except instead of looking like George we're supposed to look

115
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,520
 like Jesus.

116
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,720
 Like we should look like Jesus and live like Jesus and love like

117
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,760
 Jesus and walk like Jesus and talk like Jesus and think like

118
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,080
 Jesus and speak like Jesus.

119
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,240
 We should literally look like Jesus ourselves.

120
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,240
 But here's my fear Porch.

121
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:56,400
 I think so many of us are really good cover artists of Christ but

122
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,480
 we're really bad tribute artists of Christ.

123
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,400
 Like we know some of his hits.

124
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,360
 We know to love our neighbors and read our Bibles and come to

125
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:08,040
 church and help out the elderly and make sure we keep our

126
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,840
 manners and give some money whenever the collection plate

127
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,480
 comes across.

128
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:16,480
 We know some of his hits and yet we also know that we like some

129
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,680
 of the other hits in the world.

130
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,680
 We really like the idea of turning it up on the weekends

131
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,400
 and we really like that one about pushing some physical

132
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,880
 boundaries with our boyfriend or our girlfriend.

133
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,080
 We really enjoy making sure that we're identifying with our

134
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,600
 accomplishments or finding validation how much money we

135
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,200
 make or what people actually think of us.

136
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:38,680
 You see we know some of Jesus's songs and we even like to play

137
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,640
 them from time to time.

138
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:45,400
 But we prove by the way we live our lives that we don't actually

139
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,240
 know the artist as well as we think.

140
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:55,720
 We prove that we're just cover Christians instead of true

141
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:59,320
 genuine tributes to the one and only king.

142
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:03,920
 So how do we change it?

143
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,200
 Well that's what we're talking about tonight.

144
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,760
 So you have a Bible you can turn with me in Matthew chapter 14.

145
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,600
 That's what Carrington read for us and so that's what we're

146
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,880
 going to work through over the course of our time together.

147
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,400
 We've been in a series called Disciple where we've been asking

148
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,160
 the question what does it mean to actually follow Jesus Christ.

149
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:24,040
 You see so many of us in this life we want to be connected to

150
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,680
 something greater than ourselves.

151
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,880
 We want to live a life of lasting impact.

152
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:31,960
 We want to experience really deep joy and have meaningful

153
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,440
 connections with other people.

154
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,160
 We want to live in such a way that we ultimately feel

155
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,000
 fulfilled where we grow into something greater.

156
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,200
 We're shaped into something significant.

157
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,080
 We're molded into something meaningful.

158
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:42,960
 Do you want this?

159
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,920
 I want this.

160
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,520
 Like this is what I want in my life and what we know is that

161
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,680
 the argument from the Bible is that God wants it too.

162
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,120
 Like God wants this for you in the way he intends to bring you

163
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:58,160
 into this sort of experience is he wants to make you like Jesus

164
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,800
 because Jesus is the epitome of everything I just described.

165
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,400
 It's becoming like Christ not just behaving like a Christian

166
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:09,520
 but actually becoming like Christ that we find the kind of

167
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,360
 life all of us want to find.

168
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:17,480
 And so tonight I want to do the hard work of talking to you

169
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:21,240
 about what it means to actually become like Jesus and the way

170
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,480
 that we're going to do it is we're going to look at the way

171
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,840
 that Peter interacts with Christ over the course of this

172
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,320
 passage and we're going to see Peter take a really big step in

173
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,760
 the process of becoming like Christ.

174
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,600
 And I think in watching his step we might find a step for

175
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,160
 ourselves.

176
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,440
 So we're going to pick it up.

177
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,200
 Verse 22.

178
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,000
 This is what it says.

179
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,640
 "Immediately he made the disciples get into the boat and

180
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,320
 go before him to the other side while he dismissed the crowds.

181
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,920
 And after he had dismissed the crowds he went up on the

182
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,360
 mountain by himself to pray.

183
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,440
 When evening came he was there alone but the boat by this time

184
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,440
 was a long way from the land beaten by the waves.

185
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,040
 The wind was against it and in the fourth watch of the night he

186
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:54,640
 came to them.

187
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,400
 He was walking on the sea but when the disciples saw him

188
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,280
 walking on the sea they were terrified.

189
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,640
 They said it's a ghost and they cried out in fear.

190
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,360
 But immediately Jesus spoke to them saying take heart.

191
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,440
 It's I.

192
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,000
 Do not be afraid."

193
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,040
 So just a little bit of context that we need before we dive into

194
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:10,840
 the rest of this story.

195
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,720
 Jesus and the disciples they have just feeding the five

196
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,360
 thousand and what we know is on the hills of this grand feast

197
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,440
 that they served is popular opinion is that he is unanimously

198
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:21,960
 loved.

199
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:25,640
 Like everybody that was a part of this giant meal wants to make

200
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,920
 Jesus king which is a really reasonable response.

201
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,760
 You know he just foot the bill for you and several thousand of

202
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,520
 your best friends.

203
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,760
 I think we'll keep him around.

204
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,880
 And yet that's not a part of Jesus' plan whatsoever.

205
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,480
 That's not what he came to do.

206
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,160
 And so what he decides is okay let me grab my disciples.

207
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,160
 Let me put them on a boat.

208
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,760
 Let me send them across the Sea of Galilee.

209
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,040
 They will go ahead of me and I'll settle the crowd down.

210
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:49,760
 I'll make sure people they come to a place of peace.

211
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,440
 Now I'm not actually going to be made king and then I'm going to

212
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,920
 pray and then I'll depart.

213
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,480
 I'll catch up to my guys along the way.

214
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,600
 While Jesus is doing all of this we see the disciples.

215
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,200
 They're sailing across the Sea of Galilee and what we know is

216
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,960
 that they sail directly into a windstorm which is a really bad

217
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,400
 idea.

218
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,800
 It says that they're on their way and that it's the fourth watch

219
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,440
 of the night.

220
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,640
 In the Jewish in the Jewish worldview there were four watches

221
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,240
 in the night.

222
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,320
 The fourth being the last mean that they are somewhere between

223
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,960
 three and six a.m. in the morning.

224
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:23,440
 And if you read John's John's gospel account what you know is

225
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,240
 that there are three to four miles in route.

226
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,720
 Meaning they have spent a long time rowing into the wind and

227
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,560
 they don't have much to show for it.

228
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:38,400
 So how do you think they feel the same way you feel if ever

229
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:42,000
 you've tried to run up a descending escalator.

230
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,120
 You feel frustrated.

231
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,280
 You're weary.

232
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,240
 You're exhausted.

233
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,000
 You're tired.

234
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,320
 You're wondering to yourself why did I even choose to do this.

235
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,320
 That's what they're thinking and they actually have an answer as

236
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,000
 to why they chose to do this.

237
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,960
 They chose to do this because Jesus said so.

238
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,680
 So they're not just discouraged that this is really difficult.

239
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,240
 Now they're disappointed because the guy that's supposed to have

240
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,840
 their best interest in mind is the one that has led them into

241
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,200
 the worst possible scenario.

242
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,800
 So why would Jesus do it?

243
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:13,120
 Because he wants to make them like him.

244
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:19,600
 And Jesus knows that complicating our lives will

245
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,480
 cultivate our growth.

246
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,240
 That's what Jesus does.

247
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:27,080
 Like he will complicate our lives to cultivate our growth.

248
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,600
 And he's not crazy for doing this.

249
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,560
 Like we do this all the time.

250
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,400
 I don't know if you ever went to sports camp growing up.

251
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,560
 Maybe a cheer camp or chess camp or band camp.

252
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,360
 I can't really speak for those.

253
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,120
 I didn't go to those.

254
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,480
 And yet when you go to a sports camp what you know is you have

255
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:43,280
 to learn a very select set of skills in a very short amount of

256
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:43,640
 time.

257
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:47,440
 And so the goal of your coaches is to help you adopt some

258
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,080
 specific expertise with very little time to make that thing

259
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:51,440
 happen.

260
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,280
 And so I don't know how your coaches did it for you but I

261
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,000
 remember going to basketball camp and my coaches they did so

262
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,480
 very creatively.

263
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,160
 They decided in order to teach me to dribble with my left hand

264
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,880
 that they would tie my right arm behind my back and they would

265
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,920
 put blinders under my eyes so I couldn't see the ball.

266
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:11,040
 Which made a mess of an experience for me.

267
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:11,560
 Right.

268
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,640
 But I looked ridiculous.

269
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,120
 Sure.

270
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:17,080
 The ball was rolling all over the place of course.

271
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,000
 And yet you know what never occurred to me.

272
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,680
 My coaches hate me man.

273
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,360
 Like they don't have my best interest in mind.

274
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:24,760
 No.

275
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,920
 Like that never occurred to me.

276
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:30,880
 I knew my coach just wants me to learn to use my left hand and

277
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,160
 praise God I did.

278
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,680
 I learned how to use my left hand.

279
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,400
 How?

280
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:40,840
 Because my coach complicated my life to cultivate my growth.

281
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,520
 Jesus does the same thing.

282
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,680
 Now to be clear.

283
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:48,240
 Jesus does not cause evil.

284
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,880
 He does not condone sin.

285
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:57,520
 He will occasionally orchestrate our circumstances to promote our

286
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,520
 individual growth.

287
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,840
 That's the way that he works.

288
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,280
 If you want to learn more.

289
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:05,000
 The first chapter of James really verses 13 through 17 it'll give

290
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,680
 you a really good explanation of how Jesus does this.

291
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,200
 And yet what we know is that Jesus will introduce momentary

292
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:16,400
 complications in life to produce a meaningful transformation of life.

293
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,800
 Like he wants to make us more like himself.

294
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,160
 Which is a really fascinating idea to think about.

295
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:22,960
 Okay.

296
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,480
 Cool.

297
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,560
 Like he's going to lead me into adversity.

298
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:28,920
 He's going to produce some resistance to help me grow.

299
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,320
 Really fascinating to think about.

300
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,000
 Really frustrating to live through.

301
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,080
 Can I get an amen?

302
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,720
 Exactly.

303
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:40,640
 I know for so many of us you're, you're sitting in a situation, the

304
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:44,480
 likes of which you can't plausibly understand why you're still struggling

305
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:44,920
 within it.

306
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:51,600
 Like you're in the middle of a situation that, man, it just doesn't

307
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,320
 make sense.

308
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,360
 Even on God's own standard.

309
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:58,720
 Like you work harder than everybody else in your department.

310
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,600
 And yet for whatever reason, you're always the one that goes unnoticed.

311
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,760
 That never gets promoted.

312
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,640
 That's never afforded a bonus.

313
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:13,280
 Like others of you, you've been faithfully preparing yourself for

314
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:13,800
 marriage.

315
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:18,280
 Like you have been pursuing personal purity and yet you're still stuck in your

316
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,040
 singleness.

317
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:24,000
 Others of you, you're trying so hard to move past whatever it was that took

318
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,840
 place in your history.

319
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:29,640
 And yet no matter how hard you try to move on, it seems like the shame and the

320
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:35,600
 guilt and the pain of what transpired back then continues to creep into the

321
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,360
 here and now.

322
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:40,440
 Some of you, like you're trying to be so consistent in managing your money.

323
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,400
 Like you're being a good steward of the resources that God's given.

324
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,000
 And yet bills continue to pile up.

325
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,280
 Some of you, you're so kind to everybody.

326
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,520
 Like it doesn't matter who it is.

327
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,880
 You're like a golden retriever.

328
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,000
 You'll make a friend out of anyone that's within a six foot radius of you.

329
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:01,120
 And yet whenever the weekend rolls around, everyone is someplace that you're not.

330
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,880
 You see, I know some of you are struggling with some things I couldn't begin to

331
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,600
 understand.

332
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:12,040
 Things that make no sense whatsoever for God to let continue.

333
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,640
 So then why does he let these things continue?

334
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:24,040
 To prove that no matter how high the waves rise, Jesus still walks above them.

335
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:31,880
 That no matter how high the waves rise in your life, your Jesus, your King,

336
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,040
 still walks above them.

337
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:39,720
 John 16, 33 says, I have said these things to you that in me, you may have peace.

338
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,520
 Notice, where's your peace found?

339
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,960
 It's in him.

340
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,880
 It's not the job.

341
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,000
 It's not in a relationship.

342
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,280
 It's not going to be found in some personal acceptance.

343
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,240
 Your family finally getting their act together.

344
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,560
 It's not found in anything else but him.

345
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,760
 In the world, you'll have tribulation.

346
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,920
 Some of your versions say trouble, but take heart.

347
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,200
 I've overcome the world.

348
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,360
 Like it's interesting.

349
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,760
 It isn't until they're a long way from land, they're beaten by the waves.

350
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:06,200
 It's the fourth watch of the night that Jesus finally comes to his disciples.

351
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,240
 Just think about it.

352
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,400
 In this moment, like the waves couldn't be stronger.

353
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:14,960
 Like the wind couldn't be louder.

354
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,280
 The night couldn't get darker.

355
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:21,400
 And yet it's in this moment right now that you choose to show up, Jesus.

356
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,960
 Like, why did you wait this long?

357
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,360
 Why didn't you show up sooner?

358
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:28,280
 Why have you waited until the worst possible moment?

359
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:31,480
 Because it's through the strength of the storm that he wants to clarify who he is.

360
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,120
 It's through the strength of the storm that Jesus wants to clarify who he is.

361
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,640
 Namely, that he's more than a ghost.

362
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:40,240
 That that's actually a really poor identification of who he is.

363
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,880
 You see, Jesus is going to say something pretty powerful about himself.

364
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:53,720
 He does so in this story because by the end of it, he's going to identify himself for the very first time in the eyes of the disciples as the one and only son of God.

365
00:16:53,720 --> 00:17:00,760
 But we also know in the other gospels, he's trying to declare something significant about himself by walking on the water.

366
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,880
 If you go and you read this same story, it occurs in three different gospels.

367
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:07,920
 But if you go and you read the story in the gospel of Mark, something fascinating happens.

368
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:16,000
 It says that Jesus sees his disciples and yet he meant to pass them by, which feels really inconsiderate.

369
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,600
 Like, come on, man, don't you see us struggling out here?

370
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,840
 Like, why are you trying to move past us?

371
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:23,560
 Why does he mean to pass them by?

372
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:30,400
 Well, if you know your Old Testament, he's alluding to something really significant.

373
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:37,600
 He is intending to take his disciples back to these defining moments in the lives of two very special men.

374
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:44,480
 He wants to take them back to a defining moment in the life of Moses and in the life of Elijah, where the glory of God passed both of them by.

375
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,160
 That's what Jesus is wanting to do in walking on this water.

376
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,080
 He means to pass by his disciples to demonstrate to them.

377
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,360
 This isn't just a cool party trick.

378
00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:01,600
 No, it's a demonstration of my deity that I am God, that I am not just the son.

379
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,600
 I'm the son of man.

380
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,520
 Yes, but I'm the son of God as well.

381
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,560
 He wants to elevate their view.

382
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:11,400
 He wants to elevate ours in a way that it's never been before.

383
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:18,320
 Here's the thing. It's because of the storms of life, not despite them, that he's able to do it.

384
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,840
 It's because of the storm that he's able to do it.

385
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:29,320
 So, friends, listen, maybe your frustration is just an invitation to know him more.

386
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:43,680
 You thought about that, like maybe the frustration you feel, whatever your hurt or hang up is, maybe your situational difficulty is just an invitation from Jesus to know him more, which is really vital in the process of becoming like him.

387
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:52,520
 Like it's kind of Christ to look at you and me and say, hey, before I make you more like myself, I want to show you more of myself.

388
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:55,520
 I want you to get a full picture of who I am.

389
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,720
 That way you can know just how full a picture you will become.

390
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,960
 This is an amazing thing.

391
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:06,440
 And so he's using the storm to prove to us just in fact who he is.

392
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,880
 He will complicate our life because he ultimately wants to cultivate our growth.

393
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,440
 And so he does this with Peter.

394
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,880
 He takes Peter to a place where ultimately he is making him more like him.

395
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,520
 But he doesn't just take him to a place.

396
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,520
 He's also going to ask some things of Peter in that place.

397
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,360
 And that's what we see in verse 28.

398
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:27,960
 It says, "And Peter answered him, Lord, if it's you, command me to come to you on the water.

399
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,360
 And he said, come.

400
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,880
 And so Peter got out of the boat and he walked on the water and he came to Jesus."

401
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,240
 Like, I love it.

402
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:46,400
 In the face of this storm, Peter is needing to clarify exactly who Jesus is, despite the fact that they're boys, like they're really close, like they're best friends.

403
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,320
 Like Peter knows Jesus really well by this moment.

404
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:56,880
 And yet Jesus is doing something so significant, so category shattering, that Peter's looking out into the winds and the waves.

405
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,360
 He's like, "Is it really you?"

406
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:05,120
 Like, that's what Jesus is doing here.

407
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:12,120
 Like, he is defying the normal expectations that the disciples have of him by walking on this water.

408
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:16,320
 So a little bit more Old Testament trivia.

409
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:22,160
 In the Old Testament, the sea was a common symbol for cosmic disorder.

410
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:28,800
 Like, it was not a place conducive to things like life and peace and prosperity.

411
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,880
 Like, none of those things existed within the sea.

412
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,240
 The sea was full of danger and chaos.

413
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:38,440
 Like, it was synonymous, in fact, with the grave.

414
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:42,040
 It even represented hell in some instances.

415
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:47,320
 It was feared by all accounts because no one could control the sea.

416
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:52,400
 No man could control the sea except for God.

417
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 So here comes Jesus walking on the water, doing something that no man should be able to do.

418
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,480
 And in so doing, he's declaring something big about himself.

419
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:08,800
 That's why Peter can't wrap his mind around what he's seeing.

420
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:15,040
 Like Job 9, 8 says that the Lord, Yahweh, is the one that tramples on the sea.

421
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:21,280
 And here comes Jesus doing the exact same thing in front of Peter.

422
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:28,320
 He is defying all expectation because he wants Peter to know, "Hey, I'm the God-man.

423
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,640
 Like, I'm not just a philosopher.

424
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,680
 I'm not just a teacher.

425
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,880
 I'm not just a miracle worker.

426
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,760
 I am those things.

427
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:39,280
 Like, yes, that's a part of who I am, but I am the God-man," which is wild.

428
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:46,240
 Like, God himself, transcendent, became God-contained in the person of Christ.

429
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,200
 That's an amazing thing.

430
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,840
 That's a wild reality.

431
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,520
 But what's also wild is that that God handpicked this group of guys.

432
00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:00,640
 Like, he could have picked anybody, and yet he chose to pick these guys.

433
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,200
 Why is that so crazy?

434
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:07,880
 Well, in order to understand why it's crazy, you have to know a little bit about the Jewish education system.

435
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,720
 So I'm going to give this to you really simply, very short.

436
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,920
 But the idea within the Jewish education system is that there were three stages of learning.

437
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:21,240
 If you were a Jewish child, at the age of six, all Jewish children, they would go to this thing called Betsefer.

438
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:29,320
 Betsefer was the idea of going to school to learn the Torah, and not just learn the Torah, the first five books of the Bible, but memorize the Torah.

439
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,680
 So all Jewish children, they would learn the Torah.

440
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,680
 They would memorize it cover to cover.

441
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:44,800
 And then whenever they graduated within four years, sometime around the age of 10, they would likely be rolled out from school, and they would go and they would learn their family trade.

442
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,680
 Carpentry, fishing, something of that sort, tent making.

443
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:54,160
 And yet, if you were really distinguished, like if you really knew your stuff, they would actually, they would promote you to the next stage.

444
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:57,200
 And the next stage would pick up at the age of 10, and you would go to the age of 14.

445
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,040
 And it was called, it was called Bet-Talmud.

446
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:11,680
 Bet-Talmud was the idea of not just learning and memorizing the Torah, but learning and memorizing the rest of the Hebrew scripture, which was the Old Testament Bible that's sitting in your lap.

447
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,040
 They would memorize it completely.

448
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:26,800
 And then, if you were especially distinguished, really good, you knew your stuff, you could actually debate on the topic of textual criticism, you would get promoted to the third stage.

449
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:30,600
 Now, very few people made it to this stage, to the stage called Bet-Midrash.

450
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:39,600
 And yet at this stage, what you would find is, is your education would continue, not in a classroom, but under the tutelage of a rabbi.

451
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:47,560
 And this is why it's significant for us, because whenever you would reach this stage, very few, very few kids would make it to the spot.

452
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:56,600
 You would be interviewed by your rabbi, like they would assess whether you're actually worthy of walking with them, if you're actually deserving of following them.

453
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,680
 And so they would interview you.

454
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:01,600
 They would do with these kids the same thing that you have happen whenever you go in for a job interview.

455
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:08,760
 They would ask you questions and they would check your credentials and they would take you through a technical portion of the interview to assess just how smart you actually are.

456
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:14,840
 And then if you actually impressed the rabbi, the rabbi might invite you to walk with them.

457
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,720
 They would look upon you and say, come and follow me.

458
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:29,680
 And the idea of following a rabbi is that you would not just, you would not only adopt their scriptural interpretation, but you would adopt a personal imitation of the rabbi themself.

459
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:36,000
 Like you would learn everything they know and you would live exactly as they live.

460
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,880
 You would, to bring it into our modern context, become a method actor.

461
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,320
 What's a method actor?

462
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:48,840
 Someone that not only learns their lines, but really lives the part, you know, like on set, off set, like on screen and off screen.

463
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:54,240
 They are fully immersed into becoming the character that they're seeking to exhibit.

464
00:24:54,240 --> 00:25:00,360
 So Daniel Day Lewis, he was an amazing disciple of Abraham Lincoln.

465
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:05,880
 Or Austin Butler, amazing disciple of Elvis Presley.

466
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,880
 Or Heath Ledger, amazing disciple of the Joker.

467
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,960
 You get the idea.

468
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:17,160
 Like a disciple's goal was to become as much like their rabbi as possible.

469
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,880
 Now, why does any of this matter?

470
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,200
 Because Jesus handpicked his disciples.

471
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,160
 So what kind of disciples did he pick?

472
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:27,680
 Did he pick guys that, I mean, they were well-versed in the Hebrew scripture.

473
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,280
 Did he pick guys that were the stuff of rabbinical pride?

474
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:34,160
 Did he pick guys that could just whip anybody in a textual debate?

475
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,200
 No!

476
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,440
 He didn't pick anyone like that.

477
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:43,160
 Like he picked fishermen and he picked tax collectors and he picked zealots and thieves.

478
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:49,360
 He picked common, ordinary, really unimpressive and uneducated people to follow him.

479
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:58,520
 Like in the eyes of the world, Jesus' disciples, they had no business walking with a rabbi.

480
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:03,600
 And yet in the eyes of Jesus, he wouldn't pick anyone else.

481
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,720
 These were the people that he wanted to walk with him.

482
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,920
 He wanted them to do what every good disciple was meant to do.

483
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,040
 Become covered in the dust of their rabbi.

484
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:19,840
 To follow him so closely that they would be covered in the dust of every place he walked.

485
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,560
 That they might live exactly as he lives.

486
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:27,120
 You see, Jesus, he doesn't just want us to learn from him.

487
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,680
 He wants us to live like him, become like him.

488
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:34,800
 That he is picking anyone and everyone that's wanting.

489
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,440
 You don't need to be impressive.

490
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,880
 Like you don't need to be approvable.

491
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,840
 You just need to be wanting for it.

492
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:46,120
 Willing to say, I'll go with you, Jesus.

493
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,640
 I will walk where you walk.

494
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,080
 I will do what you do.

495
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,640
 I will speak what you speak.

496
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,280
 I want to follow after you.

497
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:56,440
 Even if it means walking on the water.

498
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,360
 Because that's our second point.

499
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:01,960
 Jesus will call us on the water to make us like himself.

500
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:05,600
 Jesus will call us on the water to make us like himself.

501
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,480
 Like, have you ever thought about this?

502
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:13,200
 Like Jesus, he never asks us to do anything that's easy.

503
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,760
 Can I get an amen?

504
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,800
 Like Jesus is calling us to walk on the water.

505
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,040
 That's unbelievable.

506
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:22,360
 And yet everything Jesus asks us to do feels really unbelievable.

507
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,440
 Sell everything and give it to the poor.

508
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,000
 That's tough.

509
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,800
 Take up your cross and follow me.

510
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,000
 That's going to hurt.

511
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,200
 Die to yourself.

512
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,120
 Ouch.

513
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,600
 Love your enemies as yourself.

514
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,840
 Do I have to, Jesus?

515
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:39,560
 Like he continually asks us to do things that feel so unbelievable.

516
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:44,880
 I don't know about you, but every command, they're not remotely simple.

517
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:51,600
 And every time I read them, I'm often filled with this, like, God, why do you

518
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,440
 expect so much of me?

519
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,240
 And yet here's the catch.

520
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,320
 It's not that God expects so much of us.

521
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:03,880
 It's that he believes so much in us because he believes we can be just like him.

522
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,920
 Isn't that amazing?

523
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:13,360
 Like he thinks, Hey, I see you and I believe you like a good disciple have

524
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,160
 the potential to become like me.

525
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:22,160
 So I'm going to ask you to do some things that I am willing to do, but that's so

526
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,280
 unbelievably hard.

527
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,000
 I know.

528
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,240
 But I believe you can do the unbelievable.

529
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,800
 That's the heart of Christ towards us as we walk with him.

530
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,320
 So let me ask you, what's he asking you to do?

531
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,960
 What water is he asking you to walk on?

532
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:41,000
 Like, is he asking you to end a relationship because it's really unhealthy?

533
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:47,200
 Like move out because the nature of your relationship is really ungodly.

534
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,840
 Is he asking you to like put in your two weeks because the things your boss asks

535
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,360
 you to do, they're really unethical.

536
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,840
 They're truly immoral.

537
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:58,000
 Is he asking you to finally share with a friend the way that you're hurting

538
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,320
 yourself and seek some help?

539
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:04,640
 Is he asking you to confess to someone that you genuinely envy and have slandered

540
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,360
 and seek their forgiveness?

541
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:10,040
 Is he asking you to give some of the money that you have to support someone else

542
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,240
 that's actually in need?

543
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:15,800
 Is he asking you to leave the corporate career and actually jump into a life of

544
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:16,600
 full-time ministry?

545
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:20,720
 Is he asking you to leave America and go overseas to reach the nations?

546
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,080
 Like what is Jesus asking you to do?

547
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,120
 What water is he asking you to walk on?

548
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:30,360
 Listen, he's asking you to walk on it because in walking on it, you will become

549
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,240
 more like him.

550
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,400
 That's the nature of what he does.

551
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:36,200
 Like Peter, he doesn't move until Jesus commanded him.

552
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:40,280
 But the minute Jesus called him on the water, he bolted.

553
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,840
 Like he went overboard.

554
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:45,040
 Like he jumped out of that boat and he started walking towards Jesus.

555
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,720
 He was fully obedient.

556
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,320
 Like, even when it doesn't make sense.

557
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:55,280
 Like to the world, walking on water, it's impossible.

558
00:29:55,280 --> 00:30:01,320
 But with God, walking on water is inevitable.

559
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:06,480
 We're going to do things that people look at and say, "That doesn't make sense.

560
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,040
 That is totally crazy.

561
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,120
 They must be outside their mind."

562
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:13,240
 We're going to go places no one else will.

563
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:16,880
 We're going to do things no one else can because that's what Jesus did.

564
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,560
 Like Jesus went someplace no one else would.

565
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:25,240
 He moved from heaven to earth to do what no one else could, to die for the sins of

566
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:25,840
 the world.

567
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,880
 That's your Jesus.

568
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:34,240
 He is willing to do the unbelievable, to do the imperceivable, to go where no one

569
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,200
 is willing to.

570
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,520
 And he's saying, "I want to make you like that."

571
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,000
 Do you want that?

572
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,640
 Because that's what he's trying to build into you.

573
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:46,000
 That's what he's trying to mold out of you.

574
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,120
 He wants to make you like himself.

575
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,240
 And yet here's the thing, Porch.

576
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:57,120
 Doing stuff like this is never easy.

577
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:00,240
 It's always hard.

578
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,560
 It wouldn't be unbelievable if it wasn't.

579
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,520
 But just think about Peter.

580
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:10,120
 I guarantee you, I wasn't there, but I guarantee you the hardest step in that

581
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,040
 moment had to have been the first one.

582
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:16,800
 Like, can you imagine sitting on the edge of the boat and being like, "I don't know

583
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,600
 about this."

584
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:21,400
 Like, "I don't think I'm gonna be able to stand.

585
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,760
 Like, this is wet, God."

586
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:28,800
 And yet he's willing to put his foot down and make a move because Jesus called him

587
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,480
 out.

588
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:34,960
 Like, it's better to be brave on the waves with Jesus than safe in the ship without

589
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,080
 him.

590
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:40,160
 And so Jesus is calling some of us out of the boat.

591
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:44,040
 The question is, will we follow?

592
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:48,240
 Deuteronomy 31, 6 says, "Be strong and courageous.

593
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,800
 Do not fear or be in dread of them, for it is the Lord your God who goes with you.

594
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:55,280
 He will not leave you or forsake you."

595
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:59,280
 Now, does that mean that we'll never falter as we follow?

596
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,480
 No.

597
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,880
 Look at verse 30.

598
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:07,400
 It says, "But when he saw the wind," talking about Peter, "he was afraid and

599
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,560
 beginning to sink, he cried out, 'Lord, save me!'

600
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:13,320
 And Jesus immediately reached out his hand and he took hold of him, saying to him,

601
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,560
 'Oh, you of little faith.

602
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,040
 I love it.'"

603
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:22,040
 In the Greek, those four words, "Oh, you of little faith," five words, it's

604
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:26,200
 actually one word, and it's like a nickname.

605
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,520
 Little faith.

606
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,400
 Jesus looks at him and says, "Little faith?

607
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,920
 Why do you doubt?"

608
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:34,560
 And when they got into the boat, the wind ceased.

609
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:37,560
 And those in the boat worshipped him, saying, "Here it is.

610
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,760
 Truly, you are the son of God."

611
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:43,880
 The first time they ever identify him as such.

612
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:49,320
 You see, Peter, he's walking on the water, but he breaks his focus from Jesus.

613
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:52,800
 And the minute he stops seeing his Savior and he starts seeing his

614
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,000
 circumstances, he sinks.

615
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 So, I remember when my wife and I moved to Houston, Texas, which is where we were

616
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:08,120
 prior to moving here to Dallas, I went into that move with so much anticipation

617
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:12,560
 because I was stepping into a job that I had been expecting and wanting for for so

618
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:16,120
 long, I was finally getting the opportunity to lead a ministry and teach the Bible and

619
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,000
 develop teams and help people.

620
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,400
 I was so eager for it.

621
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:22,800
 And so, we finally make the move, and with the opportunity, I have all of these

622
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,640
 expectations of what's going to happen.

623
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,520
 Like, it's what I've been wanting for so long.

624
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:30,400
 It's what I thought God had gifted me for, and I thought he was specifically calling

625
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,440
 me into.

626
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:35,800
 And so, when I made my way to Houston, I came in, like, fully ready to kick butt

627
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:41,760
 and take names, except the only butt kicked and name taken was my own.

628
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:50,680
 Like, year one for me in Houston, Texas, in my prior job, was arguably the hardest

629
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,880
 year of my life.

630
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:56,080
 Like, I encountered some things that I didn't expect.

631
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,800
 I suffered in some ways that I didn't predict.

632
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:02,880
 I was circumstantially depressed for the very first time.

633
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:08,640
 For all intents and purposes, it felt like I was sinking, like I was sinking really,

634
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,560
 really fast.

635
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:14,800
 And so, it was one evening, after we had another gathering, a program that we had

636
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:19,680
 produced, that I had another one of those, like, "What in the world?"

637
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:20,640
 kind of moments.

638
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:28,680
 And I remember driving home at 3 o'clock in the morning, and I was just processing,

639
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,240
 like, what I was living through.

640
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:34,880
 And I remember, like, banging my steering wheel and just crying out to God, like,

641
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,480
 "God, I don't know what we're doing here.

642
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,080
 Like, why is this so hard?

643
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:42,520
 Like, I thought this was going to be so good, and yet, God, I've stepped into a

644
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:45,080
 situation that I can't do anymore.

645
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,960
 Like, I can't do this anymore.

646
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,480
 And so, you're the one that's going to have to do it for me."

647
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:53,600
 And in that moment, like, it clicked for the very first time that I had actually been

648
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:56,960
 trying to do everything on my own.

649
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:02,160
 I had not realized, like, I wasn't walking with Jesus any longer, I was working by

650
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,720
 myself.

651
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:06,560
 I was trying to teach the Bible, and I was trying to help people, and I was trying to

652
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:10,760
 organize ministry, and build big structures and systems, and I was trying to make a

653
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:13,840
 difference and change the world, and I was doing it all on my own.

654
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:20,480
 And because I was doing it all by myself, I was drowning.

655
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:27,040
 Until the moment that I finally came to my senses, and I cried out.

656
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:32,480
 It was in that moment that everything changed, because Jesus will catch us if we

657
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,640
 will only cry out.

658
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:40,360
 Jesus will catch us if we'll only cry out.

659
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,440
 The Bible's convinced of this.

660
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,120
 Psalm 18, 6 says, "In my distress, I called upon the Lord to my God.

661
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:47,040
 I cried for help from his temple.

662
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:50,600
 He heard my voice, and my cry to him reached his ears."

663
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:53,840
 Psalm 34, 17, "When the righteous cry for help," guess what?

664
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:56,600
 "The Lord hears, and he delivers them out of all their troubles."

665
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:59,400
 Psalm 41 and 2, "I waited patiently for the Lord.

666
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,760
 He inclined to me, and he heard my cry.

667
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,440
 He drew me up from the pit of destruction, out of the miry bog.

668
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:07,200
 He set my feet upon a rock, and he made my steps secure."

669
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:11,160
 Psalm 116, 1 and 2, "I love the Lord, because he has heard my voice,

670
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:14,720
 and my pleas for mercy, because he inclined his ear to me.

671
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,720
 Therefore, I will call on him as long as I live."

672
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:20,640
 Psalm 145, 19, "He fulfills the desire of those who fear him.

673
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,880
 He also hears their cry, and he saves them."

674
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:28,400
 You see, listen, the issue is not that God never hears our cries.

675
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:33,600
 The issue is that we seldom realize we actually need to cry out.

676
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,800
 That's the issue.

677
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:39,280
 We don't understand that God is often waiting for us to cry out that,

678
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,120
 "God, we need it.

679
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,600
 We feel like we've got to put on a strong face.

680
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,040
 We've got to keep up a good front.

681
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:46,560
 Like, we have to be strong for the sake of those that are under our charge."

682
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:50,560
 And yet, God's saying, "No, you're not supposed to do anything on your own strength.

683
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,280
 You're supposed to do it with me.

684
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,560
 Don't work for me.

685
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,720
 Walk with me."

686
00:36:54,720 --> 00:37:02,040
 And yet, it took me a year before I realized I was drowning in my job.

687
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:06,280
 Because that's how it works.

688
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:09,640
 I love the way this passage reads it.

689
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:13,240
 Like, it says that Peter began to sink.

690
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:17,840
 Like, I'd always pictured Peter walking on the water one minute and then falling

691
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:20,360
 through a trapdoor in the Sea of Galilee the next.

692
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,320
 Like, it felt really sudden, really abrupt.

693
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,640
 Like, it came out of nowhere.

694
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,160
 And yet, that's not what it says.

695
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:29,080
 Like, it says that Peter began to sink.

696
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,480
 Like, it was a gradual process.

697
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:35,160
 It's the same as you walking from the shallow end of the pool to the deep end

698
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:35,600
 of the pool.

699
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:38,440
 Like, you can feel the water rising.

700
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:41,360
 That's what happened to Peter.

701
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:45,000
 Like, the signs of danger, they were all around.

702
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,960
 And some of you know what this feels like.

703
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:56,560
 Like, some of you have been sinking in your circumstances for a really long time.

704
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:05,160
 Like, you've been pulled under because your full focus is on fixing your family,

705
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:11,880
 or finding the one, or making a difference, or living with security,

706
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:15,200
 or being approved of.

707
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:22,160
 And yet, as you focus on these things and you forget about Jesus,

708
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:26,040
 you're just consistently sinking.

709
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:29,280
 I think God has brought so many of you here tonight because He wants

710
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:36,000
 to ask you the question, "What are you afraid of?

711
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,600
 What are you actually afraid of?"

712
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,240
 Because here's the case porch.

713
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:50,280
 You will either walk in faith on the waves, or you will sink in fear beneath them.

714
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:58,240
 And what you fear will ultimately determine the outcome.

715
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,240
 Like, I think God desperately wants some of you to know that whatever's trying

716
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:09,520
 to sink your life, it's still under the feet of Jesus.

717
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:16,920
 No matter how great the storm in your story feels, Jesus still walks upon it.

718
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:23,320
 He's still the one that considers the water as concrete.

719
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:27,200
 He moves through it without any difficulty.

720
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:31,840
 He is completely at ease in the face of your hardship.

721
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:38,120
 He wants you to know, "I stand upon that which seeks to drown you,

722
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:41,520
 and you can stand upon it too.

723
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:45,880
 If only you'll replace your fear with faith in me."

724
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:49,240
 That's what He's calling of us.

725
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:56,600
 James 1, 3 through 4, it tells us that we can count on joy when we make trials

726
00:39:56,600 --> 00:40:00,560
 of various kinds because we know that the testing of our faith produces

727
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:03,240
 steadfastness, and we should let steadfastness have its full effect that

728
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:05,000
 we may be perfect, complete, lacking in nothing.

729
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,280
 I read that to you because I don't want us to be mistaken that Jesus is just going

730
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,640
 to fix your problem.

731
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:15,200
 That the minute you cry out, He's just going to resolve the issue.

732
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,280
 He's just going to solve your storm.

733
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:17,880
 No.

734
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:21,800
 Like, what we know is that the road to maturity, it's paved with adversity.

735
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:25,800
 That's what James is saying right here, and that's what we should know as well.

736
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:29,080
 Like, He wants to make you like Himself, and the way that He's going to make you

737
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:37,560
 like Himself is He's going to test your faith, not bend to your will.

738
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:43,840
 So, I remember a few years ago, some dear friends of mine in Brook,

739
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,960
 they lived through the devastation of a miscarriage.

740
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:51,440
 And it was especially devastating because it was their first time

741
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,440
 ever being pregnant.

742
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:58,800
 And yet, I remember being so blown away by the way that they navigated this

743
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:04,400
 particular storm because instead of grumbling against God and raging

744
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:09,760
 against the heavens, demanding He provide a solution,

745
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:16,520
 that He fix all their problems, they responded in a way that looked

746
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:19,360
 so much like Jesus.

747
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:25,960
 They chose to trust in the character of a God that had proven so many times

748
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:32,960
 in the past that He loved them, that He was for them.

749
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:39,160
 And all of their belief in this God ultimately led them to become

750
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:46,680
 like this God and make a decision that was so characteristic of Christ.

751
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:53,000
 They named their daughter Eden, which means paradise,

752
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:59,120
 because they wanted to use her story, tell the tale of her short life,

753
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:03,000
 that the world may know life is not just found in the here and the now.

754
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,440
 Life is found.

755
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:08,960
 Paradise is ahead forever and always.

756
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:15,560
 This is what it means to face the storm, to stand in it,

757
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:18,760
 not apart from God, but with God.

758
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:25,280
 It looks like crying out and trusting Him to catch you.

759
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,920
 That's what Peter does.

760
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,520
 Like he cries out for help in this moment.

761
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:33,840
 And immediately, Jesus reaches for him.

762
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:34,920
 I love that.

763
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:39,040
 Immediately, like Jesus is waiting and He reaches as fast as possible.

764
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:42,560
 And yet here's the thing, Jesus immediately reaches for him.

765
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,680
 He doesn't immediately resolve the problem.

766
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:47,160
 He doesn't immediately solve the storm.

767
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,360
 Some of us just want that.

768
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,880
 Like we just want a quick fix.

769
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:53,040
 We just want God to give us what we want and get out of the way.

770
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,480
 And yet Jesus is not saying that that's what He'll do.

771
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:58,160
 But what He is saying is that He will stand in the storm with you.

772
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,840
 He will reach for you and He will pull you out.

773
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,800
 That's what He does to Peter.

774
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:06,640
 And what you notice is that the storm doesn't resolve until they get back to the boat.

775
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:09,320
 Meaning that Peter, he comes back up out of the deep,

776
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,920
 and yet the storm is still raging around.

777
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:14,840
 Like there's chaos abounding.

778
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:17,000
 And yet there's total peace within.

779
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:17,960
 Why?

780
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:21,960
 Because he stood with Jesus.

781
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:24,160
 And I love this.

782
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,680
 We don't know that this is true.

783
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:28,160
 This is a total inference.

784
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:35,640
 And yet how do you think Peter actually got back to the boat?

785
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:40,520
 Again, this is just my belief.

786
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:44,400
 But I think that once Jesus reached and pulled him to his feet,

787
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:51,080
 they walked back to the boat together.

788
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:59,560
 Disciple and master, side by side, walking through the waves,

789
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:03,120
 one becoming like the other.

790
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:06,560
 So I don't know what the storms of your life look like.

791
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,400
 But what I know is that Jesus will use them to make us like Himself.

792
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:10,600
 Like He will complicate your life.

793
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:11,600
 He'll call you onto the water.

794
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:16,200
 He will catch you when you're drowning because He loves you too much to leave you as you are.

795
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:20,400
 And the reason I know that is because He was willing to become like us,

796
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,280
 to make all of this happen.

797
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:23,560
 But that's the story of the gospel.

798
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:28,480
 Like Jesus, He complicated His own life to cultivate our growth.

799
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:33,960
 Like He left heaven, He came to earth, and He endured all the trouble of mankind.

800
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:36,960
 He endured all the iniquity of our sin upon the cross.

801
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:41,560
 He complicated His life infinitely because He wanted you to grow.

802
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:43,480
 He wanted you to have life.

803
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:44,600
 He walked on the waters.

804
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:54,760
 Like Jesus walked over all the disorder and all the chaos in our life to ultimately make us like Himself.

805
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:56,880
 He went to the cross.

806
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:59,760
 He absorbed the consequence of our sin.

807
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:05,600
 He endured our shame that we might be with Him in glory.

808
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:10,480
 And what we know is that Jesus, He'll catch us if only we'll cry out.

809
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:17,400
 Like He rose from the grave that any who call on the name of the Lord may be saved.

810
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:23,960
 Listen, porch, you cannot become like Jesus until you come to Jesus.

811
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:32,880
 And I believe that for some of you, He's telling you to come tonight.

812
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,120
 Let me pray for us.

813
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:38,440
 God, we love you.

814
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:50,520
 God, I thank you that it's in your heart to make us like yourself.

815
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:55,360
 Not because you're insecure and egotistical and you need a bunch of little yous running around,

816
00:45:55,360 --> 00:46:03,680
 but because God, you know that the best thing for us is to be as much like Jesus as possible.

817
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:12,960
 We know that in walking like Christ, in loving like Christ, in serving like Christ, in living like Christ,

818
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:20,800
 we find all of the joy, all of the meaning, all of the purpose, all of the depth, all of the fullness,

819
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:25,680
 all of the satisfaction we so desperately long for.

820
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:29,840
 And I thank you, God, that you're willing to do whatever it takes,

821
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:34,280
 even lead us into uncomfortable spaces, upon difficult waters,

822
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:41,080
 and possibly into the depths of our own drowning to make it possible.

823
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:43,760
 Porch, look at me real quick.

824
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:47,520
 I think that there are a few responses here for us just on the basis of these three points.

825
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:51,960
 Number one, Jesus has complicated some of your lives.

826
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:55,000
 He's trying to cultivate your growth.

827
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:02,080
 That's you. I think the response is just a prayer of consent, that I consent, God.

828
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:09,680
 I yield. I surrender. I lay down. Have your way. Do in me what you want to do.

829
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:14,760
 For others of us, what we need to know is that he will call us on the waters because he wants to make us like him.

830
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:18,080
 For some of you, it's not consent.

831
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:30,120
 The response is to come. It's to move into the difficulty, into the unbelievability of whatever he's asking you to make the difficult decision,

832
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:34,640
 that you might ultimately arrive in his likeness.

833
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:41,800
 And for others of you, you are drowning in difficulty.

834
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:44,880
 You are sinking in your circumstance.

835
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:51,840
 And what you need to do tonight is you need to cry out and say, "God, save me. Save me."

836
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:55,880
 Because he will reach for you immediately.

837
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:59,040
 We believe it, God. And we respond to you now.

838
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:04,400
 Have your way in this space. Move amongst us, we pray. In Jesus' name, amen.
