[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740]   >> Hey, PORCH.
[00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.860]   Join me as we read God's word together.
[00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:13.820]   From the gospel of Matthew chapter 28 verses 16 through 20.
[00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:21.100]   Now the 11 disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain to which Jesus had directed them,
[00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:26.660]   and they saw him, they worshipped him, but some doubted.
[00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:34.100]   And Jesus came and said to them, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
[00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.860]   Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and
[00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:46.300]   the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all I have commanded you.
[00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.700]   And behold, I am with you always to the end of the age."
[00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.940]   Now our final message and our series called "Disciple."
[00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.460]   >> PORCH, how we doing?
[00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:02.460]   We doing okay?
[00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.540]   Hey, it's great to be together.
[00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:05.540]   Thanks for joining us here.
[00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.140]   I know it is Tuesday of Thanksgiving week, and yet I don't think you could be in a better
[00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.740]   place tonight.
[00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.380]   I think God has something really tremendous in store for us.
[00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.020]   I think that every week.
[00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.980]   And yet tonight, I think that he is going to serve something up that many of us need
[00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:21.980]   this evening.
[00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.940]   Now, before we get going, I do want to say hey to a couple of special locations that
[00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.660]   are tuning in with us from around the nation.
[00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.260]   Special shout out to Portsligh Fort Worth, special shout out to Portsligh Wheaton, and
[00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:33.940]   then Portsligh Greater Lafayette.
[00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:34.940]   We love you guys.
[00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.820]   We're grateful that God is working where you are and we get to be a small part of it.
[00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:47.140]   While it's not uncommon in ministry circles to show up to a gender specific worship event.
[00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.580]   Some of you have been to one of these before where you show up and it's an all guys or
[00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.540]   an all girls worship night.
[00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.780]   Now I've worked for a ministry where this was an annual, it was an annual regularity
[00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:58.780]   for us.
[00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.100]   We would always put on one every single year.
[00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.100]   And it was special.
[00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.180]   Like I didn't know what happened to girls nights, but I knew every time the guys got
[00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.500]   together, it was a really meaningful time.
[00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.740]   Like we would find frequent references to Braveheart and there would often be stories
[00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.700]   about hunting and lessons about women.
[00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.980]   Which doesn't feel any different than your regular time with the boys.
[00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.940]   And yet this was characterized by the sound of every man singing in their deepest possible
[00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.380]   voice.
[00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.380]   It was awesome.
[00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.060]   Now, to really put an exclamation point on these evenings, what we would do is we would
[00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.580]   always bring in a big, a big name guest speaker.
[00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.260]   Like we just wanted to really blow the top off and make it a really special time.
[00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.380]   And so we would do it with the girls, we would do it with the guys.
[00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.340]   And because I was on staff, part of my responsibility was just to host the guy, make sure that he
[00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.700]   didn't need for anything.
[00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.660]   And so we have a special guest speaker and I'm kind of his glorified shadow, a bodyguard
[00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:53.660]   of sorts.
[00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.020]   I know no fighting technique and yet here I am just trying to look as intimidating as
[00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.180]   possible and yet everything looks totally normal.
[00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.540]   There's no difficulty over the course of our entire evening.
[00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.460]   That is until I noticed what appeared to be some suspicious behavior.
[00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:12.580]   Now part of my job is to be on the lookout for things that are out of the ordinary or
[00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:13.580]   odd.
[00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.660]   And so when the evening began, things were fine.
[00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.580]   Worship started, the guys were gathering, they were booming with their voice.
[00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.940]   That is until I looked across the room and I saw what appeared to be something uniquely
[00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:27.940]   different.
[00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.760]   Suspicious, to say the least.
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.460]   Because across the room, there were two guys sitting there that looked different than the
[00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:35.940]   rest of the crowd.
[00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.740]   You see, you may be wondering what looked different about them.
[00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:40.420]   Well it was what they were wearing in specific.
[00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:46.080]   Now I never judge people for what they wear and yet these guys were dressed in black from
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:52.140]   head to toe, which is ironic now that I'm thinking about it.
[00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.180]   But it wasn't just that they were wearing black from head to toe, they had sun shades
[00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:00.720]   on, caps pulled low, hoods thrown up over their heads and their hands in their pocket
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.820]   and not trying to bring about any sort of attention to themselves.
[00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:10.180]   It's odd to say the least, especially when sun shades and sweatshirts don't make sense
[00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:15.740]   in a dark room where a bunch of burly men are gathered about singing and sweating all
[00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:16.740]   together.
[00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:17.740]   It just doesn't make sense.
[00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:21.200]   And so what I do is I grab a security guard and I make my way over to where these two
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.200]   guys are.
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:27.080]   And so we approach them very discreetly and as we get near to them we realize, man, okay,
[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.720]   they can't see us but we can't see them.
[00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.320]   And so I can't make out what's actually happening in this moment.
[00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:38.880]   And so we grab them and we pull them out into the hallway, escort them very gently into
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.500]   a lit space so that way we can pull their hoods, lift their glasses and identify what
[00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.080]   exactly is going on here.
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:51.320]   And I'm not kidding you when I say the most surprising thing happened in this moment.
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:57.600]   They were girls at the guy's worship night.
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.320]   So when I asked them, took them to task and begged them to tell me, "What are you doing
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.420]   here?"
[00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:08.200]   They told me that they just love this guest speaker so much.
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.880]   Now why do I tell you that?
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:16.520]   Because the minute we learned who these girls really were, we learned what they really cared
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:24.360]   about so much so that they put on a disguise, hide in plain sight and even endeavor to get
[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:28.200]   as close to this guy as humanly possible.
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:35.760]   You see, tonight we're going to see who Jesus really is, that he is the resurrected king.
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:40.880]   And we're going to see as a result what he really cares about, saving the world and bringing
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:47.440]   as many people into his kingdom as possible, so much so that he would put on a disguise.
[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:53.560]   He would hide in plain sight because he wants to get as close to you and me as he can.
[00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:57.480]   So if you have a Bible, turn with me to Matthew chapter 28.
[00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:58.840]   It's what Franklin read a minute ago.
[00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.020]   We're just going to work our way through it.
[00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:05.940]   You know this passage famously as the great commission, which as I say that many of you
[00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.560]   just immediately begin to check out.
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:12.960]   You've heard the lessons, you've read the stories, you've memorized the verses, you
[00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.520]   know this thing better than I do.
[00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.400]   You might as well come up here and preach it yourself.
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:20.960]   And yet here's what I would endeavor in this moment to say, I don't know that we know the
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:24.480]   great commission as well as we think.
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:29.260]   And so tonight what I want to do is I just want to walk us through this passage of scripture
[00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:35.440]   and I want to save us from falling prey to being too Christian for our own good.
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:40.160]   Meaning we know all about Jesus, but we don't really know Jesus himself.
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:44.540]   You see, we've been in a series called Disciple where we've been talking about that idea,
[00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:50.160]   the idea of walking with Christ in the wonder of who he is, because I have this deep seated
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:55.160]   fear like as I've visited with people over the course of my year now, what I've seen
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:07:00.600]   in our people that I'm desperately praying God would save us from is spiritual apathy.
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:07.000]   What I'm asking the Lord to do is to give us a sense of holy urgency because I see too
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:13.160]   many of us slipping into the motions of being a Christian, going to the Bible studies, raising
[00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:16.980]   our hands and singing the songs and praying some prayers and dropping money in the collection
[00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:19.780]   plate that we don't pass collection plates any longer.
[00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:27.340]   We are slipping into the motions of becoming, of being good Christians, but we're not, we're
[00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:35.040]   not moving with the kind of motivation to become like Christ.
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:40.920]   And so tonight, as we work through this chapter, here's what we're going to see.
[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:45.360]   Jesus, he wants what you want.
[00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:49.880]   So many of us, we're not motivated to become like Christ because we're motivated to become
[00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:50.880]   something else.
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:54.120]   We want to be impactful or we want to make a difference or we want to become someone
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:55.120]   significant.
[00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.840]   We want to be connected to something that matters.
[00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:57.840]   We want to leave a legacy.
[00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:00.720]   Like we want to make a difference in the world.
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:03.880]   And Jesus wants the same thing for you.
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:08.320]   And yet what he knows that we need to know tonight that we have worked all series long
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:14.240]   to help you understand is that will not be found anywhere else, but it will be found
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:17.000]   with him.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:24.420]   All of that that you long for, it is found in this man and not this world.
[00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:33.120]   You see Jesus, he wants to connect you to something that is so significant, is so important.
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.120]   Like it's so climactic.
[00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:35.640]   It's even dramatic.
[00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:40.580]   Even he has a purpose for your life.
[00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:44.400]   And tonight we're going to talk about what that purpose is.
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:48.160]   And he's given us the great commission to clarify it.
[00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:52.360]   But before we can talk about what that purpose is, we've got to talk about who that purpose
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:53.360]   is for.
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:57.880]   So this is what it says, Matthew 28, starting in verse 16.
[00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:03.440]   It says, "Now the 11 disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain to which Jesus had directed
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:04.440]   them.
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.120]   And when they saw him, they worshiped him.
[00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:07.120]   But some doubted."
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:08.640]   We'll stop there.
[00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:11.680]   What we need to know as we come to this passage is that Jesus has risen from the dead.
[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:14.360]   He has appeared to not one, but two different Marys.
[00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:19.440]   And he has given these ladies instructions on where his disciples should meet him.
[00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:24.040]   He's literally dropped a pin in their ancient near Eastern GPS and said, "Hey, this is where
[00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:25.040]   I'm going to be.
[00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:26.280]   Send the boys to find me."
[00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:31.680]   And what we know about that location is it's in Galilee at the mountain.
[00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:32.680]   Why does that matter?
[00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:36.800]   Often when we read these types of things, we catch a location and we just kind of steamroll
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:37.800]   by it.
[00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:38.800]   We just keep moving, right?
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:39.880]   Because that's not important information.
[00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:40.880]   There's more going on here.
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:41.880]   Jesus is going to say some things.
[00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:42.880]   I want to know what he's saying.
[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:47.320]   And yet this location is incredibly significant for a couple of reasons.
[00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:50.920]   Number one, he says he's going to the mountain.
[00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:54.880]   Now there's a lot of debate about what mountain Jesus is speaking about.
[00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:58.920]   Some scholars think that he's talking about the Mount of Commission, which is where he
[00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:03.680]   ascended to a high place and he called his disciples to himself and he commissioned them
[00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:07.120]   to become his disciples, to follow him.
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:11.440]   Others believe it's where he taught the Sermon on the Mount, where he unpacked what the upside
[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:12.720]   down kingdom looked like.
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:17.400]   He gave us kingdom ethics and kingdom economy so that way we knew how we could work through
[00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:23.000]   this world, living in the kingdom that he has inaugurated and handed over to us.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.760]   But here's what I think.
[00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:29.840]   I think that what Jesus is speaking about is the Mount of Transfiguration.
[00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:31.560]   The Mount of Transfiguration.
[00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:35.280]   If you're not familiar with what the Mount of Transfiguration is, it's a mount that Jesus
[00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:39.560]   ascended, located in Galilee, where he transfigured.
[00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:46.600]   Galilee, the Greek there is metamorpho, that he transformed in front of three disciples,
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:50.440]   Peter, James, and John, and he revealed to them exactly who he is.
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:54.840]   It's kind of like what happens at your wedding when you lift the veil on your bride and you
[00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:56.360]   behold all her beauty.
[00:10:56.360 --> 00:11:01.920]   Jesus lifted the veil and he revealed to his disciples, "Hey, this is who I am.
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:02.920]   I'm amazing.
[00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:04.360]   I'm splendorous.
[00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:05.480]   I'm marvelous.
[00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:07.080]   I am not just a man.
[00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:08.680]   I am the son of man.
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:10.600]   I am not just a good teacher.
[00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:16.120]   I am a God-like figure because I am the son of God himself."
[00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:18.640]   That's what Jesus did at the Mount of Transfiguration.
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:22.320]   And the reason I think, as well as many other scholars, it's not just me, there's veracity
[00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:28.160]   to this point, is because Jesus in this chapter, chapter 28, he says, as well as the angel
[00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:35.080]   who appeared to Mary and the other Mary, that they shall come to Galilee where they shall
[00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:38.320]   see me.
[00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:40.040]   See me.
[00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:45.080]   There's one mountain in Galilee where they truly saw Jesus.
[00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:47.280]   Now why does that even matter?
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:52.600]   Because Jesus wants to verify for his disciples here in this climactic moment where he's risen
[00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:56.880]   from the dead and he's going to commission them out that he is who he says he is.
[00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:58.280]   He wants there to be no mistake.
[00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:00.520]   Hey, this is who I say I am.
[00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:04.120]   And to prove it, I'm leading you back to the place where I gave you a teaser one time before,
[00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:08.240]   and yet now I'm going to cement the idea as reality in your world.
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:12.760]   But then he also says that he needs them to come to Galilee.
[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:13.920]   Why does Galilee matter?
[00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:18.920]   Well, Galilee matters for a couple of different reasons, primarily because it was the place
[00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:24.840]   where the disciples walked with Jesus over the course of his earthly ministry.
[00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:30.240]   Like this is the place where they were called to follow him and they saw him do everything
[00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:31.240]   that he did.
[00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:34.560]   They heard the lessons and they saw the stories unfold.
[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:37.800]   It's why as we've over the course of this series been staring through their perspective
[00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:43.360]   at Jesus, seeking to learn what it means to walk with him because they saw him themselves
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:45.000]   and walked with him personally.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.400]   So he leads them to Galilee.
[00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:50.520]   And what's significant, catch this, this is so cool.
[00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:55.280]   They are in Jerusalem when they get the command, the instruction to rendezvous with him in
[00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:56.460]   Galilee.
[00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:57.800]   That means they've got a journey ahead.
[00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:59.240]   They've got to get up and they've got to move.
[00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:02.840]   Yet what's so significant about it is they are South and they've got to go North.
[00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:09.360]   And as they go North, they are literally going to retrace every step, see every site, smell
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:13.360]   the same smells, speak to the same people more than likely that they encountered over
[00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:15.000]   the course of their ministry with him.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.360]   He wants to take them down memory lane.
[00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:22.160]   He wants to do with them what I did with my wife on our one year dating anniversary.
[00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:28.440]   He wants to relive all of the beauty and the glory and the wonder of what happened in our
[00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:29.860]   first year together.
[00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:31.000]   That's what I did with Brooke.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.680]   That's what many of you have done yourself.
[00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:35.240]   That's what many of you probably should do yourself.
[00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:39.960]   It's a really good date idea so you can take a note and slip it away in your journal.
[00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:42.360]   Why did I do that with Brooke?
[00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:46.040]   Choose to relive year one with her.
[00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:51.800]   Not just to contemplate the past, but to accelerate our future.
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:55.560]   Like I knew as we look back, we're going to catch a vision for what's ahead.
[00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:58.880]   As we think about how good this has been, we're going to be motivated for how great
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:13:59.960]   it's going to be.
[00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:01.920]   And Jesus wants to do the same thing.
[00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:07.840]   Where I had big plans for Brooke and I, Jesus has big plans for he and the disciples.
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:10.840]   He has a purpose for their life.
[00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:13.920]   He is inviting them into something so special.
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:19.200]   And so he takes them back where it all began because he wants them to know, hey, as good
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:22.760]   as it was, it's only going to get better.
[00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:26.160]   The other reason he takes them to Galilee, which I think is really important, is it adds
[00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:34.240]   veracity to the fact that the great commission did not happen right before Christ's ascension.
[00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:38.200]   That moment where he looks to heaven and says, "Beam me up, Scotty."
[00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:39.840]   They didn't happen concurrently.
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:41.640]   Some of us, we don't know that.
[00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:46.280]   It's a common misconception that Jesus gave these words, he said this command, and then
[00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:47.880]   he went straight to heaven.
[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:53.920]   And yet Acts 1-3 tells us that he presented himself alive to them after his suffering
[00:14:53.920 --> 00:15:01.520]   by many proofs, appearing to them during 40 days and speaking about the kingdom of God.
[00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:06.680]   Like Jesus puts on this 40-day masterclass because he wants to prove to them, "Hey, I
[00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:11.760]   am who I said I am, and I'm going to prepare you for what I've called you to do."
[00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:19.400]   There were 40 days between his resurrection and his ascension, which I think is amazing,
[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:29.720]   given the fact that upon his appearance, some worshipped him, but some doubted him.
[00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:31.640]   How does that make you feel, knowing that?
[00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:35.840]   That some of these disciples, they doubted him.
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:40.200]   The resurrected king, I love it.
[00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:44.120]   I think it's amazing, which may not be necessarily what you were feeling.
[00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:49.080]   And yet the reason I love it is because, number one, it adds proof, veracity.
[00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:52.080]   It gives substance to the fact that this isn't fiction.
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:57.840]   Like if the disciples were just going to make up Christianity, you don't put a giant gaping
[00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:03.080]   hole in the story that other people can pour water through and ultimately puncture unto
[00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:04.080]   disbelief.
[00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:05.080]   You don't do that.
[00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:06.080]   That would be a terrible idea.
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:08.640]   No, you want to present an airtight defense that Jesus is the son of God.
[00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:12.400]   He rose from the dead and everybody believed, and yet that's not what happens.
[00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:15.440]   The story doesn't read that way because the story's true.
[00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:18.320]   They recounted history in this moment.
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:23.280]   But I also love it because it leads us to our first point.
[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:32.640]   It tells us who Jesus' purpose is for, that Jesus gives purpose to saints and skeptics
[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:35.360]   and screw-ups.
[00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:37.740]   He gives purpose to saints and skeptics and screw-ups.
[00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:39.600]   Which one there are you?
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:42.740]   You see, the saints are the ones that worshipped him.
[00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:47.120]   And yet we know that some doubt it, that there are skeptics in their midst.
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:53.320]   Like these are the 11 disciples, the very men that Jesus handpicked himself, that watched
[00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:59.040]   him firsthand in his ministry, that beheld all of the incredible things we just wish
[00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:00.200]   we could see ourselves.
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:04.880]   Like as they walked with him, they saw him calm the storm and walk on the water and multiply
[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:10.340]   the loaves and turn water into wine and heal the sick and raise the dead and exercise demons.
[00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:20.680]   They saw amazing things, and yet even still, some doubted.
[00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:24.240]   It's kind of like when I went rappelling for the very first time in my life.
[00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:25.440]   Anybody been rappelling in here?
[00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:27.360]   Show of hands just around the room.
[00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:29.800]   Yeah, I mean, you can attest to this.
[00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:32.100]   I don't care how brave or bold you are.
[00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:37.760]   The first time you go rappelling, which is walking down the side of a cliff face, traversing
[00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:42.720]   an overhang, what you feel is some sense of anxiety.
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:43.720]   Like you can't help it.
[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:47.240]   Like you start to pit a little bit, your hands get clammy, because the thought of walking
[00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:52.680]   backwards off of a cliff is stupid.
[00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:53.880]   Let's just make no mistake about it.
[00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:56.240]   Like that's a crazy thing to do.
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:18:00.200]   And yet here in this moment, I understood, like we went through this really extensive
[00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:03.640]   safety briefing that took far longer than I actually thought necessary.
[00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:06.920]   They explained to me the fact that the rope I would be rappelling from could hold something
[00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:11.720]   upwards of 8,000 pounds, which I am nowhere close in proximity to.
[00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:16.520]   I watched peer after peer after peer after peer do the very thing which I was going to
[00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:17.520]   do myself.
[00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:19.480]   I had them check and double check and triple check.
[00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:20.960]   I didn't have them quadruple check.
[00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:24.080]   All of my gear to make sure that I was safe and ready to go.
[00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:28.480]   And yet even still, despite the fact that there was so much evidence that I was going
[00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:36.520]   to be okay, I still felt some anxiousness, some stress.
[00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:41.160]   Like I couldn't help the inner voice, my very own conscience telling me, "Hey man, they're
[00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:43.120]   out to get you.
[00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:44.480]   This is all one big charade.
[00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:45.960]   Don't believe what they're saying.
[00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:47.160]   Don't look at what's happening.
[00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:48.860]   You're going to be the exception."
[00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:53.000]   And yet how did I get down that cliff face?
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:58.200]   Well, not wanting to be a coward, I rappelled down it.
[00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:06.480]   And the way that I did so, despite my doubt, is I wrestled through my doubt.
[00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:15.680]   I wrestled through it by trusting the fact my guide is who he says he is.
[00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:24.840]   And so I could take one backward step of faith at a time until I too slipped over the lip
[00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:31.840]   of that cliff face and found myself walking in an experience the likes of which I had
[00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:35.080]   not known in this world.
[00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:39.760]   I experienced wonder.
[00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:42.160]   Jesus knows you'll doubt.
[00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:44.200]   He's not disappointed by it.
[00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:46.540]   He's not concerned when you question.
[00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:48.360]   He's not annoyed by your anxieties.
[00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:54.920]   He isn't ignorant to the fact that this life is hard, that trouble abounds, that difficulty
[00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:55.920]   will come.
[00:19:55.920 --> 00:20:01.040]   He even says so himself that in this world you're going to have trouble, but take heart.
[00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:04.120]   I've overcome the world.
[00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:05.320]   He knows.
[00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:10.520]   Some of you in this room right here tonight in the realest way possible, you've taken
[00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:15.060]   some hits because of your allegiance to him.
[00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:16.640]   Allegiance to him has cost you family.
[00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:17.640]   It's cost you friends.
[00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:18.640]   It's cost you relationships.
[00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:24.760]   Convictions to Christ have led you to break off relationships and set aside friendships.
[00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:30.920]   You have felt persecution because you choose to follow him.
[00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:33.040]   He's not naive nor unknown to that reality.
[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:37.760]   He knows it's going to be hard.
[00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:41.000]   You'll have good reason for doubt.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:48.980]   He's not surprised, and yet he wants to do with you what he did with them.
[00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:54.360]   He wants to take you to the mount, back to that place, that moment where you were clear
[00:20:54.360 --> 00:21:01.880]   in knowing he is who he says he is, and he wants to walk you to Galilee, back to the
[00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:05.200]   place where you remember every step you've taken with him before, and you can be assured
[00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:09.640]   of the fact that he is as faithful today as he was back then.
[00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:15.240]   You see, Jesus, he doesn't give up on you.
[00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:17.880]   So don't give up on him either.
[00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:18.880]   Lean in.
[00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:21.060]   Push forward.
[00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:25.780]   It's never too late with Christ.
[00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:29.200]   We see he has purpose for saints, those that worship.
[00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:32.360]   He has purpose for skeptics, those that doubt.
[00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:37.280]   And we see that he has purpose for screw-ups, which you may not have seen it in the passage
[00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:42.080]   because it's subtly tucked away in there, and yet what we know is that there are 11
[00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:44.160]   disciples in this moment.
[00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:45.640]   Some of you are like, "Well, there were 12.
[00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:48.040]   One of them, he hit the hay.
[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:49.720]   Judas is gone."
[00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:53.220]   And yet what we know is that 11 still exist.
[00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:54.440]   That should catch us off guard.
[00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:56.800]   That should feel surprising.
[00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:58.240]   Why?
[00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:02.400]   Because that means Peter's numbered amongst their group.
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:07.240]   He's the last person that should be in this room because he's the first person that abandoned,
[00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:08.720]   abandoned Jesus.
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:19.920]   And yet Peter, this major screw-up, he's here in this moment receiving Christ's purpose
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:27.840]   and moving towards a life of meaning and significance and importance and magnitude that he's longed
[00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:29.680]   for and you likewise long for.
[00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:34.760]   Some of you are here and you don't need me to list all of the different ways we screw
[00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:45.520]   up because you can look in yourself and find that area which you cringe most painfully
[00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:48.440]   and know it's likely true of you.
[00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:52.800]   What I would say to you is what Dane Ortlund has said, "Where you cringe most painfully,
[00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:58.200]   it is there that Christ hugs most invincibly."
[00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:05.320]   He has a purpose for you, but the way you return to that purpose is you follow the example
[00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:07.400]   of Peter.
[00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:09.720]   You repent of your sins.
[00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:13.080]   Not some of it, not most of it, all of it.
[00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:16.400]   The whole 100%, you confess it to God.
[00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:21.480]   You receive his forgiveness because I promise you, you will not outrace the grace of God
[00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:23.640]   for your life.
[00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:25.620]   No one is too far.
[00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:29.920]   No one can outrun his reach.
[00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:31.920]   He has forgiveness for you.
[00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:36.360]   And then what you believe is he has a purpose as well.
[00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:42.640]   You see, Jesus is in the business of taking really broken stories and making them into
[00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:48.920]   really beautiful subjects that magnify the glory of God and speak to the love he has
[00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:51.120]   for you and for me.
[00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:53.000]   He did it for Peter.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.260]   If you're a screw up here, he wants to do it for you.
[00:23:57.260 --> 00:23:58.760]   He has a purpose for all of us.
[00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:00.140]   So what is that purpose?
[00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:03.080]   We know who that purpose is for, but what is the purpose exactly?
[00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:07.040]   Well, we read it in verse 18.
[00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:14.480]   And Jesus came and he said to them, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been
[00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:16.340]   given to me.
[00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:21.640]   Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and
[00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:25.760]   of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I've commanded you.
[00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:26.760]   And guess what?
[00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:30.840]   I will be with you always to the end of the age."
[00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:34.040]   Now I don't know about you, but if you're anything like me, then these verses, they
[00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:35.560]   can read like marching orders.
[00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:36.840]   Do you ever get that when you read the Bible?
[00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:39.960]   Like you're kind of working your way along and it's like, "And another to do, and another
[00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:41.120]   to do, and another to do.
[00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:44.640]   Okay, I'm like writing them out because these are the things that I'm supposed to keep.
[00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:46.800]   These are the commands I'm supposed to follow.
[00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:51.160]   This is the string of imperatives I'm supposed to guide and order my life according to."
[00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:53.640]   That's what this feels like for me.
[00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:56.920]   Like a list of marching orders that I, the good soldier of Christ, am supposed to do
[00:24:56.920 --> 00:25:02.640]   as I move my way into foreign territory to the glory of God and to save the world.
[00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:09.080]   And yet what you need to know is that this is not a series of commands, but in fact,
[00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:11.480]   it's a single command.
[00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:12.480]   That's what the Greek would say.
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:13.480]   So then what is the command?
[00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:18.400]   Well, the command that Jesus gives us to follow, the very single and sole command he wants
[00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:24.440]   us to know is that we're called to make disciples.
[00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:25.440]   This is it.
[00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:29.560]   The final command that Jesus ever gave, some of his famous last words.
[00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:34.200]   So then what does he mean when he says make disciples?
[00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:40.260]   He means this, put very simply, the goal isn't to make believers.
[00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:43.000]   It's to make becomers.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.920]   Now I say that, and I know some of your antenna just went up.
[00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:51.040]   Some of you feel some creep under your skin that that's heretical.
[00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:52.040]   That doesn't make sense.
[00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:53.040]   That isn't correct.
[00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:58.880]   And yet let me just explain to you why I've written it the way it's written.
[00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:04.600]   You see, these two things, believing and becoming, they go hand in hand.
[00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:09.800]   And so it doesn't make sense that you can be one who believes in Christ and yet not
[00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:12.860]   one who becomes like Christ.
[00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:14.440]   It makes no sense whatsoever.
[00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:19.500]   There's no scriptural precedent that you could be one who has found Jesus but not following
[00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:20.500]   after Jesus.
[00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:22.400]   It doesn't make sense.
[00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:24.520]   It's not in the word.
[00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:29.440]   And so I've written this for some shock and some awe to kind of catch our attention that
[00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:41.160]   Jesus, he desperately, desperately wants to lead you into becoming like Christ.
[00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:47.580]   Which means that we don't just tell people what they're saved from.
[00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:50.740]   We tell people what they're saved for.
[00:26:50.740 --> 00:26:57.060]   That they're saved for a relationship with God, deep connection to other people, a kind
[00:26:57.060 --> 00:27:02.060]   of diversity in the family that will grow them, stretch them, build them up, that they're
[00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:06.860]   connected to a life of significant meaning and impact and difference making.
[00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:07.960]   That's what's true for them now.
[00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:09.580]   They've been saved for that.
[00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:12.020]   And yet here's the reality.
[00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:16.820]   Often when we read the Great Commission, what we think of is evangelism.
[00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:19.940]   But what Jesus just said is it's about discipleship.
[00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:21.420]   That's what it's about.
[00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:27.860]   Like salvation, the purpose of evangelism, we often consider as essential.
[00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:30.860]   Yet discipleship is just kind of optional.
[00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:35.520]   Like salvation, that's the main mission.
[00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:38.220]   Discipleship is just kind of a side quest that some of us go on but you don't necessarily
[00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:40.140]   have to do.
[00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:41.900]   Not according to Jesus.
[00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:45.080]   That's not how he feels about this at all.
[00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:50.780]   You see, he wants to not only lead us into a life where we tell people what they're saved
[00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:52.980]   from but ultimately what they're saved for.
[00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:54.820]   Are you tracking with what I mean by that?
[00:27:54.820 --> 00:27:55.820]   Just catch it like this.
[00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:59.740]   No one gets married to save themselves from loneliness.
[00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:03.300]   If that's you, let me spare you the trouble.
[00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:05.300]   Buy a dog.
[00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:10.500]   If that's all you want to get married for, that will accomplish the purpose, ladies.
[00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:15.780]   Your dog will comfort you in the midst of your loneliness more than some man might.
[00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:17.500]   Don't fall prey to that idea.
[00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:18.500]   Why?
[00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:22.580]   No one goes to the grocery store and picks the food they pick to save themselves from
[00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:23.580]   starvation.
[00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:28.980]   No, they pick the food they pick to give them the kind of joy that something really tasty
[00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:32.220]   has to offer.
[00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:33.780]   You're not just saved from something.
[00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:36.180]   You are saved for something.
[00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:39.540]   That's what Jesus is getting at here in the great commission.
[00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:45.340]   He wants the emphasis to not solely reside on people finding him but people following
[00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:47.540]   him.
[00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:53.500]   Now let me be really clear, really clear because I don't want the email.
[00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:59.340]   I'm not saying that we don't help people find Jesus.
[00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:02.820]   If you're hearing that from me, then you're not listening.
[00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:13.100]   Yes, and amen, we help people find Jesus.
[00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:18.380]   But you shouldn't be able to find Jesus and not follow him.
[00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:21.100]   You shouldn't be able to find him and not follow him.
[00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:25.060]   That doesn't make sense according to the word of God.
[00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:30.020]   Matthew 7, 1720, Jesus himself says, "So every healthy tree, it bears good fruit, but the
[00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:32.060]   diseased tree bears bad fruit.
[00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:36.300]   A healthy tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a diseased tree bear good fruit.
[00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:39.820]   Every tree that does not bear good fruit, it's cut down, thrown into the fire.
[00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:43.820]   Thus, you will recognize the trees by their fruits."
[00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:48.820]   John 13, 34, 35, "A new commandment I give to you that you love one another.
[00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:52.500]   Just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another.
[00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:53.500]   Do you catch it?
[00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:56.580]   Don't just believe, become, just as I've loved you, love one another.
[00:29:56.580 --> 00:30:00.700]   By this," guess what, "all people will know that you are my," what?
[00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:01.700]   My converts.
[00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:06.500]   No, "my disciples, if you love one another."
[00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:12.580]   James 1, 22-24 says, "Do not merely listen to the word and so deceive yourselves.
[00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:14.240]   Do what it says.
[00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:17.140]   Anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says is like someone who looks
[00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:22.140]   at his face in a mirror and after looking at himself, goes away and immediately forgets
[00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:24.220]   what he looks like."
[00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:26.040]   What are these verses saying?
[00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:32.340]   If you believe in him, you should become like him.
[00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:40.500]   Like true faith, it isn't just content in finding Jesus.
[00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:47.500]   True faith is urgent in following after him.
[00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:52.620]   Christian, listen to me.
[00:30:52.620 --> 00:31:00.220]   If that doesn't put fire in your bones, then this message is for you.
[00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:02.660]   Then this message is for you because here's the reality.
[00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:09.260]   I think that so many of us, if we did a sincere evaluation, if we took a hard look in the
[00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:12.140]   mirror, if we just got really gut level honest with ourselves for a moment, what we would
[00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:19.140]   realize is that we claim to have found Jesus, we're not following Jesus at all.
[00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:22.500]   We're following something different instead.
[00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:27.820]   How do you know what it is you're following in life?
[00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:31.500]   Well take the advice of Instagram.
[00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:35.420]   You subscribe to the ones that you follow.
[00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:39.900]   And once you do, their influence fills your feed.
[00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:45.080]   If you want to know who you follow, then answer the question, whose influence fills the feed
[00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:49.180]   of your life?
[00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:52.740]   Whose influence fills the feed of your life?
[00:31:52.740 --> 00:32:03.760]   Like when it comes to approval, are you influenced by what Jesus has to say about you?
[00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:11.000]   Are you listening instead to what everyone else, all of your peers have to say in contrast?
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:20.200]   Like when it comes to coping, are you influenced by the promises that Jesus has given you or
[00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:27.440]   are you persuaded instead to indulge some substance, some shopping, some subscription,
[00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:30.600]   some sexuality?
[00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:34.800]   When it comes to your security, like are you influenced by the fact that Jesus controls
[00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:35.800]   everything?
[00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:40.480]   What an amazing reality.
[00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:48.920]   Or are you just trusting like your pocketbook to give you security in life instead?
[00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:55.400]   When it comes to your reputation, are you influenced by the fact that Jesus wants to
[00:32:55.400 --> 00:33:00.000]   make you into his image?
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:07.720]   Or are you more concerned with carefully crafting your image yourself?
[00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:13.540]   You see, Jesus wants you to follow him because you're going to follow something.
[00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:16.800]   So the question tonight is whose influence are you following?
[00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:27.360]   Porch, I need you to catch this because I love you enough to say this.
[00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:36.000]   If you're not following Jesus, then your purpose in life, it's impossible.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:42.320]   It's impossible because you can't make followers of a Jesus that you are unwilling to follow
[00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:44.760]   yourself.
[00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:47.120]   No.
[00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:56.760]   No, you follow him because whatever it is you want to find, I promise you.
[00:33:56.760 --> 00:34:00.760]   It's yes and amen in him.
[00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:03.720]   Now as we talk through this, here's the thing.
[00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:06.360]   Some of you are really resonating, really jiving with this.
[00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:12.940]   Like you feel this deep desire, almost this desperation to like finally just like get
[00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:14.200]   out of what you're in.
[00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:18.920]   Like to stop riding one foot in, one foot out, but to go both feet of faith all the
[00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:21.920]   way into what God is wanting for your life.
[00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:26.340]   And yet you don't know where to start.
[00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:30.680]   If that's you, if you're desperately wanting to take action on these things tonight to
[00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:36.200]   actually live into the purpose that Jesus has for you, hear me, we want to help.
[00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:43.840]   And so I and the team, we have been working for months now to organize a way in which
[00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:44.840]   we can do it.
[00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:49.160]   So starting in the new year, for the very first time ever in Porch history, we're doing
[00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:51.960]   something that we've never done.
[00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:56.020]   We're launching a discipleship initiative.
[00:34:56.020 --> 00:34:58.060]   And we want to invite you to come and be a part of it.
[00:34:58.060 --> 00:35:00.960]   If you're here and you're like, man, I want to make disciples, but I've never been made
[00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:01.960]   into a disciple.
[00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:05.080]   No one's ever shown me the ropes or taught me how to go, but I want to be spiritually
[00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:06.080]   developed.
[00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:07.080]   I want to be God.
[00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:08.080]   I want to grow in my godliness.
[00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:10.680]   I want to take ground and mature in Christ.
[00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:13.640]   If that's you, then this is for you.
[00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:16.660]   And we'd love to bring you on board and let you be a part of it.
[00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:23.040]   And so what you need to do is you just need to text the word discipleship to 40585.
[00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:26.000]   And what it'll do is it'll just, it'll lead you to an interest form.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   That's all it is.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   There's no hard commitment right now.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.400]   We're not taking any money tonight.
[00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:30.400]   There's nothing like that happening.
[00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:31.400]   Okay.
[00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:33.040]   So you can just calm down.
[00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:34.840]   This is just an interest form.
[00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:37.400]   You're just simply saying, Hey man, like I care about it.
[00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:38.400]   I want to follow.
[00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:39.400]   I want to go all in.
[00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:40.400]   I'm ready.
[00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:41.880]   I'm tired of hanging one foot out.
[00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:43.880]   I want to be all the way in with Jesus.
[00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:46.880]   And if that's you, then, then you need to scan this or you need to text this.
[00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:49.080]   And what'll happen is it'll lead you to a form.
[00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:50.280]   You'll fill out some info.
[00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:51.280]   We'll collect that.
[00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:54.320]   And then we will touch base with you in the new year when we launched this discipleship
[00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:55.320]   initiative.
[00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:57.440]   Now, let me say a couple of things.
[00:35:57.440 --> 00:36:02.520]   When you do so, there is a small barrier to entry because you've got to create a log in
[00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:04.280]   if you don't have one.
[00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:05.560]   I'm sorry.
[00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:07.560]   Wish we could remove that for you, make it easier.
[00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:11.440]   And yet if that's all it takes to throw you off the trail of following after Jesus and
[00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:15.240]   getting serious about your discipleship, then you're probably not ready for it.
[00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:18.680]   In reality, tough news.
[00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:20.880]   I promise you can do it.
[00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:24.960]   Others of you, you're here tonight and you're like, man, no, I have been discipled.
[00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:27.040]   I'm eager to learn the way in which I should go forward.
[00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:28.120]   We've got stuff for you too.
[00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:31.560]   So just hang with us because we believe that it's not just the disciple, but the disciple
[00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:34.400]   maker that we want to invest in as well.
[00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:37.640]   But here's the thing, and I just want to speak to you really straight about it because I'm
[00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:39.920]   really serious about this.
[00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:47.240]   If you're not serious about actually being a part of this, then will you just not, will
[00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:49.920]   you just not jump in?
[00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:54.160]   Because we're going to be really serious about the people that do.
[00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:59.600]   And I want to give them my whole yes, my undivided commitment to helping them grow in Christ
[00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:00.600]   likeness.
[00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:04.680]   And I would love for that to be you if you're here and you want to hop in.
[00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:07.440]   Now, a couple of things you should know.
[00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:12.640]   Number one, to PortsLive, this program is not built for you specifically, but what I
[00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:17.340]   guarantee you is your local church context does have something that they would love to
[00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:18.340]   invite you into.
[00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:21.940]   And so tonight what you need to do is you need to take action on just approaching a
[00:37:21.940 --> 00:37:24.480]   church leader and telling them, "Hey, I'm ready.
[00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:25.560]   I'm serious.
[00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:27.000]   I want to go all in.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.360]   My chips aren't held back.
[00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:30.320]   They're pushed full forward.
[00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:32.360]   Help me grow in my godliness.
[00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:34.040]   Teach me to walk with Jesus.
[00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:35.240]   I want to be discipled."
[00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:39.360]   I promise you they would love to have that conversation and they will have a next step
[00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:40.360]   for you.
[00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:44.200]   The second thing that you all need to know is this isn't replacing Tuesday nights, okay?
[00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:48.840]   We're still going to gather, sit in this room, bring our friends, meet other friends, sing
[00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:50.840]   to God, study his word.
[00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:52.540]   Our bread and butter is not changing.
[00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:58.300]   We just want to help you take a first step and help you take a next step.
[00:37:58.300 --> 00:37:59.460]   So that's what this all means.
[00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:00.460]   You tracking?
[00:38:00.460 --> 00:38:01.460]   Good?
[00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:02.460]   Okay.
[00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:03.460]   Now here's the thing.
[00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:09.220]   Some of you, when I unpack this idea, what happens is we get a really mixed bag of response.
[00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:13.240]   We fall in a wide variety of places because while we understand the call of Christ and
[00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:16.940]   what it means to go all in with Jesus and we even grasp the fact that this is a really
[00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:23.000]   noble cause, we feel some reservation, some hesitation, some trepidation of getting in
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:27.240]   with Christ, going in on this mission.
[00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:31.580]   We come up with plenty of reasons to find not to embrace this as our purpose.
[00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:35.220]   Let me just say this as plainly as possible.
[00:38:35.220 --> 00:38:41.980]   None of the reasons you find are good reasons because there are no good exceptions to the
[00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:44.300]   great commission.
[00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:47.380]   There are no good exceptions to the great commission.
[00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:50.180]   Like this isn't mission impossible.
[00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:53.100]   This isn't your mission should you choose to accept it.
[00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:55.580]   This isn't a message that's going to terminate in 10 seconds.
[00:38:55.580 --> 00:39:00.740]   No, this message is an impervious message because this call stands the test of time
[00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:07.340]   and goes over the course of all eternity until Christ himself comes back.
[00:39:07.340 --> 00:39:09.300]   This is your mission.
[00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:11.860]   He's come to make it clear.
[00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:16.500]   That's why he says, "Go, baptize and teach."
[00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:17.860]   Make disciples.
[00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:18.860]   You should go.
[00:39:18.860 --> 00:39:19.860]   You should baptize them.
[00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:22.740]   You should teach them all that I've commanded you.
[00:39:22.740 --> 00:39:23.740]   What is he unpacking there?
[00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:27.260]   Well, those three words, go, baptize and teach.
[00:39:27.260 --> 00:39:30.240]   They are present participles.
[00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:32.780]   Just to put your grammar hat on for a minute.
[00:39:32.780 --> 00:39:36.700]   And the reason they're added into this text and we're bringing them up right now is because
[00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:42.100]   what they do is they accentuate the main command of the passage.
[00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:49.080]   Like it's the same idea as if you had a picture that was set in black and white, yet you chose
[00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:50.500]   to add color to it.
[00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:51.500]   What would happen?
[00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:57.020]   The picture itself would not change and yet the vibrancy of the photo, it would increase.
[00:39:57.020 --> 00:40:00.460]   It would get better because you've accentuated it appropriately.
[00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:03.660]   That's what these present participles are doing to Christ's command.
[00:40:03.660 --> 00:40:04.660]   But they're not just doing that.
[00:40:04.660 --> 00:40:07.700]   They're not just qualifying what it means to make disciples.
[00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:11.100]   What they're doing is they're also in the process building an indestructible defense
[00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:19.080]   to the fact that there are no good exceptions to following this command if you follow Jesus.
[00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:20.080]   How do they do that?
[00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:22.940]   Well, we're going to go through this quick just for the sake of time.
[00:40:22.940 --> 00:40:29.380]   But when he says go in the Greek, that does not mean get up and go.
[00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:34.700]   Some of you should absolutely get up and go.
[00:40:34.700 --> 00:40:37.700]   We are firm believers that God is not just a God of this nation.
[00:40:37.700 --> 00:40:43.080]   He is a God of all nations and we need to extend the gospel to the utmost ends of the
[00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:44.080]   earth.
[00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:49.500]   Tonight, there's an Ethiopia interest meeting and some of you need to go because he is calling
[00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:50.900]   you to get up and go.
[00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:54.140]   And yet what we know in this passage is that's not the primary idea.
[00:40:54.140 --> 00:40:57.580]   The primary idea here is as you are going.
[00:40:57.580 --> 00:40:59.700]   That's what this word in the Greek means.
[00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:03.740]   It means that as you go, make disciples.
[00:41:03.740 --> 00:41:07.540]   Which sucks the error out of the first exception that many of us hide behind.
[00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:09.340]   That Jesus, I just don't have time to do it.
[00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:13.900]   Because according to Jesus, you don't find time to disciple.
[00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:16.940]   You disciple wherever your time is found.
[00:41:16.940 --> 00:41:19.140]   So if your time is found at the gym, disciple there.
[00:41:19.140 --> 00:41:21.220]   If your time is found at the grocery store, disciple there.
[00:41:21.220 --> 00:41:22.860]   If your time is found at the office, disciple there.
[00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:26.100]   If your time is found at spin, disciple there.
[00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:30.340]   You disciple wherever it is you are.
[00:41:30.340 --> 00:41:31.700]   You disciple as you go.
[00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:41.380]   According to Eugene Peterson, 90%, 90% of Jesus' time was spent ministering to his disciples.
[00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:47.500]   Not speaking to large crowds, not teaching in synagogue, not speaking with strangers,
[00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:49.140]   but ministering to his disciples.
[00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:50.140]   How is that possible?
[00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:52.440]   90% of his time.
[00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:58.900]   Because Jesus, he believed that discipleship, the majority of discipleship was meant to
[00:41:58.900 --> 00:42:01.980]   be informal in nature.
[00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:05.580]   That it happened as you go.
[00:42:05.580 --> 00:42:11.340]   Between meals, on the way to a meeting, in the car, going to serve these people, then
[00:42:11.340 --> 00:42:13.220]   making your way over here, there next.
[00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:15.020]   He believed that that's what it meant to make disciples.
[00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:17.140]   You do it as you go along.
[00:42:17.140 --> 00:42:19.820]   The majority of discipleship happens in the informal moment.
[00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:21.340]   Here's the problem with us here in the West.
[00:42:21.340 --> 00:42:26.140]   We believe that all discipleship happens in the formal moment.
[00:42:26.140 --> 00:42:29.780]   Happens at Bible study, happens at equipping night, happens at community group, happens
[00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:32.760]   whenever I show up to that coffee once a week.
[00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:36.740]   We think that that's where discipleship happens, and yet that's not what Jesus is saying.
[00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:38.380]   Those things are not bad.
[00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:39.380]   You should absolutely do those things.
[00:42:39.380 --> 00:42:40.860]   You should come to Sunday service.
[00:42:40.860 --> 00:42:41.900]   You should be involved in a community group.
[00:42:41.900 --> 00:42:45.740]   You should join a Bible study, and yet you can't look at those things and say, "That
[00:42:45.740 --> 00:42:47.540]   scratches my discipleship itch."
[00:42:47.540 --> 00:42:53.540]   You also can't say that attending services like this and letting the professionals do
[00:42:53.540 --> 00:42:58.180]   the discipling is your way out, because that's not what Jesus is saying.
[00:42:58.180 --> 00:43:06.380]   He's saying, "No, you, where you are, as you are, how you are, make disciples, and do it
[00:43:06.380 --> 00:43:07.980]   as you go."
[00:43:07.980 --> 00:43:09.540]   That's the first thing we need to know.
[00:43:09.540 --> 00:43:12.780]   The second thing that he says is we baptize them.
[00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:20.020]   Now, I'll admit, whenever I heard that we're supposed to baptize all nations, it didn't
[00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:22.380]   really make sense to be in the Great Commission.
[00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:23.940]   It didn't feel like it fits.
[00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:25.220]   All the other things, they make sense.
[00:43:25.220 --> 00:43:33.260]   This is Jesus' final mission to us as his people, so go and save and teach.
[00:43:33.260 --> 00:43:38.500]   Baptism just didn't fit in there, because I know, man, baptism, it's an external expression
[00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:42.340]   of an internal reality, but why the urgency?
[00:43:42.340 --> 00:43:45.100]   Why is it included in the Great Commission?
[00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:50.580]   For this reason, don't miss this, because this is massively important, because we need
[00:43:50.580 --> 00:43:56.340]   to know baptism is not just a symbol of connection to Christ, it is a symbol of connection to
[00:43:56.340 --> 00:43:58.100]   community.
[00:43:58.100 --> 00:44:04.180]   That's why it's available to all people everywhere, every tribe, every tongue, every nation.
[00:44:04.180 --> 00:44:10.340]   We should go and tell them all about the connection they can have to the family of God, which
[00:44:10.340 --> 00:44:14.060]   is made available through the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.
[00:44:14.060 --> 00:44:20.700]   It doesn't matter who you are, where you come from, what you've done, you're now going to
[00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:24.980]   be a part of God's family, which blows apart the second exception I often hear people hiding
[00:44:24.980 --> 00:44:29.660]   behind, which is, "But I don't have anything in common with them."
[00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:30.660]   According to Jesus, you do.
[00:44:30.660 --> 00:44:33.660]   You don't have to share all the similarities in the world.
[00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:37.620]   You don't have to like the same music, have the same hobbies, go to the same places, come
[00:44:37.620 --> 00:44:43.380]   from the same socioeconomic background, you don't have to have an immense amount of similarities,
[00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:49.300]   because what you have is a singular commonality in Christ, and that is the most significant
[00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:51.260]   commonality you can have.
[00:44:51.260 --> 00:44:57.020]   So what's beautiful about the people of God, the family of God, is that we're a people
[00:44:57.020 --> 00:45:06.740]   in unity, bound by our love for one another, yet not a people of uniformity that look like
[00:45:06.740 --> 00:45:07.740]   one another.
[00:45:07.740 --> 00:45:15.140]   We're a people that are diverse, we're a people that are different, yet united in Christ.
[00:45:15.140 --> 00:45:18.300]   And lastly, Jesus tells us to teach them to observe all that I commanded you.
[00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:21.460]   This one's pretty easy to understand, and yet it's often the one that we find hardest
[00:45:21.460 --> 00:45:25.940]   to follow and often find ourselves hiding behind, because when it comes to discipleship,
[00:45:25.940 --> 00:45:29.500]   so many of us, we don't know what to say.
[00:45:29.500 --> 00:45:31.460]   Like what if they ask a question, I don't have the answer?
[00:45:31.460 --> 00:45:33.500]   What if I'm supposed to teach something, but I don't know what to say?
[00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:39.060]   What if I'm not eloquent enough to communicate that to these people so they will believe?
[00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:43.020]   Just really simply, what I would say in this moment is that Christ doesn't need you to
[00:45:43.020 --> 00:45:44.020]   be perfect.
[00:45:44.020 --> 00:45:46.300]   That's not what he's looking for.
[00:45:46.300 --> 00:45:48.220]   He doesn't need you to be perfect, he just needs you to be faithful.
[00:45:48.220 --> 00:45:51.820]   He just needs you to know, man, if you've got a couple of steps in spiritual maturity
[00:45:51.820 --> 00:45:56.060]   on someone else, you can help them by bringing them up those couple of steps to greater spiritual
[00:45:56.060 --> 00:45:57.060]   maturity.
[00:45:57.060 --> 00:46:03.820]   So teach, so speak, so share, and know that, man, he'll work out the difference.
[00:46:03.820 --> 00:46:07.340]   He'll move because of your faithfulness.
[00:46:07.340 --> 00:46:11.180]   You see, there's no good exceptions to the Great Commission, none.
[00:46:11.180 --> 00:46:13.140]   Doesn't matter what you're hiding behind.
[00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:17.940]   It's an invisible wall, we can see you.
[00:46:17.940 --> 00:46:22.180]   But there are only good reasons to keep it.
[00:46:22.180 --> 00:46:28.940]   And yet here's the thing that I know, and it's the fear that I've had, and the very
[00:46:28.940 --> 00:46:35.200]   reason that we've stepped into this series, is I know we can give you eight weeks of content
[00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:42.700]   on discipleship, and you can be here and enjoy all of the acquisition of new knowledge, and
[00:46:42.700 --> 00:46:48.100]   yet walk away and be totally satisfied that you know more about Jesus, but you don't know
[00:46:48.100 --> 00:46:51.240]   Jesus personally.
[00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:55.820]   If that's you, how do you avoid that from happening?
[00:46:55.820 --> 00:47:01.300]   Well, last story, and admittedly, I'm borrowing this from J.D. Greer.
[00:47:01.300 --> 00:47:06.220]   In the Civil War, President Lincoln couldn't have hoped for a better general than he found
[00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:10.500]   in the Union's General-in-Chief, George McClellan.
[00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:15.620]   George was known as the young Napoleon because he was tactically brilliant, unlike anybody
[00:47:15.620 --> 00:47:16.620]   else.
[00:47:16.620 --> 00:47:22.360]   At just the age of 15, he was the youngest member actually invited into the U.S. Military
[00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:26.960]   Academy, and despite being so young, he nevertheless graduated at the top of his class.
[00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:31.080]   Upon graduating, he went into the service, and he did the unthinkable.
[00:47:31.080 --> 00:47:35.480]   He began to recruit people like no one had ever known before, so much so that the volunteer
[00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:40.400]   regiment grew by 300% in just four months' time.
[00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:42.480]   He was tactically brilliant.
[00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:44.900]   He was strategically intelligent.
[00:47:44.900 --> 00:47:49.400]   He was winsome to the masses, and so it was no surprise that President Lincoln made him
[00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:51.280]   General-in-Chief.
[00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:58.440]   He had the experience, the expertise, and he had the woo to bring people on board.
[00:47:58.440 --> 00:48:04.400]   He had everything he needed except one thing.
[00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:10.460]   He didn't have the willingness to fight because what we know is that for weeks, General McClellan
[00:48:10.460 --> 00:48:11.560]   readied his position.
[00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:16.780]   He organized his troops, and he strategized against his enemy, outnumbered two to one.
[00:48:16.780 --> 00:48:20.980]   His opponent, General Robert E. Lee's army, lay dangerously exposed just a few miles away.
[00:48:20.980 --> 00:48:24.720]   They were within quick reach of crushing the rebellion, ending the war, and bringing peace
[00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:31.060]   to the nation again, and yet, despite understanding the strategy, despite knowing all the odds,
[00:48:31.060 --> 00:48:39.700]   despite having all the men necessary, General McClellan did not have the willingness.
[00:48:39.700 --> 00:48:41.800]   He went a bold and a very surprising move.
[00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:49.420]   President Lincoln removed George McClellan from his position, and in place of the most
[00:48:49.420 --> 00:48:56.200]   tactically brilliant person they had known in their modern military, he put someone else
[00:48:56.200 --> 00:49:09.600]   instead, one that was half the strategic intelligence of George McClellan, but one that was altogether
[00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:14.800]   more bold and brazen for battle.
[00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:27.000]   He instituted Ulysses S. Grant as the Union's new general, and within a year, General Grant
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:33.600]   brought the Civil War to an end.
[00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:39.740]   The difference in these two men and the legacies they left revolved around their willingness
[00:49:39.740 --> 00:49:40.740]   to fight.
[00:49:40.740 --> 00:49:43.480]   It didn't depend on which was smarter.
[00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:46.160]   It didn't depend on which was more admired.
[00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:48.000]   It didn't depend on which was more talented.
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:53.060]   It depended on which was more willing.
[00:49:53.060 --> 00:49:57.000]   How willing are you to fight here tonight?
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:03.600]   How willing are you to not just know the right things, to not just say the right things,
[00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:09.200]   to pray the right things, to even believe the right things, but to actually become the
[00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:13.660]   right things, do the right things, and take the right action?
[00:50:13.660 --> 00:50:15.960]   How willing are you to do it?
[00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:17.380]   Here's the thing I know.
[00:50:17.380 --> 00:50:22.280]   We have every reason in the world to be willing because Jesus Christ himself was willing to
[00:50:22.280 --> 00:50:23.480]   enter into the fight.
[00:50:23.480 --> 00:50:28.440]   What we know about Jesus is he was willing to die for the sake of sinners and skeptics
[00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:34.480]   and screw-ups, so much so that he took our cross upon himself and he bore the consequence
[00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:35.480]   of our sin.
[00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:39.120]   We know that Jesus was willing to rise, that we might be more than mere believers.
[00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:44.400]   We might be becomers, people that become like Jesus because he didn't stay dead nor buried
[00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:49.120]   in the grave, but he rose forth so that we might rise alongside of him.
[00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:54.960]   And we know that Jesus, he was willing to give us good reason for the great commission,
[00:50:54.960 --> 00:51:02.240]   a mission that saves the world one person at a time, by one person at a time.
[00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:05.200]   Jesus has a purpose for you, porch.
[00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:08.680]   The last regular porch of the year, he has a purpose for you.
[00:51:08.680 --> 00:51:15.480]   If only you're willing, and here's what I promise, it is a purpose worth living for
[00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:23.440]   because it's a purpose Christ found worth dying for.
[00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:24.440]   Let me pray for us.
[00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:26.600]   God, I know we went long tonight.
[00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:31.720]   Yeah, God, if we're going to give our time to anyone, let it be given to you, to your
[00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:36.040]   word and to this mission, which is most important of all.
[00:51:36.040 --> 00:51:44.480]   God, I pray, Lord, that you would embed this truth into our bones.
[00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:51.680]   That God, as we step into the holiday season, we would do so without passivity, but filled
[00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:56.520]   God with great passion, that we have a purpose, one worthy of living for you.
[00:51:56.520 --> 00:52:00.480]   Jesus found it worthy of dying for.
[00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:06.360]   So God, I pray, help us to take next steps, to know that God, it doesn't take this room
[00:52:06.360 --> 00:52:07.400]   to save souls.
[00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:11.640]   It takes your people to do it instead.
[00:52:11.640 --> 00:52:13.860]   Make us like yourself.
[00:52:13.860 --> 00:52:18.520]   Make the world like yourself for your glory and our good, we pray in Jesus' name.
[00:52:18.520 --> 00:52:19.280]   Amen.
