 - Oh, I love it! Amazing!

63
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 Oh, drop the microphone! Let's go!

64
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 [cheers and applause]

65
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 What a perfect way to start the next part of a dating series.

66
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 "Just the Way You Are."

67
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 That song was a perfect ending for where we're gonna begin tonight

68
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 because that song is not only incredibly popular,

69
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 but it's popular because in some ways it really is the cry of every person,

70
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 particularly maybe it resonates with some of the ladies in the room,

71
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 that someone would love you just the way that you are,

72
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 and it exploded the Super Bowl.

73
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 I mean, that song, I feel like I've heard so many different times

74
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 because it resonates with so many different people.

75
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 And what's interesting is that message of "you're loved right now,

76
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 exactly who you are" is so counter to so many of the messages

77
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 that we hear in our world about "you're not loved just the way that you are."

78
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 But in order to be loved, you need to be different,

79
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 or you need to change if you were thinner, or if you made more money,

80
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 or if you had more hair, or if you had better hair,

81
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 or different color hair, or anything with hair.

82
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 If you had less weight, more weight, more muscle, whatever that is,

83
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 the world around us screams that these are the things that are valuable,

84
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 and if you would just be more this way, then you would be loved.

85
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 And we're gonna discuss tonight a topic as it relates really not only to dating,

86
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 but all men and women, and this subject of value,

87
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 and where that comes from, because we live in this culture,

88
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 in a society that has devalued and devalues something that God has assigned

89
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 extraordinary value.

90
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 And any time a culture or a person devalues something that God has declared

91
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 of incredible value, the outcome is catastrophic.

92
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 And so we're gonna go on a little bit of a journey,

93
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 and I'm gonna have to set it up with a history lesson

94
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 that will explain kind of where we're going,

95
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 and indicate really what I mean by how dangerous this is.

96
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 In the early 1990s, something took place in a country called Rwanda,

97
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 which was called the Rwandan Genocide.

98
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 Probably a lot of you guys saw the movie Hotel Rwanda,

99
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 or you've heard about this, but in a hundred days, think about this.

100
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 Like, this is crazy.

101
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 In a hundred days, a million people were brutally murdered.

102
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 A million.

103
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 It was the worst genocide in the history of the world

104
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 within that small of a time frame.

105
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 Enough bodies that would fill up this room, and many others.

106
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 And they weren't murdered by some incoming army,

107
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 they were murdered by their neighbors.

108
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 Think about that.

109
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 How does that happen?

110
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 A million people.

111
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 And what happened was, in Rwanda,

112
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 there were primarily two groups of people.

113
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 A group called Hutus, and a group called Tutsis.

114
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 And these two groups had a long history of animosity towards one another,

115
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 and one thinking they were better than the other,

116
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 and one thinking that the other was just cockroaches,

117
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 they're less than us, they're not even human.

118
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 And eventually, their relationship got so bad,

119
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 that the Hutus, who would use labels and terms for the Tutsis,

120
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 which were the minority in the country, that they're just cockroaches,

121
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 they're not even human.

122
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 Eventually, that way of thinking infiltrated their lives and their nation,

123
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 that a civil war broke out.

124
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 And in that civil war, all of the Tutsis fled to the edges of the country,

125
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 and the Hutus pursued them and stomped them out on the basis

126
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 that they are less than human.

127
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 And a million people died in less than a hundred days.

128
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 President Clinton said it was the biggest regret of my entire life,

129
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 and my entire presidency, that I did not act sooner.

130
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 And the mist was what was going on, because any time, in this case,

131
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 human life, any time a person or a culture devalues or wrongly values

132
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 something God has declared of incredible value,

133
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 the outcome is catastrophic.

134
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 In Nazi Germany, the same thing took place where devaluing

135
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 something God had said is of infinite value, humans,

136
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 made in the image of God, and they called women,

137
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 all Jewish women are whores, all of them, and all Jews are rats.

138
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 They're not even human.

139
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 And they exterminated millions of people.

140
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 We did it in our country when slavery existed.

141
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 We said, "Hey, slaves, they're less than human."

142
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 Then we did it with Native Americans.

143
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 They're less than human.

144
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 And any time a culture or a person devalues something God says

145
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 is extraordinarily valuable, the outcome is catastrophic.

146
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 And you're probably wondering, "Why are we talking about genocide

147
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 and slavery? Isn't this a dating series? Where am I right now?"

148
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 It's so relevant to the topic we're going to discuss tonight,

149
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 because our culture has done something as specifically as it relates to women

150
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 as we're going to see when it comes to the topic of devaluing.

151
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 What's interesting, as we transition really to the first century,

152
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 when we look at the first century, the context in which Christianity

153
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 was birthed, so this is really historical, so I'm going to try to make it

154
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 as interesting and clear as I can.

155
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 What was going on then was not dissimilar from what was going on

156
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 with the Hutus and the Tutsis.

157
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 Only this time, it was not Tutsis that were being declared less than human.

158
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 It was women.

159
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 The first century world as it related to women specifically

160
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 and the Roman Empire is a world we cannot even really begin to imagine

161
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 because it would be so foreign to us.

162
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 Infanticide or the killing of infants was so common, millions of baby girls,

163
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 just the girls, were thrown out with the trash because no one wanted

164
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 to have a baby girl.

165
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 There was a dramatic shortage of women during this time,

166
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 and there were so many men because no one wanted to have a baby girl.

167
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 You'd walk past the trash and you'd hear the cries of a little baby girl

168
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 because girls were of no value according to Roman law and Roman rule.

169
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 They had no rights.

170
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 They had no status.

171
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 First century writing even records a husband right around the time

172
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 when Jesus was born, and here's what he says.

173
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 He's writing a letter to his wife, and he says, "If you're delivered

174
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 "of a child before I come home, if it is a boy, keep it.

175
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 "If it is a girl, discard it."

176
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 One of the first laws of Rome, the law of Romulus,

177
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 one of the first laws when the empire was formed,

178
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 one of the first things written in the declarer is that any male

179
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 that is born must be kept.

180
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 Any human male, any healthy male that is born must be kept,

181
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 but every household, you only have to keep one healthy female.

182
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 All the rest you can totally discard.

183
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 It was a world that was so foreign, and we cannot even begin to imagine.

184
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 Prostitution was legal and encouraged.

185
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 It was a form of birth control.

186
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 Women had no rights.

187
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 And not only that, it became so bad that men were in such power

188
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 and women were just cattle that at some point marriage started

189
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 to rapidly decline, and so two times--think about this--

190
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 two times before the Roman Senate, bills came forward that said,

191
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 "We want to mandate marriage because none of the men would marry."

192
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 Why would I marry? I can have sex with the prostitutes all that I want.

193
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 And if I marry, all I have to do is take on the obligation

194
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 and responsibilities of a woman.

195
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 So I don't think so. Two different occasions.

196
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 In fact, it was so at the heart of their culture,

197
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 even some of the most famous teachers that anyone in this room

198
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 probably recognizes taught that women not only just were to be

199
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 less valued, they actually biologically were less valuable than men.

200
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 Here's what Aristotle wrote about women.

201
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 He said, "The female is, as it were, a mutilated male."

202
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 How about that? Encouraging for church.

203
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 "For there is only one thing they have not in them, the principle of a soul."

204
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 Plato said this, "It is only males who are created directly by the gods

205
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 and are given souls. Those who live rightly return to the stars

206
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 or to the heavens. But those who are cowards may be reasoned to have

207
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 supposed to have been changed into the nature of a woman

208
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 and come back in the second generation.

209
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 That if you lived a right life, then you would go into the heavens,

210
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 but if you weren't good, then you would have to come back as a woman."

211
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 I mean, it's laughable, isn't it? But here's what's so crazy.

212
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 This was the world into which Christianity was born,

213
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 into which Jesus appeared. Jewish culture was not much different.

214
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 There are rabbinical teachings or teachings from a rabbi

215
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 from the first century that say this, "I would rather have the Torah burned

216
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 than have it given or instructed to a woman."

217
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 How about that for light-hearted? This is a common first century prayer.

218
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 "Blessed are you, eternal God, who has not made me a Gentile,

219
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 a slave, or a woman."

220
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 I mean, think about that. Imagine. What if we started that,

221
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 and that was the way that we started our church services.

222
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 "God, I just want to thank you for not making me a woman.

223
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 I'd like to invite all the men in the room to thank God with me

224
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 that they have not been made."

225
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 I mean, 60% of our audience would just step out and walk out.

226
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 But this was the culture and the world into which Christianity was born,

227
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 and it is so far and so hard for us to imagine.

228
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 But then appeared Jesus, and into this world Jesus spoke,

229
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 and He acted in a way that was so revolutionary

230
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 and was so beyond anything anyone had ever seen.

231
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 And then Peter, His follower, showed up, and Peter spoke

232
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 as they embraced the teachings of Jesus as it related to women,

233
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 and the world would never be the same.

234
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 Jesus, one day in John chapter 4, in the Gospel of John chapter 4,

235
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 Jesus is speaking with this woman who's a Samaritan woman.

236
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 And Samaritans were like half-breeds.

237
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 They were looked down upon in society.

238
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 And Jesus is all by Himself, and He's speaking with a woman,

239
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 this half-breed woman, and not just any woman,

240
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 but a woman who had been married five times

241
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 and was now exchanging sex for rent with her current live-in partner.

242
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 And in the first showing of who He is,

243
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 the first time He tells anyone, "I am the Messiah," it's her.

244
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 His disciples walk up, and to us it's like, "Yeah, what's the big deal?

245
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 They're a woman."

246
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 His disciples walk up, and they're astounded

247
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 because He's talking to a woman.

248
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 They see Him in this conversation, and they go, "He's talking to a woman.

249
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 Why is that astounding?"

250
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 Because she's a woman. You don't talk to women.

251
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 Men didn't talk to their wives in public.

252
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 And He's talking with this woman, and they walk up,

253
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 and here's what it even says.

254
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 I mean, I've never noticed this before, but it says this.

255
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 "Just then," verse 27 of chapter 4,

256
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 "His disciples came back, and they marveled

257
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 that He was talking to a woman,

258
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 but none of them wanted to ask, 'What do you seek?'

259
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 or 'Why are you talking to her?'"

260
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 He's not only speaking and telling her before anyone else,

261
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 "I am the Messiah,"

262
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 but He offers her, asks to drink out of her cup.

263
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 I mean, this would have been crazy.

264
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 Drink out of her cup? Ew, gross.

265
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 She's a Samaritan woman. There's cooties.

266
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 That is disgusting.

267
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 Who would drink out of the cup of a dirty woman

268
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 who's been divorced five times and is exchanging sex?

269
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 That's disgusting.

270
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 Who would do that?

271
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 God in the flesh would do that?

272
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 I mean, it was like nothing the world had ever seen,

273
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 and nothing His followers had ever seen.

274
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 Another day, He's brought this woman.

275
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 This is John chapter 8.

276
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 And this woman who had been caught having sex

277
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 with a man who wasn't her husband

278
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 is thrown at His feet by these religious leaders,

279
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 and they say, "The law says we should condemn her.

280
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 What do you say?"

281
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 And He goes over there.

282
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 This is like more astounding

283
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 than any of us will be even able to grab onto.

284
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 He kneels down, He associates,

285
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 and begins to speak with this woman,

286
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 this unclean woman.

287
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 And He tells her, "I don't condemn you.

288
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 Go and sin no more."

289
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 Jesus not only allowed women to learn,

290
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 He encouraged it.

291
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 And I'm telling you,

292
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 we cannot even begin to understand how revolutionary,

293
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 because He believed and He taught

294
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 that every person, man or woman,

295
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 has dignity because they are made in the image of God,

296
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 and they should be treated as such.

297
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 And then Peter shows up.

298
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 And Peter, who helps start the early church

299
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 and he gets it rolling,

300
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 and he writes a couple of the letters

301
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 that we have inside of our Bible,

302
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 he shows up.

303
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 And Peter, who watched Jesus do all of this stuff

304
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 they had never seen before,

305
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 stuff the world around them

306
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 did not at all encourage or tolerate.

307
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 And Peter, who watched it all

308
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 as he's writing to these pagan men

309
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 who just became Christians,

310
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 in a world where women are nothing.

311
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 Here's what he writes.

312
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 And he writes in the context of husband and wives,

313
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 but he says it's about all women

314
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 based on who they are.

315
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 And here's what he says.

316
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 This is 1 Peter 3, verse 7.

317
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 "Husbands, in the same way,

318
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 be considerate as you live with your wives

319
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 and treat them with respect as the weaker partner."

320
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 The word "treat them with respect,"

321
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 think about this.

322
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 Why is that even in there?

323
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 Peter, why?

324
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 You're writing the Bible.

325
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 Why do you have to write "treat them with respect"?

326
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 Everyone knows you should treat them with respect.

327
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 No, they didn't.

328
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 Women, Peter, you're telling us I have to treat women?

329
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 But she's a woman.

330
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 And Peter said, "You don't understand.

331
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 You are to treat them with respect."

332
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 It's really the word "ascribe to them honor."

333
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 It's the only time in the New Testament

334
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 this phrase appears.

335
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 That I want you, when it comes to the women in your life,

336
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 those you are dating,

337
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 those who you took out on a date

338
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 that maybe you now try to avoid,

339
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 those who you have just spent time with,

340
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 the friends, the girls, all of them,

341
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 he says, "Here's what I want you to do.

342
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 I want you to ascribe to them honor."

343
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 And I'm not just saying, "Hey, treat them as equals."

344
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 I want you to honor them.

345
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 How do you honor someone?

346
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 If President Obama came in this room,

347
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 all of us would know how to honor him.

348
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 Or if the queen of whatever came in,

349
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 we would know what it is to honor

350
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 this distinguished person.

351
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 But Peter says, "I want you to treat

352
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 all of the women in your life with honor."

353
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 I mean, it was revolutionary.

354
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 Like nothing they had ever heard or seen.

355
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 And he says this, "As the weaker partner,"

356
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 which ladies, don't get offended,

357
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 it just means guys would probably win in a fist fight

358
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 or a boxing match if we had one in here.

359
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 He ascribes this, "As the weaker partner,"

360
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 and here's why,

361
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 "and as heirs,"

362
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 heirs was so significant

363
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 because remember, women could not be heirs.

364
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 "And as heirs with you of the gracious gift of life."

365
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 So Peter says, "Look, I know they cannot be heirs."

366
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 Woman and heirs, never been written before.

367
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 That does not go together.

368
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 And I know that's the way that things play out here,

369
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 but I want you to understand something, men.

370
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 They are co-heirs with you of the gracious gift of life.

371
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 Maybe not heirs in this Roman kingdom,

372
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 but they are in the kingdom of heaven.

373
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 And so you are to treat them as heirs.

374
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 That every woman you have ever met

375
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 is someone who's not only made in the image of God,

376
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 but someone for who Jesus died for on the cross.

377
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 Heirs as in remember who her father in heaven is,

378
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 and you treat them in accordance with that.

379
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 That in essence, that you are dating,

380
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 if you are dating someone,

381
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 or if you know someone, the boss's daughter.

382
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 A couple weeks ago, Todd came and spoke,

383
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 and he spoke about just the way that he has any guy

384
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 who wants to take his daughter on a date, call him.

385
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 If you want to take him on a date, you know.

386
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 And I was having lunch with a friend shortly after that,

387
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 and he said, "Man, that guy was intense.

388
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 "I don't know that I would want to take his daughter on a date.

389
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 "It's just too much accountability."

390
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 Here's what Peter's saying.

391
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 You're accountable to an even greater

392
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 and even more powerful heavenly father

393
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 for the ways that you treat them so much so that--look at this--

394
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 so that, in other words, this is going to be contingent on--

395
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 or the way that you treat them is so important,

396
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 and if you don't do so appropriately,

397
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 so that nothing will hinder your prayers.

398
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 Wait a second. Peter, you're saying that the way

399
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 that I treat the women in my life

400
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 is going to affect whether or not God hears my prayers?

401
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 Peter, that's--but she's a woman.

402
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 Guys, you're clearly not understanding.

403
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 I want you to honor the women in your life

404
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 and see them as heirs.

405
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 You remember who her father is.

406
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 The head of our marriage ministry today--

407
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 we were discussing at Watermark--

408
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 there's a guy who heads up all the marital stuff here,

409
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 and he said, "Look, understanding that my wife

410
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 "is God's daughter

411
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 "will do more to impact the way I treat her

412
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 "than 100 marriage books ever has."

413
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 And these teachings were so revolutionary

414
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 that Paul then shows up--

415
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 the apostle Paul, who shows up after this--

416
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 and Paul writes this.

417
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 He says, in Galatians chapter 3, verse 26,

418
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 "So in Christ Jesus,

419
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 "you are all children of God through faith.

420
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 "For all of you who are baptized into Christ

421
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 "have clothed yourselves with Christ."

422
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 And here's it.

423
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 "There is neither Jew nor Gentile.

424
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 "There is neither slave nor free,

425
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 "nor is there male or female,

426
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 "for you are all one in Christ."

427
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 This is the very first time--

428
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 secular historians say that men and women--

429
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 this is so crazy--

430
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 men and women were given equal value by a writer.

431
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 You're looking at it right there.

432
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 You're looking at it.

433
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 This is the very first time in all of human history--

434
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 secular history says the very first time

435
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 that we know that men and women were considered equal

436
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 was when the apostle Paul wrote in his letter to Galatians,

437
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 chapter 3, that man and woman are equal.

438
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 They are one in Christ.

439
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 The Bible gets hit on for being chauvinist,

440
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 or, man, they just don't treat women.

441
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 That would have been so ludicrous in the first century.

442
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 I mean, it would have blown people--

443
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 you think the Bible is chauvinist?

444
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 That's--yeah, that's a good one.

445
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 I mean, it was crazy the way that they flocked to the church--

446
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 women--

447
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 because they were treated like nowhere else in the entire world.

448
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 They were given such an elevated status

449
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 at a time when women were not elevated in any way,

450
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 and it changed the course of human history.

451
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 I mean, think about it.

452
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 In today, nations that do not have a Christian influence,

453
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 women are still second-rate citizens.

454
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 Malawa Yousafi, this past year,

455
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 a 14-year-old Pakistani girl,

456
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 was shot in the head for advocating for women

457
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 to have education in Pakistan.

458
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 40 million baby girls killed

459
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 in the last couple decades in China

460
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 because of the one-child policy, which says,

461
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 look, basically people would have a baby girl,

462
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 and they go, we'll keep her until we can have a baby boy,

463
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 and then she's gone.

464
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 163 million more men in Asia than women

465
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 because of selective abortion.

466
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 If it shows up a girl, we kill it.

467
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 It is so not natural.

468
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 In Saudi Arabia, women cannot drive cars.

469
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 And all over where Christ and His people have not touched,

470
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 it still remains the same.

471
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 And Jesus showed up and spoke,

472
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 and He changed everything because He said,

473
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 every woman has such extraordinary dignity

474
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 because she's made in My image

475
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 and is someone I died on the cross for.

476
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 And men, you are accountable to God

477
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 for how you treat them,

478
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 not just the ones that you date,

479
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 but including the ones that you date.

480
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 It was staggering.

481
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 And here's why I think this is so important,

482
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 because we live in a time and a culture

483
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 that is devaluing women,

484
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 and we are headed in a direction fast,

485
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 or they are valuing the wrong thing.

486
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 And any time a culture or a person or a people group

487
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 devalues something that God has said

488
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 is of extraordinary value to Him,

489
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 the result is catastrophic.

490
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 And every day, the message that's sent to women

491
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 and sent to men is that women are objects,

492
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 take me, use me, trade me in for another one

493
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 whenever you get done.

494
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 My body determines, or my beauty determines my worth,

495
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 and it is devaluing and discarding

496
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 everything that Jesus came to establish.

497
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 Here's what I mean.

498
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 If you look at the culture and the world around us,

499
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 the movies, ads, everything that you see,

500
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 it's sending a very clear message,

501
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 and it is one of a deteriorating culture.

502
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 I just pulled some of the top songs right now,

503
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 not just any songs, these are the top songs,

504
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 and the top five, three out of the top five right now,

505
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 and what they say as it relates to the message of women.

506
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 And here's what they say.

507
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 Here's the first one.

508
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 This is "Talk Dirty" from Jason Derulo.

509
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 I don't even know if I can read this.

510
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 "Been around the world, don't speak the language,

511
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 "but your booty don't need explaining.

512
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 "All I really need to understand

513
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 "is when you talk dirty to me, talk dirty to me."

514
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 I'm not even gonna read the rest,

515
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 but you can just read through it.

516
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 This isn't any song.

517
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 These are the most popular songs in America.

518
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 It's crazy.

519
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 And if it's not to you,

520
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 it's because you have been indoctrinated

521
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 and you drunk the Kool-Aid.

522
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 This is unbelievable.

523
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 And any time a culture or world--

524
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 let's go to the next song.

525
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 This is Beyonce and her boo, Jay-Z.

526
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 "Stumbled all in the house, back up--"

527
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 I can't even.

528
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 Okay, let's go to the next one.

529
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 This is just--

530
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 Timber.

531
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 The big--we're done.

532
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 I mean, just read it.

533
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 It's crazy, and this is the message,

534
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 and you're going, "Ah, I just like the beat."

535
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 This is the message,

536
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 and if you think you can listen to something

537
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 over and over and over again

538
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 and it not affect the way that you think

539
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 or the way that you see,

540
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 you're crazy, too, and you drank the Kool-Aid.

541
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 And our world and our culture around us

542
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 is deteriorating, and it's sending a message

543
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 every single day as it relates to women

544
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 being sexual objects,

545
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 being bitches and whores and hoes.

546
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 And as the church,

547
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 we are not to stand, support, or allow

548
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 or participate in.

549
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 And you may be going, "Oh, what are you--

550
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 "This is just the culture.

551
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 "It's just kind of art."

552
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 Newsflash.

553
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 We, as Christians, have a superior culture in Christ,

554
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 and any culture that is comfortable

555
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 with calling a woman a bitch or a whore

556
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 or a sexual toy

557
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 is an inferior culture.

558
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 (audience applauds)

559
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 It really is important.

560
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 It really is, because any time,

561
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 as we talked about with Hootoos and the Tootsies,

562
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 any time that you allow yourself to refer to someone,

563
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 whoever they are, because of their skin color

564
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 or whatever they are, male, woman, nationality,

565
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 the amount of money that they make,

566
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 any time that you allow to address a label,

567
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 eventually, it gives you permission

568
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 to treat them in that way.

569
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 And it's not just music.

570
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 Everywhere that you look, the message is the same.

571
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 Women, your bodies are something

572
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 that you leverage to get a guy.

573
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 And depending on how beautiful it is,

574
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 that's the amount of guy you'll probably get

575
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 or be able to keep.

576
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 And guys, women are things to be taken

577
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 and used and traded in at the end

578
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 for something better.

579
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 And it is going to destroy the culture.

580
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 And men, as Christian men,

581
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 we have to stand up because there's a war going on

582
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 and we're losing it.

583
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 We're losing it.

584
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 And is it any wonder why pornography in our country,

585
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 I mean, you look at this stuff,

586
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 porn is out of control.

587
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 Rape is out of control.

588
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 It's higher than it's ever been.

589
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 Abortion, out of control, higher than it's ever been.

590
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 It's more common to be raped today

591
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 than to be a smoker.

592
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 Can you believe that?

593
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 It's crazy.

594
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 Sex trafficking is exploding in the United States

595
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 and people are going,

596
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 "Man, we really got to get this under control."

597
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 And you look at what entertains the world around us.

598
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 And any time a culture celebrates

599
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 devaluing something that God has said

600
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 is of extraordinary value,

601
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 the end result is catastrophic.

602
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 And it will be for us.

603
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 And these things are so important

604
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 because all of us are being brainwashed.

605
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 All of us, and I know it's like,

606
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 "Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, church,

607
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 "we're being brainwashed."

608
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 It is influencing the way that you think.

609
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 Guys, I just want to talk to the guys

610
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 for a few minutes as we kind of give some application

611
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 to this as it relates to why this is so important,

612
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 especially when it comes to battle of the sexes

613
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 and genders and treating women and women,

614
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 how you can respond and help us.

615
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 Guys, a couple weeks ago,

616
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 we read the verse in 1 Corinthians 13

617
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 that just says this,

618
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 "When I was a child, I talked like a child,

619
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 "I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child.

620
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 "When I became a man,

621
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 "I put the ways of childhood behind me."

622
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 And so I want to give just a couple ways

623
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 that I think we as men in this room,

624
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 especially those who make up the church,

625
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 have got to put the ways of childhood behind us.

626
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 Here's the first one.

627
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 You need to change the focus.

628
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 Change your focus as it relates to who you are looking for.

629
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 The habit, generally speaking, of Christian men

630
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 is that they will either come to Christ

631
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 or they'll just be influenced by the culture around us to go,

632
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 "Okay, so now I'm a Christian,

633
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 "so I still want what I wanted before,

634
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 "which is a supermodel woman who reads her Bible

635
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 "every day at 6 a.m. and makes me brownies at night

636
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 "and comes over and does my laundry."

637
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 And that becomes kind of the focus of what we're looking for.

638
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 And you are looking for a unicorn.

639
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 They are not out there, and you are not going to find it.

640
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 It's true.

641
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 And here's all I'm asking,

642
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 is that you would elevate character over curves,

643
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 that that would be the focus for you.

644
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 And I hope you marry gorgeous women.

645
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 There's some in the audience right now.

646
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 Maybe you should ask them out when we get done.

647
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 But I hope that happens for all of you.

648
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 All the girls are like, "Yes!"

649
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 I really do.

650
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 But here's what is so much more valuable.

651
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 So much more valuable.

652
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 Character.

653
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 Character.

654
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 And if you sacrifice character for a bust size,

655
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 whatever bust even is, I'm not even really sure.

656
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 If you sacrifice character,

657
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 you are going to lose.

658
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 The second thing you need to do is change what you're feeding yourself.

659
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 I think this relates really to women and men,

660
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 but you have to watch what you're feeding yourself.

661
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 Whether it's the music you're listening to,

662
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 what's coming in and going in your body.

663
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 Or pornography.

664
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 I don't know, we talk about porn, I feel like, every week.

665
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 I know, maybe you're like, "Yes, you guys do. You need help."

666
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,000
 But we do it because there's so many in the room around you sitting right now

667
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 who looked at porn today, and yesterday, and the day before it.

668
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 And here's why that's so dangerous.

669
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 Because every time you watch porn, you are going to school,

670
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 and you're learning some lessons.

671
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 Here's what you're learning.

672
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 A real human body is not good enough.

673
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 One real human body is not good enough.

674
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 And your wife's future human body will not be good enough.

675
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 And today, you are becoming what you will be as a husband.

676
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 You've got to watch what you're feeding yourself.

677
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:01,000
 And for any of you that may be going to Regen or seeking help,

678
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:06,000
 women, here is where we need your help.

679
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 We need you--I'll start off with this--we need you to change some things.

680
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
 We need you to change your target as a person,

681
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 and don't focus on curves for yourself,

682
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 but focus on the character that you maintain,

683
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 which is of so much greater value.

684
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 Any guy--if you're going, "Yeah, but I'm not going to get a great guy."

685
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 Any guy who does not care about your character and only your curves

686
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 is not a great guy.

687
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:35,000
 He's a little boy.

688
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 A couple people excited.

689
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
 It's true.

690
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 And you need to send him home to mommy and his video games.

691
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 I'm being totally serious. I really am.

692
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 And then you need to change, I think, your view on three things.

693
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 And these three things are really, really important,

694
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
 especially maybe the first one for us.

695
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 Modesty.

696
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
 We, as guys, need your help.

697
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,000
 And I know modesty is hard because I feel like the church has given this kind of bad rap

698
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
 about, like, "Yeah, modest is hottest, but not really."

699
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:15,000
 And so we need you to help us.

700
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 And modest does not mean frumpy or dressing like grandma.

701
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
 I'm the most stylish, modest person in the room.

702
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
 But modesty--here's what modesty is.

703
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
 It's the best definition I know of.

704
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 It is not hiding your body.

705
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,000
 It is revealing your dignity.

706
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
 And that is what modesty is.

707
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
 And we, as guys, we need your help.

708
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
 Even here on Tuesdays, we need your help.

709
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 And you're going, "Oh, but that's your problem."

710
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 You're right. We have a problem, and we need your help.

711
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 And we will just keep turning the air conditioning up in here

712
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 until people start dressing modestly.

713
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
 I'm totally kidding. Kind of.

714
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
 I'm totally kidding. Totally kidding.

715
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
 Although it may be a good solution.

716
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
 We need your help. I'm being serious.

717
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
 And then your body.

718
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 Same thing.

719
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 Your view as it relates to your body.

720
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
 Any guy who is pressuring you to have sex,

721
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
 or if you feel a pressure to have sex,

722
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
 you're not dating a man.

723
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 You're dating a little boy.

724
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 You need to tell him to go home, too, with his friend.

725
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:22,000
 I was like, nervous laughter.

726
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 I'm not sure what just happened.

727
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
 And then just your value.

728
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 You have such -- I'll just say this to the girls.

729
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:39,000
 I won't be able -- I'll fall short of what I'm about to try to do.

730
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:45,000
 You have no idea how high your value is.

731
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
 And I couldn't even begin to describe it.

732
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 But God who sits in heaven says, as my daughter,

733
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
 you are of a royal bloodline, and I care so much about you.

734
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
 Every part of you.

735
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,000
 And your value is so high, I'll die for you

736
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:08,000
 before I would want you to degrade yourself or be devalued.

737
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
 And the world around you is sending you a lie,

738
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,000
 and me a lie, and all of the guys in the room a lie

739
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,000
 about where your value lies.

740
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,000
 I was getting married about a year and a few months ago.

741
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,000
 And when you get married, you have to -- you have a wedding.

742
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
 And when you have a wedding, you need a wedding ring.

743
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,000
 And so I had -- I was getting a wedding ring for my wife,

744
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
 now my fiancee then.

745
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,000
 And her grandma had these -- had some diamonds that I was given

746
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,000
 to, like, be a part of that wedding ring, which was awesome.

747
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
 I can highly recommend that for any of the guys in the room,

748
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
 if you are getting a wedding ring, as though you, like,

749
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
 can control that grandma.

750
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:54,000
 So I am getting these diamonds, and I have a ring made,

751
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
 and it's amazing.

752
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
 I mean, it's perfect.

753
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
 And at that time, I'm, like, breaking the bank to be able

754
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
 to make this incredible ring.

755
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 And there's not much left in it after that.

756
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
 It's the most valuable thing that I own, which is so --

757
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
 it's so bizarre, because you're driving around in a car,

758
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
 and you're, like, if this thing falls in the couch cushion

759
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
 or in the car, we're done.

760
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
 I'm going to have to replace it with a rubber band.

761
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:21,000
 So we -- I get this ring made, and I give it to her,

762
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 and it's perfect.

763
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
 She loved it.

764
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,000
 It was exactly what she wanted, and to this day,

765
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
 still the most valuable thing we own.

766
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,000
 And so I, this past week, had her go, because anything that's

767
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
 of great value, you often want to insure.

768
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,000
 And so she goes to get it insured and have it appraised,

769
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
 because you have to have an appraisal.

770
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
 We were told it was worth X amount of thousand dollars,

771
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,000
 and the guy comes back, and he had appraised it, and he said,

772
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:52,000
 "I'm sorry it took so long, and I wish I had good news for you,"

773
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
 which is not a great thing to hear at this point in an

774
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:59,000
 incident, but these are fake diamonds.

775
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
 They're not real.

776
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,000
 Shane, you jerk.

777
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
 These are fake diamonds.

778
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
 It was a lot sadder than this laughing thing that we're

779
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
 experiencing.

780
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
 Like, what?

781
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
 Grandma, what?

782
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,000
 Oh, my gosh.

783
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
 But we eventually said, "Somebody told you a lie.

784
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,000
 These are not real diamonds."

785
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
 The only thing that even makes this ring worth anything is the

786
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
 gold on the band.

787
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
 That's the only thing worth something.

788
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
 And it was like, what?

789
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
 And here's why I say that, because we thought, we had been

790
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,000
 told it was this amount of thousands of dollars.

791
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:41,000
 We had been told it was very valuable by trusted people.

792
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
 We had been trusting in the fact that this thing was of

793
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
 incredible value.

794
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:51,000
 But when we went to the expert, and we took it to him, he very

795
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:56,000
 quickly said, "This is worthless."

796
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,000
 And I know a lot of us in the room would say that we trust

797
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
 God.

798
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
 I trust him.

799
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
 Hey, if I said, "Hey, who trusts God in here?"

800
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
 "Oh, I trust God."

801
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
 "Who trusts Christ?"

802
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
 "Oh, I trust it in Christ."

803
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,000
 But if I said, "Do you trust what he has to say as it

804
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
 relates to your future spouse?"

805
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
 You may even say, "Yes."

806
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
 And I don't know if you know this or not, but the expert

807
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
 has said, "Hey, this is what's valuable, and this is what's

808
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
 not."

809
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
 I mean, that's worthless.

810
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
 Its value is leaving quickly.

811
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
 Here's what he said.

812
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
 He said this in Proverbs 31, which we talk about a lot, where

813
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,000
 he just said, "Look, charm is deceptive or deceitful.

814
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
 It can deceive you.

815
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,000
 Some of you have been deceived by a man or woman you thought

816
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
 was charming."

817
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
 And he says, "Beauty is fleeting.

818
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
 It's leaving.

819
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
 All of us are getting uglier.

820
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
 It's depressing, isn't it?"

821
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,000
 But he said, "A woman," or insert, "man, who has reverence

822
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:02,000
 for me, who fears in the posture of their life is to revere me."

823
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,000
 That is a woman or a man who is worthy to be praised, and that

824
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
 is what is of value.

825
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
 But that other stuff is not.

826
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,000
 And he, the expert, has spoken.

827
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:19,000
 And as you and I date and interact, or you date, I'm not

828
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
 dating.

829
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:28,000
 These are the qualities that are valuable and trusting God will

830
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
 take going, "Look, I'm going to trust that that's what I'm

831
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
 setting my sights on, and I hope everything else falls

832
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
 underneath it.

833
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:41,000
 But that's what I'm looking for from the God who loves you just

834
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
 the way that you are."

835
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,000
 I'm going to pray, and the band's going to close this out.

836
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
 Father, will you help us?

837
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,000
 Just dating is a miserable, terrible thing.

838
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:56,000
 And it is no wonder you didn't speak of it in the Bible,

839
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,000
 because there would have been chapters and chapters.

840
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,000
 And so will you help us just as my friends in the room navigate

841
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
 these waters?

842
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:09,000
 Will you prepare even now a spouse for them?

843
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,000
 Will you give them a renewed vision and renewed mind?

844
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,000
 Will you help us as men to lead the way in a culture that is

845
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,000
 headed downhill fast and devaluing this incredible gift

846
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
 you call your daughters?

847
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,000
 Will you help women in facing the temptation in a culture

848
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,000
 around us that says sex and your body are things to be

849
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
 leveraged?

850
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,000
 Will you help us to be modest?

851
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,000
 We thank you for Jesus who died on the cross, who not only

852
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,000
 showed us how incredibly loved we are and the teachings he had

853
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:45,000
 about women and men, but in the way that he died for all of our

854
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
 sins and came back from the dead.

855
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
 Thank you that we have new life to walk trusting in your ways,

856
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
 not ours.

857
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
 We pray all these things in his name, amen.

858
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,000
 Well, Jesus showed up and he changed not only the calendar

859
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:03,000
 and not only the world's view of women, but he changed many of

860
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
 the lives in this room.

861
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,000
 And he introduced and helped us understand even how we have a

862
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,000
 relationship with God, which I know everyone probably knows or

863
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
 maybe you know, but as Christians believe, it's not good

864
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,000
 people who go to heaven and trying to be good and bad people

865
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
 are the ones who go to hell.

866
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:27,000
 But it's forgiven people who go to heaven.

867
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
 Fundamentally, to be a Christian means to say, I'm not a good

868
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
 person.

869
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
 I can't be good.

870
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
 I need you.

871
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
 And if you've never had that conversation or you've never been

872
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,000
 a part of that, or maybe you just have questions, we have a team

873
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
 down here.

874
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,000
 We'd love to help work through and walk through and be a safe

875
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
 place for you to work through those things.

876
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
 I hope the guys don't feel discouraged.

877
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
 It's hard.

878
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:53,000
 So ladies, give us a lot of grace as we try to seek.

879
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,000
 Give us grace when we are trying to follow Christ's call and kick

880
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,000
 us to the curb when we're being little boys.

881
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
 But we love you guys and we think it's such a joy to get to

882
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
 serve with you.

883
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
 Go in peace to love and serve him this week.

884
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
 Amen.

885
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
 Have a good week of worship.

886
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
