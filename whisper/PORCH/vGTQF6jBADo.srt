4
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,280
 Porch, how are we doing?

5
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,040
 We doing OK tonight?

6
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,480
 Great to see you.

7
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,280
 Welcome back.

8
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,200
 If you've been here before, if it's your very first time,

9
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,800
 let me be one of hopefully very many people to just say,

10
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,300
 welcome.

11
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,300
 We're really glad that you're here at the Porch.

12
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,920
 Thanks for trusting us with your Tuesday.

13
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,600
 Special shout out to everybody that's tuning in online.

14
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,240
 We never want to lose sight of the fact

15
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,880
 that God is doing something great here,

16
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,640
 but he's doing something really great where you are also.

17
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,560
 We're firm believers.

18
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,840
 God can meet with anybody in any place at any time,

19
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,380
 and that includes those of you that

20
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:08,120
 are tuning in with us tonight.

21
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,580
 So thanks for being a part of this.

22
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:15,560
 Special shout out to Porch Live, Indy, Fresno, and Midland.

23
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:20,160
 Well, Porch, our deconstructed series

24
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,080
 is coming to an official end.

25
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,480
 We are rounding the corner--

26
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,240
 I know, that's how I feel.

27
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,560
 We're rounding the corner into what

28
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,840
 I think is going to be a really important topic.

29
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,200
 You see, our goal as we've stepped into this series

30
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,800
 is we've wanted to unpack the primary reasons that

31
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,920
 lead people to deconstruct from their faith.

32
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,800
 And yet a series about deconstruction

33
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,360
 would not be complete if we didn't first

34
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:50,840
 talk about suffering.

35
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,200
 So let me lead off with a story.

36
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,120
 When I was in college ministry, I

37
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,480
 remember sitting down with one of the leaders who served

38
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,100
 in our weekly ministry because he

39
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,880
 needed to unpack a critical situation that he was facing.

40
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,360
 You see, he was facing a plagiarism case

41
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,760
 in his senior year of college, which was a shock to me.

42
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:12,360
 Like, this guy was the textbook example,

43
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,160
 the model of what you hope would be true of your kids

44
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,880
 one day when they go to school.

45
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,800
 Like, he was hardworking and smarter than most,

46
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,920
 and he was loving the Lord and serving his people.

47
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,120
 He was doing so many good things,

48
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,960
 which is why it blew me away to hear that he

49
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:30,440
 was in a situation where his integrity was being questioned,

50
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,040
 where he may have, in fact, cheated on an assignment

51
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,560
 and used somebody else's work and claimed it as his own.

52
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,400
 And so we sat down.

53
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,880
 I looked, and I was like, dude, help me understand,

54
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,840
 like, how are we even in this spot?

55
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,440
 And he goes, well, it's interesting,

56
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,640
 because the person that I'm being accused of plagiarizing

57
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,640
 is myself.

58
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,760
 It's not anybody else's work.

59
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,720
 It's work that I actually completed

60
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,760
 on a former assignment.

61
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:58,360
 But because it isn't original to this assignment,

62
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,120
 it's a reference to something I already authored,

63
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,600
 I'm being taken to task.

64
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:09,600
 My professor is threatening me with potential expulsion.

65
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,720
 And so as we process it together, I was like,

66
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,600
 well, dude, you definitely gotta take a stand, right?

67
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,800
 Like, you can't just let this go unchecked.

68
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,880
 Like, you need to make sure to defend your honor.

69
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,400
 If you're not gonna do it, I'm gonna do it for you,

70
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,400
 because this is crazy.

71
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,440
 Like, it's your work.

72
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,600
 It's not someone else's.

73
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,520
 This is not my understanding of plagiarism.

74
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,280
 And yet, as we began to process through it,

75
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,760
 he told me, "Kylin, calm down.

76
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,120
 "I'm in a little bit of a difficult spot

77
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,300
 "between a rock and a hard place,

78
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:37,440
 "because the situation I'm in is one where my professor

79
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,500
 "does not want me to call his reputation into question

80
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,360
 "by pushing the issue."

81
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,080
 So much so that he's actually threatening

82
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,160
 to call every medical school that I might, in fact,

83
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,760
 apply to and raise character concerns

84
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,120
 with their admission board.

85
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,720
 That is being set between a rock and a hard place.

86
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,760
 That is a difficult situation.

87
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,720
 And so, as we began to process together what he would do,

88
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,960
 he looked at me and he asked me,

89
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,720
 "Kylin, why does stuff like this happen?

90
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,080
 "I've done everything right.

91
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,120
 "Like, I've walked with God and I've worked hard

92
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,160
 "and I've served his people and I've invested in others

93
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,880
 "and I've made sure to utilize my gift and steward my time.

94
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,200
 "Like, why is this happening to me?"

95
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,800
 What do you say to someone in a situation like that?

96
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,920
 When it feels like they've done everything

97
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,000
 and deserve to expect the best thing,

98
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,440
 and yet their experience would say

99
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,640
 something different is happening altogether.

100
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,360
 I remember in that same college ministry,

101
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,600
 I actually met a young lady

102
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,560
 who had no interest in Jesus whatsoever.

103
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,280
 She was raised in a Muslim family,

104
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,600
 and yet she had a friend, not just any friend,

105
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,800
 a best friend that fiercely loved God

106
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,760
 and was super intent on leading this young lady to Jesus.

107
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,600
 And she did it.

108
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,640
 Like, she relentlessly pursued this girl.

109
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,480
 And in time, she came to place her faith in Christ.

110
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,480
 And it wasn't just like, "I believe in Jesus."

111
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,120
 She believed in Jesus.

112
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,840
 Like, she was ferocious in asking questions

113
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,360
 and learning as much as she could.

114
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,920
 Like, it was early on within the first couple of weeks

115
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,160
 of her declaration of faith,

116
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,120
 where she looked at me and goes,

117
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,640
 "Can you explain the Trinity?"

118
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,880
 She was that in.

119
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,120
 She was so into Christ.

120
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,520
 And then her family found out.

121
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:28,600
 And as her family found out,

122
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,200
 that which gave her so much life

123
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,800
 began to take life from her

124
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,480
 because the cost of her faith was that of her family.

125
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,000
 They pushed her away.

126
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,320
 They abandoned her entirely.

127
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,160
 And I remember looking at her

128
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,160
 as she was grieving the fact

129
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,920
 that this had all gone the way it was,

130
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,160
 where she was expecting the very best of things to happen,

131
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,920
 yet the very worst of things had happened.

132
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,840
 Yet the very worst of things had come.

133
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:57,880
 And thinking the same question the guy before her

134
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,720
 had asked me, "Why does stuff happen like this?

135
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,260
 "I deserve to expect something,

136
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,680
 "but it feels like something different

137
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,680
 "has happened entirely."

138
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,400
 Or I remember, not in college ministry,

139
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,320
 but when I moved to Houston,

140
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,440
 I started working in young adult ministry.

141
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,040
 I met this guy who actually came to Saving Faith

142
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,200
 in a room just like this.

143
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,400
 Like, it was in a worship gathering

144
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,360
 where we preached on stage and we worshiped all together.

145
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,160
 And he came down front and we were just talking.

146
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,800
 And he decided, "Man, I'm gonna go all in on Jesus.

147
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,040
 "I'm pushing my chips forward.

148
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,940
 "I don't wanna be one foot in and one foot out.

149
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,360
 "I want to be all in on Christ."

150
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,680
 And so we saw him.

151
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,560
 Like, he drove two feet all the way

152
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,800
 into the deep end of the pool

153
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,320
 where he got implugged into the church.

154
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,320
 He started serving on weekly basis.

155
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:38,600
 He started serving within the outreach portion

156
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,920
 of his community group.

157
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:44,120
 Like, he was a diehard fanatic in the faith.

158
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:49,160
 And then the people that he thought were his friends

159
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,480
 actually betrayed him by talking about him

160
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,560
 when he was not in the room

161
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:00,560
 and using him at the cost of some sort of cheap joke.

162
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,880
 They slandered him, they belittled him,

163
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,240
 they made fun of him when he wasn't around.

164
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,080
 And he looked at me and said,

165
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,340
 "Kylin, I thought that the church was supposed to be a place

166
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:13,780
 "where God's building a family.

167
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:18,220
 "And yet this place feels like it's only filled with foes.

168
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:20,540
 "Why is this happening?

169
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,800
 "This doesn't make sense.

170
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,300
 "Like, I'm selecting into what should be

171
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,560
 "the best thing in life,

172
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,820
 "and yet it feels like the worst thing is happening to me.

173
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,760
 "Help me understand."

174
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,880
 What do you say to someone in a moment like that?

175
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,520
 When something genuinely, truly beautiful

176
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,900
 has happened in their life.

177
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,280
 Like, they have placed their faith in Jesus.

178
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,980
 They are walking with the Lord.

179
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,920
 They are openly confessing their sin.

180
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,240
 They are indulging the gift of community.

181
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,740
 They're seeking God's purposes in the world.

182
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:53,620
 And yet the very thing that we call beautiful for them

183
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:56,160
 is the very same thing that has cost them so dearly.

184
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,020
 What do you say to someone like that?

185
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:03,000
 To someone seemingly lost medical school,

186
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,680
 another that lost her family,

187
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,200
 and the last lost any confidence

188
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:13,160
 that the people of God would actually be the people of God.

189
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,160
 Why does stuff like that happen?

190
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,200
 And why would anyone follow a God that lets it?

191
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:24,920
 That's the question we're staring down the barrel of tonight.

192
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,600
 You see, that's a question that a lot of people,

193
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,640
 some of you in this room have asked yourself,

194
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,800
 and it's a question that a lot of people

195
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,060
 have actually answered that have led them to a place

196
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:33,960
 where they're no longer walking in the faith,

197
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,600
 they're actually walking away from the faith.

198
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,680
 You see, we've heard it before.

199
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:41,280
 Like, that age-old question, the problem of evil,

200
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,120
 that God is either not good enough

201
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,920
 or he is either not powerful enough

202
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,760
 to solve the suffering in our world.

203
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,440
 And yet, when it comes home

204
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,060
 and it actually roosts within our life,

205
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:53,000
 we know that question isn't so concerned

206
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,440
 with general suffering, but really personal suffering.

207
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,000
 Like, some of you, you've seen some things,

208
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,400
 you've heard some things, you've lived through some things

209
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,800
 where it's put you in a spot where you're looking at God

210
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,000
 and you can't really defend the guy.

211
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,480
 Like, it doesn't make sense that if he is who he says he is,

212
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,760
 that I would be living through the things

213
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,080
 that I'm actually living through.

214
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,320
 Like, the Christian answers for the existence of evil

215
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,480
 and the tragedies of today

216
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,520
 and all the sufferings that surround,

217
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,820
 they just pale in comparison,

218
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:21,960
 they fall insufficient of what you actually need

219
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:25,060
 when suffering strikes.

220
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:30,720
 If that's you, then tonight is for you.

221
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,080
 And if you have a Bible,

222
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:37,420
 we're gonna look at a passage in John chapter 16 together.

223
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:39,560
 John chapter 16.

224
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,120
 Tonight marks the official last talk

225
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,200
 in our series Deconstruction, or Deconstructed,

226
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,760
 where our aim has been to help you rebuild your reality,

227
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,360
 kind of boost your belief

228
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,260
 whenever it feels like crisis strikes,

229
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:52,220
 whenever you're wrestling with spiritual insecurity.

230
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:53,640
 Because contrary to popular belief,

231
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,680
 we believe that you can actually question the faith

232
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,320
 without walking away from it,

233
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,320
 since there are better answers than cultural conformity

234
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,100
 or blind belief for following Jesus.

235
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:09,760
 Paul David Tripp, he said this when he was interviewed

236
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,800
 from the podcast, "The Rise and Fall of Mars Hill."

237
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:15,160
 He said, "We should all be deconstructing our faith.

238
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:18,480
 "We better do it, because our faith becomes a culture,

239
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,820
 "a culture so webbed into the impurity of truth

240
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,500
 "that it's hard to separate the two."

241
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,100
 Like, there are some things within Christian culture

242
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:29,700
 that need to be challenged, that deserve to be reevaluated.

243
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:33,280
 But here's the thing, a Christ-honoring deconstruction,

244
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:37,340
 it revels in truth and beauty,

245
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:39,800
 not cynicism and arrogance.

246
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,720
 So let me illustrate it like this.

247
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:45,820
 Several years ago, I decided to put together a desk

248
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,840
 that my wife needed for her home office.

249
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:51,040
 And of course, the desk we ordered came in a million pieces.

250
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,200
 And when I say a million, it actually felt like a million.

251
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,840
 I mean, we unboxed it, I pulled it all out,

252
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,280
 and it covered the living room floor.

253
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,920
 And yet, I knew this is my job as a husband.

254
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,580
 And so I went to work, you know?

255
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,640
 I applied myself to the task at hand,

256
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,240
 and I was proud of the progress I was making.

257
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,160
 Like, this thing was coming along swimmingly,

258
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,400
 until I took the two tabletops,

259
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:15,120
 and I decided to bring them to an adjoining spot

260
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,480
 where they did not sit flush with one another.

261
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20,440
 And it occurred to me in that moment

262
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,860
 that something had grievously gone wrong.

263
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,020
 So what did I do?

264
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:27,760
 Did I choose to think the instructions

265
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,780
 were misleading me the whole time?

266
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:32,440
 This is crazy, they clearly don't want me to build this desk.

267
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,940
 No, that would have been a cynical response.

268
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,320
 Did I consider the situation at hand and think,

269
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,520
 you know what, I know better than the manufacturer

270
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,760
 on how to build this desk.

271
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,920
 I don't need these instructions.

272
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,320
 I will assemble it on my own.

273
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,220
 That would have been a proud response.

274
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:53,200
 Instead, the right response,

275
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,800
 which the response I took,

276
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,840
 is I worked backwards through the instructions,

277
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:01,160
 disassembling the desk all along the way,

278
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,360
 until I identified this tiny,

279
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,360
 critical little mistake that I made.

280
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,920
 And yet after correcting that miss,

281
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,120
 I began to reconstruct the desk,

282
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,080
 and what I found was something beautiful

283
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,280
 and worthwhile to build in the end.

284
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,040
 You see, the aim of deconstruction

285
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:25,040
 is to ultimately rebuild a faith that is beautiful,

286
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,820
 which is why deconstruction without reconstruction

287
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:30,960
 is a tragedy, since every crisis of faith

288
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,360
 carries with it the potential to clarify your vision

289
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,360
 for who God is.

290
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,480
 Do you wanna know who God is?

291
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,680
 Like, this is an opportunity to know who God is,

292
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,680
 to get greater clarity, eyes to see,

293
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,280
 a wider vision to bold who in fact he is,

294
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,160
 but not just that, you get a vision

295
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,360
 of what he's doing in the world.

296
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,960
 Like, I know who God is, I know what he's doing,

297
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:53,220
 and just the cherry on top, I know how I fit into it all.

298
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,960
 Like, that's the gift that deconstruction

299
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,920
 brings to the table, so long as you're willing

300
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:02,060
 to do the work of reconstructing your faith in the end.

301
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,720
 So what about those moments, those crises of faith

302
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,480
 that don't seem to clarify your vision of who God is,

303
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,180
 they only seem to confuse it?

304
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:14,480
 What do you do when one minute,

305
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:19,400
 following God is the unquestionable part of your life,

306
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,640
 but then the next moment, because of the things you endured,

307
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:26,560
 the suffering you faced, you're questioning

308
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,560
 why you would even follow him to begin with.

309
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,380
 How do you pick up and put back the pieces

310
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:35,860
 when you find yourself in a moment of suffering?

311
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:37,040
 That's what we're gonna talk about

312
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,620
 in our final lesson in the series.

313
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,860
 And coincidentally, it's the final lesson

314
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:45,180
 that Jesus instructs his disciples on in John chapter 16.

315
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,220
 Like, whenever you come to John 15, 16,

316
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,340
 and then you can include 17 into the mix,

317
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:51,820
 what you learn is that Jesus is giving an instruction

318
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:55,700
 to his disciples on what they can expect

319
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:58,860
 once he goes to the cross, right?

320
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,780
 Like, they know, or excuse me,

321
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:04,020
 he knows that he's about to be wrongly arrested,

322
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:07,740
 unjustly tried, and that he's going to be publicly executed.

323
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,380
 And so to prepare them for what's ahead,

324
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,260
 he looks at them and says, "Hey, John 15,

325
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:13,260
 "you need to make sure you're abiding in God,

326
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,800
 "that you're making your home with him,

327
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,060
 "that you're dwelling with him,

328
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,340
 "that you're depending on him,

329
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:18,980
 "because persecution is gonna come.

330
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,860
 "But then don't worry, in time,

331
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,120
 "the Holy Spirit's gonna come as well.

332
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,480
 "I'm sending in backup.

333
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,780
 "You're gonna get some reinforcements.

334
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,840
 "It's power from on high that is gonna come to you

335
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:30,060
 "and help you here in the today."

336
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:31,180
 But it's not only that.

337
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:33,820
 You need to know too that though hardship is ahead,

338
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:36,620
 hope is as well, because though I am dying,

339
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:40,060
 rising, and returning to the Father, I will come back.

340
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:42,420
 And it's into that context

341
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:45,000
 that we catch up to this conversation.

342
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,740
 The disciples, they look at him in John 16, verse 29,

343
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:52,120
 and they say, in response to these things,

344
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:57,120
 "Now you are speaking clearly and without figures of speech.

345
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,380
 "Now we can see that you know all things

346
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:00,980
 "and that you do not even need

347
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:03,180
 "to have anyone ask you questions.

348
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:05,480
 "This makes us believe that you came from God.

349
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:09,640
 "Do you now believe?" Jesus replied.

350
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:12,640
 "The time is coming, and in fact,

351
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:16,080
 "it has come when you will be scattered.

352
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:19,820
 "Each to your own home, and you will leave me all alone."

353
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:22,100
 We'll stop right there.

354
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,580
 We'll talk about this section first and foremost,

355
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:26,220
 because it contains our first point.

356
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,180
 You see, we know on this side of history

357
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:31,040
 that Jesus is about to walk into the teeth of the enemy.

358
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,020
 Like, we know that.

359
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,980
 We've read the book, we've heard the stories,

360
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,080
 we've gone to Easter service.

361
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,060
 We know that that's what Jesus is walking into.

362
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,620
 We're well aware of the fact

363
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:42,420
 that this is about to go seemingly horribly wrong for him.

364
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:45,220
 But the disciples do not know that.

365
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,480
 You see, they know, they even believe

366
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,660
 that Jesus is the Son of God,

367
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,860
 and he has come to inaugurate his kingdom,

368
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,900
 to establish it here on the earth.

369
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,740
 And yet, some of the details

370
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,140
 of how that's all gonna work out

371
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:58,220
 have not necessarily settled for them yet.

372
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,740
 And so what's going to happen

373
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:02,980
 is they're going to step out of this instruction,

374
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,860
 and they're going to go to the garden,

375
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,740
 and Jesus is going to be arrested,

376
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:09,340
 and all hell's gonna break loose.

377
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:11,260
 Like, for these guys, the bottom's gonna fall out,

378
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,840
 their belief is going to break,

379
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,540
 they're gonna worry and panic

380
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,540
 that all of this is not going according to schedule.

381
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,940
 They're going to feel a major crisis of faith.

382
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:21,100
 They're going to begin to experience suffering

383
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:24,220
 that comes in the darkness of his death,

384
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,940
 and it leaves them in a spot

385
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:31,840
 where they're unsure if this guy is who he says he was,

386
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:35,360
 and if in fact, their life has amounted

387
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,780
 to nothing in the end.

388
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:39,660
 You see, they respond in a way

389
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,940
 that many of us respond to whenever crisis comes.

390
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:44,740
 They run, they hide, and they panic.

391
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:47,100
 Because, and this is our first point,

392
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:50,340
 suffering reveals what we truly believe about God.

393
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:55,140
 Suffering reveals what we truly believe about God.

394
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:58,300
 What we believe about him, not just what we think about him.

395
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:02,040
 Like, there's a big distinction in those two ideas.

396
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,700
 To help you get clarity on the distinction,

397
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:06,260
 I asked Google AI.

398
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:08,800
 It said, "Thinking refers to the mental process

399
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,160
 "of considering information,

400
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,200
 "evaluating possibilities, and forming ideas,

401
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:17,740
 "while believing signifies a stronger conviction

402
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,920
 "where someone accepts something is true.

403
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,660
 "Often with a level of certainty and commitment."

404
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:24,120
 So just to put that very simply,

405
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,280
 the differences in thinking versus believing

406
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,740
 is thinking is all about information,

407
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:31,080
 whereas believing is all about conviction.

408
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,680
 Like the disciples, they don't say,

409
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,520
 "You know what, Jesus, we've evaluated the evidence.

410
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,300
 "We have inspected all of the data,

411
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:40,880
 "and we have decided that we think you are the son of God."

412
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,980
 That's not what they say.

413
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,540
 They say, "We believe."

414
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:47,260
 From the text, "We believe you are the son of God."

415
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:51,260
 Like, we're staking our faith on it.

416
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:55,060
 Like, we genuinely think in the core of our inner being

417
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:58,260
 that you are who you say you are,

418
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,420
 which is why it's so disorienting for them

419
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,980
 and for ourselves whenever suffering strikes

420
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:06,040
 and everything we believe starts to break down.

421
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,940
 Like, we often do what they did.

422
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:10,020
 Like, we scatter when crisis comes.

423
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,540
 We desert Jesus when difficulty develops.

424
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:15,760
 We abandon whenever the adversity strikes.

425
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,300
 And the reason we do is

426
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:23,940
 we have an insufficient belief in God.

427
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:26,460
 You see, rather than believing

428
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,700
 that God is intrinsically good,

429
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,560
 we instead believe that he's only good

430
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,020
 when things go according to our plan.

431
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:37,100
 Or rather than believing that God is intrinsically kind,

432
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,220
 we only believe he's kind

433
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:42,380
 if he looks out for us in the ways that we need.

434
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:45,220
 Or rather than believing that God is intrinsically loving,

435
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:48,300
 we question just how loving he is

436
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,440
 if he doesn't intervene into that situation

437
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,100
 and produce this sort of outcome.

438
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:56,640
 Like, contrary to the typical arguments

439
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,520
 around this problem of evil,

440
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:02,860
 most people, when it comes to evil and pain and suffering,

441
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,760
 is they don't deconstruct

442
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,440
 because God is some genocidal maniac.

443
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,080
 You better follow his rules or else.

444
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,800
 Like, that's not why most people actually deconstruct.

445
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:15,260
 Now, that's an issue that there are really good answers for.

446
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:17,380
 In fact, a few weeks back, TA,

447
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:20,100
 he spent about 45 minutes here from this stage

448
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,480
 teaching on Sunday service through that problem.

449
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,940
 You should totally go listen to it

450
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,620
 if you actually want the answers

451
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:29,340
 to why God would do those sorts of things.

452
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,320
 And yet that's not normally

453
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,200
 why people deconstruct from the faith.

454
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,380
 Instead, the answer to that question

455
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:37,260
 is what people use to substantiate

456
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,460
 their deconstruction from the faith.

457
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:41,880
 You see, most people deconstruct from the faith

458
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:45,720
 because their spiritual spiraling

459
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,980
 is not the product of the existence of evil,

460
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,220
 that it's out there, ooh,

461
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:53,260
 but from the experience of it.

462
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:55,360
 That's why people deconstruct.

463
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,000
 They experience evil, some suffering,

464
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,180
 that has called God's character into question.

465
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:03,040
 And so they've called him to the carpet

466
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,680
 and they're wondering, hey, are you even actually true?

467
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,120
 And yet if we want to consider some truth claims,

468
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:12,320
 the first thing we need to know is that God doesn't cause evil.

469
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,560
 God doesn't cause evil.

470
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,000
 That's the first truth you gotta know

471
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 if you're gonna unpack this problem

472
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,600
 is that 1 John 1:5 would say,

473
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,480
 "This is the message we've heard from him

474
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,260
 "and we proclaim to you, that God is light

475
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:27,880
 "and in him, there's no darkness, there's no evil at all."

476
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:31,440
 James 1:13 would say, "Let no one say when he's tempted,

477
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,520
 "I am being tempted by God,

478
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,640
 "for God cannot be tempted with evil

479
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,100
 "and he himself tempts no one."

480
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,680
 Okay, Kylan, I get that.

481
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,000
 Like I understand the fact that God doesn't cause evil,

482
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,680
 but that doesn't omit the fact

483
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,120
 that there's pain and suffering in this life.

484
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,320
 So if it's not coming from God,

485
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,840
 then where in fact is it coming from?

486
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,320
 Well, I'm really glad you asked

487
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:54,380
 because there are four good sources

488
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:57,580
 from which we can categorize evil.

489
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:00,400
 The first would be moral evil, moral evil.

490
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,440
 This is the evil that we perpetuate

491
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,540
 against one another as human beings.

492
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:07,800
 Like this is what we do when we act in a way

493
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,380
 that is not in accordance with God's will.

494
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:13,580
 So things like murder and robbery and rape and racism

495
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:15,440
 and hatred and jealousy and adultery and embezzlement,

496
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:20,360
 all of those things, those are acts of moral evil.

497
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:23,240
 And we're typically responsible for those ourselves.

498
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,860
 Next to moral evil, there's natural evil.

499
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,840
 Like these are those calamitous events

500
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,200
 that come into our world,

501
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,260
 yet are separate from any moral decision.

502
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:35,120
 Tornadoes, floods, fires, congenital diseases,

503
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,120
 like these are the things

504
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,800
 that natural disasters categorize.

505
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,840
 It's a product of the fall in Genesis 3,

506
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,320
 and it proliferates over the course of time

507
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,080
 as things grow worse and worse and worse.

508
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,920
 The third category would be spiritual evil.

509
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,840
 You see, we live in a world

510
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,720
 where spiritual warfare is very real.

511
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,620
 An unseen realm does in fact exist,

512
00:21:56,620 --> 00:22:00,760
 and pain and suffering, they are induced by the demonic.

513
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,560
 Now, let me be abundantly clear.

514
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,360
 Not everything is the devil,

515
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,240
 but some things are the devil.

516
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,040
 Like just because you hit a nail on the road

517
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:11,960
 and you got a flat tire,

518
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:15,120
 it's not 'cause the devil's out to get ya, you know?

519
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,380
 Oh, he did it again!

520
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,880
 Calm down, brother, you probably just hit a nail.

521
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,240
 Not everything is, but some things are,

522
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,000
 and so it's good for us to consider,

523
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,600
 man, what in life might actually be the product

524
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,760
 of a deep darkness?

525
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,160
 Because as you look into the halls of history

526
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,560
 and you evaluate some of the circumstances in our day,

527
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:36,240
 while it's difficult to ascribe what source is at play,

528
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,880
 those atrocities that you see,

529
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:43,360
 that just have an insidiousness to them,

530
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,480
 that may very well be the cause

531
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,760
 of something spiritually dark.

532
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,800
 And then the fourth one,

533
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,000
 the one that's most important for this room,

534
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,260
 is personal evil.

535
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:56,980
 Because the shortest answer to the problem of evil is you.

536
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,740
 It's me.

537
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:01,480
 Like if there was a world

538
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,680
 where there was no spiritual darkness

539
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:06,320
 and there was no natural disaster and you lived within it,

540
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,400
 evil would still exist,

541
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,880
 because you're there, because I'm there.

542
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:16,560
 Great case in point is Tom Hanks in the movie "Castaway."

543
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,640
 Tom Hanks is what?

544
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:20,320
 Deserted on an island all by himself.

545
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,200
 There's no one there for him to hurt.

546
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,960
 There's no one there for him to harm.

547
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,160
 And yet Tom Hanks somehow finds a way

548
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,320
 to sin against Wilson!

549
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:30,000
 A volleyball.

550
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,580
 Like he, within a vacuum,

551
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,280
 locked away all by himself,

552
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:40,660
 still acts evil.

553
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,960
 This is a good example of personal evil.

554
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,280
 You see, it could be a combination of any of these things

555
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,640
 that explain the evil pain and suffering

556
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,640
 that you experience in life.

557
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,020
 But the overarching point

558
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,880
 is that there are credible explanations

559
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,280
 for the suffering we experience

560
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,380
 that don't condemn God's character.

561
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:58,240
 So why doesn't he do something about it?

562
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,300
 Why doesn't God do something about it?

563
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:04,480
 If he can, why won't he?

564
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,680
 He will.

565
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:11,460
 God will do something about evil.

566
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:15,240
 And he might do something about it,

567
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:20,240
 the suffering that surrounds you within your day.

568
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:27,720
 But often, God will not do something

569
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,480
 because he has very good reason.

570
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,080
 And that reason is one we see in 2 Peter 3, 9.

571
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:37,160
 The Lord is not slow to fulfill his promises,

572
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,640
 as some count slowness.

573
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,740
 But he is patient toward you,

574
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:45,880
 not wishing that any should perish,

575
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:48,520
 but that all should reach repentance.

576
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:52,440
 You see, God, he will right every wrong,

577
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:56,640
 wipe every tear, mend every wound, cure every hurt.

578
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,180
 But he will not do it just not yet.

579
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:04,720
 And the reason why is because he is beckoning people

580
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,080
 to come to him.

581
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,820
 He wants deeply for people to come to him.

582
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,360
 Like, it's so ironic.

583
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:14,440
 Like God is willing to suffer our sins a little bit longer

584
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:17,480
 so that you and I don't have to suffer our sins forever.

585
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:21,000
 Like, who's the one that's actually suffering here?

586
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,520
 It's God.

587
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:27,520
 Like, God deserves justice against all godlessness.

588
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,680
 And he could do it right now.

589
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:33,840
 It could be over and he wouldn't be wrong for it.

590
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,320
 He would be right because evil deserves to be judged.

591
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:42,320
 And yet it is in his mercy that he slows the clock.

592
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:47,760
 He provides us time because he's beckoning us to come home.

593
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,360
 That's not bad news.

594
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,300
 That is good news.

595
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,960
 Like, that's not an evil God.

596
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,000
 That is a merciful God.

597
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,680
 Like, that's a God that's playing the long game,

598
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,920
 that's trying to pursue as many people as he can.

599
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,840
 And that should change things for you and I.

600
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,840
 Like, Christian, if you're in the room tonight

601
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,320
 and you're suffering through something,

602
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,920
 that should change your perspective.

603
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,640
 God has not solved your issue

604
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,800
 because he is trying to solve the world's issue.

605
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,600
 He's trying to bring people back home.

606
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,160
 Now, listen, as I say that,

607
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,720
 I know that some of you instinctively feel this.

608
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,040
 So what, you're just telling me to suck it up?

609
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,040
 Like, you just want me to grit it out?

610
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,540
 You want me to just like suck my tear back up

611
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:29,300
 into its duct?

612
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,840
 No, that's not what I'm saying.

613
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:38,280
 But I am saying this should shift our perspective

614
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,880
 when we consider suffering,

615
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:43,340
 which is exactly where Jesus goes next.

616
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:46,520
 We'll look at 32 again.

617
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,600
 He says, "The time is coming.

618
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:52,040
 And in fact, it has come when you will be scattered,

619
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,520
 each of you to your own home.

620
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,120
 You will leave me all alone.

621
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:59,900
 Yet I am not alone, for my father is with me."

622
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:02,400
 You see, everyone in this story,

623
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,240
 they make a decision about what direction

624
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,320
 they're going to run whenever suffering comes.

625
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,200
 And the decision they make,

626
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:11,480
 it depends on their purpose in that suffering.

627
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:14,600
 Because no one chooses what they suffer,

628
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,440
 but everyone chooses how they suffer.

629
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,580
 No one chooses what they suffer,

630
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:22,040
 but everyone chooses how they suffer.

631
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:22,960
 And here's the thing,

632
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:27,480
 how you suffer depends on your purpose in life.

633
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,040
 So listen to me.

634
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:32,840
 If you think your purpose is your happiness,

635
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,360
 your comfort, your wellbeing,

636
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,600
 it's no surprise you're disappointed.

637
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:42,760
 Because that is not Jesus's promise here.

638
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,800
 He looks at us and he says,

639
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,080
 "Hey, you're going to have trouble.

640
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,320
 It's going to come."

641
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,520
 Like the world is not yet right in all of its wrong.

642
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,440
 God has not yet come back and fixed all things.

643
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,320
 So for you to expect that you're going to be happy,

644
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,480
 means that you're expecting something

645
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,320
 that will sorely disappoint you.

646
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,120
 If you think that's your purpose,

647
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,000
 Jesus is pleading with you

648
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,840
 the way that he's pleading with the disciples.

649
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,920
 And he's saying, "Hey, no, no, no, listen to me.

650
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,160
 There's a better purpose for you than that."

651
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,600
 Like your purpose isn't comfort, it isn't materialism.

652
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,960
 It isn't the gods of Dallas, Texas in your life

653
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,680
 or wherever it is you're listening from.

654
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:18,360
 Instead, your purpose is transcendent.

655
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,360
 It is to know God.

656
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:23,560
 That's crazy.

657
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,280
 It's to know God.

658
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,560
 Like to actually know him,

659
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:29,040
 not just to ingest a bunch of facts

660
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:32,000
 and ascend intellectually and then regurgitate that,

661
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,180
 that information for other people to learn.

662
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:37,060
 It's to learn as much about him as you can,

663
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:40,160
 that it might develop within your innermost man and woman,

664
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:43,280
 deep love for him.

665
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:48,680
 And the natural expression of knowing a God like that

666
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,720
 is you tell everybody.

667
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,160
 You tell everybody.

668
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,800
 Like anybody watching a new show in the room, show of hands.

669
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:58,960
 You watching a new show, something on HBO or Amazon

670
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,520
 or Paramount or whatever your streaming service is.

671
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,360
 Okay, leave your hand up if you've told someone about it.

672
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:08,360
 You clearly think that's worthy of worship.

673
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:13,620
 But there is a purpose greater

674
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:17,720
 than making your favorite TV show known.

675
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,680
 It is to make God known.

676
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,840
 He is infinitely better.

677
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,920
 That feels weird that I even have to say it.

678
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,280
 He is infinitely better.

679
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:30,680
 And he's begging you to believe it.

680
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:33,600
 He's begging you to believe it.

681
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:38,280
 And he's actually, he's hoping your suffering

682
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,980
 will be helping in moving you to the knowledge

683
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:43,480
 that maybe you've settled for a purpose too small.

684
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:50,700
 You see, your purpose has power over suffering.

685
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:58,320
 For reference, legend has it that famed Italian violinist

686
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:03,360
 Niccolo Paganini went before an audience to perform

687
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,200
 just like you.

688
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,800
 And yet as he stepped out in front of the crowd,

689
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,200
 what he realized is he did not have

690
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,840
 his famed instrument with him, his trustworthy tool,

691
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:17,840
 the violin that had led him to such notoriety.

692
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:21,120
 Instead of waiting him on stage was a secondhand instrument,

693
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:25,280
 one that was old, decrepit, and not worthy of playing.

694
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,580
 And so as he looked at the audience, he said,

695
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:27,700
 "Please give me just a moment."

696
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:30,160
 And he snuck backstage and looked behind the curtain

697
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:33,360
 and inspected the rest of the auditorium for his violin.

698
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,060
 And yet what he learned is that his violin was stolen.

699
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,360
 And they had left this one instead,

700
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:45,100
 trying to sabotage his purpose.

701
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:49,600
 And yet as the report reads,

702
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,480
 Niccolo took that secondhand instrument

703
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,640
 and he looked to the crowd and said,

704
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,760
 "Ladies and gentlemen, I will show you

705
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:59,360
 "that the music is not in the instrument.

706
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,560
 "It's in the soul."

707
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:04,680
 And he began to play that violin in such a way

708
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:08,360
 that enraptured enthusiasm gripped the crowd

709
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,440
 as the music poured off of the platform

710
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,720
 and it descended across the seats

711
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,200
 and it touched every heart and it captivated all attention.

712
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:19,360
 They actually write that it felt like the ceiling

713
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,360
 of the room would blow off the space

714
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:25,000
 because of the ruckus, applause, and accord

715
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,920
 that were coming from the people listening in.

716
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:29,460
 They said Niccolo had never played

717
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:31,400
 the way he played that day.

718
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:37,980
 What is Niccolo trying to teach you and I?

719
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:40,600
 (whispering)

720
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:47,540
 That a moment of crisis cannot confront someone

721
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:51,340
 nor conflict them if they're convinced of their purpose.

722
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:55,700
 You see, crisis is coming for us all.

723
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,620
 For some of us, it's come already.

724
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:59,400
 And either it will define your purpose

725
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:02,580
 or your purpose will define it.

726
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:05,800
 For the disciples, the crisis of Christ's crucifixion

727
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,460
 and the ensuing suffering they experienced

728
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:08,540
 and the darkness of his death,

729
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:10,200
 it redefined everything for them.

730
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,980
 You read their stories and what you learn

731
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:13,540
 is some of them ran for the hills,

732
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:15,060
 others went back to their old jobs,

733
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:19,060
 and Peter outright denied the fact that he followed Christ.

734
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:22,780
 Everything they had spent the last three years of their life,

735
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:25,380
 the new purpose they had received from God,

736
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:30,380
 they were willing to abandon the moment crisis struck

737
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:31,880
 and suffering ensued.

738
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:34,880
 And yet you see, Jesus has a very different response

739
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,380
 because crisis didn't define his purpose.

740
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:40,140
 His purpose defined his crisis.

741
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:42,160
 It defined his suffering.

742
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:47,100
 When you read through Christ's arrest,

743
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,040
 you don't see him rally the boys together

744
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,800
 and prepare to present a defense.

745
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:56,400
 What you see is he actually heals a guy.

746
00:32:56,400 --> 00:33:01,100
 He speaks and the soldiers fall backwards

747
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,640
 and he comes with hands together,

748
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,020
 ready to be cuffed and taken away.

749
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:06,660
 As he stands before the Sanhedrin

750
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:10,060
 and they can't get two testimonial accounts together

751
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:14,420
 to actually convict him of a wrongful accusation,

752
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:16,300
 Jesus steps forward anyways,

753
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,380
 knowing the proceedings must carry forward

754
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:19,700
 if he is going to go to the cross,

755
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,080
 die for the sins of the world,

756
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,420
 rise forth from the grave

757
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:23,860
 and lead us in everlasting life,

758
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,900
 he chooses to indict himself.

759
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:30,020
 And as he hangs on the cross,

760
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:34,020
 Jesus doesn't asphyxiate

761
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:37,540
 the way that most men do

762
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:41,060
 and the way that instrument of execution

763
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,580
 was designed to kill.

764
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:46,420
 Instead, the way Mark recalls it,

765
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:51,020
 is he says, "Jesus uttered a loud cry

766
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:53,120
 "and he breathed his last."

767
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:57,300
 If you're suffocating to death,

768
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:00,180
 you don't breathe a loud cry.

769
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:03,860
 You don't shout in a final breath of declaration

770
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:05,060
 that it's finished.

771
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:08,620
 (congregation laughing)

772
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:10,500
 It says just a couple of verses down,

773
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,420
 "When the centurion who stood facing him

774
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:15,420
 "saw that in this way he breathed his last,

775
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:17,220
 "a guy that had seen many, many, many, many,

776
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:19,260
 "many men breathe their last,

777
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:23,680
 "he said, 'Truly, that guy is the son of God.'"

778
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:28,140
 Jesus didn't let his sufferings define his purpose

779
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:31,140
 and we don't have to let our sufferings define ours either.

780
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:33,980
 But how do you do that?

781
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:37,820
 Like how do you actually endure suffering,

782
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:40,760
 encounter evil, push through it

783
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:44,260
 in a way that looks like Christ?

784
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:45,220
 Well, you do what he did.

785
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:46,620
 You remember what he remembered,

786
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:48,460
 that his father was with him.

787
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:52,620
 You must remember the same, that God hasn't left you.

788
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:53,900
 Like he hasn't abandoned you.

789
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,220
 He hasn't lost sight of you.

790
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:56,700
 He hasn't run out on you.

791
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:59,780
 So many of us in a deconstructed phase

792
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:01,900
 think God is nowhere to be found.

793
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,380
 He's right here.

794
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:06,060
 He's still close.

795
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:06,980
 He's with you.

796
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:09,140
 You've just lost sight.

797
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:12,140
 Like I know some of you, like you're in chronic pain

798
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:13,500
 and yet he's right there with you.

799
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,780
 He's telling you, "Hey, even though it feels so hard,

800
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,740
 "I will sustain you."

801
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,340
 Some of you, you feel betrayed

802
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:21,740
 because of what they said or what they did.

803
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:22,960
 And yet he's looking and saying,

804
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,140
 "Hey, I'm never gonna betray you.

805
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:28,180
 "I will never leave you nor forsake you."

806
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:30,420
 Some of you feel so lonely

807
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:32,980
 and he is there with you in the loneliness,

808
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:35,740
 simply saying, "Hey, your soul was not made

809
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:37,820
 "for anyone else but me."

810
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:42,260
 Some of you, you look at the loss of a loved one

811
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:44,220
 and you are gripped with such despair

812
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:45,060
 and yet he is telling you,

813
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:47,740
 "Hey, death doesn't get the last word over them."

814
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:51,260
 Some of you, you've been abused in your story,

815
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:54,460
 mentally, emotionally, sexually at some point.

816
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:59,260
 And he's saying, "Hey, I can mend every wound,

817
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:01,100
 "even the unseen scars.

818
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:03,660
 "I'm with you."

819
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,580
 He is with us in it,

820
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:08,600
 whatever it is that you suffer through now,

821
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,180
 he's with you in it.

822
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:13,860
 And listen, this might be the most important thing I say,

823
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:18,860
 it is not most loving of God to take our suffering away.

824
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:26,660
 It is most loving of God to enter our sufferings himself.

825
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:31,820
 Some of you want him to chop her over,

826
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:35,860
 pull you out and rescue you to some other spot.

827
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:41,460
 And yet his heart is one that sees you in the flame of fire

828
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:43,020
 and parachutes right in.

829
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:45,980
 And he stands beside you through it all.

830
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,940
 This is his heart.

831
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:50,460
 And we see it in the person of Jesus.

832
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:53,100
 Like Jesus, he entered into our suffering.

833
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:57,020
 Listen, he had a pretty cush existence

834
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:58,320
 before he showed up, okay?

835
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:02,820
 He had no good reason to come from heaven down here below.

836
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,460
 And yet he chose to anyways, why?

837
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:07,500
 Because he wants to be with you.

838
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,340
 And he wants you to be with him,

839
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:11,780
 not just now, but forever.

840
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:15,900
 He has stepped into our sufferings,

841
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,580
 but here's the thing, not just to sit in them with us,

842
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:20,320
 but to lead us through them,

843
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,820
 which is where we'll finish.

844
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:24,740
 Verse 33, "I have told you these things

845
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:26,380
 "so that in me you may have peace.

846
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:28,200
 "In this world, you will have trouble,

847
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:31,180
 "but take heart, I have overcome the world."

848
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:33,540
 Like Jesus doesn't promise a pain-free existence

849
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:34,580
 or an easygoing life.

850
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:37,200
 He tells us, "Hey, this world is anything but perfect.

851
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,540
 "And yet here's the thing you need to know,

852
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:39,980
 "peace is possible."

853
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:42,020
 Wait, what'd you say?

854
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:43,740
 Peace is actually possible for me?

855
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:44,900
 Yeah, that's what I said.

856
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:47,040
 How is it possible?

857
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,980
 It's possible in me,

858
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:51,740
 which was really convicting for me to read

859
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:53,020
 because I was reading through that.

860
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:53,860
 I thought to myself,

861
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:58,600
 how often do I look for peace in other places than Jesus?

862
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:01,320
 Like he's often not the one that I'm looking for peace in.

863
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,320
 In fact, I would rewrite that to say,

864
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,120
 "In this world, you will have trouble."

865
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:05,960
 Oh, excuse me.

866
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:08,360
 "So that in my circumstances, you may have peace.

867
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:11,240
 "So that in your future, you may have peace.

868
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,340
 "So that in your job, you may have peace.

869
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:16,120
 "Or so that in your justice, you may have peace."

870
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:18,640
 I try to replace the fact that peace is only

871
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,840
 and solely found in him.

872
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,280
 How are you trying to replace the place

873
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,640
 where Jesus' peace is solely and only available?

874
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,260
 You're looking elsewhere?

875
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:30,200
 Like, do you think it's gonna come from a new job

876
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,200
 after you faced a layoff?

877
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,400
 No peace in that.

878
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:37,000
 Justice against a person that hurts you,

879
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:41,680
 cure for yours or someone else's illness,

880
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,420
 relief from your past.

881
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:48,640
 There's no peace, true God-given peace in those things.

882
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,920
 Now, let me be clear.

883
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:53,900
 Wanting for an end to suffering

884
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:57,880
 is a desire worthy of wanting.

885
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:02,080
 God wants an end to suffering himself.

886
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,080
 He will accomplish that, in fact.

887
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:07,280
 And yet, the only place that peace is truly found

888
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,700
 is in Christ.

889
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:12,120
 Because peace isn't found in suffering removed,

890
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:14,080
 it's found in suffering redeemed.

891
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:18,480
 Peace isn't found in suffering removed,

892
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,760
 it is found in suffering redeemed.

893
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:23,960
 Like, so often, God will not change your situation

894
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:26,820
 because he is trying to use your situation to change you.

895
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:29,960
 Since it's in the midst of suffering, not outside of it,

896
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:32,360
 that we are best able to decide

897
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,240
 what we want to be true of our lives

898
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,240
 once we get outside of suffering again.

899
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:40,400
 So let me ask you so very graciously,

900
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,600
 because I know some of you are hurting here.

901
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:47,640
 If you're in a season of suffering,

902
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,280
 are you counting down the days

903
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,220
 until God changes your circumstance?

904
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:57,400
 Or are you making the days count

905
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,840
 that God has given you now?

906
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:04,040
 Like, if you're in a season of suffering,

907
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,800
 are you complaining against God,

908
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,080
 raging against the heavens,

909
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,440
 or are you actually considering the fact

910
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:11,080
 that maybe he's trying to do something in you

911
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,560
 and through you today?

912
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:15,600
 If you're in a season of suffering,

913
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,760
 are you looking at your situation with old eyes,

914
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:21,640
 tired eyes, or are you looking upon it

915
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:25,240
 and evaluating carefully with a new God-given perspective

916
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:28,120
 of what suffering might actually accomplish?

917
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:30,380
 Like, listen, as hard as it is to believe,

918
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:34,000
 suffering circumstances are often the perfect condition

919
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,920
 for your growth in God's glory.

920
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,160
 Like, they're the perfect condition

921
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,760
 for your growth in God's glory.

922
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,440
 Like Romans 5, 3, 5 says,

923
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:45,360
 "Not only so, but we also glory in our sufferings."

924
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:48,080
 Because we know that suffering, it produces perseverance,

925
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:50,880
 and perseverance, character, and character, hope,

926
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,120
 and hope does not put us to shame

927
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:54,680
 because God's love has been poured out into our hearts

928
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:57,120
 through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.

929
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:02,000
 So does anybody in here follow viticulture,

930
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,000
 winemaking, show of hands?

931
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,600
 Don't do that, you're in church.

932
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,840
 (congregation laughing)

933
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:11,200
 I don't follow it very closely,

934
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:15,720
 but there is one common knowledge amongst all winemakers,

935
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:19,160
 and it's this, that the hardest soil

936
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:21,240
 produces the greatest grapes.

937
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:24,800
 Why is that?

938
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:30,520
 Because it's in difficult ground

939
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:36,640
 that though you may not yield a great quantity of fruit,

940
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:39,220
 you actually yield the greatest quality of fruit

941
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:41,560
 because it's in difficult soil

942
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:45,920
 that those grape clusters receive the most character,

943
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,800
 that the vine itself,

944
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,480
 as it draws nutrients through its roots,

945
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:53,200
 prioritizes what's most important,

946
00:41:53,200 --> 00:42:00,120
 which is to produce a fruit that is filled with life.

947
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:07,320
 That's what your suffering offers you the opportunity for,

948
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:13,280
 to produce something of great character, great flavor,

949
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,920
 a multifaceted experience,

950
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:20,840
 the likes of which transcend other bland ways of living.

951
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:24,200
 Hebrews 12, 11, it says,

952
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,600
 "For the moment, all discipline seems painful

953
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,660
 "rather than pleasant,

954
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:30,880
 "but later that discipline yields the peaceful fruit

955
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:34,660
 "of righteousness to those who have been trained by it."

956
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,040
 You see, according to Jesus,

957
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:42,000
 success isn't suffering avoided, it is suffering endured.

958
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:47,280
 And I'll admit, the world is right.

959
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:50,360
 So many Christians follow Jesus

960
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,320
 because they've never suffered anything.

961
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:55,680
 And yet what the world will not admit to you

962
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,080
 is the very strongest of Christians

963
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:00,040
 are those that have suffered something.

964
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:04,560
 They have lived through hell,

965
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,640
 and they stand to tell the tale.

966
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:12,640
 God will produce something worthy, glorious,

967
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:16,680
 beautiful in you by way of the suffering it is you're under.

968
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:20,120
 We will all suffer,

969
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:22,280
 and yet our sufferings, they're not final.

970
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:24,300
 Like they don't get the last laugh, they're not fatal.

971
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:25,520
 We have hope beyond the grave,

972
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:30,360
 and they're not futile because our pain isn't purposeless.

973
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:35,280
 I started tonight with a story about three friends,

974
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,360
 and yet I didn't finish their stories.

975
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,600
 Because while each of them found themselves

976
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:41,840
 in a moment of great crises,

977
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:46,200
 where they questioned their faith, they doubted in God,

978
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,800
 God redeemed all of their suffering.

979
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,880
 For my friend, the one that wanted to go to medical school,

980
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:56,560
 he actually went to medical school, he's a doctor today.

981
00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:00,880
 And he went under the endorsement of the very professor

982
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:05,200
 that threatened to withhold the opportunity from him.

983
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,100
 That professor looked at him and said,

984
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:10,640
 there's something unique about this guy

985
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,600
 that he wouldn't defend himself,

986
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:15,960
 but he would preserve his witness for the sake of Christ.

987
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:21,240
 That young lady, though she's lost her family,

988
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:23,780
 she began a new one, married a Christian guy.

989
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:27,920
 And now their family is one

990
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:32,320
 that has produced generational change

991
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:36,600
 for those that will come after her.

992
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:39,320
 Her family will be a family unlike the family before,

993
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:42,280
 her family will be a family of a people that follow God.

994
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:46,780
 And the last guy, the one who was betrayed

995
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:49,180
 and slandered and gossiped about by his friends,

996
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:55,200
 he actually now today in his church leads a Bible study,

997
00:44:55,480 --> 00:45:00,440
 calling people to belong to a family

998
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:04,040
 that will accept them free of judgment

999
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:06,000
 and void of any criticism.

1000
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,660
 Friends, we will suffer, some of us have already,

1001
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:12,000
 and yet that suffering can be redeemed.

1002
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,320
 God is not evil for our hardships,

1003
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:18,480
 he's good because he's made a way through them all.

1004
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:21,280
 Like he redeems those sufferings now,

1005
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:22,720
 and yet what we know is he will remove

1006
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,240
 those sufferings forever.

1007
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:28,400
 For this is what he's promised in Christ.

1008
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,600
 Like suffering reveals what we truly believe about God,

1009
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:33,960
 that in God we have a long-suffering Savior

1010
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:37,080
 who endured our sin until he could send his son.

1011
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:42,600
 In God we know that while we wouldn't choose to suffer,

1012
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:45,400
 he would choose to suffer, suffer for the sins

1013
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:48,280
 of people like you and me, even to the point of death.

1014
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:53,680
 And we know that that same God in the person of Jesus

1015
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:56,120
 came to bring peace to our suffering,

1016
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:59,360
 not only redeeming what we endure today,

1017
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:03,240
 but promising defeat for that which we suffer

1018
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:05,200
 for all eternity.

1019
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,480
 If you're here and you're suffering,

1020
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:10,840
 there's only one way to never suffer again,

1021
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:13,080
 and it's in him.

1022
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:14,320
 Will you place your faith in him

1023
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:15,400
 and come to know him tonight?

1024
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,200
 Let me pray for you.

1025
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:21,240
 God, I'm so grateful and thankful, God, for your word.

1026
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:25,320
 Oh God, I thank you for how sufficient it is.

1027
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:28,240
 The fact, God, that from its pages,

1028
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:30,720
 even to this day, right now in a room like this,

1029
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,480
 you still speak to us.

1030
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:34,200
 And the words you speak to us

1031
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,240
 are not words of condemnation,

1032
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:37,520
 they're not words of judgment,

1033
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:39,640
 they're words of love.

1034
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:42,200
 They're words of relationship, invitation,

1035
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:44,000
 a welcoming reception, God,

1036
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,600
 that any person that would place their faith in Jesus

1037
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:48,360
 for the forgiveness of their sins

1038
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:50,360
 and calling him Lord of their life

1039
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:54,760
 might actually be united to you again.

1040
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:56,640
 I pray, God.

1041
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:58,760
 Oh God, I wanna spend a moment here now,

1042
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:00,800
 but Lord, you do not need me

1043
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,880
 to do what you, God, alone can do,

1044
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:06,080
 which is work in the hearts of these friends,

1045
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:07,960
 move God amongst these seats,

1046
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:11,920
 stir up our spirits, save our souls,

1047
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:17,000
 and save us from our suffering,

1048
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,560
 if not today, one day.

1049
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:21,960
 It's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
