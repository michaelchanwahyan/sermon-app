1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,160
 (upbeat music)

3
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:33,620
 - All right, well, hey, welcome everybody in the room,

4
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:37,620
 everybody joining us online in our Porch Live locations.

5
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,060
 I wanna highlight especially Tulsa, Porch Live Austin,

6
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:42,800
 Porch Live Des Moines, Porch Live North Houston.

7
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,900
 We are starting a brand new series called POV,

8
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:49,860
 or Point of View, Seeing How They Saw the Savior.

9
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,780
 Let me start by telling you a little bit

10
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,040
 of something that happened to me this past week.

11
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,340
 I went to lunch with a friend on Thursday,

12
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:57,240
 and he was older than I was,

13
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,060
 and I was asking him where he was from and his wife,

14
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,820
 and it turned out that his wife and he and she

15
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,020
 had gone to Mizzou, and I did some math,

16
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:05,660
 and I had another friend that was around their age

17
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:10,340
 and knew a little bit about who was at Mizzou at that time,

18
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:13,140
 and I said, "Wasn't Brad Pitt at Mizzou?"

19
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,940
 Random trivia that I happen to know.

20
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,720
 "Wasn't he at Mizzou, like, around that time?

21
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,580
 "Like, did your wife ever meet him?"

22
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:21,040
 And she said, "Oh, she knew Brad well.

23
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,340
 "She dated his roommate."

24
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:25,140
 And it turned out it was all true,

25
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,160
 and he was like, "Yeah, I mean,

26
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,340
 "she wasn't walking with Jesus,

27
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:28,580
 "he wasn't walking with Jesus,

28
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:29,780
 "but he was a super nice guy."

29
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:31,340
 And he began to tell these stories of, like,

30
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:33,480
 "Oh, yeah, there was one time that her roommate,

31
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,760
 "they were going to some concert,

32
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,620
 "and the car broke down an hour outside of where Mizzou was,

33
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:40,460
 "and Brad got in the car and came, picked him up."

34
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:43,500
 And I was like, "But he wasn't Brad Pitt at that point."

35
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,520
 He was like, "No, he was, like,

36
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,140
 "doing thespian plays at Mizzou.

37
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,540
 "It was nothing like, you know, Fight Club, Brad Pitt,

38
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:51,660
 "or whatever you think of when you think of Brad."

39
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:56,180
 But he just began to tell these stories about knowing him.

40
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,940
 It even to the point of, like, the send-off,

41
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:00,340
 when he stopped doing the plays at Mizzou

42
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:02,500
 and decided to go try and make it in Hollywood,

43
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,140
 and how they all got together and they sent him off.

44
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:08,440
 And I was introduced to just another aspect

45
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,860
 of somebody that a lot of us have seen movies of,

46
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,300
 or we know about, and we know something about,

47
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,500
 you know, maybe him and Jennifer, or the other one,

48
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:21,500
 and just the ways that most of us know about any celebrity.

49
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,180
 And yet to hear from a firsthand account

50
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:26,700
 of what this actually person was like is totally different.

51
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:31,260
 It introduces you to a deeper level,

52
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:35,060
 another level of their humanity, of who they were.

53
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,940
 And our heart in this series

54
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:40,420
 is to look at these stories from the gospels

55
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:43,160
 and attempt to do just that, not with some celebrity,

56
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,580
 but with the Son of God.

57
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:48,180
 To walk through, because all of us in the room,

58
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,940
 I'm confident, or the vast, vast, vast majority came in,

59
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,340
 and you know at least about Jesus.

60
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,340
 You may have been in church a long time,

61
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,300
 and you know some of the stories.

62
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:01,540
 But our hope is to take a look in depth

63
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:04,800
 at the stories and the perspectives

64
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,460
 of those who were around Jesus when he walked on the planet.

65
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,600
 'Cause there's some level in which a lot of us,

66
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,160
 when we think about Jesus, aka God,

67
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,380
 there's things that come to mind,

68
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:19,180
 and they shape how we respond to him, what we pray to him.

69
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,100
 Like maybe you think of God and you think he's distant,

70
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,500
 he's apathetic, he's a judge.

71
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,700
 They're there to catch you when you get out of line.

72
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,620
 You wouldn't put it like that,

73
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,500
 'cause you know the church answers.

74
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,500
 There's some part of your heart that really thinks that way.

75
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,740
 Or maybe you think he, it's just kinda there to be a genie.

76
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,960
 God, will you help me make sure I get a green light,

77
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,840
 'cause I'm running late to work,

78
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,700
 and we hope things go well, and please help that date to go.

79
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:44,500
 And you see it more as like a genie.

80
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:49,400
 And our heart is to help you and all of us

81
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,300
 more clearly see Jesus as who he is,

82
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:54,200
 because the Bible says in 2 Corinthians chapter four,

83
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,400
 it's in seeing Jesus,

84
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,260
 beholding him is the word that's used.

85
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,220
 We're transformed from one degree of glory to the,

86
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:03,300
 we're made more like him.

87
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,820
 And so that's what we're gonna do in this series

88
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:08,200
 and walk through each week, a different point of view.

89
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,460
 And tonight, we're gonna do the point of view

90
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:14,580
 of the disciples early in Jesus's ministry.

91
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,500
 And do so by covering a trio of stories

92
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,540
 from the book of Mark chapter five.

93
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:23,160
 Now why do I say the disciples early in his ministry?

94
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,220
 Well, in Mark chapter two, Jesus calls the disciples.

95
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:29,140
 Mark chapter three, he teaches the disciples.

96
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:31,660
 And in Mark chapter four, they get on a boat ride

97
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,140
 where Jesus says, "Hey, we're gonna get on this boat.

98
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,680
 "We're gonna go across the other side."

99
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,400
 This huge storm pops up, the disciples are terrified.

100
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,220
 Jesus is taking a nap in the back on a pillow,

101
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:41,940
 and they wake him up, and they're like,

102
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,100
 "Jesus, we're dying."

103
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,860
 And they're fishermen, so they're used to storms.

104
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,000
 So this was a bad storm, and they're going,

105
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,100
 "Water's coming to the boat, we're all gonna die."

106
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,620
 And Jesus wakes up, gets sleep out of his eyes, says,

107
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:52,460
 "Peace!"

108
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:57,180
 And he rebukes the wind and wave like it's a child.

109
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,600
 And it goes completely still.

110
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,820
 And the disciples are going, "Wow.

111
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:08,300
 "Who is this man that controls even nature?"

112
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,380
 And it's at the end of that story

113
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:14,540
 that our story's gonna begin, chapter five.

114
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,500
 And Jesus is getting off the boat.

115
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,060
 And if all that excitement wasn't enough,

116
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:23,180
 what happens next is further alarming or exciting,

117
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,180
 depending on how you were,

118
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,100
 and we're just gonna walk through three things

119
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,720
 the disciples would have seen of this new rabbi,

120
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,660
 who they would soon find out is the savior of the world.

121
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:36,380
 Three characteristics of how he is powerful,

122
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:40,500
 he's personal, and how he's purposeful.

123
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,500
 And so the first one we're gonna look at is his power.

124
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,820
 And like I said, he's getting off the boat.

125
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:46,140
 So this is from Mark chapter one,

126
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,660
 or I'm sorry, chapter five, verse one.

127
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:49,660
 If you don't have a Bible, it'll be up on the screens.

128
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,060
 If you don't have a Bible in general,

129
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,860
 it would be our joy to give you one,

130
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:53,940
 and you can get one at the Welcome Center

131
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:54,780
 right outside of these doors.

132
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,680
 So here we go, verse one, chapter five.

133
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:01,100
 So they arrived at the other side of the lake,

134
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:05,260
 the boat ride, in the region of the Gerasenes,

135
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:07,940
 when a man climbed out of the boat.

136
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:12,300
 A man possessed by an evil spirit, or demon possessed,

137
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,020
 came out from a cemetery to greet them.

138
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:18,580
 This man lived among the burial caves, the tombs.

139
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:23,340
 He could no longer be restrained, even with a chain.

140
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,380
 Whenever he was put into chains and shackles,

141
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,900
 as he often was, he snapped the chains from his wrists,

142
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,180
 smashed the shackles.

143
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,820
 No one was strong enough to subdue him.

144
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:34,700
 Day and night he wandered among the burial caves,

145
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:38,080
 in the hills, howling, crying out in the night,

146
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,780
 as he cut himself with sharp stones.

147
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,300
 While Jesus was some distance away,

148
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,160
 the man saw him and ran to meet him.

149
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,580
 So they just get out of this storm.

150
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,300
 The disciples are like, man, that was crazy.

151
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:49,580
 Wow, that is the epitome of excitement in one day.

152
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,060
 I just saw a guy command a storm,

153
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,760
 and they step off the boat, and all of a sudden,

154
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,820
 this demon possessed man begins sprinting

155
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,140
 in their direction at them.

156
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,460
 The other gospels tell us he's naked.

157
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,980
 So they got a naked demon possessed man sprinting at them,

158
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:02,460
 going, oh, this is about to go down.

159
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:05,060
 Watch out, bro, we got the storm controller over here.

160
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,740
 This bro better watch himself.

161
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:10,300
 And the demon possessed man doesn't run up

162
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:14,220
 to tackle, hurt, attack.

163
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:19,220
 We're told he bowed low before Jesus,

164
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:22,380
 and with a cry, he screamed,

165
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,700
 why are you interfering with me,

166
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:26,380
 Jesus, son of the most high God?

167
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:29,420
 In the name of God, I beg you, don't torture me.

168
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,180
 This demon possessed man, he runs,

169
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,500
 and he throws himself at the feet of God,

170
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,740
 and says, please, don't harm me.

171
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:38,240
 But he knows exactly who just stepped on the shore.

172
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,860
 For Jesus has already said to the spirit,

173
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,740
 come out of the man, you evil spirit.

174
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,780
 Then Jesus demanded, what is your name?

175
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:48,100
 And he replied, my name is Legion,

176
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,900
 which is a word for many,

177
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,100
 because there are many of us inside this man.

178
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:56,820
 Then the spirits begged him again and again

179
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:59,300
 not to send them off to some distant place.

180
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,760
 There happened to be a large herd of pigs

181
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:04,060
 feeding by a hillside nearby.

182
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,940
 Send us into those pigs, they begged, let us into them.

183
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,940
 So Jesus gave them permission.

184
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:11,140
 Evil spirits came out of this man, entered the pigs.

185
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:13,620
 The entire herd was about 2,000,

186
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,820
 and they ran that herd all the way down

187
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,140
 the steep hillside into the lake.

188
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:19,320
 They drowned in the water.

189
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:24,000
 Verse 15, a crowd soon gathered around Jesus,

190
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,460
 and they saw the man who had been possessed

191
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,800
 by the legion of demons.

192
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,260
 But he wasn't bound, and he wasn't naked.

193
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:35,740
 He was sitting there fully clothed and perfectly sane,

194
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,460
 and they were all afraid.

195
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:42,300
 The first thing we see, and the disciples would have seen,

196
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:45,380
 is Jesus is powerful.

197
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:46,940
 He's not just powerful over the storm.

198
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:51,620
 He's powerful over sin, Satan, the spiritual world.

199
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:53,140
 In other words, the Bible doesn't present

200
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:57,300
 a Star Wars view of good side versus dark side,

201
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,480
 enjoying the dark side, and it's kind of a coin toss

202
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,860
 on who's gonna win based on the day.

203
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:03,540
 The Bible presents a view that all of the spiritual world,

204
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:08,500
 any angelic or demonic force, Satan himself,

205
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,980
 bows at the feet of Jesus all throughout the New Testament

206
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:15,100
 when Jesus encounters somebody who is demon-possessed

207
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,500
 inside of those lands.

208
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,680
 They don't ask him a question.

209
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,580
 They don't talk back to him.

210
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:23,580
 They grovel at the Son of God's feet who created them.

211
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,940
 Other places in the Bible, when Jesus is being arrested,

212
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,900
 they come to him, and they arrest him later in the story,

213
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,700
 and they're arresting him and go take him to the cross,

214
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,740
 and Judas is there, and they bring the temple guard

215
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:34,660
 before him, and they say, "Hey, are you Jesus?"

216
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:37,300
 And he says the words, "I am," which was a reflection

217
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:40,860
 and callback to a statement from God in the Old Testament

218
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:45,860
 that God says, "I am," and the guards fall to their feet

219
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:50,700
 as power with a word comes out, and the disciples see

220
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:56,540
 this man is more powerful than any force of evil

221
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:59,180
 and darkness and any force in general in our world,

222
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:05,220
 that Jesus is powerful, and this man had done,

223
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:10,660
 and really is a living example of what sin can do

224
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,780
 to any of our lives.

225
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:18,660
 The word for unclean spirit is a word for violated,

226
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:22,340
 defiled, that he had gotten into something,

227
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:24,460
 and something had gotten into him,

228
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,580
 and it's a real story of a real man,

229
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,860
 but it's a parallel to what sin can happen,

230
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,220
 produce in our lives.

231
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:36,040
 Make a decision with substance, with sexuality,

232
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,740
 and all of a sudden, it goes from something

233
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:41,980
 that we thought we can control, and it now is taking over

234
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,740
 and controlling us.

235
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:47,580
 Let me use an illustration.

236
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:52,580
 2003, in Harlem, there was a hospital that had a man show up

237
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,380
 and he had bite marks all over his arm,

238
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:56,420
 all over his leg, all over his hand,

239
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,560
 and he came to get him treated, and he said,

240
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:00,860
 "My pit bull bit me," and the doctor was treating him,

241
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,780
 and he looked at the bite marks, and he thought,

242
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:07,380
 "Those are far too severe and far too large

243
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:10,100
 "to be the bite marks of a pit bull."

244
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,580
 But you're treating him, like who would make that up?

245
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,580
 Maybe it was just kind of bizarre biting,

246
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:19,440
 but it so startled the doctor that when the gentleman left,

247
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,500
 he told a policeman, "I think you should send someone

248
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:26,440
 "over to the apartment to check on whatever's going on

249
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,900
 "over there," and so the police went over

250
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,640
 to the apartment later, and they showed up,

251
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,340
 and they knocked on the door, and they basically said,

252
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:35,820
 "NYPD," nobody answered.

253
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:40,820
 They knocked again, "NYPD," and they didn't hear a person.

254
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:45,460
 They heard a loud, deep growling

255
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:49,180
 to the point where they decided,

256
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:51,900
 "I don't think it's a good idea for us to go in there,"

257
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,800
 so they got a warrant, and they went to the neighbor,

258
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,020
 and they got permission to drill a hole

259
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:59,940
 in the apartment side, neighbor's apartment next door,

260
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:02,540
 and they look in to the camera, and I'll show you

261
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,340
 in a second what they eventually saw,

262
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,300
 but first thing they see is these scratch marks

263
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,860
 all up and down the wall from ceiling to bottom,

264
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,860
 and they're going, "This is like out of the sandlot

265
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:13,860
 "or something, or whatever is in there,"

266
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:18,540
 and they turn the camera, and this is what they see,

267
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:23,540
 a 400-pound tiger that this man had for 2 1/2 years

268
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:29,140
 been raising named Ming, and this man was just

269
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,240
 an avid lover of animals.

270
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,500
 He brought him home when he was a cub,

271
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,300
 and neighbors always complained of loud noises

272
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,900
 and it smelled like urine and things

273
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,220
 that should have been somewhat alarming.

274
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,140
 In fact, even the neighbors across the street,

275
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:43,460
 there was a retirement home that called multiple times

276
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:45,660
 saying, "Hey, we've seen a tiger in the window,"

277
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:46,940
 (audience laughing)

278
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:47,820
 and they didn't believe him.

279
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,620
 They were like, "It's the tiger lady again, okay?"

280
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:55,640
 Eventually, they had to send in a SWAT team

281
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,340
 that on the outside, and those who are streaming it online,

282
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:00,220
 you won't be able to see this because copyright laws

283
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:02,220
 and et cetera, but I don't know if we have

284
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,300
 that picture now, JJ.

285
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,140
 All right, I'll just tell it.

286
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,060
 It's even better this way.

287
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,500
 He's hanging out the outside of the building,

288
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,740
 and they get to the window, and he's got a tranquilizer gun,

289
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,940
 and he shoots the dart into the back of the tiger,

290
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,500
 and the tiger turns around, sees him,

291
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,740
 charges towards the window.

292
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:17,620
 He's hanging from the roof on a rope with his tranquilizer.

293
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,440
 Tiger smashes and breaks the window,

294
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,560
 and then he hits the bars on the outside,

295
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:27,140
 and eventually, he's taken and he's brought away.

296
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,380
 Now, why did the SWAT team go there?

297
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:31,220
 Because they knew that just like had happened

298
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,660
 the day before, that man had something

299
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,540
 that he thought he could control.

300
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:38,460
 The reason he ended up getting bit is he had a kitten,

301
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,620
 stray cat that he brought home as well

302
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:44,220
 just 'cause he loved animals, and that tiger loved lunch,

303
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,620
 and so the tiger tried to eat the animal.

304
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:49,260
 He was trying to get him away, and the tiger attacked him,

305
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,380
 and the SWAT team knew you have something

306
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,500
 you think you can control,

307
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,800
 but you cannot control a 450-pound tiger,

308
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,460
 and it may be strong, but a group of a SWAT team trained

309
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:02,060
 is going to bring that out because it's gonna harm you

310
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,900
 and harm others if it stays in there,

311
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:07,180
 and the picture that we see of Jesus is he sees this man

312
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,220
 that nobody could, they couldn't shackle.

313
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:13,140
 He got in a place where it said that they could no longer

314
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:15,020
 bind him as in they at one point could,

315
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,320
 and they couldn't anymore,

316
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:21,180
 and yet Jesus is stronger than any force,

317
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,860
 and this is where I think it's a real parallel

318
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,540
 for our own stories and for some of us

319
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:27,860
 in the room right now because like this man,

320
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,840
 it's not necessarily a demon,

321
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:35,680
 but at some point along your life and story,

322
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,620
 there's something that felt defiled.

323
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:46,400
 Maybe you were hurt, abused, violated,

324
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,280
 and it created some hurt and some things

325
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,840
 that you now turn to substances to cope with,

326
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,640
 and you've been turning for a while,

327
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,360
 and it's no longer something that you can control.

328
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:02,180
 There's an eating disorder that you've been carrying

329
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:05,620
 with you for years, and you never told anybody,

330
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:11,660
 and like this man, you find yourself alone in the night

331
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,380
 feeling like I'm gonna carry this to the grave.

332
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:18,400
 Maybe you were introduced like I was to pornography

333
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:24,300
 early in age 12, and you like I did carried for years

334
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,540
 or are carrying like I did for years

335
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:30,180
 an addiction to pornography, and you hide it in shame,

336
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,720
 and the man, it's like he cries out in the night.

337
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,140
 It's where you find yourself.

338
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:42,080
 Maybe it is a substance or some sort of medication,

339
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,220
 and you have bought the idea

340
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,360
 that you're just gonna carry that,

341
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,780
 that Jesus can't set you free from that,

342
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:54,780
 and the parallel here is there is nothing

343
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:58,460
 that Jesus is not stronger than,

344
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:01,040
 and he wants to use that power to bring freedom

345
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,420
 just like he did with this man,

346
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,900
 and whatever your story is, you don't have to carry that.

347
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,440
 It doesn't have to define you,

348
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,380
 and you don't have to live the rest of your life

349
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:14,480
 with that marking you, but like this man,

350
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,140
 you've gotta bring that to Jesus,

351
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:20,700
 and the way we do that today is by bringing it

352
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:24,660
 to his body, the closest representation,

353
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,540
 which is the church, where we bring it to others

354
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:30,180
 in the light, we live openly, confess that,

355
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:34,740
 and when you do, the Bible says we experience healing,

356
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:39,580
 James 5:17 says, and you discover what this man discovered.

357
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:42,560
 You don't have to live where there is no life.

358
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,820
 That's what it means to live among the tombs,

359
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:50,180
 and you can be free because Jesus is more powerful

360
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:53,240
 than anything anyone inside of this room is facing.

361
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:57,460
 Now, what's interesting is the man,

362
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,780
 after he's sitting there with Jesus,

363
00:16:58,780 --> 00:16:59,860
 and he's closed in his right mind,

364
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:00,940
 and the town comes up, and they're like,

365
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,540
 oh my, that's crazy Carl, man.

366
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:05,180
 Crazy Carl's got clothes on, he's sitting with Jesus,

367
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:09,540
 and Jesus gets up to leave and go back across the lake,

368
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,520
 and the man says, I wanna come with you,

369
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,360
 I wanna come with you.

370
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,740
 It says this in verse 18.

371
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:14,860
 Jesus was getting into the boat.

372
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:16,860
 The man who had been demon-possessed begged him

373
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:21,060
 to go with him, but Jesus said,

374
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:24,660
 no, go home to your family,

375
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:28,040
 and tell them everything the Lord has done for you,

376
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:31,220
 how he's been merciful to you.

377
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:34,300
 So the man started off to visit the 10 towns of that region,

378
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:37,340
 began to proclaim the great things Jesus had done for him,

379
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:39,020
 and everyone was amazed.

380
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:41,500
 The same thing that we see in this man's life

381
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,860
 is what Jesus does with all of our stories.

382
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:46,260
 He wants to take, as we've said, your mess, my mess,

383
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,580
 he wants to make it a message for his glory.

384
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:52,380
 Whatever shame, whatever decision in your past

385
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,620
 that you go, man, I could never open up about that,

386
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,720
 I was a part of having an abortion,

387
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,060
 or encouraging someone to get an abortion,

388
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:01,260
 when you bring that to God,

389
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,980
 he begins to write a beautiful story,

390
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:06,900
 and he begins to use your story to tell of God's goodness.

391
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,220
 That's what he told the man.

392
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,060
 No, no, no, no, no, don't come with me.

393
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:13,000
 I want you to go and tell your family, your friends,

394
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,280
 your people what God has done for you.

395
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:20,520
 What's interesting is, often, the past that we have,

396
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,360
 the mess that we have,

397
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,360
 it's what God uses to make a platform.

398
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,760
 Some of the best ministers that I know,

399
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,600
 as it relates to someone who struggled with pornography,

400
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,680
 that's a part of their story.

401
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,760
 Anytime someone comes out in front,

402
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,060
 and they're struggling with same-sex attraction,

403
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:37,440
 often one of the best ministers to that person

404
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,240
 is someone who goes, man, that's a part of my story,

405
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,320
 can I just share how God has given me freedom,

406
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,840
 is giving me freedom, and is setting me free from that.

407
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,920
 That God wants to use whatever your story is,

408
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,320
 the thing that you're afraid to even acknowledge

409
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,480
 and admit to people around you,

410
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,800
 he wants to use that mess and make it a message.

411
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:56,100
 And it's bizarre, it's like your story is a key

412
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,560
 that unlocks the chains of other people.

413
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,840
 This is why we train our volunteers.

414
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,360
 There's 200 men and women that lead at the porch

415
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,560
 that are part of our volunteers,

416
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,140
 and all of them go for a training,

417
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:07,240
 a 10-week training process to serve and be a part

418
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,240
 of leading alongside of us in this ministry,

419
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,440
 and part of that training involves

420
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,600
 learning to share your story, your testimony,

421
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,200
 about what God has done in your life.

422
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,800
 You learn it in 30 seconds, three minutes,

423
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,480
 and 30 minutes if God allows.

424
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,360
 That you learn to share,

425
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,780
 because one of the most powerful things

426
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,200
 that no one can refute,

427
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,860
 and that all of us who know Jesus have,

428
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:25,280
 is a story, a testimony of what God has done.

429
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,520
 And Jesus looks in the eyes of this man,

430
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,540
 who he just gave his humanity back to,

431
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:32,760
 and gave him back to humanity.

432
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:36,280
 He says, go tell your family,

433
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:40,880
 go tell your friends, go tell them what God has done.

434
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,280
 So we see Jesus, and the disciples saw Jesus,

435
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,680
 this man is powerful.

436
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:52,280
 And then we're introduced to another story.

437
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:55,720
 He gets back on the boat, verse 21.

438
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,200
 Jesus got back into the boat again,

439
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,720
 he went back to the other side of the lake,

440
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,960
 where a large crowd gathered around him.

441
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,320
 So he goes across the lake, a big crowd around.

442
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:06,660
 Then a leader of the local synagogue,

443
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:09,400
 whose name was Jairus, arrived.

444
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,760
 When he saw Jesus, he fell at his feet,

445
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,360
 pleading fervently with him.

446
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:18,880
 My little daughter is dying, he said.

447
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,960
 Please come lay your hands on her, heal her,

448
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,520
 so she can live.

449
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,360
 And Jesus went with him, and all the people followed.

450
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,040
 So he shows up, he gets to the other side of the shore,

451
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,680
 huge crowd is waiting there, and a religious leader,

452
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,280
 that's what it means to be a leader of a synagogue,

453
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,840
 he shows up, and he throws himself at the feet of Jesus.

454
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:33,920
 In order for a religious leader

455
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,240
 to throw themselves at the feet of Jesus,

456
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:38,440
 they clearly have desperate, and a desperate posture

457
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:41,500
 and heart, and we're told why.

458
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,320
 His daughter, who we find out is age 12,

459
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:47,520
 he's got a sixth grader who's dying at the point of death.

460
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,280
 And this is the worst day in this man's life.

461
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,560
 So maybe through tears, he's saying,

462
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,320
 can you help me, can you help me?

463
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,440
 We've gotta move quick, she's about to die.

464
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,400
 And Jesus and the boys get there, and there's a crowd,

465
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,960
 and I'm sure Jairus is like, get out of the way,

466
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,360
 get out of the way, and they're trying to hurry,

467
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,560
 and they're going to go see this little girl

468
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:07,240
 before she dies, and they're trying to press through

469
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,740
 this crowd that's surrounding him.

470
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:14,040
 And then Mark takes a really interesting term in the story.

471
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:18,640
 He says this, a woman in the crowd had suffered

472
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,760
 for 12 years with constant bleeding.

473
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:24,360
 She had suffered a great deal from many doctors,

474
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:27,200
 and over the years, she spent everything she had to pay them.

475
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,800
 But she had gotten no better, in fact,

476
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:32,600
 she had even gotten worse when she heard about Jesus.

477
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,760
 And Mark takes us in this really intense moment

478
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,940
 where the dad is going, can you please save my baby girl?

479
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,720
 We've gotta hurry, we've gotta hurry, move out of the way,

480
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,300
 move out of the way, and Mark brings up another woman

481
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,400
 that's entirely unrelated to this,

482
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,560
 and he begins to talk about her medical history

483
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:49,600
 and this menstrual problem that she's having,

484
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,740
 and it goes from TMI to this is bizarre,

485
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:53,480
 and he's like, that's it, they're on their way.

486
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:58,480
 And there was this woman, and she had this blood problem,

487
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,240
 and man, it had been, and he's going on and on,

488
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,480
 and it had been not just like a year or two,

489
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:06,500
 I mean, it had been 10, almost 12, more than a decade,

490
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,280
 she'd been struggling, and she'd gone to doctor,

491
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,120
 and doctor, and doctor, nobody could get any,

492
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,560
 in fact, things were getting worse,

493
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,880
 she'd spent everything that she had,

494
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,440
 and you're like, Mark, why?

495
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:17,720
 There's a girl who's dying, he's gotta get to the house,

496
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,240
 why are we going on and on about this woman

497
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,160
 who's had this thing for 12 years?

498
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:26,760
 But Mark was written through the lens of Peter,

499
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:30,780
 and Peter saw this story firsthand,

500
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:33,040
 and he's about to tell us

501
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,080
 and show us something else about Jesus.

502
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:40,120
 And so this woman said, if I can just get to Jesus,

503
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:43,600
 and she had heard about him, and I can touch his robe,

504
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,960
 for she thought to herself, if I can touch his robe,

505
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,200
 I will be healed.

506
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:54,520
 She did, and immediately, so she sneaks up behind him,

507
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,160
 and she just touches his robe.

508
00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:01,080
 Immediately, verse 29, the bleeding stopped,

509
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,440
 and she could feel in her body,

510
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,780
 that she'd been healed of her terrible condition.

511
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:10,280
 Jesus, realizing at once

512
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,200
 that the healing power had gone out from him,

513
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,420
 turned around in the crowd and asked, who touched my robe?

514
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:20,360
 And the disciples said to him, look at the crowd you're in,

515
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:24,620
 you're in the middle of a huge, crowded group of people,

516
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:26,580
 everyone touched, probably anybody who's near you

517
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,520
 is the one who touched your robe, what do you ask?

518
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,680
 They said, who touched me?

519
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:35,600
 But he kept on looking around to see who had done it,

520
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,600
 so Jesus is not gonna let this go,

521
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,960
 and he's continuing on, wait, who was it?

522
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:40,800
 And the disciples are going, what do you mean,

523
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,200
 there's so many people around here,

524
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,280
 any of these people could have touched,

525
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,880
 does it really matter, there's a girl who's dying,

526
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,040
 let's go, let's go, and Jesus is not gonna let it go,

527
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,200
 he's going, no, no, no, no, who was it?

528
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:54,560
 And the woman, we're told, who had been bleeding

529
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:57,760
 for 12 years, and then touching his robe, and it stopped.

530
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:02,040
 Then the frightened woman, trembling at the realization

531
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:05,280
 of what had happened, came and fell to her knees

532
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:09,400
 in front of him, and told him what she had done.

533
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:14,120
 Jesus' response to this woman

534
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:17,140
 is one of the more profound teachings,

535
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:19,820
 maybe in the book of Mark, because it shows us

536
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,680
 how Jesus responds to the outcasts.

537
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:25,680
 This woman, if you had this blood made her unclean,

538
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,040
 which means she couldn't go to temple,

539
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,640
 she couldn't go to church, she was not to be

540
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,840
 around other people, because if she touched other people,

541
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,360
 then they would become unclean.

542
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,720
 It meant that she could not get married,

543
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,680
 because no one could share a bed with somebody who had this.

544
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,880
 And this woman throws herself down,

545
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,600
 knowing she's broken the law, she's not supposed

546
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,600
 to be in a crowd of people, she's not supposed

547
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,840
 to touch someone, and yet she was so desperate,

548
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,720
 and she throws himself at the feet of Jesus,

549
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,480
 and how does Jesus respond?

550
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:57,000
 He says, and he said to her, daughter,

551
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 your faith has made you well, you can go in peace,

552
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,400
 your suffering is over.

553
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:09,280
 Second thing that we see about Jesus

554
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,320
 is he's not just powerful, he's personal.

555
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,760
 And let me explain what I mean.

556
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:18,320
 The only time in the New Testament Jesus calls a woman

557
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,820
 daughter, it's a very intimate term, is here.

558
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:25,480
 In all of the Bible, there's no other occasion

559
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,380
 that Jesus looks in the eyes of a person and says daughter.

560
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:32,280
 This woman just wanted the power of Jesus,

561
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,120
 just wanna touch him.

562
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,860
 Jesus wanted more for this woman.

563
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:38,200
 He didn't want her to just have the power,

564
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,880
 he wanted her to know the person.

565
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:42,000
 He wants a face-to-face encounter with her.

566
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,560
 I mean, think about it.

567
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:46,120
 No one else in the story wants this interaction to happen.

568
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,320
 The disciples don't want it to happen,

569
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,720
 they're going, Jesus, we gotta go, we gotta go.

570
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,520
 There's a guy, Jairus doesn't want it to happen,

571
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,280
 his daughter's at the point of death.

572
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,980
 The woman doesn't want it to happen, she's terrified.

573
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,980
 And Jesus wanted her to have something

574
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:59,180
 so much more than the power,

575
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:00,620
 he wanted her to know the person,

576
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:02,340
 and he wanted a face-to-face interaction

577
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,100
 because Jesus, he's personal.

578
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:06,900
 He wants a personal relationship with you.

579
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:10,180
 And he looks in her eyes and he says, daughter.

580
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,720
 Now think about the context.

581
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:15,540
 This is a woman who's spent 12 years.

582
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:17,060
 This is a woman who's been so sick.

583
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:19,500
 Imagine a scenario where someone you know in your life

584
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,340
 has spent everything that they have.

585
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:23,700
 They sold the house, they sold the car,

586
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:26,840
 they spent savings, they've done everything that they can.

587
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:30,220
 And none of it worked.

588
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:32,980
 They can't get married, they can't worship,

589
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:34,420
 can't be around God's people.

590
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:41,340
 And Jesus calls her daughter.

591
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:46,380
 Jairus was advocating for his daughter.

592
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:51,940
 Jesus says, man, you may feel like an outcast.

593
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:53,480
 This woman, there's no father mentioned for her

594
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,320
 in the picture.

595
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,500
 Like when I think about my own kids

596
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,420
 and I think about my own daughter

597
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:57,940
 and her having to suffer through what this woman did

598
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:00,100
 for years and years and years,

599
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,140
 if God forbid someday and I'm not around anymore

600
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:03,340
 and she has no one to advocate,

601
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:06,260
 and Jesus looks in her eyes and says, you have an advocate.

602
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:10,780
 I call you daughter, and you're not alone.

603
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:15,240
 And your faith has made you well.

604
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,460
 And you may feel like an outcast.

605
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:19,300
 You're adopted into my family

606
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:23,020
 because I'm personal.

607
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:24,680
 I don't wanna know you personally.

608
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:27,580
 And you're healed.

609
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,840
 Your suffering's over.

610
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:34,720
 And that woman, everything changed.

611
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:42,240
 But her story is a parallel to our story,

612
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,600
 to your story.

613
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,200
 God wants to be your story.

614
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,420
 How so?

615
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,400
 Jesus calls this woman out of hiding and says,

616
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:58,160
 I want you to come in all of your brokenness,

617
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:01,640
 messed up misbehavior to me

618
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:08,540
 and encounter my love and my grace for you.

619
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:15,480
 I want you to have a relationship with me that is personal.

620
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,700
 In the same way, this woman had a problem

621
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,340
 that she couldn't find a cure to.

622
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:25,580
 Nothing in this world, no amount of money,

623
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:26,980
 no amount of doctors, no amount of anything.

624
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:29,880
 There was no solution other than Jesus.

625
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:34,140
 Every person alive in this planet who has ever lived,

626
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:36,900
 whoever will live, has a problem that nothing in this world

627
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:40,460
 and nothing in this life can fix other than Jesus.

628
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:41,580
 That he alone is the solution,

629
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,820
 and that problem is called sin.

630
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:45,380
 Ultimately, that is why Jesus came,

631
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:47,560
 not just to heal someone of a disease she carried

632
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:50,780
 for 12 years, but to heal humanity of a sickness called sin.

633
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:52,680
 And he would do so by dying on the cross,

634
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:56,160
 giving his life on her behalf, your behalf, on my behalf,

635
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,400
 dying in the place that anyone who trusts in him

636
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,320
 and his death and his resurrection from the dead

637
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,660
 would have eternal life.

638
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,960
 And he alone is the solution to the sin in your life

639
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:05,840
 and in my life.

640
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,760
 And here's what you need to know,

641
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:09,520
 'cause this generation, it's been a long time, man.

642
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:14,080
 This is the fatherless generation who carries wounds,

643
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,880
 who wonders if God cares, if God is present,

644
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,800
 who projects their earthly father on their heavenly father.

645
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,200
 And Jesus, if he was here, would look into your eyes

646
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:27,200
 and say, "My son, my daughter, I love you

647
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:32,520
 "so much I would give my life for you.

648
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:36,840
 "Trust me, I'm not distant.

649
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,760
 "I'm present and I am personal,

650
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:43,340
 "and I wanna know you in a personal way."

651
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:49,400
 The woman is overjoyed 'cause the first time in her life

652
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:54,520
 what is unclean, which is a Jewish terminology,

653
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,960
 touches something clean.

654
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,040
 And generally speaking, if unclean touches something

655
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:02,080
 that's clean, the thing that's unclean makes it dirty.

656
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,800
 In other words, if you have clean clothes

657
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,020
 and you're hugging somebody covered in mud,

658
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:07,240
 they're gonna make your clothes dirty,

659
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,440
 not the other way around.

660
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,880
 It works similarly in terms of the way

661
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,440
 that the Jewish mindset would have worked,

662
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,320
 and really just in general we can understand

663
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,600
 that if something unclean touches that which is clean,

664
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,280
 it makes it unclean too.

665
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,320
 Works like sickness.

666
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:22,080
 In other words, the stomach bug's been going around

667
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,680
 with everybody, it seems like.

668
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,160
 And in my family, it's no different.

669
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,400
 My son got sick, and then we have kids

670
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,480
 that just pass it from one to the next to the next.

671
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,480
 And I know that despite the fact that I'm healthy,

672
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,160
 I can't go, "Hey, look, you get around me,

673
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,000
 "you're sick, I'm healthy,

674
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,020
 "I'm gonna give you my healthiness."

675
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,320
 I know that if I get around him,

676
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,440
 I'm just gonna get his sickness.

677
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,600
 That's the way that it works.

678
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:46,160
 And this is the way the Jewish understanding was.

679
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,720
 And Jesus says, "I don't work and operate

680
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,420
 "like the rest of the world does.

681
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:55,380
 "I'm more powerful than your sin, than your sickness.

682
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:59,560
 "And I do for you like I did for this woman.

683
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,120
 "I make what is unclean clean."

684
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,340
 That he, 2 Corinthians 5, 21 says,

685
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:05,380
 "Made him who knew no sin," that's Jesus,

686
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:07,260
 "to become sin so that you would become

687
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:09,800
 "the righteousness of God."

688
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,360
 It's a parallel to the gospel.

689
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,560
 And in the middle of the story,

690
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:19,040
 we're given maybe the most heartbreaking component,

691
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:22,720
 verse 35, which says,

692
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:28,220
 "While he was still speaking Jesus to this woman,

693
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:31,460
 "messengers arrived from the house of Jairus,

694
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:34,380
 "the leader of the synagogue, and they told him,

695
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:35,840
 "Your daughter is dead.

696
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,200
 "She died.

697
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,900
 "There's no use troubling the teacher now."

698
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:45,320
 The worst thing he could hear,

699
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,640
 'cause here's what he just heard,

700
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:50,560
 "Jairus, she's dead."

701
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:53,520
 And Luke's gospel told that's the only child that he had.

702
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:58,320
 You little girl, she didn't make it.

703
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,540
 And Jairus is flooded.

704
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:03,160
 I mean, what kind of grief goes through in that moment?

705
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:06,600
 Not only has she died, you weren't there for her, Jairus.

706
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,900
 You weren't there in her last moments of life.

707
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,680
 Hold her hand, pray over her.

708
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:15,480
 Come alongside her.

709
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,800
 She's gone.

710
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:23,120
 And Jesus, who had been taking his time,

711
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,080
 I mean, what are you flooded with

712
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,760
 if you're Jairus at that moment?

713
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,400
 You really had to know?

714
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,040
 You really had to know who touched you?

715
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,080
 I told you my daughter was dying.

716
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,640
 You really had to know?

717
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:36,120
 You couldn't have waited?

718
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,720
 She's had it for 12 years.

719
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:41,080
 She's been sitting, wait another 30 minutes?

720
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:46,640
 We're gonna see Jesus wasn't asleep at the wheel.

721
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,480
 And he allowed what happened to take place

722
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,980
 so that Jairus, his wife, and his daughter,

723
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:55,440
 and the disciples would see something

724
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,120
 that to this point in the ministry, Jesus has not done yet.

725
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,600
 'Cause he's not done showing the disciples,

726
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,800
 "I'm not just powerful, I'm not just personal,

727
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,800
 "I am purposeful."

728
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,560
 And he says this,

729
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,840
 "Jesus overheard them say that to Jairus,

730
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,620
 "and he said, 'Don't be afraid.

731
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:13,280
 "'Just have faith, trust me.'

732
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:16,280
 "Then Jesus stopped the crowds,

733
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,080
 "and he wouldn't let anyone go with him

734
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,040
 "to see to the house of the dying or the dead girl,

735
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,900
 "except Peter, James, and John, the brother of James.

736
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,620
 "When they went inside the home and the synagogue leader,

737
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:27,620
 "Jesus saw the commotion, weeping, wailing.

738
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:28,460
 "He went inside and said,

739
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:29,660
 "'Why all the commotion and weeping?

740
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:31,920
 "'The child isn't dead, she's only asleep.'"

741
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:35,320
 Now she was most certainly dead,

742
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:38,420
 but Jesus is describing, "I'm about to wake her back up."

743
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:43,420
 And the crowd laughed at him, or jeered, or sneered at him.

744
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:46,600
 "But he made all of them leave the house,

745
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:49,080
 "set everybody out, except for the father and the mother

746
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,020
 "and the three disciples, and he went into the room

747
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:52,360
 "where the girl was lying.

748
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:55,800
 "He took her mom and he took her dad,"

749
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,960
 who have gotta be just bawling,

750
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:01,120
 that their daughter is, she's gone.

751
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:06,860
 "And he bends over and he said to her,

752
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:11,840
 "holding her hand, Talitha kumi,"

753
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,920
 which means little girl, get up.

754
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:18,000
 "And the girl, who was 12 years old,

755
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,600
 "immediately stood up and walked around,

756
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:26,120
 "and they were overwhelmed and totally amazed."

757
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:29,320
 That Jesus is personal, purposeful.

758
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,840
 That Jesus knew all things, he knew exactly the timing.

759
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,960
 He knew that they, Jairus just wanted to see

760
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,520
 his daughter get healed, and Jesus said,

761
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,880
 "Man, I want something even more for you.

762
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:40,640
 "I want you to see me move in a way that is undeniable,

763
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:43,640
 "that to date, no one has seen before.

764
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,680
 "And you are gonna see God do what I do,

765
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:48,180
 "which is bring dead things and make them alive."

766
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:52,800
 Because Jesus is purposeful, and he has a purpose,

767
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,680
 even in the midst of the pain

768
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,120
 that's represented in this story,

769
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,520
 and the pain that's represented in this room.

770
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:01,760
 And one day, in a way that I can't fully explain,

771
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,480
 and we don't have time to go fully into,

772
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,960
 you, if you're a follower of Jesus,

773
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:09,160
 are gonna see that he is gonna put all things in your life,

774
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:13,900
 good, bad, horrendous, highs, lows, seasons of drought,

775
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:17,120
 seasons of pain, job loss, cancer, sickness,

776
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,360
 and he's gonna work them together for good,

777
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,560
 that he's gonna put purpose,

778
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,040
 and there's a purpose that he is working together.

779
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,800
 He didn't cause the abuse, he didn't cause the divorce,

780
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,760
 he didn't cause any of that,

781
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:29,000
 but he is going to bring about good from it.

782
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,500
 The scriptures have promised.

783
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,360
 And one day, you're gonna see it.

784
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:36,880
 And right now, you may not be able to see it.

785
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,600
 And I don't know that you'll ever,

786
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,520
 in this life, be able to see it.

787
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,360
 But that's the promise that Jesus said,

788
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:47,160
 that I am purposeful, and I am working together for good.

789
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,520
 I'm gonna read a verse here in a second,

790
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,720
 but it's similar to this.

791
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,560
 There's logos and things that you and I are around

792
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,760
 all the time that you don't actually see.

793
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,180
 Oh, I never noticed that before.

794
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:58,480
 Yet, the creators of that logo

795
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,920
 very intentionally put it there.

796
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:04,080
 And you've been looking at it every day, and you missed it.

797
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,040
 Here's an example.

798
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,040
 This is a FedEx label, Tostitos label.

799
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:07,880
 See that?

800
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:08,700
 Look at that every day.

801
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:09,540
 We love chips.

802
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:10,800
 There's two people eating chips and salsa in that.

803
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,080
 You see it?

804
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,080
 Right in the middle.

805
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,320
 FedEx label.

806
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,040
 Here's a FedEx label.

807
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,520
 You see the arrow between the E and the X

808
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,760
 pointing to X marks the spot.

809
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,580
 We're gonna take your,

810
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:22,680
 you see Amazon drop-off boxes at your house every day.

811
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,180
 You've never seen that before.

812
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:27,560
 The creators intentionally put it there.

813
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,600
 Here's Hershey's Kiss.

814
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,080
 Hershey's Kiss, you see it?

815
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,720
 There's a Hershey's Kiss turned sideways

816
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:34,680
 between the K and the I.

817
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:35,500
 You've been looking at it.

818
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,560
 Some of you guys got this in your purse right now.

819
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:42,760
 And they very intentionally placed this thing there

820
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:45,460
 that the creators on purpose,

821
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:48,840
 I just lost everybody, didn't I?

822
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,200
 All right, goodnight.

823
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,720
 That the creators very intentionally

824
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,180
 put this thing on purpose.

825
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:56,040
 And you haven't seen it.

826
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,680
 And it was right in front of you.

827
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,800
 Now here's what is gonna happen

828
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,680
 according to Romans 8, verse 28,

829
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:03,800
 a verse we're very familiar with.

830
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,320
 Ecclesiastes chapter three, verse 11,

831
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,760
 where it said, "He will make everything beautiful

832
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,600
 "in its time."

833
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,420
 Romans 8, verse 28.

834
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:10,020
 "We know that in all things,"

835
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:12,280
 good things, bad things, hard things, light things,

836
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:15,680
 "He works together, God works together

837
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,480
 "for the good of those who love Him."

838
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,840
 That one day, just like that moment,

839
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,040
 you just went, oh.

840
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,520
 There's things in your life and in my life

841
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,520
 that I just can't see it.

842
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:31,600
 And I can't understand how He can make good things.

843
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:36,080
 But you see things in front of you all the time

844
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,380
 that you don't pick up on.

845
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,980
 And one day from a heavenly perspective,

846
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:44,400
 you and I will see the creator is working together

847
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,160
 and placing and working and bringing about purpose,

848
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,200
 even in the pain.

849
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:52,360
 Because our God is not just powerful

850
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,200
 and not just personal,

851
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:58,400
 He is purposeful in what He brings about.

852
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:03,520
 In conclusion, He is powerful,

853
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,760
 He is personal, as in He wants a relationship with you.

854
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:11,300
 And He is purposeful in every circumstance.

855
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:12,600
 He is working for good.

856
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:17,080
 A few years ago, we had a guy at the porch

857
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,080
 and a guy on Sunday come,

858
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:22,960
 and he painted a painting.

859
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,560
 And he did it live in front of the audience.

860
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,600
 And I remember, especially on Sunday,

861
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,520
 which is the first time here at Watermark

862
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,160
 that they did it, sitting there watching,

863
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,580
 and the communicator was just speaking,

864
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:33,840
 and it was kind of just like a random,

865
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,160
 like, I guess we're trying something artsy,

866
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,960
 and they're gonna paint for 30 minutes,

867
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,160
 and they painted this thing.

868
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,520
 And you see him throwing up different things.

869
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,120
 You're like, man, what?

870
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,760
 I hope we didn't pay a lot for this,

871
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:47,280
 because it feels like you got Casper

872
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:51,780
 coming out of a T-Rex vomiting milk or something.

873
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:54,360
 And it just, you looked at it, and you're like confused,

874
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:57,600
 and it's just so random, and what is that?

875
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:03,480
 And then he finished,

876
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:06,560
 and he changed the point of view.

877
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:12,480
 And all of a sudden, you go,

878
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:16,280
 oh, it's Jesus.

879
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:20,520
 And he had been there right in front of you the whole time.

880
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,420
 You just weren't able to see him,

881
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:24,720
 because you had the wrong point of view.

882
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,980
 And what I hope in this series,

883
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:31,420
 in a way that candidly, I can't do,

884
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:35,820
 JD can't do, Josiah can't do, none of us can do,

885
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:40,820
 is that God will give you a greater clarity on who he is,

886
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:48,000
 that you will see, like the disciples who watched this man,

887
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:52,420
 give freedom to a possessed man,

888
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:56,380
 same freedom he wants to give inside of this room tonight.

889
00:39:56,380 --> 00:40:03,360
 Give healing to a woman who should run out of options,

890
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:06,520
 no hope,

891
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:11,880
 and then work in greater ways

892
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:15,100
 than you could even ask for or imagine,

893
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:19,560
 like Jairus saw and the disciples saw.

894
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:23,080
 And you would have a correct understanding

895
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:25,280
 or a more correct understanding

896
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,120
 through a more correct point of view.

897
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,480
 And he's not far.

898
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:32,640
 He's in front of you.

899
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,280
 He's around you.

900
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,760
 He's with you.

901
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,040
 And he's the king.

902
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,700
 And he's not some distant, powerful force.

903
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:40,200
 He's powerful, but he's personal.

904
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:43,160
 And he is purposefully working in your life.

905
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,000
 Let me pray.

906
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,480
 Father,

907
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:50,960
 I read stories like this, and like everybody,

908
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:55,960
 we just find ourselves overwhelmed at who you are,

909
00:40:55,960 --> 00:41:04,520
 your love, your grace, your goodness,

910
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:07,720
 compassion, your power.

911
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:11,760
 And I pray that tonight you would allow

912
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:17,840
 the eyes of anyone here,

913
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:21,080
 the heart of anyone here

914
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:24,940
 who's never fully accepted what you did for them,

915
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:28,240
 fully put their faith or trusted

916
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,060
 that you are the payment for their sin.

917
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:30,940
 You died on the cross.

918
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:32,000
 You rose from the dead.

919
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,600
 And because of that, if they receive you as their Lord,

920
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:37,060
 their Savior, the payment for their sin,

921
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:38,420
 they have eternal life.

922
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:42,720
 And you begin to bring about healing and freedom

923
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,480
 in this life that tonight would be the night.

924
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,200
 For anyone listening at a later date

925
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,000
 to this podcast right now,

926
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,180
 they would fall to their knees in their room,

927
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:53,540
 in their dorm, and wherever you have them.

928
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:55,580
 And they would put their faith in you.

929
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:57,480
 And they would find you're a God

930
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,980
 who is personal, powerful, present,

931
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:06,720
 who calls the fatherless, my daughter, my son.

932
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:11,880
 They have an advocate in heaven.

933
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:16,400
 Through you and on this earth, through your church.

934
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,000
 And I pray for the rest of us, God,

935
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,120
 that you would allow more freedom

936
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,880
 in any places in our hearts, God,

937
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,240
 where we may be blind to where you need to just take ground.

938
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:28,900
 Start with me and make us more like Jesus.

939
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:30,780
 What you say happens the more we see Jesus.

940
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:33,080
 Would you allow that to happen tonight

941
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:35,040
 and for the rest of our life?

942
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,260
 Christ's name, amen.
