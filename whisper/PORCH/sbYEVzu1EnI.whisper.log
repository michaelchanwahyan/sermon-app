[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (gentle music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:20.980]   - Porsche, how we doing?
[00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:22.520]   (congregation cheering)
[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.120]   Awesome, it's really fun worshiping with you guys.
[00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.000]   I wanna start here.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.200]   I want you to picture me at 18 years of age,
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:35.200]   and so about 90 pounds lighter, better hair, less stars.
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:41.040]   And so there I am, just a confused high schooler,
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.920]   senior year in high school,
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.000]   and I've got this 1979 Mercedes Benz.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.040]   I mean, you know, with, says Superfly on the back window.
[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.020]   It's got hydraulics.
[00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.480]   I mean, that's, you know, I'm in 4H and FFA.
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.840]   I'm a confused young man.
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.900]   I just quit athletics to try to pass Algebra II,
[00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:04.300]   and my mom comes to me, and she sits me down,
[00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.720]   and it's this serious talk.
[00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.180]   It has some weight to it, and she's a counselor,
[00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.120]   I should tell you, like a school counselor.
[00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.320]   So she does this for a living,
[00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.080]   and she says, "Where do you wanna go to college?"
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.440]   Now, you may have known the answer to this question
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:18.940]   since you were in the third grade,
[00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.320]   but what's crazy is I hadn't thought about it much.
[00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.520]   I don't know.
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.040]   And she says, "Well, what do you wanna study?"
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.160]   Nothing.
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.240]   I don't like studying, you know?
[00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.740]   And she asked this question.
[00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.380]   "Well, what are you passionate about?
[00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.800]   "What are you passionate about?"
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.440]   I'm 18 years old with a 1979 Mercedes
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.240]   that says Superfly on the back window.
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.960]   Like, what are you asking?
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.680]   What kind of profound answer to this question?
[00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.880]   'Cause it feels like I'm about to carve a path
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.860]   for the rest of my life by the answer to this question.
[00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.640]   And so I'm 18, what am I passionate about?
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.880]   I don't know, being liked, Dawson's Creek,
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.620]   and, you know,
[00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.360]   spring break, beer,
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.640]   skateboarding, art.
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.440]   She's like, "We can work with that."
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.880]   What did you just say?
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.000]   Art?
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.840]   Yes.
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.120]   I was like, "What, what do you have in mind?"
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.240]   She's like, "There's this school in Waco," not Baylor,
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.340]   "a little school you've never heard of
[00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.240]   "that you can go and study art."
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.600]   I'm like, "Cool, awesome.
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.200]   "That sounds great, I'll go and do that."
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.480]   So I did, so I moved to Waco.
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.880]   I go to this little technical school, I study art,
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.360]   and I'm there for two years.
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.280]   I graduate with a two-year degree.
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.540]   I've got this diploma, but here's what I learned in college
[00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.440]   is I like art when I can kind of do art on my own terms
[00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.680]   and kind of come up and create with whatever I want.
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.400]   I don't like art as an assignment.
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.920]   I don't like someone telling me what to art, if you will.
[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.840]   And so I'm like, I don't really wanna do this.
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.040]   So then I've got this diploma, this degree, if you will,
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.160]   that says, "Hey, now you can do this for a living,"
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.400]   but it's pretty much worthless
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.320]   'cause what I've determined in the past two years
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.040]   is I don't wanna do this for a living.
[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.600]   And so I'm back to this question,
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.240]   "What are you passionate about?"
[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.560]   And I don't know.
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.400]   Like now I'm just a slightly older version of me
[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.520]   when I was 18.
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.880]   I'm passionate a lot about a lot of the same things,
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.080]   except for now it's One Tree Hill,
[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.260]   and so I'm just like, I don't know, you know?
[00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.080]   What am I passionate about?
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:45.240]   And so I remember specifically in Waco,
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.760]   waking up early one morning, praying for a job.
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.280]   I'm like, "God, I need a job."
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.920]   And so what am I passionate?
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.200]   I'm passionate about eating and not starving to death.
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.560]   So I wake up early in the morning.
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.000]   I don't know where to go to look for a job.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.920]   Like you probably have all kinds of great places to go.
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.440]   I just go to the mall and it's not open.
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.760]   And so I sat in the parking lot, "Lord, give me a job."
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.280]   And the mall opens, I walk through it.
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.060]   This girl comes up to me and says, "Hey, what do you do?"
[00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.040]   I said, "I'm looking for a job."
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.760]   She says, "You wanna manage an Abercrombie & Fitch?"
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.840]   I say, "Yes, I do so much."
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.800]   She says, "Where?"
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:14.920]   I say, "How about Dallas?"
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:15.880]   She says, "Dunn."
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.560]   I'm like, "This is how this prayer thing works.
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:18.760]   "This is amazing."
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.520]   And so you know those guys that stand in front of Abercrombie
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:23.920]   with their shirt off?
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.320]   I was not one of those guys, okay?
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.120]   I took my shirt off once, they said, "Put it back on."
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.520]   Anyways, and so I worked there
[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.680]   and here's what I learned there.
[00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.400]   I was not passionate about that, okay?
[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.940]   I was not passionate about folding clothes at midnight
[00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:39.160]   and I was doing a lot of that.
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.120]   So I thought, you know, I need to go find a new job.
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.080]   What am I passionate about?
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.400]   Okay, I'll go work at a gym.
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:44.880]   So then I'm selling gym memberships
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.200]   and I learned there that I wasn't passionate about that.
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.360]   And so then I go and I work for this design company,
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.760]   Graphic Design, I'm like, okay, I can put my degree to use.
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.720]   And then I remembered, no, I'm not passionate
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.120]   about doing other people's art.
[00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.440]   And then I go work for this consulting firm,
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:59.440]   doing sales for them.
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.120]   And I learned I wasn't passionate about that.
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.720]   And then I went and worked at telecom.
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.440]   And what I found about this time of my life
[00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.400]   is I was passionate about making money.
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.520]   And I was passionate about myself.
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.600]   And I came to a place where my passion
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.920]   was taking me in and out of jobs.
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.880]   And I kind of found myself despairing a little bit.
[00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.240]   And I don't know if you've ever been there,
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.840]   but you get real philosophical in these times.
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.000]   Like you're having really grand philosophical discussions,
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.160]   usually on the back of a tailgate with a beer.
[00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.920]   And you're like, what if I'm supposed
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.360]   to be a race car driver?
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.780]   (congregation laughing)
[00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.280]   Like what if I'm the fastest race car driver in the world?
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.000]   And I just don't know, 'cause I've never driven one.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.040]   Like I need to find this out.
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.680]   And you're having these kinds of discussions.
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.700]   And it usually almost always goes to this,
[00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:49.200]   I just wanna shack on the beach and surf.
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.480]   My buddy's like, have you ever surfed?
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:51.800]   No, but I bet I could.
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.040]   And the Christian version of this is,
[00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.160]   I think I need to move to Africa.
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.800]   I don't know why, but all the Christians,
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.740]   when they kinda hit that wall, wherever they're at,
[00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.200]   they're like, let's go build water wells in Africa
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:07.560]   or do something amazing in Africa, care for the orphans.
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.480]   And so somehow all the Christians end up in Africa.
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:12.720]   But this is the problem.
[00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.560]   And I want you to know this, it's not your fault.
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.040]   It's not your fault, you've been fed this.
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:22.640]   In fact, I wanna show you something rather profound.
[00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:25.400]   There's this phrase, follow your passions.
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.200]   You ever heard that, follow your passion?
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:31.640]   You know that little phrase was virtually not there.
[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:36.720]   It was not here before 1980.
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.120]   And I'm gonna show you on this graph behind me,
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.360]   if you will, and I'll just read this to you.
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.080]   And so the phrase, follow your passion,
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.840]   went from being virtually non-existent in 1980
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:49.160]   to one and a half million times in 1990.
[00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.680]   So all of a sudden, it shows up in English literature.
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.320]   This is not search engine, so you're like,
[00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:54.200]   well, that's 'cause the internet.
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:57.640]   No, this is written, this is typed in English literature.
[00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:59.160]   One day, it's not there.
[00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:02.000]   A decade later, it's one and a half million times.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.320]   And then if you keep going and you see that in the 2000s,
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:08.560]   it's just skyrocketed to then in 2008,
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:11.920]   over 21 million times in English literature,
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:14.120]   you could find this idea of follow your passion.
[00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:15.800]   And the reason I tell you that is because
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:19.040]   that's what you've been sold for the past 20 years.
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:21.280]   Follow your passion.
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:24.360]   And I want you to know something right up front.
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:27.760]   That's really, really, really bad advice.
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:32.160]   It's really bad advice.
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:37.160]   It flies in the face of what God's word teaches, okay?
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:40.520]   We are to bring our passion under control of the Spirit.
[00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:42.600]   We're to find a greater passion.
[00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:45.480]   We're to pursue God's passions.
[00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:48.000]   We're to inform our own passions.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.160]   But we are not to just follow our passion.
[00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:52.800]   So if you've been fed that,
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.720]   then I'm so excited that you're here tonight
[00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:56.220]   because I want you to know something.
[00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:57.720]   In my great-grandfather's day,
[00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:00.040]   in your great-grandfather's day,
[00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:02.000]   he never asked himself, let me sit back,
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.320]   man, what am I passionate about?
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:06.600]   What do I wanna do for a living?
[00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.720]   He's like, I'm gonna be a farmer.
[00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:10.440]   My dad was a farmer, his dad was a farmer.
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:12.160]   We're a family of farmers, so I'm gonna farm.
[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:13.000]   Why?
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.240]   'Cause I wanna eat.
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.280]   And it's that simple.
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.800]   It was a pragmatic approach to life.
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:21.760]   I'm gonna grow stuff so I can eat it and not die, okay?
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:23.600]   And then we show up on the scene
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:25.240]   and we got all these profound tools.
[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:28.520]   We got Myers-Briggs and DISC and Strength Finder
[00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:31.760]   and lion, otter, beaver, I'm woo, you know?
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:36.120]   And we're kinda like, we're a really introspective group, us.
[00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:36.960]   We sure are.
[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:40.040]   And so we have all of these tools at our disposal
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:41.740]   and you would think we'd get a lot better at this,
[00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:42.640]   but we're awful at it.
[00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:45.000]   We're the worst that any other demographic's ever been at it
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.200]   and it's not your fault.
[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:48.760]   It's what you've been taught,
[00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:51.400]   but I want to reteach you tonight from God's word
[00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:55.360]   so that you can leave here with the right perspective
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:58.620]   on work and passion.
[00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:00.840]   To show you that we're not getting better at it,
[00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:04.400]   from Forbes Magazine, 2012, 91% of millennials
[00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:08.560]   expect to stay in a job for less than three years.
[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:12.120]   Tom Rainier in Millennials, his book, said this,
[00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:14.320]   that we stay only two years at a job
[00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:17.380]   compared to baby boomers, an average of seven.
[00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:20.540]   So we're jumping jobs, more jobs, we have more options,
[00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:26.860]   but less commitment, which translates to less skills
[00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:29.440]   because we haven't developed them,
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:30.600]   because we're changing them
[00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.760]   with whatever passion shows up that day.
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.540]   And so that brings me to my point.
[00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:41.240]   Don't follow your passion, but develop your passions
[00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:42.840]   and use them for your purpose.
[00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:45.000]   If you're here and you're a follower of Christ,
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.740]   I'm gonna talk to you tonight, if you're not a guest,
[00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:47.840]   I know that's about half of you,
[00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:49.280]   if you're not a follower of Christ, rather,
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:50.880]   I know that's about half of you, listen in
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:54.960]   and hopefully you'll gain insight to a Christian worldview.
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:56.360]   But if you're here and you're a follower of Christ,
[00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:59.560]   your purpose is to know God and to make him known,
[00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:00.880]   is to know God and to make him known.
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:04.360]   So don't follow your passions, develop your passions
[00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:06.320]   and use them for your purpose.
[00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:08.080]   And so we're asking the question tonight,
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:09.840]   this is the subject of this evening,
[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:12.480]   what if I'm not passionate about what I do?
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:14.200]   And so maybe that's you,
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:15.720]   maybe that's a question you've asked,
[00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:19.120]   what if I'm not passionate about what I do?
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:20.240]   And so from God's word,
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.680]   we're gonna come up with these three answers,
[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:25.400]   change your perspective, invite God in to help you
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.320]   and find a greater passion.
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:30.840]   And so usually if you hang out at the porch much,
[00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:32.840]   you know that I pick a passage and I camp in it,
[00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:34.480]   I usually break it up into three sections
[00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:36.460]   and then I expound on what it's saying.
[00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:38.560]   Tonight I'm gonna be in Luke chapter five,
[00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:39.720]   verses one through 11,
[00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:41.680]   and I'm gonna read all of this up front to you
[00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:42.840]   and then we're gonna jump around
[00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:44.240]   and I'm gonna support some ideas
[00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:45.520]   with several different verses,
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:48.320]   it's gonna be more topical in nature.
[00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:51.040]   And so Luke chapter five, this is the gospel,
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:52.200]   it's the beginning of the New Testament,
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:55.360]   Matthew, Mark, Luke, if you wanna turn there.
[00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:57.660]   And so Jesus's ministry is just taking off,
[00:10:57.660 --> 00:10:59.720]   Jesus is literally on the scene,
[00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:02.660]   this part of your Bible is just a historical, accurate book,
[00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:04.660]   it's just telling you about the life
[00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:05.960]   and account of Jesus Christ.
[00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:07.520]   And so one day, verse one,
[00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:10.960]   one day as Jesus was standing by the lake of Gennesaret,
[00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:13.640]   I knew I'd messed that up,
[00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:16.180]   also the Sea of Galilee, if you prefer,
[00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:18.360]   the people were crowding around him
[00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:21.000]   and listening to the word of God.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.800]   He saw at the water's edge two boats
[00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:28.040]   left there by the fishermen who were washing their nets.
[00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:32.000]   He got into one of the boats, the one belonging to Simon.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   Now we know Jesus later changed Simon's name to Peter,
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.200]   and so if you know anything about the Bible
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:39.360]   where you see Simon, this is also Peter.
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:42.320]   And he asked him to put out a little from shore,
[00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:45.480]   then he sat down and he taught the people from the boat.
[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:48.120]   Jesus is there, he's on the shore of the Sea of Galilee,
[00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:49.920]   crowds are coming up, he's teaching,
[00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:51.320]   and crowds are coming up so much
[00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:52.440]   that they're kind of pushing him back
[00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:54.000]   and pushing him back in the water,
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.340]   and he's like, "Okay, I'm about to be in the water,
[00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:56.640]   "okay, there's two boats here."
[00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:58.320]   He just looked, "I'm in a boat."
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:01.180]   And then Simon's like, "Whoa, whoa, that's my boat.
[00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:02.020]   "You're in my boat."
[00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:04.440]   He said, "Yeah, come in with me and let's go out.
[00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:06.500]   "Let's go out, let's push off from the shore,
[00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:08.920]   "and I'm gonna preach."
[00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:11.080]   And so I love that right off the bat,
[00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:14.600]   you see Simon or Peter's occupation
[00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:17.200]   as a tool for the gospel.
[00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:19.400]   Immediately, his livelihood,
[00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:22.040]   now let me just tell you about this boat for a minute, okay?
[00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:25.880]   This would have been a lifetime investment.
[00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:28.840]   Someone in this time could have worked their entire life
[00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:30.800]   to be able to afford one of these boats,
[00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:32.840]   and if you had one, it meant you had a job,
[00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:35.720]   you had an occupation, you had a way to feed your family.
[00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:37.640]   Why? 'Cause there's a sea there, there's water there,
[00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:38.640]   there's fish in that water,
[00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:40.760]   and so you were good to go if you had a boat.
[00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:42.160]   These boats would be passed on
[00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:43.760]   from generation to generation,
[00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:46.520]   but this boat, this particular boat, Peter's boat,
[00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:49.960]   is the single most famous boat in all of history.
[00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:52.800]   Why?
[00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:55.980]   It's most likely that this is the boat
[00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:58.280]   that Jesus went from shore to shore to shore
[00:12:58.280 --> 00:12:59.340]   to do ministry in.
[00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:00.980]   It's most likely that this is the boat
[00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:02.580]   that Jesus and his disciples were in
[00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:05.580]   when Jesus was taking a nap and a storm blows in,
[00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:06.920]   and he calms the storm.
[00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:10.060]   It's most likely that this is the boat
[00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:11.140]   that Peter's in when Jesus says,
[00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:13.760]   "Hey, come out and walk on the water."
[00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:16.360]   That's this boat, most likely.
[00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:24.820]   When he had finished, verse four, speaking,
[00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:26.220]   he said to Simon,
[00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:28.480]   "Put out into deep water
[00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:31.640]   "and let down the nets for a catch."
[00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:34.300]   Simon answered, "Master, we've worked hard all day
[00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:35.960]   "and haven't caught anything.
[00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:40.060]   "But because you say so, I will let down the nets."
[00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:43.380]   He says, "Jesus, I've been up all night working.
[00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:45.400]   "I don't wanna adult today, okay?
[00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:47.880]   "Like, don't make me go back to work today.
[00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:49.940]   "I've already done, you don't understand, Jesus.
[00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:51.720]   "I'm a fisherman by trade.
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:53.160]   "I'm a fisherman for a living.
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:54.620]   "My daddy was a fisherman.
[00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:56.360]   "I come from a long lineage of fishermen.
[00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:58.860]   "I know these seas like the back of my hand,
[00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:01.500]   "and they're not biting today.
[00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:03.060]   "Don't make me do it."
[00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:11.280]   When they had done so, verse six,
[00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:14.260]   they caught such a large number of fish
[00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:15.640]   that their nets began to break,
[00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:19.540]   so they signaled their partners in the other boat
[00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:22.160]   to come and help them, and they came
[00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:26.340]   and filled both boats so full that the boats began to sink.
[00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:29.200]   And so what happens is Peter sees more success
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:32.680]   than he had ever imagined by going out with Jesus,
[00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:35.920]   much more success than any other time in his career
[00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:37.400]   of being out there alone.
[00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:39.320]   They're catching so much fish
[00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:42.280]   that both boats began to sink.
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:45.280]   And verse eight, when Simon Peter saw this,
[00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:46.860]   he fell at Jesus' knees and said,
[00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:49.840]   "Go away from me, Lord, I'm a sinful man."
[00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:55.040]   His immediate reaction to this success is humility.
[00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:57.160]   It's a sober awareness that his success
[00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:59.160]   has come from Christ.
[00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:02.000]   This had nothing to do with his efforts
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.280]   and everything to do with who was with him in the boat.
[00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:08.580]   It had nothing to do with his skills,
[00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:11.520]   nothing to do with how hard he had trained,
[00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:13.840]   nothing to do with his knowledge of the sea,
[00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:16.800]   and everything to do with who was in the boat with him.
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:22.120]   Verse nine, "For he and his companions were astonished
[00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:24.440]   "at the catch of fish they had taken,
[00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:25.900]   "and so were James and John,
[00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:27.740]   "the sons of Zebedee, Simon's partners."
[00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:29.340]   Do you see what happened?
[00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:31.180]   Is this success is now being used
[00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:32.760]   to bring attention to Jesus.
[00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:38.220]   Peter had so much success at his work
[00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:40.180]   that folks are saying, "Hey, who is this man
[00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:42.260]   "that Peter's with?"
[00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.680]   Better said, "Who is this man with Peter?
[00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:47.380]   "We must know this man."
[00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:52.000]   Then Jesus said to Simon, "Don't be afraid.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.400]   "From now on you will fish for people."
[00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:56.220]   So they pulled their boats up on shore,
[00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:58.180]   left everything, and followed him.
[00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:01.460]   Followed him.
[00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:03.060]   I'm gonna make you fishers of men.
[00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:08.460]   His work gave him a platform to reach people.
[00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:11.380]   And it's the same purpose of your work today.
[00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:14.420]   And so the first thing as we answer this question,
[00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:17.420]   what if I'm not passionate about what I do?
[00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:20.420]   The first thing I want you to do is change your perspective.
[00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:22.980]   You need a new perspective on work.
[00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:26.000]   You've been fed a lie from our culture,
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.300]   and it's really important that you leave here tonight
[00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:29.820]   with a new perspective.
[00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:31.300]   This is gonna save you a lot of pain
[00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:33.340]   and a lot of heartache and a lot of despair.
[00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:35.220]   And so I know that you graduated from college,
[00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:37.280]   you thought, "Hey, this is gonna come natural to me,
[00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:38.120]   "but here's the truth.
[00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:39.580]   "Here's how you need to change your perspective.
[00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:41.420]   "Work is hard."
[00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:43.820]   So I know you're on a search for your dream job.
[00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:46.300]   Okay, your dream job probably doesn't exist.
[00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:47.140]   It's probably not real.
[00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:48.860]   It's out there with the one and the unicorn.
[00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:51.380]   And so work is really hard.
[00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:52.220]   It's difficult.
[00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:54.180]   One thing that makes it hard
[00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:56.580]   is that your passions are always changing.
[00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:58.300]   They're constantly changing.
[00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:01.700]   And so Peter was passionate about fishing,
[00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:04.420]   but because he was unsuccessful,
[00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:07.220]   he came to a place where he was despairing.
[00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:09.140]   Okay, because he had hit some walls,
[00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:10.420]   because things were hard,
[00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:11.260]   he came to a place where he's like,
[00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:13.300]   "I don't wanna do this right now.
[00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:14.140]   "Okay, I'm not good.
[00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:16.140]   "I didn't do it well last night.
[00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:17.700]   "I just don't wanna do this."
[00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:20.900]   And so he's discouraged because he had been ineffective.
[00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:22.980]   And so some of you graduate from college,
[00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:25.260]   you're like, "Look at me, I'm adulting all over the place."
[00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:27.500]   And then the world kicks you in the teeth.
[00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:29.260]   And you're like, "Man."
[00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:30.900]   I mean, life is hard, right?
[00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:32.420]   Work comes along and it's like,
[00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:34.380]   "Well, I thought this would be hand in glove easy.
[00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:35.860]   "I thought this would be a natural fit."
[00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:37.440]   And you're like, "What, you're questioning everything.
[00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:40.220]   "Why did I become a teacher again?"
[00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:42.460]   Okay, that's funny to the teachers.
[00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:44.940]   (congregation laughing)
[00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:46.340]   And here's what I want you to know.
[00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:49.500]   We've said this before, it's worth writing down.
[00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:51.260]   Your greatest disappointments in life
[00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:53.060]   come from your expectations.
[00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:56.240]   Isn't this true?
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:57.700]   Your greatest disappointments in life
[00:17:57.700 --> 00:17:59.260]   come from your expectations.
[00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:00.860]   My little girl, Presley, she's eight years old.
[00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:02.420]   She's playing basketball right now.
[00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:03.860]   And they're really, really good.
[00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:05.640]   I didn't say she's really good, but they're really good.
[00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:07.540]   Her team, she's on a really good team.
[00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:09.300]   And they're undefeated, man.
[00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:11.400]   They've been winning every game they show up to play.
[00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:12.240]   They've won.
[00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:14.700]   And this past Saturday,
[00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:17.460]   they played Mark Cuban's daughter's team.
[00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:19.660]   He owns the Mavericks.
[00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:22.980]   (congregation laughing)
[00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:24.280]   And they lost real bad.
[00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:26.620]   And it was interesting at the end of the game,
[00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:28.720]   'cause Presley's not real competitive,
[00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:30.380]   but there's some players on her team
[00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:31.860]   that are real competitive.
[00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:32.720]   And at the end of the game,
[00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:33.740]   they're looking at the scoreboard
[00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:35.220]   and they're just like, "What is this?
[00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:36.780]   "Like, how come our number's less than theirs?
[00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:38.460]   "And what is this wet stuff on my face?
[00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:39.440]   "And what are these emotions?
[00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:41.060]   "And I just don't know what happened."
[00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:44.860]   And we, "We, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we."
[00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:46.460]   Wait, you lost, sweetie?
[00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:47.300]   No, no.
[00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:49.260]   And they're like, their whole world is falling apart.
[00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:50.700]   Why?
[00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:52.420]   Because they expected to win.
[00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:55.000]   And now they're in a place where they're like,
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.180]   "I don't know what to do with this."
[00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:58.820]   And it's cute when you're eight, but when you're 28,
[00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:01.420]   it's like, wait a minute, life,
[00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:03.560]   like, I'm kind of terrible at it.
[00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:04.740]   And I thought I'd be good at it.
[00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:07.620]   And why is every day so hard?
[00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:09.820]   And why do I just wanna stay in bed right now
[00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:13.700]   and not go to work and not do this?
[00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:15.200]   And here's how I can help you.
[00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:17.020]   It's hard.
[00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:21.620]   And it's not broken because it's hard, it's just hard.
[00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:23.460]   You're not doing it wrong because it's hard,
[00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:24.560]   it's just difficult.
[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:28.540]   In some ways, it's actually supposed to be difficult.
[00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:32.180]   I'm gonna show you that from the scripture.
[00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:34.980]   But before I do, let me just say this,
[00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:38.600]   discouragement can rob you of your passion.
[00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:40.900]   Right?
[00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:44.760]   Like you haven't made a sale in a while.
[00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:48.480]   You went from hero to zero, new month, new quota.
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:49.320]   And all of a sudden, you're like,
[00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:51.620]   man, I don't know if I'm passionate about this.
[00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:53.860]   Your students are acting up, and it's not the students,
[00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:55.540]   it's like the parents are even worse than the students.
[00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:57.480]   And why aren't the parents, why are they so involved
[00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:58.660]   in what I'm doing and how I'm teaching?
[00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:01.140]   And it's like, I don't think I'm all that passionate
[00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:02.920]   about this, and your boss is a jerk.
[00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:04.480]   Or maybe it's not that your boss is a jerk,
[00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:05.480]   maybe your team is a jerk.
[00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:07.500]   Maybe you work on a floor full of jerks,
[00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:09.980]   and you're like, I don't like the people that I work with,
[00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:11.820]   and I'm not passionate about this product,
[00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:13.220]   or passionate about this service,
[00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:14.700]   so I just don't wanna do it anymore,
[00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:16.580]   I'm moving to Africa, you know?
[00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:19.280]   (congregation laughing)
[00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:21.140]   And maybe your job is getting in the way
[00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:22.600]   of what you really want to do.
[00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:25.940]   And I want you to change your perspective,
[00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:29.460]   and I want you to understand that work is difficult.
[00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:32.540]   Let me show you from the scripture, Genesis 2, verse 15.
[00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:35.880]   The Lord took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden
[00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:37.160]   to, what's that word?
[00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:39.100]   Work.
[00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:41.300]   He said, man, I want you to work.
[00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:42.340]   I want you to work it.
[00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:43.780]   Now, he's not talking about dancing.
[00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:46.980]   I want you to work it and take care of it, okay?
[00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:48.460]   I want you to work the garden,
[00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:49.700]   I want you to till the soil,
[00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:51.300]   I want you to get your shovel,
[00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:54.200]   and I want you to pile up dirt and plant seeds
[00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:56.620]   and take care of stuff and trim, you know,
[00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:58.380]   plants and all of that fun stuff.
[00:20:58.380 --> 00:20:59.840]   Now, what's interesting about that
[00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:02.560]   is that's Genesis chapter two.
[00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:03.720]   That's before what?
[00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:06.900]   What happens in Genesis chapter three?
[00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:09.920]   The fall happens in Genesis chapter three,
[00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:11.560]   so this is Genesis chapter two.
[00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:13.680]   We're still in perfection.
[00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:16.560]   We're still in the world is perfect as we know it,
[00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:18.520]   everything is right and true,
[00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:21.840]   and God says to man, I want you to work.
[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:23.920]   Do you know we'll work in heaven?
[00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:27.640]   In paradise, with God, we will work.
[00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:29.040]   It's true.
[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:31.080]   You will work the rest of the rest.
[00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:33.560]   True story, but let me show you something
[00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:34.800]   in Genesis chapter three.
[00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:37.040]   To Adam, verse 17, to Adam he said,
[00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:38.720]   because you listened to your wife
[00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:41.200]   and ate from the tree about which I commanded you,
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:42.800]   you must not eat of it.
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:44.500]   Listen to this, this is the result of that,
[00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:46.400]   the result of sin, if you're new to church,
[00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:48.200]   sin enters the world through this decision
[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:49.720]   to not trust God.
[00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:51.700]   Cursed is the ground because of you.
[00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:53.440]   Through painful toil, you will eat of it.
[00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:54.720]   All the days of your life,
[00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:57.000]   it will produce thorns and thistles for you,
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.240]   and you will eat the plants of the field.
[00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:01.900]   By the sweat of your brow, you will eat your food
[00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:03.520]   until you return to the ground
[00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:05.000]   since from it you were taken,
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.780]   for dust you are and to dust you will return.
[00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:08.920]   Now if you don't understand
[00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:10.480]   what all that theological language is,
[00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:11.480]   here's what he says.
[00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:13.120]   Your work's gonna be hard now.
[00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:14.520]   Before I wanted you to work,
[00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:16.500]   now because you sinned, you're gonna work
[00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:17.880]   and it's gonna fight against you.
[00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:19.240]   When your alarm clock goes off,
[00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:20.720]   you're not gonna wanna go in anymore,
[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:22.400]   and your boss is gonna be mean,
[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:24.320]   and your coworkers aren't gonna get along with you,
[00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:26.080]   and there's gonna be conflict there,
[00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:27.900]   and you're gonna have to take the TPS reports
[00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:29.240]   from the client to the customer,
[00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:30.580]   and it's just gonna be messy.
[00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:31.840]   This is what God is saying there.
[00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:34.040]   It's in the Greek, or in the Hebrew, you can't see it,
[00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:35.640]   but this is what he's saying.
[00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:40.340]   He's saying, hey, it's going to fight against you.
[00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:44.360]   Then you're like, oh, that's why my boss is a jerk.
[00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:47.760]   It's because of Adam and Eve, the fall.
[00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:49.520]   It's because of sin.
[00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:52.600]   Yes, it is, and it's a fact.
[00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:55.100]   For the rest of your life, your work is going to fight.
[00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:56.040]   So if you're here and you're like,
[00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:58.120]   but I love my job, give it time.
[00:22:58.120 --> 00:22:59.760]   (congregation laughing)
[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:01.340]   Just wait.
[00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:03.120]   Just wait, I promise, I don't care how,
[00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:04.080]   young adults tell me all the time,
[00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:05.620]   man, I love my job, next month.
[00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:06.600]   Hey, how's your job going?
[00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:08.400]   I quit, man.
[00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:11.280]   Thing is awful, terrible.
[00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:14.800]   And so work, like marriage and relationships require work.
[00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:18.040]   It's hard, but it's supposed to be hard, right?
[00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:20.160]   Post-fall is what I mean by supposed to be.
[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:22.920]   And so if you were supposed to enjoy it,
[00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:25.040]   they wouldn't pay you to be there.
[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:26.720]   Like think about this value exchange.
[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:29.240]   Like if you loved what you do, they would say,
[00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:31.760]   hey, would you do it for free, since you love it so much?
[00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:33.880]   But what they say is, we know you don't like it,
[00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:35.420]   so in exchange for you being here,
[00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:37.320]   we're going to give you a paycheck.
[00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:40.720]   Because if you did like it, that would be a hobby,
[00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:43.800]   not a job, like those are things you do for fun.
[00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:47.080]   Job is work, you do that in exchange for money.
[00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:47.920]   Okay, you see how that works?
[00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:49.720]   I'm glad we're all on the same page.
[00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:52.000]   (congregation laughing)
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.020]   And so if you desire to have a job you love,
[00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:56.620]   that's a great thing, it's just a longing for heaven.
[00:23:56.620 --> 00:23:58.640]   That's a great thing.
[00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:01.080]   If you don't like your work, I just want you to remind,
[00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:03.080]   that to be a reminder to you, you're not home yet,
[00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:04.520]   and one day you're gonna have a job
[00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:06.560]   that you absolutely love for the rest of the rest
[00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:07.400]   of the rest.
[00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:11.020]   But until then, your work's gonna fight against you.
[00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:13.600]   And so the second thing I want you to do,
[00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:16.780]   and this is simple, but maybe the most profound,
[00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:20.180]   I want you to invite God to work with you.
[00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:23.840]   I want you to, and before you're like,
[00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:26.280]   oh my goodness, Sunday School 101,
[00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:29.080]   invite God to work with me, what are you talking about?
[00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:30.740]   I just wanna ask you if you have.
[00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:33.640]   Like how much have you complained about your boss
[00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:34.840]   and your coworkers and what you do,
[00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:37.840]   and the fact that you can't keep a job or whatever that is,
[00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:40.960]   and how much, how often, what quantity of your life
[00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:42.640]   have you spent on your hands and knees saying,
[00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:43.940]   Lord, would you help me?
[00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:46.520]   God, would you come to work with me,
[00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:47.480]   would you direct my steps,
[00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:49.120]   would you give me favor with my boss,
[00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:50.720]   would you give me favor with my coworkers,
[00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:53.280]   would you give me the courage to make you famous there?
[00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:55.680]   I mean, tell me, if you're here and every day
[00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:56.920]   that's the cry of your heart,
[00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:58.400]   every day you're pleading with God that way,
[00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:00.140]   that's awesome, feel free to sleep
[00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:00.980]   for the rest of the night.
[00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:03.780]   If that's not you though,
[00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:07.040]   just know you're in the right place at the right time,
[00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:09.040]   and God has a word for you this evening.
[00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:12.760]   I want you to invite him to work with you.
[00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:17.760]   Every morning I wake up and I'm taking the girls to school,
[00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:20.960]   Presley and Finley, and my three-year-old son,
[00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:22.400]   he's at home, every morning he wakes up
[00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:23.800]   and he's sitting there, he's eating his cereal
[00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:25.440]   at the little breakfast bar,
[00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:28.120]   and he says, Daddy, where you going?
[00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:28.960]   Every morning.
[00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:32.160]   Weston, I'm going to work, buddy.
[00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:33.360]   Daddy, can I go with you?
[00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:35.920]   No, son, every morning.
[00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:38.540]   I told you yesterday no, the day before no,
[00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:40.520]   tomorrow it's gonna be no.
[00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:41.800]   Oh, Daddy, why?
[00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:42.640]   Every morning.
[00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:45.960]   I wanna go to work with you.
[00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:48.480]   And this is what God is saying to you
[00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:50.580]   in a less toddler way.
[00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:53.320]   I wanna go to work with you.
[00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:57.600]   Would you incorporate me into your profession,
[00:25:57.600 --> 00:25:59.640]   into your occupation?
[00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:03.380]   I want to go with you.
[00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:06.060]   And the reality is God answers prayers,
[00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:09.120]   and so many of us have not taken advantage of that.
[00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:10.440]   And so let me just ask you a question.
[00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:11.680]   Who cares more?
[00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:13.600]   Who cares more about how you perform at work?
[00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:17.780]   You, your boss, or God?
[00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:22.280]   And I promise you the answer of that is God.
[00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:24.880]   And so Jesus gets in the boat with Peter,
[00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:26.100]   and Peter listens to him.
[00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:28.600]   Out of an act of faith, he does what Jesus says,
[00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:30.560]   even though he doesn't feel like it,
[00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:34.440]   and the results are better than anyone could have imagined.
[00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:35.800]   And so what I want you to know
[00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:37.860]   is sometimes you are given challenges at work
[00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:39.600]   to show who you really trust.
[00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:41.840]   Sometimes you face challenges at work
[00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:45.000]   so that you can display and demonstrate to the world
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:49.960]   who you worship, who you are, who you trust in.
[00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:51.720]   And so when crisis hits,
[00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:54.200]   do you turn to your savings, to your bank account?
[00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:55.680]   Do you turn to monster.com?
[00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:56.760]   Do you turn to LinkedIn?
[00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:58.800]   Do you turn to your network of people?
[00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:01.280]   Do you turn to coping mechanisms of sin,
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:04.080]   and pornography, and spending, and shopping?
[00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:05.640]   Or do you turn to God and say,
[00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:07.080]   "God, this is really tough.
[00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:08.620]   "I need you to strengthen me.
[00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:10.560]   "I wanna remind myself of your word,
[00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:11.680]   "that your word is true,
[00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:13.740]   "and I wanna navigate these waters
[00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:15.920]   "in a way that makes you famous.
[00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:18.200]   "Will you help me?"
[00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:20.840]   And maybe one of the greatest examples of this is scripture.
[00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:23.980]   I've been hanging out with Peter in Luke chapter five,
[00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:26.320]   but I want you to know this is not unique to Peter.
[00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:28.640]   It's a Genesis to Revelation story.
[00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:30.520]   There are lots of examples in scripture
[00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:34.240]   of people who were faithful in really trying circumstances.
[00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:38.960]   I'll give you one out of Genesis chapter 38,
[00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:41.720]   starting in actually Genesis chapter 37,
[00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:44.420]   where it's Joseph, shows up on the scene.
[00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:47.340]   Now, Joseph is the heir to an estate,
[00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:48.980]   but his brothers are jealous of him,
[00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:53.140]   and so his own family members sell him into slavery.
[00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:56.500]   Now, this is a time in life when you're sold as a slave.
[00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:59.300]   You go from kind of hero to slave.
[00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:01.800]   You're like, "Okay, God, are you really with me?"
[00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:05.900]   But what it says that he does is he goes,
[00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:09.020]   and he ends up working for Potiphar.
[00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:12.960]   And Potiphar's a wealthy man, reports to Pharaoh,
[00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:15.240]   and it says that Joseph is so faithful,
[00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:16.520]   he's not sitting there like, "What?
[00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:18.640]   "I'm a slave, how did this happen?
[00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:20.400]   "I just want to sulk in my pity."
[00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:23.100]   It says he got after it.
[00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:24.160]   It's the message version.
[00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:28.160]   He got after it, and God rewarded his faithfulness,
[00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:30.720]   and Potiphar puts him over his entire estate.
[00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:35.120]   That's until Potiphar's wicked, witchable wife comes
[00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:39.020]   and tries to get Joseph to sleep with her.
[00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:41.660]   Joseph gets arrested, even though he's innocent,
[00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:42.780]   and he goes to prison.
[00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:45.860]   Now you would think, "Okay, slavery, now prison."
[00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:49.740]   All right, God's not with Joseph.
[00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:52.100]   This is where Joseph falls apart, he despairs.
[00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:54.860]   This is where he has the job that he really doesn't like.
[00:28:54.860 --> 00:28:58.100]   But what the Scripture says is he was so faithful in prison
[00:28:58.100 --> 00:29:00.180]   that the warden, the prison warden,
[00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:02.100]   put him over the entire prison.
[00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:06.120]   Joseph is ruler of the entire prison,
[00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:07.640]   even though he's an inmate.
[00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:10.900]   His faithfulness and his gifts and his talents
[00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:13.640]   bring him to a place where he gets to stand before Pharaoh.
[00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:16.680]   He gets out of prison, he goes to work for Pharaoh,
[00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:19.040]   and it says that Joseph was so faithful
[00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:22.480]   that Pharaoh put him over all of Egypt.
[00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:24.700]   Can I tell you something?
[00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:29.040]   God wanted Joseph to be over all of Egypt.
[00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:30.640]   Do you know what he did?
[00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:33.600]   He had him sold into slavery.
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:37.440]   God wanted Joseph to be ruler over all of Egypt,
[00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:38.960]   so do you know what he did?
[00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:42.260]   He had him sent to prison for something he didn't do.
[00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:46.680]   But Joseph never caved under the test.
[00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:48.560]   He continued to be faithful.
[00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:50.680]   And do you know the phrase that is repeated
[00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:55.560]   in Genesis 37, Genesis 39, Genesis 40, and Genesis 41?
[00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:58.200]   In four chapters, Joseph goes from slave
[00:29:58.200 --> 00:29:59.160]   to ruler of Egypt.
[00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:01.040]   And do you know the phrase that is repeated
[00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:03.240]   over and over and over in those four chapters?
[00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:04.440]   It's this right here.
[00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:07.400]   The Lord was with Joseph,
[00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:10.980]   but the Lord was with Joseph.
[00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:14.900]   And tomorrow, when you show up somewhere at 8 a.m.,
[00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:16.120]   the Lord is with you,
[00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:20.640]   and he wants to be invited into your occupation.
[00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:23.360]   He wants to come with you in the boat.
[00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:26.280]   He wants you to push out into the sea,
[00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:29.260]   and he wants to do work with you.
[00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:32.280]   And any success that he gives to you
[00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:35.700]   is so much more about him than it was ever about you.
[00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:37.880]   The worst thing that he could do for you
[00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:40.400]   is make you unbelievably successful,
[00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:43.320]   not attached to him.
[00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:46.000]   That is the worst thing that could happen to you,
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.200]   that he would fill your life with distractions
[00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:51.280]   when you have not attached that success to him,
[00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:54.280]   that you would find yourself in a place isolated
[00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:57.920]   and with a dying faith, moving away from him.
[00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:01.840]   But sometimes what he does is he brings attention
[00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:03.440]   through his servants to himself
[00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:07.780]   so that he might make his name famous through you.
[00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:12.040]   Joseph knew that the success that he was given
[00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:14.240]   had so much more to do with God than him.
[00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:15.960]   This idea will keep you humble
[00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:17.740]   because you understand that it is the Lord
[00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:19.340]   who makes you successful.
[00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:20.480]   Peter's here saying,
[00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:22.560]   "Hey, I didn't catch a bunch of fish because I'm good.
[00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:25.640]   "I caught a bunch of fish because Jesus is with me.
[00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:28.880]   "My boat right now encompasses the creator
[00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:30.080]   "of the heavens and the earth.
[00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:32.340]   "He's in here with me.
[00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:35.520]   "He commands the fish where to go.
[00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:39.160]   "He's God and he's with me."
[00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:42.880]   Peter later wrote in a book in your Bible
[00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:47.880]   called 1 Peter 5-6, he says this to us.
[00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:51.460]   "Humble yourselves therefore under God's mighty hand
[00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:53.520]   "that he may lift you up in due time."
[00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:57.440]   Humble yourself therefore under God's mighty hand
[00:31:57.440 --> 00:31:59.400]   that he might lift you up in due time.
[00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:02.680]   And so if you find yourself in a place
[00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:05.400]   where you're not passionate about what you do,
[00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:08.240]   the third thing I want you to consider
[00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:11.340]   is pursuing a greater passion.
[00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:13.560]   In fact, my third point,
[00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:15.600]   my third instruction for you this evening
[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:18.280]   is to pursue a greater passion.
[00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:21.080]   Now what do I mean by that?
[00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:23.600]   I want you to pursue what God is passionate about.
[00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:26.660]   You're asking yourself the question,
[00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:28.580]   what am I passionate about?
[00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:30.500]   That's the wrong question.
[00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:34.360]   The right question is what is God passionate about?
[00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:38.080]   What does God wanna do in and around me?
[00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:41.120]   And am I being as faithful as I possibly can
[00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:44.360]   to bring about his will in this environment?
[00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:47.160]   What is God passionate about?
[00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:49.160]   See, if you're just thinking about catching fish,
[00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:50.760]   you're thinking too small.
[00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:53.400]   Jesus is about catching people.
[00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:56.320]   If all you think about is a paycheck and a promotion,
[00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:58.480]   you're missing your real purpose.
[00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:01.740]   If all you think about is a paycheck and a promotion,
[00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:03.980]   you're missing your real purpose.
[00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:06.460]   God has a much bigger purpose for you.
[00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:08.640]   And so when you're asking, what am I passionate about?
[00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:11.460]   He's saying, no, would you focus on what I'm passionate about
[00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:13.480]   and if you're here and you're a follower of Christ,
[00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:16.360]   I hope number one on the list, really high on the list,
[00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:19.400]   is I'm passionate about Jesus.
[00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:21.200]   I'm passionate about a man who lived
[00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:23.720]   and lived a perfect life, unprecedented,
[00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:25.940]   and died a perfect death and he did so
[00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:27.520]   because I'm a pervert, he did so
[00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:28.680]   because I've done some terrible things,
[00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:30.520]   he did so because I'm materialistic,
[00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:33.440]   he did that for me, he came back from the grave
[00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:36.060]   and if I've trusted in that, he's given me a promise
[00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:38.320]   of eternal life forever and ever and ever and ever
[00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:42.200]   and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever with him.
[00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:44.320]   And I'm really passionate about that.
[00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:48.640]   I hope that, I mean, I hope that you have a response
[00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:49.960]   in your heart to that, that you say,
[00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:51.820]   I'm passionate about that.
[00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:56.980]   I want the world to know about an amazing God
[00:33:56.980 --> 00:33:59.180]   who offers eternal life forever and ever and ever
[00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:01.900]   and our biggest problems pale in comparison.
[00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:04.140]   One day he's gonna wipe away every tear
[00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:07.020]   and give us a new kingdom to live in.
[00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:08.500]   I'm passionate about that.
[00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:11.200]   Are you passionate about that?
[00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:15.640]   I'm asking, man, are you passionate about that?
[00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:24.420]   Colossians 3 verse 22 says,
[00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:28.160]   and slaves, it's not a racial slavery, okay?
[00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:34.480]   The most modern translation to this would say employees.
[00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:36.320]   Employees obey your earthly masters,
[00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:39.300]   earthly employers in everything and do it
[00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:42.980]   not only when their eye is on you and to curry their favor,
[00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:46.180]   but with sincerity of heart and reverence for the Lord.
[00:34:46.180 --> 00:34:48.100]   Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart
[00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:50.420]   as working for the Lord, not for humans
[00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:53.340]   since you know that you will receive an inheritance
[00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:55.220]   from the Lord as a reward.
[00:34:55.220 --> 00:34:57.260]   It is the Lord Christ you are serving.
[00:34:57.260 --> 00:35:00.540]   He says you're not working for your boss that you hate,
[00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:02.940]   you're working for an amazing boss, a perfect boss,
[00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:06.300]   an incredible boss who has you there in his sovereignty.
[00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:09.540]   He placed you there, literally placed you there,
[00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:11.940]   very strategically put you there.
[00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:15.340]   Acts 17 verse 26 says that he's determined the place
[00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:17.100]   and the time that you live.
[00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:18.580]   You've got to believe this,
[00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:22.140]   that God determined the place and the time
[00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:24.300]   that you live and that you work.
[00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:29.400]   One day I had a job I hated.
[00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:33.140]   I was doing door-to-door sales to businesses.
[00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:38.860]   It was in Dallas, I was at Industrial Boulevard.
[00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:45.380]   It was August, triple digit heat temperature that day.
[00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:50.460]   I had on a wool suit, which let's just all agree was stupid.
[00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:54.620]   And I walked in to a business,
[00:35:54.620 --> 00:35:56.500]   said no soliciting on the door.
[00:35:56.500 --> 00:35:58.020]   Lady behind the counter,
[00:35:58.020 --> 00:36:01.100]   "Ma'am, may I speak with whoever makes decisions
[00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:02.300]   "on your telecommunications?"
[00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:06.860]   She looks at me, Satan encompassed her.
[00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:11.900]   And she said, "Get out."
[00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:13.700]   I said, "Yes, ma'am, I understand, but listen, ma'am."
[00:36:13.700 --> 00:36:16.540]   "Get out, get out, get out."
[00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:18.020]   I'm like, "Okay, I'm out."
[00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:23.020]   And I walked out drenched in sweat.
[00:36:23.020 --> 00:36:25.660]   I'm angry at a lot of things.
[00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:26.740]   I'm angry at the job.
[00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:28.860]   I'm angry at God that has me at the job.
[00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:30.280]   And I'm really angry at that lady.
[00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:31.380]   I want to burn her house down.
[00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:34.140]   And so I'm walking angry.
[00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:37.380]   I didn't say it was a great moment,
[00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:38.620]   but I'm walking angry.
[00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:41.020]   And so I'm walking, I'm working,
[00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:41.980]   and I'm working the concrete.
[00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:44.060]   She's walking, I'm so mad.
[00:36:44.060 --> 00:36:48.460]   And I didn't even see this air conditioning unit
[00:36:48.460 --> 00:36:50.820]   sticking out of a brick wall about six feet high.
[00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:51.980]   I didn't see it.
[00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:54.660]   Walking, just hating life, hating that woman.
[00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:57.500]   Catches me in my temple right here, okay?
[00:36:57.500 --> 00:37:00.640]   Spins me around, fall to my knees,
[00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:03.320]   and I'm staring at the concrete.
[00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:07.180]   That is until a pool of blood fills the concrete
[00:37:07.180 --> 00:37:09.620]   and I begin to stare at my own reflection.
[00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:12.960]   [congregation laughing]
[00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:17.240]   And I'm taking this as confirmation
[00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:19.120]   that this is not where God wants me.
[00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:24.640]   I'm like, God just spoke through an AC unit out of a wall.
[00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:26.720]   He does not want me in this job.
[00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:30.260]   And I'm like not in a good place, okay?
[00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:32.280]   Like I'm not healthy at this moment.
[00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:35.800]   And I look up and across the street,
[00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:38.100]   there's a Burger King.
[00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:40.680]   It's amazing.
[00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:42.320]   I hadn't eaten at a Burger King my entire life.
[00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:44.320]   I'm like, there's the answer to all my problems.
[00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:47.600]   So I walk across to that Burger King
[00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:49.880]   and I walk inside and at this time,
[00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:52.840]   in Burger King's marketing campaign,
[00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:56.880]   they were selling a brownie, a warm brownie.
[00:37:56.880 --> 00:38:01.040]   I go up to the kind gentleman behind the counter
[00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:04.160]   and I said, I would like that with some ice cream on it.
[00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:08.120]   He tried to tell me they didn't put ice cream
[00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:08.960]   on the brownie.
[00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:12.700]   That is until that same demon that was in that woman
[00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:14.820]   possessed me in that moment.
[00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:17.140]   And I let him know there was gonna be ice cream
[00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:18.860]   on that brownie.
[00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:19.900]   I got the brownie.
[00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:22.180]   I sat down at a table for two
[00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:24.760]   and I began to eat my brownie.
[00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:27.820]   And think about how much I hated my job with every bite.
[00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:33.380]   I look up and there is a man sitting at my table.
[00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:35.940]   I am dead serious.
[00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:42.220]   He looks me in the eyes and he said, having a bad day.
[00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:45.560]   (congregation laughing)
[00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:49.520]   I said, sir, you don't even wanna get into it.
[00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:52.440]   Well, I gave it away with a big gash in my forehead
[00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:54.080]   or the way I'm eating the brownie.
[00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:58.240]   He said, what's wrong?
[00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:01.360]   I said, man, I don't know.
[00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:05.640]   He proceeds to begin to share the gospel with me.
[00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:06.640]   I wave him off.
[00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:08.720]   I'm a Christian, Christ follower, believer.
[00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:09.560]   I mean, you wouldn't believe it
[00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:11.200]   by the way I just acted, but I am.
[00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:12.600]   (congregation laughing)
[00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:15.400]   And he says, so what's wrong?
[00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:16.880]   What's up?
[00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:18.280]   I said, man, I just don't know what I'm supposed.
[00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:21.080]   Now I'm talking to this counselor at my table.
[00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:23.920]   I'm like, I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing.
[00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:26.120]   This is completely normal for some reason in this moment.
[00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:27.680]   I'm like, okay, I'll tell you.
[00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:28.960]   You wanna know.
[00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:30.420]   I hate my job.
[00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:32.760]   I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing right now.
[00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:34.560]   God has gone silent on me.
[00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:38.800]   And he goes, do you have any unconfessed sin in your life?
[00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:41.680]   I'm like, did my mom send you here?
[00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:42.520]   Like what?
[00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:45.120]   (congregation laughing)
[00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:46.640]   No, no, I don't.
[00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:48.120]   I'm in a small group.
[00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:48.960]   I'm in community.
[00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:51.800]   We talk, no, I mean, no unconfessed sin in my life.
[00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:54.760]   He goes, oh, I know what you're supposed to be doing.
[00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:55.680]   I go, oh, here we go.
[00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:56.920]   Charismatic guy over here.
[00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:57.960]   He's about to say a word for me.
[00:39:57.960 --> 00:39:59.260]   He's about to prophesy over me
[00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:00.720]   or tell me something amazing.
[00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:02.080]   Okay, what is it, sir?
[00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:04.640]   What is it I'm supposed to be doing?
[00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:07.160]   And he said this.
[00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:10.420]   He said exactly what you're doing.
[00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:15.160]   And didn't like that very much.
[00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:17.920]   You know, I'm like, you can see what just happened, bro.
[00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:22.440]   And he just said, you know, I know a little bit about God
[00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:25.440]   and I know he's in control of where we're at.
[00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:27.880]   And this morning you woke up in this job.
[00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:29.080]   And so I'm quite confident
[00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:31.880]   this is exactly the job God wants you in.
[00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:33.240]   And I'm confident that he wants you
[00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:35.600]   to bring glory to him in this job.
[00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:37.840]   And so I don't know you well enough to know
[00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:39.760]   if there's some things that you can change
[00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:42.900]   about the way you're doing this job to do that better.
[00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:45.200]   But I know that that's his will for your life.
[00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:47.800]   And then he disappeared.
[00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:48.920]   No, he didn't disappear.
[00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:52.260]   [congregation laughing]
[00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:55.820]   And this is, I mean, I've told this story.
[00:40:55.820 --> 00:41:00.180]   This is one of those stories that the Lord just gave me.
[00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:03.040]   I honestly believe in my heart of hearts to pass on to you.
[00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:05.400]   I believe that moment was more about you
[00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:06.580]   than it was me even.
[00:41:06.580 --> 00:41:09.720]   I'll always tell that story,
[00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:11.000]   probably for the rest of my life
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.440]   until the Lord takes me to be with him
[00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:16.960]   because it's just unexplainable how those events happened
[00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:19.080]   that he put this follower of Christ in my path
[00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:21.680]   in just that moment to tell me that message.
[00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:25.040]   And I believe it's a message for you
[00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:28.640]   as much as it is for me, is the Lord put you where you are.
[00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:30.620]   I don't know you well enough to know
[00:41:30.620 --> 00:41:32.680]   if you're living out his purpose there.
[00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:34.640]   I don't know if you can do it better.
[00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:37.760]   You need to be asking those questions.
[00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:38.960]   You need to be asking God,
[00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:41.240]   "Lord, is there someone here you want me to share with?
[00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:43.160]   "Is there a way I can be bolder?
[00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:45.240]   "God, am I leveraging the gifts and the talents
[00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:46.500]   "that you've entrusted to me?
[00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:48.980]   "Father, am I thinking too much about myself
[00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:51.280]   "that is driving me to a place of despair
[00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:53.480]   "so that I'm missing your purpose here?"
[00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:56.640]   Because I believe God is sovereign.
[00:41:56.640 --> 00:41:58.720]   I believe he placed you where you're at.
[00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:00.120]   And I just want you to believe that.
[00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:02.960]   My favorite verse in the scripture is this.
[00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:05.520]   It's Titus, I'm sorry, favorite verse on the topic.
[00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:07.040]   Titus 2, verses nine and 10,
[00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:09.920]   teach slaves, employees, to be subject
[00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:12.600]   to their masters, employers, in everything,
[00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:14.780]   to try to please them, not to talk back to them,
[00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:15.960]   and not to steal from them.
[00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:17.240]   And you're like, "Not to steal from them?
[00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:18.280]   "I don't do that."
[00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:21.320]   That's like, hey, are you looking
[00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:23.240]   at social media on company time?
[00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:25.260]   Are you showing up late?
[00:42:25.260 --> 00:42:26.100]   Are you leaving early?
[00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:27.520]   Are you taking long lunches?
[00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:30.020]   Let's put that in the stealing from them category.
[00:42:30.020 --> 00:42:33.640]   Work hard, don't steal from them.
[00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:39.640]   But to show that they can be fully trusted, that's you,
[00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:42.520]   so that in every way they will make the teaching
[00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:45.100]   about God, our Savior, attractive.
[00:42:45.100 --> 00:42:48.200]   The reason I have you there is so that you can work hard,
[00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:49.560]   so that you can make the teaching
[00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:53.200]   about God, our Savior, attractive.
[00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:54.320]   You see that?
[00:42:56.680 --> 00:42:58.400]   This passage does not condone slavery.
[00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:01.040]   It condones a hard work ethic.
[00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:04.780]   And so stop following your passions in and out of job.
[00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:09.560]   To understand why we work, we must have a biblical worldview
[00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:10.680]   on the reason for work.
[00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:12.560]   There's four reasons you work.
[00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:14.560]   Number one, for provision, so that you can provide
[00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:15.780]   for yourself and for your family.
[00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:17.160]   Number two, to be generous,
[00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:19.360]   so that you can be crazy generous.
[00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:20.320]   The world would look at you and say,
[00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:22.680]   "Why does she give more than she keeps?
[00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:24.000]   "Why is she so generous?
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.060]   "Why is she always willing to help?
[00:43:26.060 --> 00:43:27.880]   "How does he give that much away?"
[00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:30.600]   To be generous, to improve your God-given talents,
[00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:33.440]   that you would stay in a place and develop the talents
[00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:35.040]   that God has entrusted to you,
[00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:36.840]   even when you don't feel like it,
[00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:38.940]   even when you don't wanna do art anymore,
[00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:42.160]   that you would continue to develop those God-given talents.
[00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:44.120]   And then lastly and most importantly,
[00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:48.720]   to minister to others, to make Jesus famous.
[00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:51.080]   And so stop following your passions
[00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:54.360]   and form a greater passion for making Christ famous.
[00:43:55.260 --> 00:43:57.720]   There's no greater cause.
[00:43:57.720 --> 00:44:01.380]   You can give someone a drink and save their day,
[00:44:01.380 --> 00:44:03.260]   or you can share Christ and save their forever.
[00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:05.300]   Give someone a coat and make them warm,
[00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:09.060]   or share Christ and help them be an heir to a kingdom
[00:44:09.060 --> 00:44:10.620]   forever and ever and ever.
[00:44:10.620 --> 00:44:12.180]   There is no greater cause.
[00:44:12.180 --> 00:44:14.440]   And so how important is passion?
[00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:15.280]   I don't know.
[00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:18.520]   Was Jesus passionate about carpentry?
[00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:20.860]   I don't know.
[00:44:20.860 --> 00:44:22.100]   I mean, I don't know if you've thought about this.
[00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:23.940]   Jesus literally had a job.
[00:44:23.940 --> 00:44:25.200]   I mean, there were days of his life,
[00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:28.900]   he'd wake up and he'd hammer nails into wood,
[00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:30.600]   and he would make things with wood.
[00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:32.460]   That's what he would do day in and day out.
[00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:34.300]   That was his occupation.
[00:44:34.300 --> 00:44:37.060]   He was a carpenter 'cause his dad was a carpenter.
[00:44:37.060 --> 00:44:40.120]   Was Paul passionate about making tents?
[00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:42.900]   I don't know if he had a thing for REI or what,
[00:44:42.900 --> 00:44:45.460]   but I think it was just a means to ministry.
[00:44:45.460 --> 00:44:47.180]   Like he's just like, "Hey, I'm gonna make tents
[00:44:47.180 --> 00:44:49.560]   "so that I can do my greater passion,
[00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:51.460]   "which is making Jesus famous."
[00:44:51.460 --> 00:44:53.580]   Was Peter passionate about fishing?
[00:44:53.580 --> 00:44:55.620]   Until he found a greater passion, he was.
[00:44:55.620 --> 00:44:58.820]   But when he found a greater passion,
[00:44:58.820 --> 00:45:01.220]   he became the first leader of our church,
[00:45:01.220 --> 00:45:04.060]   one of the greatest leaders our church has ever known.
[00:45:04.060 --> 00:45:07.180]   And that's what God is calling you today.
[00:45:07.180 --> 00:45:08.940]   He wants to get in your boat, man.
[00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:15.300]   He wants to get in your boat and do work with you.
[00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:21.300]   And so friends, if your vision for your work is too small,
[00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:23.540]   if you can't see past promotions and paychecks,
[00:45:23.540 --> 00:45:28.540]   past 401ks and W2s, God has a bigger vision for your work.
[00:45:28.540 --> 00:45:33.060]   Your work is a vehicle that the gospel moves forward on.
[00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:35.220]   It always has been.
[00:45:35.220 --> 00:45:38.060]   The gospel moves into countries and into new places
[00:45:38.060 --> 00:45:40.340]   and everywhere through our work.
[00:45:40.340 --> 00:45:44.860]   Stop asking Jesus where you should go
[00:45:44.860 --> 00:45:47.100]   and start asking him to go with you.
[00:45:48.380 --> 00:45:50.300]   Stop asking Jesus where should I go
[00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:53.620]   and start asking him to go with you.
[00:45:53.620 --> 00:45:55.620]   See, the thing is, I can't go
[00:45:55.620 --> 00:45:57.660]   where you're gonna be tomorrow.
[00:45:57.660 --> 00:45:59.700]   I can't be behind that Starbucks counter.
[00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:01.220]   I can't be behind the counter of that bank.
[00:46:01.220 --> 00:46:02.940]   I can't be in that public school.
[00:46:02.940 --> 00:46:07.340]   I can't be in that engineering firm
[00:46:07.340 --> 00:46:08.660]   or that oil and gas company.
[00:46:08.660 --> 00:46:11.700]   I can't be back there in that telecom building.
[00:46:11.700 --> 00:46:14.340]   But God has you there.
[00:46:14.340 --> 00:46:16.580]   And so in that moment,
[00:46:16.580 --> 00:46:17.420]   I can't be there.
[00:46:17.420 --> 00:46:20.100]   And so in summary, what do I do
[00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:22.500]   if I'm not passionate about my job?
[00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:24.180]   One, change your perspective.
[00:46:24.180 --> 00:46:26.420]   Two, invite God into what you're doing.
[00:46:26.420 --> 00:46:30.540]   And three, pursue a greater passion in making Christ famous.
[00:46:30.540 --> 00:46:33.020]   Taught this message a lot.
[00:46:33.020 --> 00:46:36.740]   And so rather than give you another illustration
[00:46:36.740 --> 00:46:39.180]   from my own career,
[00:46:39.180 --> 00:46:40.740]   I thought I would tell you about a friend of mine.
[00:46:40.740 --> 00:46:42.540]   This was a porch leader.
[00:46:42.540 --> 00:46:44.420]   We'll call him Adam.
[00:46:44.420 --> 00:46:46.540]   You know, led a team here at the porch.
[00:46:46.540 --> 00:46:47.900]   And Adam hated his job.
[00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:49.660]   And I remember being in his life at this time
[00:46:49.660 --> 00:46:51.620]   and as he just wrestled with his job.
[00:46:51.620 --> 00:46:53.860]   And specifically the reason that he hated his job
[00:46:53.860 --> 00:46:55.340]   is because his boss didn't like him.
[00:46:55.340 --> 00:46:57.340]   And there were some really specific things
[00:46:57.340 --> 00:46:59.860]   that his boss had done to show him
[00:46:59.860 --> 00:47:02.500]   that she was not a fan of his.
[00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:04.020]   And so he was like, "Hey, I'm out.
[00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:05.820]   "I want to look for a new job."
[00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:07.780]   And so he began that search.
[00:47:07.780 --> 00:47:10.020]   And that brought him to a friend's company.
[00:47:10.020 --> 00:47:12.060]   A friend had started with this company,
[00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:14.500]   had hiring responsibilities.
[00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:16.580]   This company was just kind of taken off
[00:47:16.580 --> 00:47:18.340]   and he was making a bunch of money.
[00:47:18.340 --> 00:47:22.860]   And so Adam would make a significant percentage more there.
[00:47:22.860 --> 00:47:23.940]   He'd get to work with a friend.
[00:47:23.940 --> 00:47:24.780]   He'd have more freedom.
[00:47:24.780 --> 00:47:25.860]   He'd work less.
[00:47:25.860 --> 00:47:28.700]   And so he begins to process this decision.
[00:47:28.700 --> 00:47:31.740]   And so his buddy offered him a job.
[00:47:31.740 --> 00:47:34.900]   And so he did what good church goers do.
[00:47:34.900 --> 00:47:36.100]   He met with his community group
[00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:37.300]   and he just said, "Hey, what should I do?"
[00:47:37.300 --> 00:47:38.860]   And they processed the decision.
[00:47:38.860 --> 00:47:39.700]   It didn't take them long.
[00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:41.700]   They said, "No brainer, you should leave.
[00:47:41.700 --> 00:47:42.540]   "It's more money.
[00:47:42.540 --> 00:47:43.460]   "It's more flexibility.
[00:47:43.460 --> 00:47:44.980]   "You're more passionate about it.
[00:47:44.980 --> 00:47:47.300]   "It's getting to work with a buddy.
[00:47:47.300 --> 00:47:49.460]   "This is a no brainer, done deal.
[00:47:49.460 --> 00:47:52.580]   "You should go and do this, except one man."
[00:47:52.580 --> 00:47:57.340]   That one man was the same guy I talked about last week.
[00:47:57.340 --> 00:47:59.220]   I said he was the wisest man I've ever met.
[00:47:59.220 --> 00:48:00.860]   He's an elder here.
[00:48:00.860 --> 00:48:02.820]   And he said this and it blew my mind.
[00:48:02.820 --> 00:48:07.340]   He said, "Whoa, show me where the Bible says
[00:48:07.340 --> 00:48:10.300]   "to take a job because you make more money."
[00:48:10.300 --> 00:48:12.180]   He says, "Hey, can somebody chapter and verse
[00:48:12.180 --> 00:48:14.540]   "where it says, 'Hey, you should take a job
[00:48:14.540 --> 00:48:15.540]   "'with more flexibility.'
[00:48:15.540 --> 00:48:17.200]   "Hey, that you should leave the job
[00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:19.260]   "where God has you for a new job.
[00:48:19.260 --> 00:48:21.420]   "Can somebody help me see that in the scripture?"
[00:48:21.420 --> 00:48:25.360]   Now I'm like, "Whoa, he's gone off the deep end.
[00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:27.000]   "This is simple.
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:28.560]   "We don't need to make this a big deal.
[00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:30.760]   "He has the freedom to look for a new job."
[00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:34.400]   And he goes, "I think he's running from something,
[00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:35.580]   "not to something.
[00:48:35.580 --> 00:48:39.140]   "I don't know that the Lord has opened this door to me.
[00:48:39.140 --> 00:48:41.260]   "It's not clear and I don't know that he's living out
[00:48:41.260 --> 00:48:43.480]   "his purpose at his current job."
[00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:47.300]   Now listen, Adam, to his credit,
[00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:49.700]   in a way that I don't think I would have had
[00:48:49.700 --> 00:48:51.900]   the spiritual maturity to do,
[00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:53.700]   Adam listened and Adam stayed there.
[00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:57.180]   And what's crazy about that
[00:48:57.180 --> 00:49:03.460]   is one day he saw something in his boss
[00:49:03.460 --> 00:49:06.020]   that she was kind of struggling and he went up to her
[00:49:06.020 --> 00:49:07.860]   and he just said, "Would you just please, would you please?
[00:49:07.860 --> 00:49:10.900]   "I don't know if we, we don't seem to be well,
[00:49:10.900 --> 00:49:13.580]   "but would you come to church with me?"
[00:49:13.580 --> 00:49:16.300]   And she said, "I will."
[00:49:16.300 --> 00:49:21.140]   She came to church with him here to this place.
[00:49:21.140 --> 00:49:24.000]   She rededicated her life to Jesus.
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:27.180]   The Holy Spirit comes in and softens her heart.
[00:49:27.180 --> 00:49:30.380]   Now her son begins to struggle with some life decisions.
[00:49:30.380 --> 00:49:33.260]   She doesn't know where to turn to, so she turns to Adam.
[00:49:33.260 --> 00:49:34.160]   Says, "Hey, will you help me?
[00:49:34.160 --> 00:49:37.400]   "We're going through some family challenges."
[00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:41.020]   Adam begins to minister to her family through her,
[00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:43.580]   this lady that he was gonna leave
[00:49:43.580 --> 00:49:45.340]   because she didn't like him.
[00:49:45.340 --> 00:49:47.540]   And God changed the whole situation,
[00:49:47.540 --> 00:49:50.460]   gave him favor there and began to use him as work.
[00:49:50.460 --> 00:49:51.280]   Why?
[00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:52.940]   Because he changed his perspective.
[00:49:52.940 --> 00:49:55.660]   He asked God to come to work with him
[00:49:55.660 --> 00:49:58.180]   and he began to live for a greater passion.
[00:49:58.180 --> 00:49:59.140]   And that's not all.
[00:49:59.140 --> 00:50:04.900]   His buddy's job, it didn't do so well.
[00:50:04.900 --> 00:50:09.200]   It became a chaotic, corrupt environment.
[00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:10.680]   There were lawsuits.
[00:50:10.680 --> 00:50:13.200]   His friend was wrongfully terminated.
[00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:16.120]   It became a very, very toxic environment
[00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:18.440]   and would have been a complete curse had he gone there.
[00:50:18.440 --> 00:50:22.100]   And no one saw that, not anybody,
[00:50:22.100 --> 00:50:23.920]   not a room full of counselors,
[00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:26.140]   but one man armed with God's word said,
[00:50:26.140 --> 00:50:27.440]   "Hey, wait a minute, guys.
[00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:31.740]   "Are we processing this based on passions?
[00:50:31.740 --> 00:50:34.740]   "Are we processing this based on God's purpose for us?"
[00:50:34.740 --> 00:50:38.080]   And that pause made all the difference.
[00:50:38.080 --> 00:50:40.120]   Now, I know you got questions
[00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:41.200]   running around your mind right now.
[00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:42.400]   I know everybody in the room's saying,
[00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:44.760]   "But wait a minute, when can you leave a job?"
[00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:45.840]   [congregation laughing]
[00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:48.200]   Like, are you saying I gotta stay here forever?
[00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:51.080]   You know what?
[00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:53.440]   I don't think God called me into vocational ministry.
[00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:55.720]   And God clearly called me into vocational ministry.
[00:50:55.720 --> 00:50:58.000]   If you know my story, it was very clear.
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:01.520]   I don't think he did until I was already doing ministry.
[00:51:01.520 --> 00:51:03.620]   I think he waited.
[00:51:03.620 --> 00:51:05.960]   I think he waited until I began to see
[00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:09.380]   past my own narcissism, past my own passion,
[00:51:09.380 --> 00:51:11.860]   past my own desires, until I was a place
[00:51:11.860 --> 00:51:13.660]   where God, I'm gonna do your will wherever I'm at,
[00:51:13.660 --> 00:51:15.920]   be it here or be it anywhere.
[00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:18.760]   And then he said, "You're gonna come work for me."
[00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:20.120]   But what he's saying to you tonight
[00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:21.760]   is you're gonna come work for me.
[00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:25.340]   Maybe not at a church, maybe at Starbucks,
[00:51:25.340 --> 00:51:28.740]   but you're gonna come work for him.
[00:51:28.740 --> 00:51:29.580]   Let me pray.
[00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:32.820]   [pastor sighing]
[00:51:32.820 --> 00:51:38.800]   Father, as we seek your desire and your word,
[00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:43.280]   as we wrestle with where we're gonna show up tomorrow,
[00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:46.160]   as we wrestle with the people that you've placed
[00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:47.860]   in our life to minister to,
[00:51:47.860 --> 00:51:51.580]   God, would you give us the confidence that you're with us,
[00:51:51.580 --> 00:51:54.160]   that you're at the desk with us,
[00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:57.360]   that you are using us right where we are
[00:51:57.360 --> 00:51:58.640]   and that you've placed us there.
[00:51:58.640 --> 00:52:02.120]   That's what I'm asking you for, Father.
[00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:03.160]   You don't have to give it to us.
[00:52:03.160 --> 00:52:05.760]   You're God, we're not, but would you please consider
[00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:09.680]   just giving us a piece as we sing this song
[00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:13.680]   that we are exactly where you want us,
[00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:17.260]   just like you told me on that day through your servant.
[00:52:17.260 --> 00:52:21.460]   Would you just affirm in us that we are right
[00:52:21.460 --> 00:52:22.300]   where we need to be?
[00:52:22.300 --> 00:52:25.940]   And Lord, if you would, would you show us why?
[00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:29.560]   Would you help us know why?
[00:52:29.560 --> 00:52:32.520]   Father, thank you.
[00:52:32.520 --> 00:52:36.680]   It's an honor to serve you there, here, and everywhere.
[00:52:36.680 --> 00:52:37.840]   We worship you now.
