1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:17,360
 - I'm about to introduce you to an anomaly.

3
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:22,140
 Really a really weird thing today.

4
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,840
 And here's what I mean by that.

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,300
 Every now and then I read about forefather,

6
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,740
 the fathers of the faith that honestly I walk away from

7
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:32,160
 and I question my salvation.

8
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,880
 When I read quotes like from Martin Luther,

9
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,000
 you know, I have so much to do today,

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,140
 I'll spend the first four hours in prayer.

11
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,820
 I'm just like, am I really a believer?

12
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,200
 Like what is wrong with me?

13
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,100
 And so there are folks, there are few folks alive,

14
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,740
 honestly, very few human beings breathing today

15
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:49,880
 who delight in the word of God,

16
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,600
 like the person I'm about to introduce you to.

17
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,160
 The guy who is responsible,

18
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,060
 the guy who God used to bring me into relationship with him

19
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:58,900
 would tell you, and I agree with him,

20
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:03,660
 that Tommy Nelson is the best Bible teacher alive.

21
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:06,680
 One of the best Bible teachers ever to live.

22
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:10,020
 And so it is with great joy, it is a true delight

23
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,060
 that we get to sit at his teaching today

24
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,860
 and really share a Metroplex with him.

25
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:18,660
 And so would you guys please welcome with me Tommy Nelson.

26
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:21,820
 (audience applauding)

27
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:24,860
 - An anomaly.

28
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:29,820
 An anomaly, I've never been an anomaly.

29
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:34,260
 I'd like you to look at Hosea in chapter 12,

30
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,380
 and I know what you're thinking,

31
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:38,020
 I'm so tired of listening to teaching on Hosea.

32
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:43,020
 But it's there in the clean part of your Bible back there

33
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:46,500
 where you don't have a lot of notes.

34
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,260
 It is a delight to be here with you.

35
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:53,820
 You know, I saw a watermark when it was a gleam

36
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:57,900
 in Todd and Kirk McJunkin and Scott Polk

37
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:01,060
 and a bunch of those guys, just a gleam in their eye

38
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:04,800
 back about, oh gosh, 25 years ago.

39
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,460
 So this is a joy to come here.

40
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,640
 And you know, it's always tough

41
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,940
 when you take a group like yourself

42
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:14,180
 and you say, you know, I've got 35, maybe 40 minutes.

43
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:17,420
 What can I do that for the rest of their life

44
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:20,900
 will be something that will impact them from the scripture

45
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,140
 that will carry them to the end?

46
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:26,740
 And I know that I've got something.

47
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:29,120
 I hope that you'll receive it as such.

48
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,340
 But Hosea chapter 12, let me just give you a little,

49
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:37,380
 so you can hit this on the run.

50
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:42,260
 The writing, W-R-I-T-I-N-G,

51
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,460
 the writing prophets of the Old Testament

52
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:48,260
 are the guys that come

53
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:51,800
 toward the end of the Old Testament narrative

54
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,720
 whenever the nation of Israel

55
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,460
 is about to get sent into exile.

56
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,780
 That from Solomon

57
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:04,940
 and about 900 BC all the way till about 700 BC,

58
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:08,580
 about 200 years, the Northern kingdom of Israel

59
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:12,260
 and the Southern kingdom lived in sin, went after idols.

60
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:15,700
 And they were just a step away from going into exile

61
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:20,100
 into Assyria in the North and Babylon in the South.

62
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,400
 You're with me so far.

63
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,400
 And God raised up like Elijah and Elisha,

64
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,000
 the preaching prophets to call them back.

65
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 And they didn't.

66
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,320
 He raised up a fellow named Jehu

67
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:40,200
 and he destroyed all of the Northern house.

68
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,560
 He was the terminator.

69
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,720
 He destroyed down among the Southern kings.

70
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,120
 Did he just wipe them out and it didn't turn them back.

71
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,720
 And his descendants, those kings fell into idolatry.

72
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,800
 And then God raised up the Syrians,

73
00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:00,240
 a fellow named Hazael to come and torment the North.

74
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,700
 And that didn't turn them back.

75
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:07,240
 And so when God had been so patient, so loving kind,

76
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:11,080
 and now in about the seventh century BC,

77
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:15,420
 after 200 years from the end of Solomon's reign

78
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,720
 where he fell into idolatry,

79
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,520
 all the way through these kings,

80
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,800
 you've got 20 Northern kings and 20 Southern kings.

81
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,560
 All 20 Northern kings are idolaters.

82
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,480
 All but just about six, seven Southern kings are idolaters.

83
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:33,200
 That this was a nation that was in the land of Canaan

84
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,680
 and it flourished.

85
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,760
 And yet they turned their backs on the God

86
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,440
 that had brought them there.

87
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,240
 And so as the last line of defense,

88
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,380
 God raised up not the preaching prophets,

89
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,880
 but the writing prophets.

90
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,800
 And they're called the Amis.

91
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,620
 Up in the North, you have Amos, Hosea, A-H.

92
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:53,720
 Down in the South, Micah, Isaiah, Ah-mi, A-H-M-I.

93
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,360
 They came at the same time.

94
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,120
 Amos and Hosea in the North said,

95
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,280
 "Repent, Micah and Isaiah in the South."

96
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,200
 They didn't take the pleading up in the North.

97
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,260
 And in 722, the Assyrians are gonna wipe

98
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:07,080
 the generation that heard Hosea.

99
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,640
 They're gonna wipe them off the map.

100
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,440
 The Southern kingdom, they listened to Micah and Isaiah.

101
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,900
 They refused them.

102
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,920
 And then God raised up a guy named Joel,

103
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,760
 a guy named Zephaniah, a guy named Jeremiah,

104
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,280
 a guy named Habakkuk.

105
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,640
 And they didn't listen.

106
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,780
 And the Southern kingdom went into exile.

107
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:28,480
 And so these, I say that because these prophets,

108
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:33,480
 they're like, y'all know what the term a Dutch uncle means?

109
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,760
 When somebody talks to you like a Dutch uncle,

110
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,860
 it means they get real, not East and West,

111
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,420
 they get North and South.

112
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:41,240
 And they tell you what you're doing, what you need to do,

113
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,300
 and what's gonna happen if you don't.

114
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:46,920
 The prophets were Dutch uncles.

115
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,960
 You don't have to worry about interpretation.

116
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,580
 It's real straight.

117
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,860
 You don't have to take historical narrative

118
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,360
 and try to figure out what it means.

119
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:58,580
 You don't have to take pictures of the Old Testament worship

120
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:03,340
 and take the heavenly substance of which that is the shadow.

121
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:07,140
 No, it's just a straight port into your heart.

122
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:09,700
 And God speaks real straight.

123
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:14,300
 And that is what Hosea, Amos were to the North.

124
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:18,480
 And so this is the last word God gives

125
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,780
 before we will, and I quote,

126
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:24,460
 "Dash your children against the rocks."

127
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:29,460
 And so there's not a lot of East-West negotiation.

128
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,720
 God speaks straight.

129
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,720
 Chapter 12 of Hosea.

130
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,660
 Are you with me so far?

131
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:36,580
 Okay.

132
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:41,300
 In chapter 12, he begins, like a lot of chapters,

133
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,940
 with what you're doing that is stupid.

134
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,620
 Okay.

135
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:48,580
 And he just says, in chapter 12, verse one,

136
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:51,760
 God through Hosea says, "Ephraim,"

137
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,460
 that is a short term for the Northern Kingdom,

138
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,860
 "the largest of the tribes of the North

139
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:01,860
 "was the tribe of Ephraim, Joseph's blessed son.

140
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:07,280
 "Ephraim," and the Hebrew says that he shepherds the wind.

141
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,120
 Some of you have Bibles that say,

142
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,400
 "Ephraim feeds on the wind."

143
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,440
 The term feed and the term shepherd

144
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,560
 are really the same term.

145
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,720
 And so if you have a Ryrie study Bible,

146
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,520
 it will say, "Feed also shepherds the wind."

147
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,640
 I think the best translation

148
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:27,080
 is that Ephraim shepherds the wind.

149
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,960
 To shepherd something, we would take the term tinned,

150
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,440
 shepherd my sheep, tin my sheep.

151
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,700
 When you say tin the business,

152
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:39,120
 it means that you're very focused on that business

153
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,380
 and making it work.

154
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,840
 You're gonna take care of responsibilities.

155
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,960
 To shepherd something means that you're committed to it,

156
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,400
 like a shepherd, to raise it, protect it,

157
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,700
 nurture it, bring it to maturity.

158
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:55,420
 God says of Israel that they shepherd the wind.

159
00:07:55,420 --> 00:08:00,320
 They are committed to something that is non-substantial.

160
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,880
 Something that is non-substantive,

161
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:08,560
 that is ephemeral, that's worldly,

162
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,220
 that is human, that comes and goes.

163
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:18,600
 Ephraim shepherds or labors at

164
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:22,480
 or is committed to the wind, nothing.

165
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:26,360
 And he says he pursues the east wind.

166
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:29,760
 In Israel, whenever you had wind come off the desert,

167
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,580
 it's a blast of hot air.

168
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:37,580
 God says you guys are committed to hot air

169
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:40,360
 of what has no substance.

170
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:45,740
 And specifically, he's talking in verse one about politics.

171
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:46,700
 Let me explain.

172
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:51,800
 He multiplies lies and violence.

173
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,720
 And here's what he means.

174
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,200
 He makes a covenant with Assyria

175
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,100
 and oil is carried to Egypt.

176
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:05,100
 Israel was always to find peace and security

177
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:09,420
 by being obedient to God.

178
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:12,300
 God would always take care of them.

179
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:15,940
 If they weren't obedient to God, they would get afraid.

180
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:18,260
 They would get afraid of what was above them,

181
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:21,020
 Assyria and the land of Babylon,

182
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:23,760
 and what was below them in the land of Egypt.

183
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,140
 Now on the Mediterranean,

184
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,900
 it's location, location, location.

185
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,340
 And the best place to have a nation

186
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,180
 is right there on the Mediterranean border,

187
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,560
 on the Mediterranean Sea.

188
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,580
 That's where Israel was stationed.

189
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:36,960
 Assyria wanted their property, Egypt wanted their property.

190
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,860
 How could Israel defend themselves?

191
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,740
 Being obedient to God.

192
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,220
 And you never had to worry.

193
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,700
 But if they weren't obedient to God,

194
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,660
 they were always having to keep a balance of power.

195
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:49,060
 They were always having to placate Assyria

196
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:51,740
 and make treaties with Egypt.

197
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:55,260
 And so without their being obedient to God,

198
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:59,820
 they were shepherding, hoping in, trusting in

199
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,620
 their ability at foreign relationships.

200
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:06,780
 And they were acting in lies and in violence.

201
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:09,740
 They would, and I quote, "Make a covenant with Assyria,

202
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,340
 "and then they would break it,

203
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,380
 "and they would carry oil into Egypt."

204
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,300
 As a matter of fact,

205
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,680
 whenever the Northern kingdom went into captivity,

206
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,140
 it's because the Northern king named Hoshea

207
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,060
 made a covenant with Assyria,

208
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,460
 and then broke it and went down to Egypt,

209
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,240
 and Assyria came to and destroyed them.

210
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,260
 In 722 BC.

211
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:31,760
 And so the blast of hot air is your trusting

212
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:36,220
 in the pagan world to give you meaning and happiness

213
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,920
 and significance and security.

214
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,520
 Can that still be true in the New Testament life?

215
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:45,020
 When you are conformed to this world.

216
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:49,620
 I asked one of the girls on my staff,

217
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:52,260
 and she, when I did Metro back years ago,

218
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:55,060
 back in the 90s, we had, it was over at Prestonwood,

219
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:58,380
 we had about two, 3000 singles that would come.

220
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,900
 And I asked her, I said,

221
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,660
 "You were a single in the Dallas community.

222
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:07,660
 "What was a Dallas single man like back there then?"

223
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:11,620
 This is back when single men were sinners in Dallas.

224
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:14,120
 All right.

225
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,360
 And she said, "The single men,

226
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,820
 "a lot of them at Metro were great men,

227
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:21,420
 "but a lot of them, if they weren't focused on God,

228
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:24,800
 "they were always waiting for their ship to come in.

229
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,640
 "They were always working the world

230
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,140
 "and working the finances,

231
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:30,560
 "and they were always just looking around the corner

232
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,340
 "for something to happen.

233
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:34,140
 "They were shepherding the wind.

234
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,980
 "All of their hopes were in the world."

235
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,260
 I said, "What were the girls like?"

236
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,660
 "They were looking for a guy

237
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:39,980
 "whose ship was gonna come in."

238
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:40,820
 All right.

239
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,260
 "They were gonna, we were," she said,

240
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,500
 and he's talking about herself.

241
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,260
 She said, "If a girl is not focused on God,

242
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:49,460
 "a lot of times she's looking for that white knight

243
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:53,280
 "to come and spirit her away to a castle in the hills,

244
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,700
 "and everything's gonna be great.

245
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:57,140
 "The guy's looking for this big business deal,

246
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:00,000
 "this big promotion, this big stock sale,

247
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,300
 "this big something or other that he's nursing,

248
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,580
 "and that girl's looking at him,

249
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:10,580
 "and all of their hopes are on very non-substantial things.

250
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:14,440
 "And so they, just like Israel,

251
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,100
 "you are shepherding the wind.

252
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:21,280
 "All of your hopes, your values, your priorities,

253
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:24,740
 "your time, your money, your energies, your thoughts

254
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,940
 "are in the things of this world,

255
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:31,940
 "on how men, humans, will fulfill your dreams.

256
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:34,500
 "Can that ever be a problem?

257
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:38,680
 "Looking to humans to make my life."

258
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:43,680
 Well, in verse two, he says, "Men are not your problem."

259
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:49,100
 In verse two, who does Israel have a problem with?

260
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,600
 Verse two, the Lord has a dispute with Judah.

261
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,180
 Literally, the Lord also.

262
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:01,220
 Your problem isn't Egypt, and it's not Assyria.

263
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:03,720
 It's not politics, it's not the economy.

264
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,940
 Your problem's not the military.

265
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:09,060
 Your problem, Judah, is me.

266
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:13,580
 I made a covenant with you at Sinai,

267
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:16,340
 that if you would have no other gods,

268
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,940
 make no image in the form of God,

269
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,040
 honor my name and me as creator,

270
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,340
 and remember the Sabbath,

271
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:24,180
 that if you would honor your father and mother,

272
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:26,780
 if you would not go after your brother's wife,

273
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:29,740
 or his life, or his money and possessions,

274
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:32,300
 or his reputation, if you would not covet

275
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:35,460
 the things of the world, and apologize often when you did,

276
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:38,580
 that I would bless you and your agriculture and your city,

277
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,780
 and the nations would be no fear to you.

278
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,540
 That was my promise.

279
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:45,100
 Y'all seen the movie, "The Ten Commandments"?

280
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,900
 That's what happens at Sinai.

281
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,700
 God says, "I swear to you, you honor me,

282
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,020
 "and I'll take care of you."

283
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:54,180
 But if you don't, if you go after other gods,

284
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:56,980
 you have breached the contract,

285
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,900
 the Old Testament covenant.

286
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:02,800
 And now, ultimately, I'm gonna turn off the spigot

287
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,140
 on the rains, I'm not gonna let your crops come up.

288
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:08,660
 If they do, the mildew's gonna eat 'em,

289
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,260
 the locust is gonna eat 'em,

290
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:12,300
 and then the bad guys are gonna come in

291
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,480
 and take you off my land, and they're gonna haul you off.

292
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:19,980
 And so God says, "Your problem is not Assyria,

293
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,380
 "and it's not Egypt.

294
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,980
 "Your problem is me.

295
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:26,800
 "You're alien to me.

296
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,700
 "You shepherd the wind, but you're not my sheep."

297
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:33,880
 In verse two, "And as a result,

298
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:37,660
 "he will punish Jacob according to his ways,

299
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:41,020
 "and repay him according to his deeds.

300
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:46,020
 "God said he would, and God will be faithful to his word."

301
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:51,860
 In verse three, he states that the nation,

302
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:56,740
 in contrast to verse one, instead of looking to the world,

303
00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:01,620
 he says, "I wish you would go back to your old way of life.

304
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:04,020
 "I wish you would go back to a day

305
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:06,420
 "when you were faithful to me."

306
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:10,020
 And he says in verse three, "In the womb,"

307
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:14,760
 speaking of Jacob, "he took his brother by the heel,

308
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:18,680
 "and in his maturity, he contended with God.

309
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,480
 "He wrestled with the angel, and he prevailed.

310
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,380
 "He wept, and he sought his favor.

311
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:27,540
 "And Jacob found him at Bethel.

312
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:32,260
 "And there he spoke with us, even Yahweh, the Lord of hosts."

313
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:34,060
 Yahweh is his name.

314
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,320
 Return to your God.

315
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,560
 Observe justice and kindness, and wait for him continually.

316
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,800
 Well, let me tell you what this means about Jacob.

317
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,260
 When he says, "I wish you would go back

318
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,440
 "to the way of your forefather,"

319
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,340
 there's Abraham, there's Isaac, there's Jacob.

320
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:57,700
 Jacob has 12 sons, they form the 12 tribes.

321
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:01,660
 Jacob, in the book of Genesis, is given chapter 25

322
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:06,220
 through chapter, really, about chapter 49.

323
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:09,380
 He gets an enormous amount of material.

324
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:13,620
 He is Israel's root, their trunk, their forefather.

325
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,980
 He's the George Washington,

326
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:18,760
 the Abraham Lincoln of the nation.

327
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,500
 Well, he looks at the beginning of his life.

328
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,660
 He took his brother by the heel,

329
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:27,140
 and at the end of his life, he contended with God,

330
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,620
 and he prevailed.

331
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,900
 He looks at the whole of Jacob's life.

332
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:34,500
 Now, let me just tell you, lay this on you.

333
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,900
 What do you know about Jacob?

334
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,740
 Just stay with me here.

335
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:42,660
 Jacob was a guy that is named Ya'aqob,

336
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,900
 because he is the heel catcher.

337
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:47,320
 The brother Esau is born first.

338
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,300
 Jacob hangs on to his heel,

339
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,060
 and he's named the heel catcher.

340
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:54,980
 He's the guy that is going to take his brother's place.

341
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,900
 The brother is the firstborn.

342
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,500
 Jacob is the secondborn.

343
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,160
 Esau, Jacob.

344
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:06,160
 But Jacob is one that is desperately going to long

345
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,380
 to be the chosen child

346
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:11,700
 to whom the promises of Abraham will come due,

347
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:14,080
 the great spiritual blessings,

348
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:19,080
 and he desperately wants the blessing of God.

349
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:22,620
 And so God, when he is born, says,

350
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:26,500
 "Jacob I loved," the secondborn,

351
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,740
 "Esau I hated."

352
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:31,060
 That's a term that means to pass over,

353
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:33,620
 not to put my blessing upon.

354
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:36,020
 Of these two little sinners,

355
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:39,380
 I will not put the Abrahamic and the Isaiah

356
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:42,620
 or Isaac-like blessing on Esau.

357
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:45,980
 I'm gonna put him on the secondborn, on Jacob.

358
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:48,460
 He will be a Ya'aqob.

359
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:51,860
 He will be the one that will replace his brother

360
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,560
 and get the blessing.

361
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:56,980
 Now, what Isaac was supposed to do

362
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:59,740
 was to enact that with his sons.

363
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:04,740
 He was to say, "Esau, the blessing has come to Jacob."

364
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:08,860
 You may remember that Abraham had Isaac

365
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:11,020
 and what's the other son?

366
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,420
 Ishmael.

367
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:16,200
 He sends Ishmael away outside of the land

368
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,640
 and gives him gifts,

369
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,820
 but he puts his blessing on Isaac.

370
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:22,060
 He is obedient to God.

371
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:25,060
 Isaac should take Esau

372
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:29,460
 and send Esau outside the land to know God's blessing.

373
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:33,880
 And Jacob, the promises of the land of Canaan

374
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,900
 are going to be to you.

375
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:39,060
 The promises to you that God will make a great nation

376
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,940
 are gonna be from you.

377
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:43,300
 The promises that in your seed,

378
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,220
 the nations will be blessed,

379
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:48,340
 that of Messiah are going to come through you.

380
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:53,340
 But Isaac didn't do it because he liked Esau

381
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,700
 because Esau was a good chef.

382
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,340
 He was a good cook.

383
00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:00,980
 And so Isaac was led by his nose

384
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,700
 instead of by the word of God.

385
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:06,680
 He was led by his flesh instead of by the word of God.

386
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,760
 Can that ever happen to us?

387
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:12,460
 That instead of following God, we go after our flesh.

388
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:15,520
 And so he put his blessing on Esau.

389
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,120
 And it made Jacob,

390
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:21,520
 a lot of times your father can put you in a place

391
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,680
 that you feel like you're having to go around him.

392
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,560
 What Jacob should have done was to say,

393
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,640
 "God, you made a promise.

394
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,020
 "Jacob, I have loved.

395
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:32,120
 "Therefore there is no way that promise can't take place."

396
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,160
 I'm gonna trust you.

397
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,160
 If you know your Old Testament,

398
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:41,760
 did Jacob initially trust God?

399
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,920
 He did not.

400
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,460
 First he used usury.

401
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:49,160
 Esau was hungry, came to Jacob.

402
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,600
 Can I have a little bit of that stew?

403
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,840
 In Israel, you never charge interest

404
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,440
 for what a need is.

405
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,720
 You give freely.

406
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,040
 He said to his brother,

407
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,600
 "I'll give you a pot of stew,

408
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,520
 "but it's gonna cost you interest."

409
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,680
 What's the interest?

410
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,560
 Your life.

411
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:06,720
 I'd like your birthright.

412
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,880
 I'd like the blessing.

413
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,560
 He tried to go around the promise of God

414
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,360
 and get it by usury.

415
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,180
 And his brother said,

416
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,840
 "If I die, what use is my birthright?"

417
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,920
 Sure, take it.

418
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,760
 You know what?

419
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,320
 He reneged though.

420
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,120
 And so later on in his life,

421
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,740
 Isaac, his father calls in Esau,

422
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:30,080
 "Let me put my blessing on you before I die."

423
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,400
 Did God say that the blessing would come to Jacob?

424
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,240
 Say yes.

425
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:39,640
 So why does he wanna put it on Esau?

426
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,480
 The father is disobedient

427
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:45,640
 and disobedient fathers can drive their sons

428
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,160
 to do crazy things.

429
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,600
 And so Jacob says,

430
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,080
 "Well, I better do what I gotta do to get the blessing."

431
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,320
 And so he and mama conspired.

432
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:59,080
 Mama says, "I'm gonna fix you up some food

433
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,120
 "like Esau would.

434
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,260
 "We'll feed it to your daddy.

435
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,760
 "He'll think that you're Esau,

436
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,380
 "the blessing will come to him.

437
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,000
 "First we use usury,

438
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,680
 "now we'll use deceit to get the blessing of God."

439
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,760
 In other words, I want the blessing of God, Jacob says,

440
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:15,000
 but I don't wanna trust God.

441
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,400
 I'm gonna use usury and deceit.

442
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,120
 And he says, "But Esau's a hairy man.

443
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,040
 "I'm a smooth man."

444
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,440
 They killed a kid, a little lamb,

445
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,040
 not a little bitty guy, all right?

446
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:28,480
 They killed a little lamb

447
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,040
 and they put it on his arm and he'll feel the hair.

448
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,000
 He'll put his clothes on,

449
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,160
 he'll smell like a guy been working in the field.

450
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,920
 And so tell me if this is not preaching material,

451
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,600
 the child of God to get the blessing of God

452
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,600
 is gonna imitate the world.

453
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,640
 He's gonna look like Jacob,

454
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,140
 feel like Jacob, smell like Jacob.

455
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:52,400
 The daddy says, "You know, it feels like Esau,

456
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,080
 "but it smells like Esau,

457
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,680
 "but it sounds like Jacob."

458
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:01,020
 "I know you're Jacob,

459
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,740
 "but dern if I can recognize you,

460
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:08,740
 "you sure look like a pagan looking for God's blessing."

461
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:11,800
 And he put his blessing on Jacob.

462
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:16,240
 So did Jacob through deceit get the blessing?

463
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,360
 Say yes.

464
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,160
 Yes, atta boy, Jacob.

465
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,680
 So now the blessing will be his.

466
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,480
 Remember what Esau said he's gonna do?

467
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,520
 He said, "I'm gonna kill you,

468
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,060
 "which is always a bad deal.

469
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,760
 "I am gonna kill you."

470
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:32,360
 And so the guy that had feathered his nest had to run away.

471
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:36,540
 He went all the way to Abraham's hometown, back to Haran.

472
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:38,800
 And on the way there,

473
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,960
 he laid down in an open field near the city of Ai,

474
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,800
 and he put a rock under his head.

475
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,680
 That's when you're uncomfortable.

476
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:48,420
 And he just said, "God, I've been kicked out of my house.

477
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:51,380
 "My big brother back here is wanting to kill me.

478
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:56,380
 "I thought I was gonna feather my nest, but it messed up."

479
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:01,300
 He that sows to the flesh shall from the flesh

480
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:04,520
 reap corruption.

481
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:09,060
 And so he laid down and he had a vision.

482
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:11,660
 And there was a ladder from heaven to earth,

483
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:13,980
 the angels of God coming and going.

484
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:16,020
 And he said, "God, you're here with me."

485
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:18,880
 And God stood at the top of the ladder and he said,

486
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,420
 "I'm gonna give your people the land.

487
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:23,900
 "I'm gonna give your people a great nation.

488
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:26,180
 "And from you will the nations be blessed.

489
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:28,860
 "I'm gonna put my blessing on you.

490
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:31,920
 "You're not gonna have to trust in usury or deception.

491
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,500
 "My blessing is upon you."

492
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:36,500
 He rises up and he takes that rock he slept on,

493
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:40,020
 he put it down, pulls oil on it like angels coming down.

494
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,860
 And he says, "God, if you'll take me there,

495
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:44,300
 "give me a wife, give me a family, give me a heritage,

496
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:48,040
 "give me a nest egg, when I come back, you'll be my God."

497
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,380
 He made a deal with God.

498
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:51,920
 He goes away.

499
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,180
 Are you with me so far?

500
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:58,840
 You're always watching Isaac shepherd the wind.

501
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,240
 He's trying his best to get God's blessing.

502
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:06,240
 He goes away to Haran and he meets a relative named Laban

503
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,220
 that has a PhD in deceit.

504
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:13,140
 He's a pro in deceit.

505
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:16,120
 And he takes Jacob.

506
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,240
 "Jacob, you just live with me, you're a relative."

507
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,180
 "Why, thank you."

508
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:20,960
 "Should you serve me for nothing?

509
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,920
 "Name your price and I'll give it."

510
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,000
 Because as soon as he names a price,

511
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,840
 he's no longer a relative, he's a worker.

512
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,580
 "I've got you now, name your price."

513
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:33,360
 Jacob's on to him, these two wheeler dealers.

514
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,380
 He says, "Yeah, here's the price.

515
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:38,200
 "I want your younger daughter for my wife."

516
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,760
 Boop.

517
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,440
 The father says, "Well, I'll see you won."

518
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,280
 Boop.

519
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,400
 "'Cause I'd just as well give her to you as anybody else."

520
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,680
 He doesn't say, "Yes, you can have her."

521
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,800
 He just said, "I'd rather give them to you

522
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,840
 "than anybody else."

523
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:51,380
 "Work for me seven years."

524
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,960
 "Will do."

525
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,840
 He's got this great looking woman, Rachel,

526
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,240
 just waiting for him.

527
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:00,240
 And Jacob's thinking, "I was a little bit."

528
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,400
 He said, "Name your wage, I named the daughter."

529
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,400
 "Ha, I beat him, I trumped him."

530
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,640
 He worked for seven years.

531
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,160
 It came for the honeymoon.

532
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:15,920
 Laban served him up a couple of Mad Dog 2020s.

533
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,760
 All right, son.

534
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,400
 (congregation laughing)

535
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,100
 (Jacob babbling)

536
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,720
 He went in for the honeymoon.

537
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,200
 They turned the lights out, he can't see nothing.

538
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,220
 He's feeling around and he's thinking,

539
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,860
 "Hot dang, it's Rachel."

540
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,400
 Well, it wasn't Rachel.

541
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,480
 Because Laban had an older daughter,

542
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:36,240
 he couldn't push off on nobody.

543
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,260
 I'm sorry, but that's the case.

544
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:44,720
 And so he grabbed Rachel and he grabbed Leah

545
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,140
 and he ran her in there and he said,

546
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:49,620
 "You go act like your sister."

547
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:53,960
 And she went in there and he made love to the wrong woman.

548
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,280
 Always a problem on your honeymoon.

549
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:59,620
 (congregation laughing)

550
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:03,760
 Turn on the lights.

551
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:07,100
 (congregation laughing)

552
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:16,880
 Well, I love it.

553
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,800
 Now, he wakes up in the morning

554
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,880
 and it's one of the great verses in the Bible.

555
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,040
 And the morning light came and behold, it was Leah.

556
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:28,260
 (congregation laughing)

557
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:32,000
 One commentator said, "Whenever we forget God

558
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,220
 "and try to get his blessings ourselves,

559
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:39,640
 "we think we've done it until the morning light.

560
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:43,280
 "And then behold, it's Leah."

561
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,740
 (Jacob screaming)

562
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:45,580
 Okay.

563
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:51,160
 And dig this, he comes to Laban and he said,

564
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,060
 "Hey, I made a deal for the second born,

565
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:55,100
 "you gave me the first born."

566
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,900
 And he says, "It's not our custom

567
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:59,140
 "to marry off the second before the first."

568
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:03,220
 When else did somebody swap children

569
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:05,460
 and in an absence of light,

570
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:09,540
 have the second born feel like the first born?

571
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:12,740
 That's what Jacob did to his daddy.

572
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:15,660
 And now God did it to him.

573
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:17,420
 And he says to him in so many words,

574
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:20,620
 "Now, how do you like deceit, Jacob?"

575
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:22,720
 "I don't like it so good."

576
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,780
 "No, neither did your daddy."

577
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:28,160
 So we force fed him.

578
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,900
 And he says, and the daddy says,

579
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:32,960
 "Hey, what, work for another 14 years

580
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,540
 "and then you can leave."

581
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:39,420
 So he gets now Leah and Rachel,

582
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:42,300
 but he's got to go another seven years.

583
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,820
 And in that seven years,

584
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:46,200
 he saw competition with these women,

585
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,060
 competition with their two maid servants.

586
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:51,260
 He ended up with 12 kids.

587
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:55,340
 And it was just, he saw competition like him

588
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,340
 and he saw it, he didn't like it.

589
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:59,860
 It got time to leave.

590
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:03,220
 And when he got time to leave, he had a vision.

591
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:07,260
 And in the vision, he saw that all of Laban's flock

592
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:12,260
 were bringing forth black and modeled and striped sheep.

593
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:15,100
 And God said, "I've seen what he's been doing to you.

594
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,040
 "From here on, all the sheep

595
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:20,360
 "are gonna be striped and modeled."

596
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,320
 He comes to Laban.

597
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:26,220
 He says, "I've worked 14 years for your daughters.

598
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:29,880
 "How about I get something for myself?"

599
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,180
 Laban says, "What do you want?"

600
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:36,660
 "Any flock animal that brings forth striped or modeled,

601
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:38,380
 "I'll take him.

602
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:41,720
 "Any black sheep, white sheep will be yours."

603
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,240
 He says, "Do it."

604
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,080
 Guess what?

605
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:48,040
 All the sheep brought forth were spotted

606
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:52,420
 and he took all of Laban's herd and took it to himself.

607
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:56,660
 In other words, he had to trust who?

608
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:57,680
 God.

609
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,760
 Is he learning?

610
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:02,000
 God is teaching him.

611
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,800
 Whom the Lord loves, he

612
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:08,620
 beats the snot out of.

613
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:12,080
 (audience laughing)

614
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,400
 God was instructing him.

615
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,640
 When I try to do something, it screws up.

616
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,740
 When I trust God, I get a ladder from heaven

617
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:21,560
 and I get striped and modeled sheep.

618
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,320
 God is good to his word.

619
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,480
 I mess it up.

620
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,360
 He worked for six years.

621
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:31,420
 Seven plus seven is 14 plus six is 20 years.

622
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:35,100
 That's the time of a bachelor's and a master's, you know?

623
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:39,900
 I worked that long and he had a great flock.

624
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,120
 You know what he did?

625
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,120
 Instead of saying, "I'm ready to go,"

626
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,160
 he took off on his own.

627
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:49,620
 His wife stole the household idols, Rachel,

628
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:52,240
 because she thought it would bring good luck.

629
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,680
 He gets chased down by Laban.

630
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,980
 "You got my idols.

631
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,440
 "I don't have your idols."

632
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,280
 You do.

633
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,480
 If anybody that has the idols,

634
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,440
 you check 'em and you can kill 'em.

635
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,900
 He just put his wife to death.

636
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,760
 Laban goes through all the stuff.

637
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:11,600
 He comes to Rachel and she won't stand up.

638
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,480
 She's sitting on a saddle.

639
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,020
 And she says, "I'm sorry, I can't stand up

640
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:19,060
 "because the custom of women is upon me."

641
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,040
 Trivia question.

642
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,920
 Where's the first time in the Bible

643
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:24,140
 the word idols occurs?

644
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:25,080
 It's right here.

645
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:28,960
 Normally, God carries his people.

646
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,840
 They had to carry the idols, put 'em on a donkey.

647
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:35,720
 Rachel is sitting on the idols.

648
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,560
 The idols are not a protection, they're a threat to her.

649
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:44,040
 They're gonna cost her her life in contrast to God.

650
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,380
 And she says, "I can't stand up

651
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:46,920
 "'cause the custom of women is upon me,"

652
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:49,040
 meaning I'm in my period.

653
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,920
 She's claiming to be in her period, sitting on the idols.

654
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,320
 That's Hebrew humor.

655
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:57,820
 It's funnier in the Hebrew, all right?

656
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:59,240
 (congregation laughing)

657
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,520
 There's nothing, in the Old Testament, Leviticus,

658
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:02,480
 if a woman's in her period,

659
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,480
 everything she touches is unclean.

660
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,720
 She's sitting on the idols, you dig?

661
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,080
 It's nasty as a mug, all right?

662
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:16,000
 (congregation laughing)

663
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,640
 And she says, "Daddy, I'm sorry I can't stand up

664
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,000
 "because the custom," and she uses a word,

665
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,080
 the custom of women.

666
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,560
 You know where the word occurs in Genesis?

667
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:27,200
 Whenever Laban says, "It's not our custom

668
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,520
 "to marry off the second before the first,"

669
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,180
 and now she turns around and says,

670
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,480
 "The custom is upon me."

671
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,680
 That is Hebrew humor.

672
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,720
 (laughing)

673
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,560
 All right.

674
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:41,860
 God carries you, you carry the idols.

675
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:44,400
 They're nasty, they're dirty, they'll get you killed,

676
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:49,080
 and God ends up whooping him

677
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,880
 simply by his sovereign grace.

678
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,720
 And so you're watching here.

679
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,800
 Jacob's trying to do it, God doing it.

680
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,980
 Laban trying to stop him, God taking care.

681
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:59,720
 The idols trying, the idols are a joke, God carries it.

682
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,080
 Are you with me?

683
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,880
 No need to shepherd the wind.

684
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,480
 God is great, amen?

685
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:08,180
 No need to do that song and dance.

686
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:10,480
 God can take care of you.

687
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:15,240
 Well, he got ready to go back,

688
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,580
 and here they come to him.

689
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:18,520
 I got a quarter after.

690
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:21,040
 Can I finish my Jacob story here?

691
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:21,880
 Okay, okay.

692
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,960
 Y'all want me to close right now?

693
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:26,720
 No, you wanna know how this story ends.

694
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,320
 It's in the Bible, it's full of lots of interesting facts

695
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,720
 and information if you'll read this.

696
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,560
 Okay.

697
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:38,360
 He's got all of his family together.

698
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:41,600
 He's got 12 kids, they got wives, they got kids.

699
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,720
 And Jacob gets ready to leave,

700
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,280
 and he said, "I gotta go back on the land."

701
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,840
 And one of his guys comes before him,

702
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,260
 that he sent before him, and he says,

703
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,160
 "Guess who's coming to meet you?

704
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:56,120
 "Esau, the guy you offended 20 years earlier."

705
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,440
 And he's coming with 300 soldiers.

706
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:04,040
 And Jacob said, "Oh, Lord."

707
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:09,920
 Now, can this guy kill Jacob after God has made a promise?

708
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,480
 Yes or no?

709
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,960
 No.

710
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,840
 Trust God.

711
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:14,760
 You know what he does?

712
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,700
 He takes all of his belongings,

713
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:21,700
 and he sends them in waves to placate Esau.

714
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:26,000
 He won't trust God.

715
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,660
 He's always gonna trust his ingenuity.

716
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:35,520
 The problem is Jacob is too smart for his own good.

717
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:42,200
 Well, they go, and he's left by himself on a riverbank.

718
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,400
 And you know what happened that night?

719
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:49,680
 In the womb, he took his brother by the heel.

720
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:52,680
 In his maturity, he contended with God,

721
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,140
 he wrestled with the angel.

722
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:56,200
 That night, he got attacked.

723
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:00,720
 Someone came into the camp to rob him.

724
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,600
 You know what they were gonna rob him of?

725
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,800
 He had sent everything ahead of him.

726
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,880
 He doesn't have anything.

727
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,720
 It was the angel of the Lord.

728
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:09,960
 All through the Old Testament,

729
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,760
 you see a person called the angel of the Lord.

730
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,960
 The Jews had a name for him.

731
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,720
 They called him Metroton.

732
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,040
 And it's the, always when the angel of the Lord appears,

733
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:20,360
 he claims deity, and yet he is distinct from deity.

734
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,520
 You see him all the way through the Old Testament.

735
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,420
 He appears first in Genesis 15.

736
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:27,460
 He occurs again in the book of Zechariah chapter 12.

737
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:30,420
 He's all the way through the Old Testament.

738
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:33,540
 He never occurs once the New Testament begins.

739
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:37,420
 Question is, who is the angel of the Lord?

740
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:40,420
 It is the pre-incarnate Son of God,

741
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:42,220
 who doesn't appear anymore as an appearance

742
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:44,880
 because now we have an incarnation of God,

743
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,440
 the highest form of revelation.

744
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:50,380
 And so the angel of the Lord attacks him.

745
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:51,220
 You know why?

746
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:52,640
 He's gonna rob him.

747
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,680
 Rob him of what?

748
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:58,760
 Rob him of the one thing God doesn't have from him.

749
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,620
 And that's him.

750
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:02,720
 I want you.

751
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,780
 And he wrestles with the angel.

752
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:09,160
 And Jacob recognizes who it is.

753
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:14,160
 But the external fight typifies the internal battle.

754
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:19,880
 I personally believe that God does not use a Christian

755
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,480
 until he hurts him.

756
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:27,480
 I think women, God can woo to himself by his love.

757
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:31,940
 I think most men, God has to hurt him.

758
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:37,880
 And he wrestled with Jacob all night long,

759
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:40,240
 which is the way Jacob was with God.

760
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,520
 I'm not gonna trust you.

761
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,540
 I'm gonna do it myself.

762
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:49,480
 And finally, the sun's about to come up

763
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:53,240
 and God says, "The battle is over."

764
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,920
 James Montgomery Boyce said this

765
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,880
 about the wrestling with the angel of the Lord.

766
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,760
 He said, "Remember, when you wrestle with God,

767
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,280
 "God always cheats."

768
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:08,080
 You remember what the angel of the Lord does?

769
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:12,960
 He takes his finger and he touches his hip.

770
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,320
 The strongest joint you got is in your hip.

771
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,360
 You got gluteus, you got quads,

772
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:22,320
 you got adductors, adductor, they all tie in there.

773
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,960
 I've only seen one guy in football dislocate,

774
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:28,720
 tear his hip out, and that was Bo Jackson.

775
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,840
 When he went down the sideline,

776
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:32,740
 he jammed his femur up and it shattered.

777
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:36,520
 The angel of the Lord reached out and touched him,

778
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:40,280
 just touched him, and his hip went (imitates cracking)

779
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,760
 And now he's not wrestling with the angel,

780
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:45,160
 he's hanging onto him.

781
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,720
 And he finally learns how to pray.

782
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,840
 It's a great prayer.

783
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:53,520
 It says, "I will not turn you loose

784
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:59,280
 "until you bless me."

785
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,840
 He finally, after 20 years,

786
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:10,640
 he wept and sought his favor.

787
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,560
 He cried because he was hurt,

788
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:16,020
 and he said, "God, help me."

789
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:20,720
 You know, my wife was at East Texas State University,

790
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,680
 and she lived by her own, this is her public testimony,

791
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:28,680
 she lived a life of rebellion and sin,

792
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,960
 and she came to know the Lord

793
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,160
 when she was a little Baptist kid

794
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,080
 at like eight, 12 years old in there.

795
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,760
 But she said, "All the time I was in East Texas

796
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:41,760
 "in commerce, I had a continual vision in the daytime.

797
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:46,780
 "I could see it of like a black sheet settling over me

798
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:49,720
 "as I would go on in rebellion."

799
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:52,940
 And she said, "The more that sheet would settle,

800
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:56,800
 "the smaller the little hole at the top would get."

801
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:01,140
 And she said, "I was convinced that when the hole closed up,

802
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:02,920
 "God was gonna kill me."

803
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:08,560
 And so she finally repented,

804
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,680
 and God brought into her life.

805
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:16,320
 (audience laughing)

806
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:28,060
 I could give you my own story.

807
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:30,420
 God heard him.

808
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:34,760
 I wanna say to you something as a man, girls and guys,

809
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:38,760
 if God is pleased to choose you,

810
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:44,760
 and if God is going to have you, God will get you.

811
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:49,360
 Now you say, "Ah, he ain't never met a debater like me."

812
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:53,500
 All he's gotta do is touch you.

813
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,840
 That's all, and it's all over.

814
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:59,540
 Well, he brought Jacob to his knees,

815
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:01,780
 and Jacob learned how to trust.

816
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:06,700
 And Jacob said, "I'm going now back home."

817
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:08,680
 And he met Esau, and you know what?

818
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,860
 Esau ran to meet him and hugged him and cried.

819
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:12,880
 As a matter of fact, the parable of the prodigal son

820
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,740
 is a takeoff on that verse.

821
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:16,360
 Esau was full of love.

822
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:19,500
 You tell me, had God gone ahead and prepared Esau's heart?

823
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,940
 Say yes.

824
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:24,040
 Amazing, he didn't have to go through all that hassle.

825
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,860
 And then Esau says, "Come home with me to Saer."

826
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:28,220
 You know what Jacob should have said?

827
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:32,480
 "I can't go home to Saer and the land of the Edomites.

828
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:35,360
 "I promised God I'd come to Bethel

829
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:37,220
 "whenever he showed himself to me."

830
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:38,340
 But he didn't.

831
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:40,860
 He says to Esau, "Yeah, you go ahead.

832
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:42,060
 "I'll be there later."

833
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:45,780
 And he takes a left and he leaves him and doesn't show up.

834
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:46,900
 You know why?

835
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:49,460
 Because he didn't go to Bethel where he said he would go.

836
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:54,460
 He stopped 15 miles short in a city called Shechem.

837
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:58,560
 It's in Genesis 35, and the name God is not mentioned.

838
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:02,060
 You know why he stopped 15 miles short?

839
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:04,620
 Because in Shechem, he could build booths,

840
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:06,380
 otherwise known as sukkoth.

841
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:09,560
 He put his animals there and there he could trade

842
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:12,280
 and make money.

843
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:16,980
 And so money caused him not to fulfill his vow.

844
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:18,860
 Isn't that something?

845
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:23,860
 Are we ever at the place that we can't do stupid stuff?

846
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:24,740
 Say no.

847
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:27,380
 Point to the guy next to you and say,

848
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:30,340
 "There is a stupid individual right there."

849
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:31,740
 (congregation laughing)

850
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:34,780
 He stopped 15 miles short.

851
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:36,060
 Now, okay, Jay.

852
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:41,780
 JP, he's got 12 sons.

853
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:44,740
 He's got a little daughter named Dinah.

854
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:50,500
 In Genesis 35, God isn't mentioned

855
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,140
 because he ain't trusting God.

856
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:54,340
 He's out to make some money.

857
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:58,540
 Can money ever carry good men off the path?

858
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:00,560
 Only living ones, all right.

859
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:03,260
 Yeah.

860
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:06,820
 He's got a little daughter though, named Dinah.

861
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:09,340
 JP, you remember what happens to Dinah

862
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:10,740
 in the town of Shechem?

863
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:13,380
 What happens to her?

864
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:18,800
 (congregation laughing)

865
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,260
 Yes, I do.

866
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:26,660
 She got raped.

867
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:28,600
 You know why she got raped?

868
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:32,540
 Because the daddy was someplace he shouldn't have been.

869
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:34,180
 Did God say Bethel?

870
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:36,860
 He didn't say Shechem.

871
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:39,260
 He stopped and he got hurt.

872
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:40,380
 And you know what else?

873
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:45,100
 He had two sons that got mad, Levi and Simeon,

874
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:47,540
 at this little daughter getting raped.

875
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:49,220
 And they went to these guys and said,

876
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:50,260
 "Hey, you wanna do business with us?"

877
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:51,540
 "Yes, we'll do business with it."

878
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:53,620
 "We can't do business with you unless you're Jews.

879
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:55,540
 "You're gonna have to get circumcised."

880
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:57,660
 Cha, all right?

881
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:59,380
 All right, yeah.

882
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:01,260
 Okay.

883
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:04,060
 (congregation laughing)

884
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:06,420
 They all got circumcised, all right?

885
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:12,460
 And when they're circumcised,

886
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:15,460
 they all come running in and they kill all the men.

887
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:18,700
 And now all the Canaanites around them hear about it.

888
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:22,140
 Now they're gonna kill Jacob and his 12 sons.

889
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:24,420
 And all of God's purposes in Israel

890
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:26,180
 are about to come to an end.

891
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:31,140
 And if Jacob dies and if Judah dies, who dies with him?

892
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:35,060
 Very famous guy born in Bethlehem, died on a cross, rose.

893
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:38,180
 He dies with him.

894
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:42,700
 And if Jesus dies, who goes to hell?

895
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:43,700
 You do.

896
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:46,580
 Thank you, Jacob.

897
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:49,180
 But you know what?

898
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:51,340
 God had mercy.

899
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:55,700
 And Jacob now gets up with his sons with a bounty on him,

900
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:57,500
 his daughter they got raped,

901
00:42:57,500 --> 00:43:01,100
 a bunch of dead, smoking ruins in Shechem.

902
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:05,060
 And finally, he comes to Bethel.

903
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:09,260
 Took him 20 years and a lot of pain.

904
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:12,460
 And in chapter 12 in verse four,

905
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:16,900
 he found him at Bethel.

906
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:20,420
 There was a 20 year period of pain between there

907
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:22,220
 and God found him.

908
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:28,140
 And there, Hosea says, watch the end of verse four,

909
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:32,140
 "He spoke with," what's the last word

910
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:33,780
 that's the pronoun in verse four?

911
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:36,060
 Us.

912
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:38,740
 He didn't just speak to Jacob at Bethel,

913
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:42,820
 he spoke to the whole nation and said, trust me.

914
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:47,500
 And so Hosea says, you guys, you Jews,

915
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,820
 have a dispute with God.

916
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:54,700
 All of your hopes are up in Assyria and down in Egypt

917
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:57,140
 and all of your shenanigans

918
00:43:57,140 --> 00:44:00,780
 and all of your moving and shaking.

919
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:03,140
 But you got a dispute with me.

920
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:05,980
 Go back to your roots.

921
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:09,260
 Go back to the old time religion.

922
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:12,540
 It was good for the Hebrew fathers

923
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:14,620
 and it's good enough for me.

924
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:18,140
 Trust God and his word.

925
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:21,220
 Don't be shepherding the wind.

926
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:22,740
 Amen.

927
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:26,260
 Let me tell you, I had to learn that.

928
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:27,780
 How to trust him.

929
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:30,540
 All of my life, all I wanted to be

930
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:31,780
 was a professional football player.

931
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:35,660
 I turned down the Cincinnati Reds to play college football

932
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:37,460
 'cause that was the quickest way to the top.

933
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:40,740
 Went to a team that threw the ball about 60 times a game.

934
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:45,060
 My freshman year, I got this hurt.

935
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:47,660
 My sophomore year, I broke this.

936
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:51,940
 Senior year, I blew this out and God brought me

937
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:54,580
 and broke me to the bottom.

938
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:57,140
 And I gave my heart to Christ.

939
00:44:57,140 --> 00:45:00,780
 And I said, God, I have tried and I have failed.

940
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:02,260
 You come into my heart.

941
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:05,060
 You make me what you want me to be.

942
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:07,420
 Well, I came back for two a day workouts.

943
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:09,420
 I was phenomenal.

944
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:13,700
 And they moved me to safety.

945
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:15,820
 Me, safety.

946
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:22,900
 I was not about to hit anybody.

947
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:26,140
 But I was pretty good.

948
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:27,460
 I could read the plays real well.

949
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:29,660
 And I thought, well, I guess I'll be an all-American.

950
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:31,500
 Safety, you know, God has plans.

951
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:35,940
 This guy overthrows a tight end, there I am, JP.

952
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:37,860
 Picked it off, took off.

953
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:40,580
 I see the flag cut back across the grave.

954
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:43,540
 A guy comes at me from Richardson, Texas.

955
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:46,220
 I went around him, he never touched me.

956
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:49,100
 My right knee went boom.

957
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:52,060
 And I was done, missed my senior year.

958
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:53,900
 Then we got a guy named Hayden Fry to coach us.

959
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:54,980
 You ever heard of him?

960
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:58,780
 College Football Hall of Fame came to coach us.

961
00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:00,740
 I came out for my fifth year.

962
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:02,820
 I was more than phenomenal.

963
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:06,780
 And he called me into his office.

964
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:08,300
 He said, Tommy, you're phenomenal.

965
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:09,420
 I said, what can I say?

966
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:15,780
 But you know, Tommy, we're going to lose this year.

967
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:17,660
 We're rebuilding and I can't lose

968
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:19,220
 the fifth year senior.

969
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:22,420
 We're going to have to let you go.

970
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:23,460
 I just got let go.

971
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:24,500
 I gave my heart to Christ.

972
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:26,140
 I got moved to safety, blew out my knee,

973
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:27,140
 and I just got cut.

974
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:31,420
 Well, I went ahead and finished my degree.

975
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:34,140
 I was student teaching down at Louisville, Texas.

976
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:35,380
 A coach came to me.

977
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:36,660
 As the team is now meeting,

978
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:38,420
 I can't meet 'cause I'm student teaching.

979
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:40,700
 I'm about to get my degree and be a football coach

980
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:43,380
 'cause that was my degree, so I guess I better be one.

981
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:46,820
 And the coach, this coach named Don Harvey,

982
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:47,940
 he said, you're a Christian?

983
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:48,900
 I'd given him a magazine.

984
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:51,620
 Yeah, can you come speak to my FCA group,

985
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:53,060
 Fellowship of Christianity?

986
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,260
 I said, yeah.

987
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:56,060
 And so I asked my Campus Crusade guy,

988
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:56,980
 I said, what do I do?

989
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:57,980
 He said, share the gospel.

990
00:46:57,980 --> 00:46:59,500
 I can do that, yeah.

991
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:00,700
 He said, here, memorize this.

992
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:01,660
 It's called God's plan.

993
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:03,220
 So I got up with 16 of them.

994
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:07,260
 I said, hey, fellas, it's good to be here talking to you.

995
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:10,020
 (congregation laughing)

996
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:11,540
 And I shared my testimony.

997
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:12,380
 I shared the gospel.

998
00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:13,220
 I got finished.

999
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:14,380
 I said, hey, I don't guess any of y'all

1000
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:16,020
 want to get Christians to you.

1001
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:17,460
 And eight of them said, yes, we do.

1002
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:19,940
 We went and prayed, and those eight guys trusted Christ.

1003
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:21,020
 Little bit later, a guy said,

1004
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:23,360
 could you come talk to the whole school?

1005
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:24,620
 Scared me to death.

1006
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:25,620
 I said, let me pray about it.

1007
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:27,860
 Maybe God didn't want me to share the gospel with 1,500.

1008
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:30,660
 (congregation laughing)

1009
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:33,980
 And I said, God, these guys are going to laugh at me.

1010
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:35,540
 And God just seemed to say,

1011
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:36,540
 when you gave your heart to me,

1012
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:37,860
 you gave me your reputation.

1013
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:40,420
 I'll do with you what I want to do with you.

1014
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:43,460
 And I spoke, and God blessed it.

1015
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:46,820
 Then I found out you could get paid for doing this.

1016
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:47,660
 And here I am.

1017
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:51,000
 (congregation laughing)

1018
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,980
 Pray with me.

1019
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:56,780
 Father in heaven, thank you for a time

1020
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:58,420
 in your word this evening.

1021
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:04,420
 And Lord, this is not the word we hear

1022
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:09,980
 from our sponsor of trust, the God of creation,

1023
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:14,740
 the God who chose Israel, the God of Abraham,

1024
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:18,620
 Isaac, and Jacob, the God who has given man his word,

1025
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:21,060
 the God who gave us his son,

1026
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:23,340
 who died and rose from the dead,

1027
00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:27,580
 the priesthood of philosophy, the priesthood of education,

1028
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:31,180
 the priesthood of science, the priesthood of religions.

1029
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:34,780
 They all say different things,

1030
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:38,820
 and they've all failed miserably.

1031
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:42,700
 But you have given us your word and ethics and each other

1032
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:45,340
 and hope and a meta narrative of history.

1033
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:47,300
 We know where it's going.

1034
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:52,300
 Why would we house the shaft and burn the grain?

1035
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:56,020
 Oh, Jacob, you shepherd the wind.

1036
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:58,080
 Come home.
