[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.880]   And yet the story inside of the Bible tells us that what does God do? God looks
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.200]   down at humanity who is running away from him. God looks down at you and me
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.000]   who are running away from him. And does he get angry? Does he say, "I'm just gonna
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.840]   destroy you. I'm God. You think you know better?" And what does he do? What does the
[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.820]   heart of God move him to do? He becomes a man, takes on the form of man, says, "I will
[00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.960]   die for these people. I will die for the runaway so that the runaway goes free."
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.300]   Like Paul said, "I'll pay for it." Jesus said, "I will pay for it." How amazing is
[00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.660]   this God that when he looks at his enemies, those who have run from him, he
[00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.160]   says, "I'll pay for it." The probably best verse that I know that displays this is
[00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:53.640]   Romans 5 where it says this in verse 6 and 8, "For while we were still weak, at
[00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:00.360]   the right time, Christ died for the ungodly." Verse 8, "But God
[00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:06.600]   demonstrates his love for us in this, and that while we were still sinners, Christ
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:13.280]   died for us." While we were running ungodly, unaware, enemies and thieves,
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:21.000]   Jesus stepped in and said, "I will pay for it." And why did he do it? Love. Love for
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.160]   you and for me. The idea of this God being a God who dies for his enemies, he
[00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:31.760]   dies for those who oppose him. This is who God is. He's a God of incredible love
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.800]   that moves them when they're worst are at their worst. When they're running from
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.040]   God, he says, "I'll die for them." What kind of God is this? You study other
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.640]   religions, you don't find a God represented like this. You see in
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.520]   Islam, "Hey, if anyone doesn't believe in Allah, kill them." In the Quran, you see in
[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.560]   other religious texts from other religions, in other anxious Jewish
[00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.900]   writings outside the Bible, they speak of, "Do not help your enemies." God's a God
[00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:03.080]   who says, "I'll die for my enemies." What kind of love is that? I love Onesimus. I
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:13.520]   love you, David. I love you, Alex. This is the God who is there. A God who dies for
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.680]   the worst when they're at their worst, before they could do anything right, when
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:18.880]   And they're still sinners.
