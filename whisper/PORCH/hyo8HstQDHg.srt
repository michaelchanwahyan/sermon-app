1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 [Music]

2
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 Well, Porsche Dallas, how are we doing tonight?

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 [Cheers]

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 Let's go. Well, I'm going to welcome you to the Porsche.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 And if you're watching with us online, welcome.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 And all of our Porsche Live locations around the nation, my name is Josiah.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 I want to especially, I want you to especially help me welcome our very, for the very first time,

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 the Porsche Live Atlanta in Dayton, Ohio.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 [Cheers]

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 Let's go. Welcome.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 We are so glad that you're tuning in for the very first time.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 Well, I've been in Seattle all weekend and it has been a long day.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 And I was there from Saturday to this morning and I'm whipped.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 So I'm praying for the Holy Spirit, supernatural power, and coffee to kick in.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 Amen.

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 And so I was out in Seattle and I took this epic guys trip with a guy in my community group and his two sons.

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 And so from Saturday to Monday, we went to this kind of a sporting event,

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 just kind of a, if you will, to a sporting event every single day.

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 Saturday we started out watching the number two team in the nation, the Washington Huskies.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 You're probably like, what? College football.

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 But yes, they are number two right now, which is nuts, the Washington Huskies, which is an awesome experience.

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 And then Sunday we went to the Seattle Seahawks game.

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 And then last night we were at, okay, we got some Seahawks fans, some people from Seattle in the room.

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 And then last night we went to watch the Seattle Mariners.

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 And here's a picture of us on the screen.

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 This is my buddy Chase and his two sons, Hudson and Jack.

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 And Chase reached out to me several months ago and he just said, hey, man, would you come on this trip with my sons and I?

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 Because I would love for you just to be another voice in their life as I'm investing in them spiritually.

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 And I'm like, me, bro? Like, really?

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 And he's like, yes.

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 And I think like Godfather, you know, like I'm going to be my God sons, that type of mentality, just kind of this second, third voice.

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 And I said, sure, let's do it.

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 And so he invites me on this trip and he's like, dude, we're going to have fun.

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 We're going to go to these epic sporting events.

35
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 We're going to eat good food, which we did.

36
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 And we're going to watch them throw the fish in the market, which we did.

37
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 And we stayed in this amazing hotel that overlooked the ocean, which was amazing.

38
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 But what was more crazy about this trip is waking up every day, taking his 10-year-old and 8-year-old on a journey through the word of God.

39
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 And praying with them and talking about like real life issues that they're struggling with and sharing the gospel with our Uber drivers.

40
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 And you're probably thinking, man, why are you sharing this thing?

41
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 Because if you've been a part of the porch for any time, you've probably heard my testimony.

42
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 Because me going on a trip like this, even being in community with other Christians, was kind of this foreign concept that I never thought in a thousand years that I would do.

43
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 Much less pour into other kids with the gospel of Jesus Christ, be a spiritual mentor.

44
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 You see, my life was all about the next party.

45
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 Like I would go in college and I would go on these trips and they would be marked by the party and the club and hooking up with multiple women and orgies and pornography addiction for 10 years.

46
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 And it would be marked by alcohol and whatever was under the sun, if it pleased me, I did it.

47
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 That was my story.

48
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 And God began to get a hold of my life at the tail end of my college career.

49
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 I was playing baseball and I remember coming home from a game and just remembering feeling empty and unsatisfied and unfulfilled.

50
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 And I try to share this story as much as I can because it's not a story about me.

51
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 It's a story about how God's grace swooped into my life, intersected all of those different sins.

52
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 The pride in my heart that said, God, I got this.

53
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 I don't need you.

54
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 I can live life apart from you.

55
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 I don't need to be connected to my creator.

56
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 Man, who even knows if Jesus is really God?

57
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 That was me.

58
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 I was the skeptic.

59
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 And for me to be on a trip over the last 72 hours with a guy in my community group, even committing to community with other believers, much less a spiritual mentor, is only by an act of God's grace.

60
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 And so I don't say that to boast about it.

61
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 I say that to boast about my God.

62
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 And here's what we know to be true.

63
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 Like if you're a Christian in the room, you were once lost but now you're found.

64
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 Like you know, you know at the hardest of hearts, like you know who you were before Christ.

65
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 Christ found you and he began to change your desires and your wants to be in line with who God is.

66
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 And so I start there tonight because as we open up the book of John, we're going to be in John chapter 1, starting in verse 35.

67
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 So if you have your Bibles, you can open them up.

68
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 We're going to see Jesus finding his first disciples and calling them to follow him.

69
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 And so it's this idea that, man, every time we tell our story, it's a reminder of God's grace in our life.

70
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 And so God has rescued us.

71
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 He saved us.

72
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 He's given us a new heart with new desires.

73
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 And so maybe you're here tonight and be like, I don't think that's a part of my story, Josiah.

74
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 Well, in the same way as Jesus pursues and finds his first disciples,

75
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 I believe that God, the God of the universe, brought you here for such a time as tonight to find you.

76
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 And he's pursuing your heart and he's going to bring you to the end of yourself tonight where you're going to bend the knee for the very first time and surrender your life to him.

77
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 See, Jesus has 12 disciples, and tonight we're going to learn about four of them, Andrew, Simon, Philip and Nathaniel.

78
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 And we're going to be in the book of John, like I said, starting in verse 35.

79
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 And I'm just going to read this passage and then we're going to walk through it.

80
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 Verse 35, "The next day, again, John was standing with two of his disciples."

81
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 So this was John the Baptist.

82
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 If you read a few verses before, he was the guy, the precursor of Christ, and he was just pointing other people to Christ.

83
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 That's all he was doing is just saying, hey, I'm not the Christ.

84
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 I'm not the prophet.

85
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 I am just the one to point others to Christ.

86
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 And so he was just saying, hey, I'm not even worthy to untie the sandals on this guy named Jesus' feet.

87
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 And there's going to be a guy named Jesus who shows up on the scene, and he has the same message in the same chapter, and he pushes it down over and over and over again.

88
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 And it's this message, "Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world is going to show up unto the scene."

89
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 So the next day, this is John, was standing with two of his disciples, and he looked, and look at what he says.

90
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 As Jesus walked by, he said, "Behold, the Lamb of God."

91
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 The two disciples heard him.

92
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 The two disciples that were following John heard him say this, and what did they do?

93
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 They left to follow John, and they went to follow Jesus.

94
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 They left following John to follow Jesus.

95
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 Verse 38, "Jesus turned and said," or Jesus turned and saw them following and said to them, "What are you seeking?"

96
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 And they said to him, "Rabbi," which means teacher, "where are you staying?"

97
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 He said to them, so they didn't answer the question.

98
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 When Jesus asked, "What are you seeking?" they just said, "Where are you staying?"

99
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 We'll unpack that here in a minute.

100
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 He said to them, "Come and you will see."

101
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 So they came and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him that day for just about the 10th hour, so think around 4 p.m. in the afternoon.

102
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 One of the two who heard John speak and followed Jesus was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.

103
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 So what did Andrew do?

104
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 He found his brother Simon and said to him, "We have found the Messiah," which means Christ, and what did he do?

105
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 He brought him to Jesus.

106
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 Jesus looked at him and said, "You are Simon, the son of John.

107
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 You shall be called Cephas," which means Peter.

108
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 Jesus changes his identity.

109
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 When you were lost and then you began to be found, you have an identity change.

110
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 This is what Jesus is doing in Simon Peter's life.

111
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 Verse 43, "The next day Jesus decided to go to Galilee.

112
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 He found Philip and said to him, 'Follow me.'"

113
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 Now, Philip was from Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.

114
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 "Philip found Nathanael and said to him, 'We have found him of whom Moses and the law and the prophets wrote about, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.'"

115
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 Everything that the Old Testament had been pointing to, he's now on the scene.

116
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 Jesus is here.

117
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 Everything in the Old Testament points to Jesus.

118
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 And now Jesus is showing up, and they're looking at him.

119
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 And look at what Nathanael says.

120
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 "Nathanael said to him, 'Can anything good come out of Nazareth?'

121
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 Philip said to him, 'Come and see.'"

122
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 Nathanael was a skeptic.

123
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 "Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him and said to him, 'Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom there is no deceit.'"

124
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 Now he's reading his mail.

125
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 "Nathanael said to him, 'How do you know me?'

126
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 Jesus answered, 'Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.'"

127
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 And look at Nathanael's response.

128
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 "Rabbi, you are the son of God.

129
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 You're the king of Israel."

130
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 Why?

131
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 Because you read my mail?

132
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 "Jesus answered, 'Because I said to you, you were under the fig tree?

133
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 Do you believe?

134
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 You will see greater things than these.'"

135
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 Verse 51.

136
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 "And he said to him, 'Truly, truly, I say to you, you will see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.'"

137
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 So tonight I want to give you four things.

138
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 Four things on what it looks like to be found in Jesus.

139
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 If you have come into this place and you consider yourself to be a believer in Jesus, a follower of Jesus, then you have been found by Jesus.

140
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 So what does it look like to be found by Jesus?

141
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 Point number one.

142
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 Found people see Jesus.

143
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 Simple.

144
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 Found people see Jesus.

145
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 Look at what John 1, 35-37 says.

146
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 "The next day," let's just unpack it from the top.

147
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 "The next day again John was standing with two of his disciples and he looked at Jesus as he walked by and said, 'Behold, the Lamb of God.'"

148
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 This word "behold" just means to see.

149
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 He's basically saying see the Lamb of God.

150
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 God is here in the flesh.

151
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 His name is Jesus.

152
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 "The two disciples heard him say this and they followed Jesus."

153
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 Found people see Jesus.

154
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 Like if you've been found by Jesus, you're going to see Jesus.

155
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 Let me ask you a question.

156
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 As you look back on the last week of your life, have you seen Jesus?

157
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 Do you see Jesus as you go about your life?

158
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 If you're following anything other than Jesus, you're following a counterfeit God.

159
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 And a counterfeit God can't stand under the weight of your glory.

160
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 This is what I mean.

161
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 What do I mean by glory?

162
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 This word glory, it's the name of our series.

163
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 And every single week at the porch we want you to glory.

164
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 We want you to praise.

165
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 We want you to exalt Jesus.

166
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 Not another person, not a place, not a thing.

167
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 The reality is we're all going to glory.

168
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 We're all going to praise.

169
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 We're all going to exalt in something.

170
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 And so you might ask yourself, how do I glory in Jesus?

171
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 How do I understand more of Jesus?

172
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 You behold Jesus.

173
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 This word behold, again, is see, observe, consider.

174
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 So when John says in verse 36, behold the Lamb of God, he's saying see Jesus.

175
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 Observe Jesus.

176
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 Consider Jesus.

177
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 Like we don't want you to see the band.

178
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 We want you to see Jesus through the band.

179
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 Like we don't want you to see any communicator on this stage, whether it be T.A.,

180
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 myself, Jenny Allen, or anyone that stands up here.

181
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 We don't want you to glory or praise or exalt or lift us up.

182
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 We want you to see Jesus through everything we do.

183
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 And so if we're doing something that hinders your sight from seeing Jesus,

184
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 then we've missed it.

185
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 So this is why our mission statement says the porch exists to call any and

186
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 every young adult to what?

187
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 To see Jesus and surrender fully to life with him.

188
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 That's what it's all about.

189
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 Our goal is to get out of the way and display Jesus in everything we can.

190
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 We know we're going to glory.

191
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 We know we're going to praise something.

192
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 We know we're going to exalt something in our life.

193
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 What are you exalting in?

194
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 What are you praising?

195
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 If you did an inventory of the past week of your life, what would you say you

196
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 gave your time and attention and resources to?

197
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 We were created to glory in something.

198
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 And here's what happens.

199
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 When you glory in something, you ultimately give credit to and you

200
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 ultimately worship that thing.

201
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 So there's not a communicator on this stage that can stand under the weight of

202
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 your worship.

203
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 Why?

204
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 Because communicators are fallible people.

205
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 But what happens a lot of times we go throughout our week and we exalt,

206
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 we listen to more of communicators of God's word than we do God himself.

207
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 And so we spend more time getting sound bites or listening to podcasts or

208
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 listening to a message after message, and those things aren't bad in

209
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 themselves.

210
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 Hopefully they point you to Jesus.

211
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 But if they're not pointing you to open up this book and spend time with

212
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 Jesus, then we've missed the point.

213
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 We've missed the point.

214
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 Found people see Jesus.

215
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 Sin can't sit under the weight of your worship.

216
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 Like some of you, man, you worship yourself.

217
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 Like I don't care how beautiful fit, how much kale you eat.

218
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 Like I don't care how much workout you do.

219
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 Like my wife does pier bar.

220
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 I love it.

221
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 It's awesome.

222
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 I try to do CrossFit.

223
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 I attempt to do CrossFit.

224
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 Not very well, but I'm trying to get a workout in.

225
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 And it's usually body weight at best.

226
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 But I don't care.

227
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 If you glory in yourself, if you worship yourself, like go get that

228
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 gain.

229
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 But if you worship yourself, it will make you sick.

230
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 That's my testimony, man.

231
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 I worshiped me.

232
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 Like I couldn't get out of the way.

233
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 I wanted life to be about Josiah, and it led me to a place of depression.

234
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 And that's my story.

235
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 Because I wasn't created to worship myself.

236
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 You worship money, you'll never have enough.

237
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 Just asked a dude I went on a trip with.

238
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 Like multimillionaire.

239
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 And he just turned to me and he just said, hey, everything I have is

240
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 God's.

241
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 How do you think I should steward this money that he's given me?

242
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 And we invited his 10-year-old and 8-year-old into the conversation as

243
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 we're trying to show them that, hey, just because you can doesn't mean

244
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 you should.

245
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 And I saw this multimillionaire just say no, no, no, no, no all throughout

246
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 the weekend.

247
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 And we're discipling his kids.

248
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 Because he knows that money isn't his.

249
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 Like do you live with that type of loose hands or does your money own

250
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 you?

251
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 Do you grip it so tight or is it, hey, God, you own it all.

252
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 You worship sex, it won't ever satisfy.

253
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 I tried that too.

254
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 It's a part of my story.

255
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 It's empty.

256
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 I was a shell of a man before God found me.

257
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 On the outside everybody could think, man, oh, this guy has everything he

258
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 could ever want.

259
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 And on the inside I was dying.

260
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 Empty.

261
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 You worship the next thing you're going to buy, the house, the car,

262
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 vacation.

263
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 I hope you get all of that.

264
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 But if you worship it, it won't stand.

265
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 If you glory and if you exalt it, if you praise it, it won't stand under

266
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 the weight of your worship.

267
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 This is what he's getting at.

268
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 You were created to worship God.

269
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 Found people see Jesus.

270
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 And these things can be hindering you from seeing Jesus.

271
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 These things can blur your vision.

272
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 Maybe you don't struggle with any of that.

273
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 Maybe you just, you know, you go throughout your week and, man,

274
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 culture, you give yourself too much credit.

275
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 You put too much confidence in the flesh.

276
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 And you're kind of like a pretty good Christian.

277
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 And the things I just said, you don't really struggle with that.

278
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 But you allow culture to influence you.

279
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 And so you just kind of take a step back and be like, hey,

280
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 that's the things I'm watching over here, the things I'm listening to.

281
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 It's not really affecting me.

282
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 But it's beginning to hook you.

283
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 And it's subtle.

284
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 For some of you, you're going through it.

285
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 And the question I would ask you, do you depend more on God to get you

286
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 through it or yourself?

287
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 Are you self-reliant or dependent on God?

288
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 Found people see Jesus.

289
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 So when Jesus showed up on the scene, those who were following John

290
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 left to follow Jesus.

291
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 Why?

292
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 Because they saw Jesus.

293
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 I wonder if Jesus were to walk into this place tonight,

294
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 would we even see him?

295
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 Or would we be too busy following this thing called the porch,

296
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 which I love.

297
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 I love this gathering.

298
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 It's one of my favorite things to do every single week.

299
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 That's why I took a 6 a.m. flight from Seattle tonight to be back here

300
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 to preach God's word.

301
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 But our job is not to make much of the porch.

302
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 It's to make much of Jesus.

303
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 What are you glorying in?

304
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 What are you exalting?

305
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 Point number two, found people follow Jesus.

306
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 It's simple, man.

307
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 I'm not going to give you any groundbreaking points tonight that are

308
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 going to be like, oof, like just blowing your mind.

309
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 Found people follow Jesus.

310
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 Look at what it says here.

311
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 Jesus is inviting these people into his life to become his disciples.

312
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 The Greek word for disciple simply means learner.

313
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 But here we get a glimpse of what Jesus intended for discipleship to look like.

314
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 Look at verse 38 and 39.

315
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 Jesus turned and saw them following and said, "What are you seeking?"

316
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 And they said to him, "Rabbi," which means teacher, "where are you staying?"

317
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 He said to them, "Come and you will see."

318
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 So they came and saw where he was staying,

319
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 and they stayed with him that day for what was about the 10th hour.

320
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 Jesus sees Andrew following him and asks him straight up,

321
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 "What are you seeking?"

322
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 They don't even respond to that question.

323
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 And I think -- I'm just -- you know, I'm making a calculated assumption.

324
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 I think they might have been embarrassed to admit to Jesus what they were seeking,

325
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 why they really wanted to follow him.

326
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 And I think if we're honest with ourselves, some of us,

327
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 like we come into this place and if I were to ask you, "Hey, why are you here?

328
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 Why do you want to follow Jesus?"

329
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 And some of you, you would give me the church answer.

330
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 Oh, man, because, you know, I really want to just know God more

331
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 and I want to make much of his name

332
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 and I want to learn how to share the gospel with my friends.

333
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 But deep down inside, there's some other reasons.

334
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 And they're not bad in and of themselves.

335
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 But I think sometimes we try to fake God out as like,

336
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 "God, I really want a spouse, but if I tell you I don't want a spouse,

337
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 maybe you'll think I'm content, and then if you see that I'm content,

338
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 maybe you'll give me a spouse."

339
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 I used to do that.

340
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 So I'm laughing at myself.

341
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 No lie.

342
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 I had two girls, like my first two children, they're girls.

343
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 I love them.

344
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 I call them my muchachicas.

345
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 And I did this with them.

346
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 Or I did this with God and them.

347
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 I'm like, "God, I could take five more girls, but deep down inside,"

348
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 and I could, like I love my girls,

349
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 "but deep down inside, I wanted a boy.

350
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 I wanted a boy.

351
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 But for years, I wouldn't pray and ask for a boy because I wanted God to see

352
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 that I was content with my girls.

353
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 And I thought I was faking God out, but God knows you.

354
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 Did you not see how he read Nathaniel's mail?

355
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 He literally called Nathaniel out and said,

356
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 "Hey, I saw you way before Philip ever called you.

357
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 You were underneath the fig tree, bro."

358
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 God knows you.

359
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 He knows your motives.

360
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 He knows what you're seeking.

361
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 He knows why you're here at the porch.

362
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 Some of them are selfish reasons and some of them are good reasons.

363
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 I'm not saying you're all selfish.

364
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 No, but here's what I'm saying.

365
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 [Laughter]

366
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 But this is what I'm saying.

367
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 Just be real with God.

368
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 He can handle it.

369
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 Be real with God.

370
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 Tell him everything.

371
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 Tell him the good reasons and the selfish reasons.

372
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 He can handle it.

373
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 And so Jesus sees Andrew, asks him the question.

374
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 He may be too embarrassed to share what he's really seeking.

375
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 So instead of Jesus pressing him more and asking these guys why

376
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 they really wanted to follow him, he just invites them into his life,

377
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 to live life with him.

378
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 I love this.

379
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 Following Jesus meant spending time with him, seeing how he lived.

380
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 Jesus is inviting them to spend the day with him.

381
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 Now he's opening up his life and saying, "Hey, as I do life,

382
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 come do life with me."

383
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 This is an amazing picture of discipleship,

384
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 which you think is just a lost art within the church today.

385
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 When Jesus is saying, "Come follow me," and he's saying,

386
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 "Hey, come follow me as I do life," he's inviting them into a

387
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 relationship with these men.

388
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 Man, I was talking to Uber drivers.

389
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 Man, we probably had four of them.

390
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 And every Uber driver had this religion where you would do these

391
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 five things and that would help you get into heaven.

392
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 And I said, "No, bro, you got it wrong.

393
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 God is after your heart.

394
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 He wants to have a relationship with you,

395
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 not that you just go and check the box for these five things and

396
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 automatically you stand before him and you enter heaven because you

397
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 prayed a certain prayer or you prayed in a certain direction or you

398
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 read the sacred book enough or you went to, you know,

399
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 the church to repent and you just did all these things and it was

400
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 stale and it was dead and you could see there was no life there."

401
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 And I just said, "Jesus loves you.

402
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 He died on the cross for your sins.

403
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 He wants to make a way when there was no other way so that you could be

404
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 made right with him and he's inviting you into a relationship with him.

405
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 And as you get to know him, it's not going to feel like duty.

406
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 It's going to feel like a delight.

407
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 It's not going to feel like a have to.

408
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 It's going to feel like a want to."

409
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 And some of us, we come into this place and we just have a dead,

410
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 cold religion and that's how we view God.

411
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 And I want you to see the personal connection that Jesus is inviting his

412
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 disciples into tonight.

413
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 And what do the disciples do?

414
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 They reorient their entire day to spend time with Jesus.

415
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 God's inviting you into a relationship with him.

416
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 Would you spend time with him?

417
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 If there was a written account of my life, I would love for people to read.

418
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 And this is what I would love for them to read every day.

419
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 Josiah spent time with Jesus.

420
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 Every day.

421
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 And when I got done spending time in the typical read God's word, pray,

422
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 I didn't leave Jesus at the desk that I was at or at the chair I was at or

423
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 the front porch that I spent time with him.

424
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 I took him with me wherever I went.

425
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 And I had an ongoing dialogue with him.

426
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 Hey, I'm stepping into this Uber car right now.

427
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 Give me the words to speak.

428
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 Give me the questions to ask.

429
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 Hey, I'm going on this trip and I want to make the most of it.

430
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 I know there's going to be a lot of distractions and Seattle's big and it's

431
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 fun, but here we want to be a second voice into these kids' lives.

432
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 And so, God, I need you to make sure that my heart is postured in a way where I

433
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 can truly invest and I don't get distracted.

434
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 God, would you come with me on those,

435
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 all the different adventures that God wants me to partake in?

436
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 So Andrew and his brother Simon Peter spent the day with Jesus.

437
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 And look at what it leads to.

438
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 Later on you see in Mark chapter 1, 16 through 18,

439
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 passing alongside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon, who's he?

440
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 Jesus saw Simon and Andrew, the brother of Simon,

441
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 casting a net into the sea for they were fishermen.

442
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 And Jesus said to them, follow me and I will make you fishers of men.

443
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 And immediately they left their nets and followed him.

444
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 Why? Because they had spent time with Jesus.

445
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 They got to know Jesus.

446
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 They did the things that Jesus did.

447
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 They saw what Jesus saw and Jesus invested deeply into them.

448
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 They were taught by Jesus.

449
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 They broke bread with Jesus.

450
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 They did life with Jesus.

451
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 And it led to a career change.

452
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 That's nuts.

453
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 Same is true for Levi, Mark 2, 14.

454
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 And as he passed by, he saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus,

455
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 sitting in the tax booth or sitting at the tax booth.

456
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 And he said to him, follow me.

457
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 And he rose and followed him.

458
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 There wasn't just a career change.

459
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 There was a lifestyle change.

460
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 He left everything to go and follow Jesus because he spent time with him.

461
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 Don't miss it.

462
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 Found people follow Jesus because found people spend time with Jesus.

463
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 This is the trajectory of each disciple's life.

464
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 It started with spending time.

465
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 They learned how to live from him.

466
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 They enjoyed being with him.

467
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 They watched him work.

468
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 They were encouraged and sharpened by him.

469
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 And they were entrusted with his mission.

470
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 And so Jesus says, now I can entrust you to go out into the world and change it.

471
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 And so this model of discipleship is what my wife, Kathy, and I love to do.

472
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 Like it's just something we have seen early on after I came to know Jesus

473
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 and I was single for almost the next decade of my life.

474
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 It's hard season.

475
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 I feel some of your pain.

476
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 But to be real, when I met Kathy, we started studying God's word and saying,

477
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 hey, what do we want our life to be about?

478
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 Like I don't want to just sit up here and preach the gospel and never go

479
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 and live it with you.

480
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 I don't want to just be in a Bible study and never go and do the things we're

481
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 talking about.

482
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 And so we just said, hey, we're going to invite young adults into our life.

483
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 Like whatever we do.

484
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 So what does this look like practically?

485
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 Sunday night usually.

486
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 We sit on the couch, have to put our three kids to bed.

487
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 We pull out our calendars.

488
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 And we just said, hey, what are the openings?

489
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 Do you have openings?

490
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 Do we have openings for dinner?

491
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 Can we invite some people over for dinner to sit around the table?

492
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 How about grocery store, Costco run, soccer practice, getting haircuts.

493
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 No lie.

494
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 Like getting that fade.

495
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 Man, I invited a young adult and we just got a fade together and we were

496
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 talking about Jesus, sharing the gospel with a guy named Brian, our barber.

497
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 And just doing life with people.

498
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 And so this is what we've made our life about.

499
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 And it's a beautiful thing.

500
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 It's one of the most -- one of the most joyous things that we do all week is

501
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 bring people into our life.

502
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 Because we want our life to be a bigger invitation to young adults seeing and

503
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 following Jesus.

504
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 Not just what we say, but what we do.

505
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 And listen, we don't get it right every time.

506
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 They see the good, bad, and the ugly with us.

507
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 They see sometimes when I'm sharp with my kids.

508
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 Or I have a wrong tone with Kathy.

509
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 And I have the opportunity to say, hey, that was a miss.

510
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 Will you forgive me?

511
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 And so I don't just model the good, man, we model it all.

512
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 They have an open book to our life.

513
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 We were driving down the road the other day and Kathy said, hey, a young

514
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 adult reached out to me and she just asked if she could come over and just

515
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 watch how we do morning routine once a week.

516
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 What?

517
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 Morning routine?

518
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 Like they want to come over and they want to watch how we get our kids out

519
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 of bed and how we get them clothed and how we make breakfast and how we just

520
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 go throughout the morning routine and get them ready for school.

521
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 And she said, yeah.

522
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 I said, why not?

523
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 And so once a week we have a young adult that just comes over and watches

524
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 this because she's trying to learn what it looks like to be a mom and a wife

525
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 someday.

526
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 And this is what Jesus did.

527
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 He invited the disciples into his life and he didn't expect them to change

528
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 without a relationship.

529
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 He said, hey, I'm going to invite you into a relationship and when you see

530
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 me and when you see how life is supposed to be done, you're going to be

531
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 attractive to this Jesus.

532
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 And so often we just hear messages and we never see anything.

533
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 And our lives speak way louder than our words, amen.

534
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 And so what I love to do is, you know, as people are coming over to my

535
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 life, let me just give you a practical illustration or a picture I should say.

536
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 This is a picture of my two daughters and these are two guys I've invested in

537
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 for some time now.

538
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 And this is Kyle and JT.

539
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 And I just invite them into my daughter's rooms.

540
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 I said, hey, you're up, bro.

541
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 You got about a minute, because that's their attention span, to give them some

542
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 of the gospel, to share a Bible story.

543
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 And then you got about 20 seconds or less to pray, okay.

544
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 And you better pray with one eye open because you never know what's going to

545
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 come flying at you, all right.

546
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 And they just get to see what it looks like to follow Jesus in making

547
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 disciples of our kids.

548
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 And so this is what Jesus is inviting you and I into.

549
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 I love what Dallas Willard said.

550
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 He just said, "Discipleship is the process of becoming who Jesus would be

551
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 if he were you."

552
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 Discipleship is the process of becoming who Jesus would be if he were you.

553
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 And so my question is, why are so many of our trajectories seem so radically

554
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 different than this?

555
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 Like many of us, man, we're so busy that we just, as T.A.

556
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 said last week, we glance at Jesus instead of gazing at him.

557
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 And so often we have this phrase where quality time versus quantity time.

558
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 But what I've learned from T.A. is he says, hey, quantity time actually leads

559
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 to quantity time.

560
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 And so if you are looking for 140 characters or less, you're looking for a

561
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 gum bite on Instagram or a reel to get your feeding, when it comes to God's

562
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 word, it's not enough.

563
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 And that you glancing at Jesus instead of gazing at him, God wants to speak to you.

564
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 God's word is God's voice.

565
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 And he wants to speak to you every single day.

566
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 I said this earlier, but Jesus is more of a duty than a delight.

567
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 The result is that following an influencer on Instagram gets more of our

568
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 attention and affection than following Jesus.

569
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 We expect his commands to submit to our feelings, so we do what feels right

570
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 instead of what he says is right.

571
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 And we defend our sin by just saying, hey, this is just what young adults do.

572
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 But I believe that God is raising up a generation that doesn't create a

573
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 category of believing in Jesus without following Jesus.

574
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 I believe that God is grabbing a hold of some hearts tonight that says, hey, I

575
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 don't want to just believe anymore, I want to follow.

576
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 And I would just say if it's true belief, it will always lead to following.

577
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 And so I'm not here to get you to question your salvation.

578
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:37,000
 I'm here for you to examine, do you really have true belief?

579
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 Is your belief in step with your life?

580
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 See, heaven isn't just full of a bunch of people who are scared of hell.

581
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 Heaven is full of people who fell in love with Jesus.

582
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:01,000
 Believing in Jesus is simply meant to be the beginning of following Jesus.

583
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 Point number three, lastly, found people, find people to follow Jesus.

584
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
 Found people, find people to follow Jesus.

585
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,000
 Look at what verse 40 says of John 1.

586
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,000
 One of the two who heard John speak and followed Jesus was Andrew,

587
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 Simon Peter's brother.

588
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 So what did Andrew do?

589
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 He went and found his brother and said to him, we have found the Messiah,

590
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 which means Christ, and he brought him to Jesus.

591
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 Found people, find people to follow Jesus.

592
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 Then Jesus finds Philip.

593
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
 Philip starts following Jesus.

594
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 And what does he do?

595
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
 Verse 45 through 46, Philip found Nathaniel and said to him,

596
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 we have found him of whom Moses and the law and the prophets wrote,

597
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.

598
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 Nathaniel said, can anything good come out of Nazareth?

599
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
 Philip said to him, come and see.

600
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 Do you see it?

601
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 After Andrew and Philip had been found by Jesus,

602
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 they go and find people to follow Jesus.

603
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
 Found people always.

604
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
 Find people.

605
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:08,000
 And so in this passage, there's four main ways that people become Christians.

606
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 So I just want to walk through this with you.

607
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 So for Andrew, it was a leader.

608
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
 It could have been a Bible study leader.

609
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 It could have been a coach.

610
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:22,000
 For Andrew, it was John the Baptist, the guy that was the forerunner to Christ.

611
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 He was the prereq to Christ.

612
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
 He was pointing people to Jesus.

613
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:31,000
 So for you, some of you, you came to know Christ because of a faithful leader in your life.

614
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
 Maybe it was a Bible study leader.

615
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
 Maybe it was the chaplain in your fraternity or your sorority.

616
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 You know, back ten years ago in college, remember that college?

617
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 For some of you, it was a faithful pastor that just proclaimed the gospel of Jesus Christ.

618
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
 Like it was a leader in your life.

619
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
 Maybe it was young life.

620
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
 Maybe it was FCA, Fellowship of Christian Athletes.

621
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:01,000
 And so what I want to do in this moment is if that's you, if you came to Christ because of a faithful leader,

622
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
 would you just stand to your feet for a minute?

623
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 Would you just stand?

624
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:09,000
 If you came to Christ because of a faithful leader, look at this.

625
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
 Like look at this room for a second.

626
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
 [Applause]

627
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:20,000
 Like the people, I see you in the balcony, the people who are standing came to Christ because of a faithful leader.

628
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
 You can be seated.

629
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
 That was Andrew's story.

630
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 For Simon, it was a family member.

631
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
 It was his brother Andrew.

632
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
 For some of you, that's your story.

633
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:37,000
 You grew up in a loving Christian home, a home that had committed parents that took you to church,

634
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:46,000
 that walked out their faith, that, hey, owned their mistakes, owned their sin when they made mistakes.

635
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:53,000
 And so for Simon, it was his brother Andrew that led him to Jesus.

636
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
 Maybe that's true for you.

637
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
 And so if that's true for you, would you just stand to your feet?

638
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:02,000
 I just want to see if you were led by -- led to Christ by a faithful family member.

639
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
 Wow, that is incredible.

640
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
 Wow.

641
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
 So stay standing for a second.

642
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
 Stay standing for a second.

643
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:18,000
 Sometimes Satan, the enemy, will want to shame you and say you don't have a story.

644
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:25,000
 You don't have a story like Josiah shared or up on stage where it was partying and drinking and, you know,

645
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
 multiple women and all these different things.

646
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
 And I don't say that to boast.

647
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
 I say that to make much of God and what he saved me from.

648
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
 And let me tell you, you have an amazing story.

649
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
 Why?

650
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
 Because I can't lead people like you can lead people.

651
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,000
 Maybe you have led people in the past or maybe you're like I don't really have a story to share.

652
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
 Yes, you do.

653
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:53,000
 You can share the story with people who didn't have your story so you can share with them how you fought against those temptations,

654
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:59,000
 how you stood the temptations of the enemy and the world and your flesh.

655
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:05,000
 Maybe that's your story because of faithful parents and family members that led you to Christ at a young age.

656
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
 You can be seated.

657
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
 That was Simon.

658
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:14,000
 For Philip, Jesus found him and called him to follow him.

659
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
 Maybe that's your story.

660
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,000
 Jesus met you in a tough moment in life.

661
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:26,000
 Maybe, you know, your story is a lot like mine where you just tried everything underneath the sun and you began to feel empty and unsatisfied and unfulfilled.

662
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:32,000
 And so as I got back from that baseball game and I just said, hey, I'm going to take this one off.

663
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
 I'm not going to the party.

664
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:41,000
 I looked at myself in the mirror as I've shared this story before and I just said, God, if you're real, will you reveal yourself to me because I'm a shell of a man.

665
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:46,000
 Everything on the outside looks good, but I'm dying on the inside.

666
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:54,000
 And God began to reveal himself that night and in the days to come that he was truly who he said he was.

667
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
 And he began to save me when I couldn't save myself.

668
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:06,000
 He began to extend the grace that I needed so that I wouldn't continue in the shame and the condemnation that the enemy kept putting in my face.

669
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
 And so maybe that's your story.

670
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:19,000
 Maybe you resonate with Philip and you had that moment where you were met by Jesus.

671
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
 If that's you, would you stand?

672
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,000
 Like you just came to the end of your rope.

673
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,000
 Look at this.

674
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,000
 This is your story.

675
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
 And your story is powerful.

676
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
 And your story is to be shared.

677
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
 You can be seated.

678
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,000
 And lastly, for Nathaniel, it was a friend.

679
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,000
 Philip cared enough to go run to his friend.

680
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:52,000
 It had to have been one of his best friends because he ran to Nathaniel and Nathaniel was a skeptic and he just said, can anything good come out of Nazareth?

681
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
 And look at Philip's response, come and see.

682
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
 And so maybe you're here tonight.

683
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:07,000
 Maybe you came to Christ because of the faithful friend that feared rejection but pushed against the rejection and said I'm just going to share.

684
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,000
 I'm just going to invite them to come to church or the porch on Tuesday night.

685
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:18,000
 And you heard the gospel through your friend and through their faithfulness to invite you to a place like this.

686
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
 If that's you, would you stand?

687
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
 If you came to Christ because of a faithful friend.

688
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:30,000
 [Applause]

689
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
 You can be seated.

690
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
 This is how God saved you.

691
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,000
 Now, how might God use you to save others?

692
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:45,000
 You know where to start, with your family, with your friends, with those of you, your leaders in your workplace.

693
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:56,000
 And there's people following you that you would be bold enough to, you know, not fear rejection but push against it and you would just invite people to come and see our great God.

694
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,000
 Or you would say, hey, can I just share with you how God changed my life?

695
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:08,000
 He took me out of this crazy place of sin and emptiness.

696
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
 And I've never been the same.

697
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:15,000
 Just think real quick, does anyone immediately come to mind?

698
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:20,000
 Can you envision the day when that person is passionately following Jesus?

699
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,000
 Maybe it's a family member, maybe it's a friend.

700
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
 Maybe it's someone you lead.

701
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
 Some people just need an invitation.

702
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:37,000
 I just want to encourage you when Andrew ran to tell his brother that he found the Messiah, he didn't push back against it.

703
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
 Simon Peter came.

704
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:46,000
 I can't imagine that in this city in Dallas that there's thousands of people that would come because of an invitation.

705
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:55,000
 All the cities that are watching, I can't imagine that there are people would come because of an invitation to come and see our great God.

706
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
 Resistance is okay.

707
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
 Skepticism is okay.

708
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
 Be encouraged by Nathaniel's story.

709
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:08,000
 Just like Nathaniel, don't be discouraged by people's initial response or, you know, resistance to skepticism.

710
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:13,000
 Someone might tell you no to coming to the porch, but it only takes one yes.

711
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
 Do you understand that?

712
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:21,000
 Like it only takes one yes for God to change the trajectory of someone's eternity.

713
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
 Would you push back?

714
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:29,000
 Would you push back on the rejection and the fear?

715
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:33,000
 I'll end with this story because I think it's one for you to know.

716
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,000
 And sometimes I hear a message like this, and it's like, does that really happen?

717
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
 Like that's what comes into my heart because I doubt it.

718
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:43,000
 I'm skeptic even when I hear, you know, people like me preaching the gospel.

719
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
 And it's like, yes, it happens.

720
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:50,000
 I was doing young adult ministry in Kansas City, and I came across this guy named Michael Pigman.

721
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:58,000
 And Michael, man, I saw him, and, man, I went and had a conversation with him, and he was the typical partyer.

722
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
 He was strung out on drugs.

723
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,000
 And, man, on the outside everything looked cleaned up.

724
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
 And he had been doing so many drugs.

725
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
 And I just said, hey, do you know there's hope beyond that?

726
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
 Do you truly find rest?

727
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
 Do you truly find satisfaction and fulfillment?

728
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
 And he said no.

729
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
 And I remember him saying, but I don't want your God.

730
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,000
 And I just kept pursuing him and inviting him and sharing with him the gospel.

731
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:29,000
 And three years after I initially talked to Michael, he came to our young adult gathering in Kansas City, and he gave his life to Christ.

732
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:35,000
 And three weeks ago I was in Kansas City, and he married a girl about two years ago.

733
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
 I did their wedding, and this is a picture of us.

734
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
 We're saying bye to them.

735
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
 I think it's coming.

736
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
 We're saying bye to them.

737
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
 This is Michael and Hannah.

738
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
 We're saying bye to them.

739
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
 Why?

740
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
 Because they're going to the mission field.

741
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,000
 They're going to the 1040 window where there's limited to no access of the gospel.

742
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:58,000
 This guy right here in the middle that's holding my son that used to be strung out on drugs five years ago gets married two years ago.

743
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:09,000
 Now he's surrendering his career, a very lucrative career at that, to go take the gospel to a place where they have little to no access of the name of Jesus.

744
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
 That's crazy, y'all.

745
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
 That's crazy.

746
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:19,000
 [Applause]

747
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
 What can you do to help other people follow Jesus?

748
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
 Let me give you six things quickly.

749
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:27,000
 Pray fervently for courage, boldness, and opportunities.

750
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,000
 Pray fervently for courage, boldness, and opportunities.

751
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:35,000
 Faithfully invite people to places where you know Jesus will be proclaimed.

752
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:39,000
 Give God credit for the work he is doing in your life.

753
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,000
 Ask good questions.

754
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
 Do you have a faith?

755
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
 This guy at Napa Auto Parts, a young adult, his name was Andrew.

756
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,000
 I'm like, hey, bro, you know you have a disciple of Jesus' name?

757
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
 He's like, I actually do.

758
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
 I said, do you have any -- do you know Jesus?

759
00:44:54,000 --> 00:45:04,000
 He's like, man, I don't know, but I've been going to bed every night wondering if I go to heaven or hell.

760
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:12,000
 It's like Jesus wanted me a battery to go out so I could talk to Andrew who has a disciple's name about Jesus.

761
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
 It's all over, y'all.

762
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
 And I just said, hey, do you have a faith?

763
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,000
 And he says, no, I grew up in the church, but I haven't gone back.

764
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:29,000
 And I got to share the gospel and I said, hey, any Tuesday night, 7 o'clock, come and see our great God.

765
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
 Ask good questions.

766
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:36,000
 Is there anything you need that I can ask God to help you with?

767
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:41,000
 Where do you find peace and hope in tough times?

768
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
 Number five, start an explorer group.

769
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:48,000
 Maybe some of you would gather some people in your workplace or in your apartment complex and just say, hey,

770
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,000
 would you like to examine the evidence of Christ and go through the book of John?

771
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,000
 We've been going through it on Tuesday night at this thing called the porch.

772
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,000
 And you'd read through the book of John and meet regularly to talk about it.

773
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,000
 Number six, live a surrendered life.

774
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:06,000
 There's a difference between living a moral life and a surrendered life.

775
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
 God isn't after your morality.

776
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,000
 That's what I thought for 21 years of my life, almost 22 years of my life.

777
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
 Like God was just after my behavior.

778
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
 No, he's after your belief.

779
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:22,000
 He's trying to give you a different perspective of what it looks like to live this life.

780
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:28,000
 When it comes to your relationships, when it comes to your sex life, when it comes to the way you spend,

781
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:34,000
 when it comes to the way you work, the way you commit to things, he's trying to give you a different way,

782
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,000
 a way that's going to lead to life and not death.

783
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
 He's after your heart.

784
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
 He's not after your behavior.

785
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,000
 Surrender your life to him.

786
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:49,000
 I read a story recently about a missionary who was killed by a jungle tribe of Indians in Ecuador

787
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:57,000
 when he sought to take the gospel to them, said this, "Father, make me a crisis man.

788
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:02,000
 Bring those I contact to decision.

789
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,000
 Bring those I contact to decision.

790
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:11,000
 Let me be a mile post, a single --" Excuse me, let me back up.

791
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:15,000
 That was just terrible.

792
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:19,000
 You're like, "Bro, spit it out."

793
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:23,000
 All right.

794
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
 "Father, make me a crisis man.

795
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:29,000
 Bring those I contact to decision.

796
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:33,000
 Let me not be a mile post on a single road.

797
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:39,000
 Make me a fork that men must turn one way or the other in facing Christ in me."

798
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
 You know what he's saying?

799
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:46,000
 Every person he comes in contact with, may I be a fork in the road for Christ.

800
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:50,000
 You want a purpose that goes beyond what you're doing today?

801
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,000
 Get on mission.

802
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,000
 Quit making everything about you.

803
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:01,000
 Get out there and fight against the -- I mean, I still have it, man.

804
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,000
 I get kind of anxious.

805
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
 And I sometimes cower down.

806
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
 And I'm just like, "God, I'm available.

807
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
 Wherever I'm walking to, God, I'm available.

808
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
 I want to be available for you."

809
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
 Sometimes I miss it.

810
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
 I strike out.

811
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:22,000
 But just you putting that in motion, "God, I'm available," is a step in the right direction for you to live a life on mission.

812
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:29,000
 And you never know who's going to respond.

813
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:34,000
 If you don't have a relationship with Jesus and you're more naturally skeptic, that's okay.

814
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:41,000
 More of a logical thinker and need some convincing, just know that Jesus isn't bothered by your questions.

815
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:45,000
 He wants to meet you right where you are tonight.

816
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
 He's not bothered by your questions.

817
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:54,000
 He wants to say, "Hey, come and see and examine the evidence.

818
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
 Ask your questions."

819
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
 But look at what Nathaniel did.

820
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:02,000
 Even in his skepticism, he went to the effort to see Jesus for himself.

821
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
 Would you do the same tonight?

822
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:09,000
 Would you grab a Bible at the Next Steps desk, the welcome desk out there in the town center when you leave here?

823
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
 Would you go to Great Questions?

824
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:16,000
 It's going to be right down this hallway, and you can ask whatever you want about faith, about culture, about life.

825
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,000
 And there's going to be some trusted leaders in that room.

826
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:26,000
 That's not going to claim to have it all together, but we'll try to answer your questions biblically and effectively.

827
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:30,000
 We welcome skepticism here.

828
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,000
 As I close, man, I got fired up tonight.

829
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
 Hope you know I love you.

830
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
 Hope you know I love you.

831
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,000
 There's two people I want to address in the room tonight.

832
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
 That's it.

833
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
 There's two people.

834
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:50,000
 The first one is those of you that are following Jesus.

835
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:58,000
 The call for you, like I've shared the last five or ten minutes, is a call to live a life on mission.

836
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
 I had you stand up for a reason.

837
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
 Why?

838
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:08,000
 Because you can be that friend that shared with you, and you begin to go share with friends that don't know Jesus.

839
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,000
 You can be that leader that shared with you.

840
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,000
 You can be that leader.

841
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:24,000
 You can be that family member, that faithful family member to go and share with other family members that reject Jesus or are just kind of lukewarm in their faith.

842
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
 You can be that person tonight.

843
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
 You can.

844
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:33,000
 That's the call of God for every single one of us that are following Jesus.

845
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:44,000
 And then the other person I want to address in the room tonight is you know under the sound of God's voice tonight, not my voice, but the sound of God's voice, you know that you're not following Jesus.

846
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,000
 And I'll illustrate it like this.

847
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:53,000
 About four years ago, a little over four years ago, my family moved tonight from Kansas City to Dallas.

848
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,000
 And it was a hard transition, y'all.

849
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,000
 Like we moved four times in the first year, couldn't find a house.

850
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
 Ended up living with my in-laws.

851
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:06,000
 We got pregnant with our third child.

852
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
 And then on top of that, COVID hit.

853
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:13,000
 I was driving 100 miles to work and back, living in Fort Worth.

854
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,000
 And I almost lost my life, seriously.

855
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
 What do I mean by that?

856
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:24,000
 I was leaving the porch one night, and I got in my car, and I started feeling drowsy, you know, like getting tired, right?

857
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
 And what do you do in that moment?

858
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:32,000
 You turn the radio on, you roll the windows down, and you're like, oh, fresh air, it's going to wake me up, you know.

859
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
 And it does for about ten minutes.

860
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
 And then what happens?

861
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:40,000
 You start kind of getting drowsy again, and then you're just slapping your face, right?

862
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
 You ever done that?

863
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
 Just me?

864
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
 I'm literally slapping my face to stay awake.

865
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:52,000
 And I get to downtown Fort Worth, downtown Fort Worth, and I feel myself doze off.

866
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:59,000
 And my car is headed to the guardrail because I wake up because I hit the rumble strips.

867
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:04,000
 And as I wake up, I'm still kind of groggy and not all with it.

868
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:10,000
 And then all of a sudden I hit this pothole, and it blows out the left side of my tires.

869
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:19,000
 And by God's grace, I'm glad that pothole was there, I get over into the shoulder right before I hit the guardrail.

870
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:24,000
 And I call my wife, Kathy, and I just said, hey, you're not going to believe this, I almost crashed.

871
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:30,000
 And if I would have hit that guardrail head on, I think I would be dead.

872
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:35,000
 And so I called the tow truck, she comes and picks me up.

873
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
 And listen, don't miss it.

874
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,000
 If you're not following Jesus, don't miss it. Here's the transition.

875
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:45,000
 I share that with you tonight because some of you are going through this thing called life,

876
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:49,000
 and you're falling asleep at the wheel, and the wheel is life.

877
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:58,000
 And you're drowsy, and you're not with it altogether, and your vision is being blurred by all the things of the world that's being thrown at you.

878
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:03,000
 And listen, you're on the way, headed to destruction.

879
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:09,000
 And God has allowed you to hear this message tonight to be a fork in the road and said, hey, if you keep going down that road,

880
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:14,000
 if you keep going down that path, the Bible says that there's a way that seems right to man, and that way ends in death.

881
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:28,000
 And you're driving the wheel of life, and you're drowsy, and you're about to crash and burn.

882
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:35,000
 And God is allowing you in his sovereignty and in his grace to be a fork for you tonight.

883
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:40,000
 And he's asking you to bend the knee, to surrender your life to him.

884
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:47,000
 And he is saying, hey, I'm here. I'm here. Come and follow me.

885
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:54,000
 Everything you've done, the past, the present, everything you're going to do in the future, I can wipe clean.

886
00:53:54,000 --> 00:54:00,000
 I can forgive, not because of who you are, but because of what my son Jesus did on the cross when he hung on that tree.

887
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:07,000
 And he died, and all of our sin was poured out on him, and he soaked up every last ounce of God's wrath, the wrath that should be poured out on you and me.

888
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:14,000
 And not only that, Scripture says in History Accords, on the third day, he bursted forth from the grave to defeat sin and death.

889
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:19,000
 And now the ball is in your court. What are you going to do with Jesus?

890
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:24,000
 And he's saying, wake up.

891
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:28,000
 He's inviting you into a relationship with him.

892
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:34,000
 And my prayer for you tonight is that you would step into that relationship.

893
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:38,000
 Let me pray that you would tonight.

894
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:42,000
 With every head bowed and every eye closed,

895
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:49,000
 if you haven't seen Jesus tonight, or in the past, my encouragement is that you'd sit with him.

896
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:54,000
 Maybe you would go to Great Questions or come down front.

897
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:58,000
 If you have seen Jesus for the first time tonight, would you entrust yourself to him?

898
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:02,000
 Would you put all your faith and trust in him? Ask him to forgive you of your sins.

899
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:06,000
 If you've entrusted yourself to him, would you follow him?

900
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:13,000
 Would you read about his life in the Gospels and ask the Spirit of God who's living inside of you to make your life more like his?

901
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:17,000
 And if you're following him, would you invite others to do the same?

902
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:21,000
 Found people, see Jesus.

903
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
 Found people, follow Jesus.

904
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:29,000
 And found people, find people to follow Jesus.

905
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:33,000
 God in heaven, would that be our cry tonight?

906
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:38,000
 Would you do your greatest work tonight, Lord, for your glory, our joy, and the world's good.

907
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:42,000
 In Christ's name we pray. Amen. Let's worship.
