 Wish that I could dance alone.

 [APPLAUSE]

8
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,140
 Porch, how we doing tonight?

9
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,340
 Let me hear from you.

10
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,340
 Man, so glad you are here.

11
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:50,240
 Man, I hope you know we never take for granted an evening

12
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,940
 where we get to gather together, not only here

13
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:55,260
 in the city of Dallas, but all across the nation

14
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,380
 in our Porch Life location.

15
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:58,500
 So thanks for trusting us with your time,

16
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,300
 joining us here tonight.

17
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:04,380
 Special shout out to Porch Life Boise, Porch Life Scottsdale.

18
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:05,300
 Love you guys.

19
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,940
 Thanks for being a part of what God is doing here,

20
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:10,620
 as well as there, as well as all of our other Porch Life

21
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:11,740
 locations.

22
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:14,620
 Hey, just a few years ago, I decided

23
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:15,900
 to take up a new pastime.

24
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,100
 I decided to take up the game of golf.

25
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,240
 Show of hands, anybody taking up the game of golf as of recent?

26
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,660
 It's sweeping the nation.

27
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:23,340
 Yeah, I don't really understand why.

28
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,620
 A few years ago, it was COVID.

29
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:28,340
 And so I knew I needed to find some way

30
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:31,920
 to pass the time in my own personal isolation.

31
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,260
 And so I thought this would be a great use of it.

32
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:38,940
 And so I set off to learn what is a really difficult sport.

33
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:41,380
 If you've never played it, what you need to know

34
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:44,500
 is this is anything but an easy game.

35
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,620
 Like we've all played mini golf.

36
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:49,260
 It's hard.

37
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:52,500
 That's a microcosm of how much more difficult

38
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,820
 the game of golf actually is.

39
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:57,500
 And yet I thought, sure, you know what?

40
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,700
 I'm willing to take this challenge on.

41
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,920
 Like I'll forge my own path to greater golf glory,

42
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,540
 even if it means I have to do so by myself.

43
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:07,300
 And so I set out to do it.

44
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,920
 I decided that I was going to teach myself

45
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,620
 because here's the thing, the game is extremely difficult.

46
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:15,980
 What you need to know is it requires you to refine

47
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,380
 a very specific skillset over the course

48
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,780
 of a really long time.

49
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:20,620
 That's the point.

50
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:23,100
 And you should do so with the help of instruction.

51
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:26,100
 But because it was COVID and everybody's social distancing,

52
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,180
 there was no instruction for me to be able to find.

53
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,020
 I couldn't do it.

54
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,820
 So I had to do it all by myself.

55
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,020
 So how did I do it?

56
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:36,320
 How did I make my way through the game of golf?

57
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,240
 I did it like this.

58
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,660
 I would go and I would play.

59
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:42,980
 I would identify what was broken in my game,

60
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,520
 which was a lot.

61
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,520
 And then I would come back home

62
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,680
 and I would type into YouTube whatever my issue was.

63
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,280
 I would listen to a variety of online coaches

64
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,800
 tell me their proposed solution.

65
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,400
 And then I would get back out there and I'd try it again.

66
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,640
 And I would rinse and repeat the process

67
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,060
 over and over and over again.

68
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,920
 What do you think happened to my game?

69
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:12,440
 It didn't get any better,

70
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,420
 but I got a lot busier, I'll tell you.

71
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:18,040
 You know, I had plenty of different proposals

72
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,200
 to get out there and try.

73
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,160
 Different of many different options

74
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,780
 that had been offered to me that I should go out

75
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:27,000
 and I should try to apply to improve my game.

76
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,220
 But I was not improving.

77
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:31,040
 I was only getting worse.

78
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,580
 And so my in-laws intervened.

79
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,340
 They decided after having watched me struggle

80
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:39,820
 for a couple of years time that at last it made sense

81
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,940
 for me to go and see a golf instructor,

82
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:44,380
 a certified golf coach.

83
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:46,840
 And so they bought me as a gift,

84
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:51,220
 a 30 minute private lesson, which I'll be honest.

85
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:54,840
 I received, it was extremely kind of them,

86
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,660
 but it felt like too little too late.

87
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,820
 You know, I mean, it's 30 minute lesson.

88
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:04,620
 I, by this point have consumed hundreds of hours of videos.

89
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,740
 I have listened to dozens of online coaches

90
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:11,940
 and I have spent plenty of money playing this game.

91
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:14,100
 What is a 30 minute lesson

92
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,420
 and your special certified golf instructor

93
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,580
 going to tell me that I don't already know?

94
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:23,020
 But hey, what I had to lose, you know,

95
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,220
 I wasn't getting any better.

96
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,100
 So I decided to take the lesson.

97
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,100
 I made my way out to the course.

98
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,220
 I met the instructor.

99
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:32,380
 I hit a couple of balls for the guy

100
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:35,100
 where immediately he stops the practice.

101
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,580
 He pulls me over to the side.

102
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:39,580
 He looks right into my eyes and he goes,

103
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,020
 "There are a couple of things you need to know

104
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:41,860
 about this game.

105
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:48,020
 Number one, it's much easier than people think.

106
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:52,820
 Number two, you are making it much harder

107
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:53,860
 than it needs to be.

108
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,740
 Forget everything you've learned

109
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:01,620
 and listen to my voice alone."

110
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:04,060
 And so I did.

111
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:07,540
 I continued through the practice.

112
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,020
 He showed me a variety of different things

113
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,820
 and by way of applying myself,

114
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:15,860
 not to all of these different competing voices,

115
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:18,600
 but merely listening to the one voice

116
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,460
 that actually knew what it looked like to grow.

117
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,160
 You know what happened to my game?

118
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,860
 It did.

119
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:26,780
 It got better.

120
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:30,860
 It's not great, but it did get better.

121
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,940
 (congregation applauding)

122
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,900
 Why do I tell you that?

123
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,900
 Because as we journey through life

124
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,260
 and we mature along the way,

125
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:40,980
 there are so many competing voices telling us

126
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,220
 how we should do it.

127
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,060
 Like how we should progress as a human being,

128
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,060
 how we should advance as individuals.

129
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:48,860
 So many so-called experts all propositioning us

130
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,340
 to follow their philosophy,

131
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:54,180
 to trust their teaching, to endorse their ideology,

132
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,460
 they're trying to get us to follow them

133
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,800
 because they know the way for us to grow.

134
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,500
 They know what it looks like for us to get better.

135
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,640
 They know what it looks like for us

136
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,740
 to achieve all of our hopes and dreams here in this life.

137
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:08,060
 And yet, as we listen to all of these different voices

138
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,140
 and as we put into practice

139
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:11,900
 all of these different proposals, what happens?

140
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,420
 Life doesn't get better.

141
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:18,560
 It just gets busier.

142
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,260
 That's what happens.

143
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,100
 Why?

144
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,860
 Why is that the case?

145
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:27,100
 Because many may promise a fuller experience in this life,

146
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:30,860
 but only one whose name is Jesus Christ

147
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:34,500
 can actually deliver on that promise.

148
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,540
 Many different voices may propose to you,

149
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:40,100
 hey, this is the way to fuller life.

150
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:45,020
 This is the way to grow here in your time on earth.

151
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:48,420
 But only one can actually deliver on that promise.

152
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:51,120
 That's what the book of Colossians is all about.

153
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:54,500
 So if you have a Bible, you can turn there with me.

154
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:59,220
 Last week, we introduced that over the course

155
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,980
 of the next several weeks,

156
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,380
 we are going to be journeying

157
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,480
 through the book of Colossians together.

158
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,340
 And so we're gonna take it from the very beginning

159
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,380
 to the very end.

160
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:11,860
 We're gonna go line by line, page by page,

161
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,820
 and we're gonna journey and understand

162
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:16,700
 what is the apostle Paul who authored this letter?

163
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,300
 What is he writing about?

164
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,180
 What is his point and his purpose

165
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:23,860
 in pinning this little letter to this group of believers

166
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,740
 in a city known as Colossae?

167
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:26,780
 What was his point?

168
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:30,620
 So let's set it up with some context.

169
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,220
 What you need to know is that he was writing

170
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,940
 to a group of young believers in a city called Colossae.

171
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:37,020
 Colossae wasn't an especially large city

172
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,740
 at the time that Paul was writing to it,

173
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:41,740
 but what it was, was especially diverse.

174
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,340
 It was diverse ethnically.

175
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:45,540
 There were Phrygians as well as Greeks

176
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:47,660
 and some Jews living there within the city.

177
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:51,100
 And it was also ethnic, it was also diverse philosophically,

178
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,460
 which actually raises the issue

179
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:53,580
 that Paul is going to address,

180
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,460
 which I'll unpack for you in a minute.

181
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,480
 But what you see is that he's writing

182
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,500
 to a group of young Christians, young believers,

183
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,980
 that have placed their faith in Jesus Christ,

184
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:07,980
 that have made the ultimate decision to go all in with God.

185
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:10,380
 And yet now they're appropriately at a place

186
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,620
 that many of you may find yourself sitting in.

187
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:13,700
 What's next?

188
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:14,860
 Like, how do I get better?

189
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,820
 What does it look like for me to advance as an individual,

190
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,340
 to progress through this life,

191
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,940
 for me to achieve all the fullness of God,

192
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:23,300
 all the fullness that God is offering me

193
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,740
 while I'm here on this earth?

194
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,140
 How do I do it?

195
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,460
 What steps do I take from here?

196
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,780
 This is the question these believers are asking,

197
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,300
 and you may be asking yourself.

198
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,780
 And to these believers,

199
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:38,380
 this backdrop of Colossae,

200
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:42,020
 a city diverse in philosophy and ideology

201
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:44,980
 and riddled with so much different tradition

202
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:49,740
 begins to permeate the walls of their community

203
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:53,800
 and tell them what it looks like to grow

204
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,120
 in greater spirituality.

205
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:00,580
 Many competing voices begin to tell them what to do.

206
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:05,780
 And what you find is an immense amount of confusion.

207
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:09,020
 Like, they find that they actually don't know

208
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:11,980
 how to make sense of what is true and what is not.

209
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:14,780
 And so Paul, who's in prison, he gets word of this.

210
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,220
 He learns that this is the case

211
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,580
 for this young group of believers.

212
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,260
 And so he writes this letter to them

213
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:23,380
 to clarify for them very specifically with one voice

214
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,400
 what they need to know,

215
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,180
 what it looks like to grow in Christ like this,

216
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:29,940
 what it looks like to mature and move forward in life.

217
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,620
 And so what he says,

218
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:36,320
 and the main idea of this entire letter

219
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:41,320
 is that if you want maturity in life,

220
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,740
 you need clarity of Christ.

221
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:44,900
 That's Paul's point.

222
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:47,140
 That's what this entire letter is about.

223
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:50,040
 If you want maturity in life, you need clarity of Christ.

224
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,940
 You don't need spiritual mysticism and special knowledge

225
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:55,820
 and some path to a superior existence

226
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,380
 or some new moral ethic.

227
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:59,140
 You don't need any of this other stuff

228
00:09:59,140 --> 00:09:59,980
 that people are telling you.

229
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:03,140
 What you need is you need greater clarity of him.

230
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:06,400
 Because if you see more of him, you'll see more of yourself.

231
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,960
 We just walked through a series called Essential

232
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,340
 where we unpacked what?

233
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:13,860
 The one thing that God wants most for you,

234
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,700
 which is to see him.

235
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,420
 And the reason we're studying Colossians

236
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:19,540
 is because this is the natural next step.

237
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:22,740
 Now that you see him, what then happens?

238
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,140
 What then takes place?

239
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:28,300
 Your clarity of him produces a maturity in you.

240
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:32,140
 This is why as Paul writes the book of Colossians,

241
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:33,780
 he presents what is quite possibly

242
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:38,420
 the Bible's highest Christology in all the scripture.

243
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:43,060
 He paints a picture of Jesus with an unbridled beauty

244
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,560
 and out of this world beauty,

245
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,660
 because he wants them and he wants you to know

246
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,460
 there's no one like him.

247
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:53,940
 There's plenty and all the more to find within him.

248
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,600
 You just need to see him clearly.

249
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,580
 And in so doing, you'll see yourself.

250
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:00,460
 That's what he's going to unpack for us.

251
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:05,460
 He wants to write to a group of young, eager Christians

252
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:08,740
 amidst a chaotic and confusing day,

253
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:11,180
 the truth that they need to know,

254
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:16,180
 which is that God in the person of Jesus really is above all.

255
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:20,620
 Which is why I'm so excited for us to read it together,

256
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,960
 because our room looks a lot like the church in Colossae.

257
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,200
 Like we're a group of young people

258
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,300
 gathered into one space at one time

259
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,860
 amidst a chaotic and confusing day,

260
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:33,060
 amidst a city that is culturally diverse

261
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:36,300
 with a variety of philosophy swirling about,

262
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,240
 wanting and aspiring to grow.

263
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:44,660
 This letter, it's written for you.

264
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,060
 It's written for me.

265
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,700
 And so we're going to take our time through it.

266
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:48,980
 Like we're going to walk through this thing

267
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,060
 from beginning to end.

268
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:53,780
 And so what we're going to do is start at the very beginning.

269
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,500
 We're going to pick it up in chapter one.

270
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,600
 So if you have a Bible, chapter one, starting in verse one,

271
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,260
 we're going to start where Paul starts.

272
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,500
 Where does Paul start?

273
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,980
 He starts with some encouragement.

274
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:04,980
 That's what he does.

275
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:08,620
 It says, "Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus

276
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:11,380
 by the will of God and Timothy, our brother,

277
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:14,220
 to the saints and the faithful brothers in Christ at Colossae

278
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:17,360
 grace to you and peace from God our father.

279
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,280
 We always thank God, the father of our Lord Jesus Christ,

280
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,620
 when we pray for you,

281
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:24,140
 since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus

282
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:26,520
 and of the love that you have for all the saints

283
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,620
 because of the hope laid up for you in heaven."

284
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:31,220
 You see, Paul, before he unpacks

285
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:33,100
 where these believers need to grow in Christ,

286
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:33,940
 and he's going to do it.

287
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,820
 Like there's plenty of room for them to grow.

288
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,380
 There's plenty of ground for them to take

289
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,920
 before he moves into any of that,

290
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,500
 any area of opportunity for growth.

291
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,580
 He wants to celebrate the ways

292
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,060
 that God has already grown them.

293
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:45,900
 That's what he does.

294
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,820
 That's why he starts with encouragement.

295
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:51,300
 The porch thing, we do this every single Wednesday.

296
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,660
 Tomorrow, we're going to meet

297
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:55,280
 and we're going to talk about what happened tonight.

298
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,420
 But here's what we do.

299
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,780
 At the very beginning of that meeting,

300
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:00,860
 before we talk about the work that is ahead,

301
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:05,420
 we celebrate the work that is behind.

302
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,940
 We tell God's stories to one another.

303
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:10,800
 Stories where we saw Jesus move amongst us

304
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,160
 here this evening.

305
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,860
 Stories where we saw the very clear hand of God

306
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,460
 on the lives of people or upon our team,

307
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:20,860
 because we want gratitude to be the platform

308
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:23,200
 from which we plan the next week.

309
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,500
 You see, we don't want to work for gratitude.

310
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,100
 We want to work from gratitude.

311
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,740
 Paul's doing the exact same thing.

312
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:32,900
 He's saying, "Hey, before we talk about all the areas

313
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,860
 you need to grow, let's just acknowledge

314
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:37,420
 God's already grown you so much.

315
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,900
 Like he's already done such a good work in you.

316
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,620
 Let me tell you why, that's where we're going."

317
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,540
 But what he wants them to see is, man,

318
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,700
 it's not by way of your personal application

319
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,700
 that you're going to be able to pull yourself up

320
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,100
 by your bootstraps and move forward into greater godliness.

321
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:49,940
 That's not the case.

322
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:52,100
 No, God has not called you to be successful.

323
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,980
 He's called you to be faithful.

324
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:55,260
 That's it.

325
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,620
 He's the one that moves the needle, not you.

326
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,900
 He's the one that makes the difference, not you.

327
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:03,460
 He's the one that leads you forward, not you.

328
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:07,860
 He is the one that powers the engine of your life

329
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:11,380
 and leads you into greater growth, not you.

330
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:16,900
 So we've got to celebrate what he's already done.

331
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,060
 We need to be encouraged by the fact

332
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:21,200
 that God is already at work.

333
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,560
 And so what Paul says is he says,

334
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:27,540
 "Hey, I've heard of some things about you

335
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:29,540
 that are deeply encouraging.

336
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:30,740
 You have a good reputation."

337
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:33,940
 And it's reached my ears all the way over in prison.

338
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:38,440
 Which actually begs the question,

339
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,640
 how had Paul heard of all of this?

340
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:44,040
 Like, sure, they were in a different city,

341
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,460
 separate from Paul,

342
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:47,740
 and yet he's heard about their behavior.

343
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,940
 What does that mean?

344
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:53,380
 It means that people didn't just notice what they did,

345
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:56,140
 they discussed what they did, right?

346
00:14:56,140 --> 00:15:00,360
 So why do we talk about the things that we notice?

347
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,000
 Why do we talk about those things which we see

348
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,120
 that we think other people need to know as well?

349
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,340
 That she's so pretty,

350
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,000
 or man, that guy is the nicest guy ever,

351
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,080
 or that meal was amazing.

352
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,860
 Why do we do that?

353
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:14,120
 Because it's not enough that I know

354
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,740
 other people need to know.

355
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,420
 That's what I'm going to tell them.

356
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,720
 They have a reputation.

357
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,240
 That's not just, it's not sufficient enough

358
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,920
 for people to be like, man, they're really awesome.

359
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,720
 No, everybody needs to know

360
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,600
 that these guys are really great.

361
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,640
 God has done a good work.

362
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,880
 And so Paul's saying, hey, I've heard word.

363
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,200
 I've got wind of your good reputation.

364
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,840
 So what about their good reputation has Paul heard?

365
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,840
 What can we learn from their example?

366
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,980
 Well, there's going to be three things.

367
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:44,240
 But the first thing we see is that Paul heard of their faith.

368
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,200
 That's the very first thing.

369
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,600
 That's what it says in verse three.

370
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,780
 We always thank God when we pray for you,

371
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:52,420
 since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus.

372
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:54,420
 Which begs the question,

373
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,580
 what's so impressive about their faith?

374
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:59,420
 Like Paul was always thanking God when he prayed for them.

375
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:02,500
 He was always thanking God when he prayed for them.

376
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:06,380
 Why did he have to always thank God when he prayed?

377
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:08,540
 Why couldn't he have just thanked God when he prayed?

378
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,420
 Why always?

379
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,040
 If you read the Greek, when he prayed,

380
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,380
 that was continually happening.

381
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:15,620
 So every time he prayed, he was continually thanking God.

382
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:19,420
 Why does he add the double emphasis of always doing it?

383
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:22,180
 He's literally saying, I always thank God when I pray.

384
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:26,260
 I continually thank God when I continually pray for you.

385
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:28,380
 Why are you overreacting, Paul?

386
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:30,000
 This feels absurd.

387
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,380
 Like these guys, sure, they've got some faith,

388
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:34,620
 but why is it something to write home about?

389
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:35,460
 Like, why is it the,

390
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:37,020
 why is the fact that they've placed their faith

391
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:37,860
 in Jesus Christ?

392
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,620
 They've trusted in him for the forgiveness of their sins.

393
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,540
 Why is that so notable?

394
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,860
 Well, the answer to that question

395
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:45,300
 lies in our understanding of what faith is.

396
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,260
 Because the Bible has a very clear definition

397
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:49,500
 of what faith actually is.

398
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,680
 And here's the thing.

399
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,780
 So if you're not listening,

400
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:53,300
 you're gonna wanna lean in on this.

401
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:56,880
 I think it's different than what most of us would assume.

402
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:01,740
 How would you define faith?

403
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:04,340
 Like if I walked around the room right now

404
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:06,820
 and we passed a microphone by, what would you say?

405
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,340
 What would you say is true of faith?

406
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:09,780
 What would you define it as?

407
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:13,220
 We're not gonna do that, but I've done this before.

408
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:15,620
 And always what I get, it's a wide range of answers,

409
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:18,100
 but always what I hear from people is it's,

410
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,380
 it's what you believe.

411
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,620
 That's what faith is.

412
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:21,440
 It's what you believe.

413
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,060
 It's what you believe about God.

414
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,540
 It's your religious persuasion.

415
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:27,780
 It's your personal conception of spiritual realities,

416
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:31,840
 which isn't inherently wrong, but isn't exactly right.

417
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:36,840
 You see, what we need to know is that faith,

418
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,780
 as the Bible defines it,

419
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:42,840
 is so much more than just what you think about God.

420
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:46,240
 It's bigger than your mental activity.

421
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,460
 Hebrews 11, one would tell us,

422
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:53,980
 now faith is the reality of what is hoped for.

423
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:57,080
 It's the proof of what is not seen.

424
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:00,720
 This is probably the single clearest definition

425
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,400
 in all the Bible of what faith actually is.

426
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,480
 And if you read this verse across different translations,

427
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,120
 there's different words thrown in there,

428
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,640
 but that translation, the CSB,

429
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,320
 is the closest translation

430
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,080
 to what the Greek is actually saying.

431
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,620
 It's saying that faith, it's a reality.

432
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,940
 Like it has objectivity to it.

433
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,900
 There's proof behind it.

434
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:25,860
 There's an evidential element to faith.

435
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:28,500
 It's not just what do you think about God?

436
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,180
 What do you believe about God?

437
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,700
 What do you know about God?

438
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:34,260
 It's so much bigger than that,

439
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,940
 which defies our normal expectation.

440
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:38,420
 Because how do we walk around and asking people

441
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:40,380
 what their spiritual persuasion is?

442
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,300
 What do we say?

443
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:45,860
 We don't say, "Hey, what religion do you ascribe to?"

444
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:46,700
 We don't say that.

445
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,140
 We say, "Hey, tell me about your faith background."

446
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:48,980
 And what do we expect?

447
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:51,660
 For people to unpack for us a mental checklist

448
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,460
 of the things they believe, right?

449
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:56,180
 Faith is way bigger.

450
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:59,180
 Faith is not just a mentality we adopt.

451
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,740
 It's a reality we experience.

452
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:05,620
 Faith is not just a mentality we adopt.

453
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:09,200
 It's a reality we experience,

454
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,480
 which I think is so important for us.

455
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,180
 This is a current passion point of mine.

456
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:16,540
 I learned this a few years ago and it blew my mind.

457
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,660
 And I believe it still to this day.

458
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:23,660
 So many of us, we treat God like an idea to learn,

459
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:26,740
 a concept to study.

460
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:29,320
 But he's the character of the story.

461
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:32,460
 Like God is not just distant, dormant, far off God.

462
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,860
 No, he's right here right now.

463
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,500
 Like he's in the room with you.

464
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,900
 Like we don't just talk about, "Man, I believe in God."

465
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,820
 No, you walk with God.

466
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:45,180
 He's a person that wants intimate relationship with you.

467
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:47,300
 He doesn't just want you to be intellectually acquainted

468
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,140
 with him.

469
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:50,220
 He wants you to be intimately acquainted with him.

470
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:52,060
 He wants you to know him.

471
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,540
 It's funny.

472
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:55,260
 I understand what people say when they're like,

473
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:58,060
 "Man, I just am studying the character and nature of God."

474
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:00,740
 I don't study the character and nature of my wife.

475
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:04,300
 Like that's not how I talk about her.

476
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,620
 That's not how I treat her.

477
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:07,580
 Why? Because she's real.

478
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:11,280
 Now I care deeply about her character.

479
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,960
 I care deeply about her nature.

480
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,520
 But how do I learn those things?

481
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,800
 By walking with her and talking to her and listening to her

482
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,300
 and spending time together.

483
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,360
 That's how I learn about my wife

484
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,120
 because she's a real person.

485
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,320
 God is the same.

486
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,560
 He's not just one we study.

487
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:33,080
 He's one we enjoy.

488
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:37,360
 This is what faith is unpacking for us.

489
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,820
 You see, what Paul is trying to present

490
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:45,320
 is that Jesus has this mind-blowing beauty.

491
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,000
 Like what the book of Colossians is gonna say

492
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,440
 is that Jesus is overwhelmingly supreme

493
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,520
 and he's inexhaustibly sufficient.

494
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,680
 You'll find no higher authority

495
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:58,520
 and you'll find no more perfect sustainer,

496
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,560
 provider for your life.

497
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,060
 You need to look nowhere else.

498
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:04,960
 And yet, if we just hear that

499
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,880
 and take it as a nugget of insight,

500
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,560
 some new knowledge to learn,

501
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:14,300
 and it does not impact our life,

502
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,740
 if all it does is inform our mind

503
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:17,420
 but doesn't inflame our heart,

504
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:21,200
 then this entire series will be a waste.

505
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,360
 That's why we're spending so much time on this

506
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,980
 because I need you to get this.

507
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:30,980
 I need you to know that he's real

508
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:34,100
 and he's personal and he wants you.

509
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,780
 So when Brooke and I first started dating,

510
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:39,240
 I knew all the right things that I was supposed to say,

511
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,960
 all the right things that I was supposed to do.

512
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,380
 I know what it looked like to be a good Christian guy

513
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,680
 dating a good Christian girl.

514
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,480
 Like I knew that clarity was really important.

515
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,880
 I knew that I should ask her out on dates

516
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,560
 and not just to hang out, you know?

517
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,780
 I knew that purity should be a high priority for us,

518
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:55,960
 that I should make sure

519
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,880
 we had mutually agreed upon boundaries,

520
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,640
 we'd established parameters

521
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,240
 to protect us from any sort of temptation.

522
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:04,040
 I knew it was important that I continually pursued her,

523
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,120
 that I couldn't just settle for quantity of time,

524
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:09,260
 but I really needed to fight for quality of time with her.

525
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:12,400
 I knew how a Christian guy was supposed to conduct himself.

526
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,980
 I had great vision

527
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:16,180
 and really good intentions for our relationship.

528
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:19,160
 But if you ask Brooke, but she's sitting down here,

529
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,120
 she can agree if this is actually true.

530
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,720
 If you asked her for a report

531
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:29,920
 on the quality of my leadership during our dating history,

532
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,800
 I'd have anything but straight A's.

533
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,680
 You see, I knew all the facts of what to do,

534
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:42,840
 but I didn't live in light of the truth of them.

535
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:47,780
 Like I had a great dating mentality,

536
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:49,620
 but a really poor dating reality.

537
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:53,400
 I wonder how many of us could say

538
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,960
 the same is true for us tonight, just with respect to faith.

539
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,840
 That our faith mentality, man, it's really good.

540
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,880
 Like I could sit down and I could chop it up

541
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,320
 with the best of them at the coffee shop.

542
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,520
 I can let them know what I learned in my podcast.

543
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,440
 I can talk to them about what I studied this week.

544
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,560
 And yet though my faith mentality may be so strong,

545
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:17,560
 my faith reality, it actually could not be any weaker.

546
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:26,320
 You see, for many of us, we have the best of intentions.

547
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,600
 We know all the right things to do,

548
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,040
 but like me and dating, there's a lack of action.

549
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:35,320
 What you need to know is that faithful believers,

550
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:40,320
 faithful believers are never without faithful behavior.

551
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:45,720
 Faithful believers are never without faithful behavior.

552
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,880
 The way Jesus unpacks this is he says,

553
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,880
 "You will know a tree by its fruit."

554
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,840
 You'll know it.

555
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,560
 That's why he curses the barren fig tree.

556
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,440
 It has all the markings of life,

557
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,080
 and yet there's no fruit on it.

558
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,760
 And he says, "That's not real.

559
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,720
 "That's not genuine."

560
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:04,440
 Faithful believers are never without faithful behavior.

561
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:07,040
 We must live, act, speak, move,

562
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,440
 stand in light of what we know.

563
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,560
 You think about it like this.

564
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:16,120
 Jesus never once asked anyone, "Hey, what is your faith?"

565
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,040
 Never.

566
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,200
 What did he repeatedly ask?

567
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:24,120
 Where is your faith?

568
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:27,320
 That's what he was searching for

569
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:30,400
 because faith isn't just intellectual, it's experiential.

570
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,720
 It doesn't just change our thinking,

571
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,040
 it changes our living.

572
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:37,760
 All throughout the gospels, Jesus responds to the faith,

573
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:42,400
 not that he hears about, that he sees and he knows about.

574
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,700
 Mark 2, three through five says,

575
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,000
 "And they came bringing to him

576
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,560
 "a paralytic carried by four men.

577
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,860
 "And when they could not get near him

578
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:50,040
 "because of the crowd, they removed the roof above him.

579
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,200
 "And when they had made an opening,

580
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,040
 "they let down the bed on which the paralytic lay.

581
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,620
 "And when Jesus saw their faith,

582
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,040
 "he said to the paralytic, 'Son, your sins are forgiven.'"

583
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,800
 Their faith was observable.

584
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,800
 Matthew 8, 10, "When Jesus heard this,

585
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,440
 "he marveled and said to those who followed him,

586
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:09,300
 "Truly I tell you, with no one else in all of Israel

587
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,800
 "have I found such faith."

588
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,900
 It was observable.

589
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,360
 Mark 5, 32 through 34,

590
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,100
 "And he looked around to see who had done it,

591
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,680
 "who had touched him in this story.

592
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,580
 "But the woman, knowing what had happened to her,

593
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,300
 "that she had been healed of her infirmity,

594
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:23,440
 "she came in fear, trembling, and fell down before him

595
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,600
 "and told him the whole truth.

596
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:29,040
 "And he said to her, 'Daughter, your faith,

597
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:33,920
 "which is observable, has made you well.

598
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,220
 "Go in peace and be healed of your diseases.'"

599
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:39,760
 You see, these people,

600
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:43,760
 they did not engage the world by way of what they saw.

601
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:49,000
 They engaged the world by way of how it should be seen.

602
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,520
 We must do the same.

603
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:55,120
 This is what it looks like to be genuinely faithful

604
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,520
 as we walk with God.

605
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:59,680
 Like these people, their lives were not dictated

606
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,440
 by the circumstances of this world.

607
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,840
 Like bleeding discharge for 15 years,

608
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:08,980
 born crippled, overwhelming disease,

609
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,240
 their lives were not dictated

610
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,900
 by the circumstances of this world.

611
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:15,160
 Their lives were dictated by the evidences of another world

612
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:18,280
 that God had broken into the story,

613
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:21,280
 that God from on high had become Jesus here down low,

614
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:25,400
 and he was engaging with them right where they were.

615
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,560
 And it changed everything

616
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:29,240
 about the way they engaged the world.

617
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:32,640
 Brooke and I, just yesterday, we were walking in a park

618
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,520
 and we were looking at the trees around us,

619
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,920
 and we called to mind what we know,

620
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,480
 what the right mentality is.

621
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,040
 And it said of our reality,

622
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:43,560
 these trees are groaning in eager anticipation

623
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,920
 for the sons of glory to be revealed.

624
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,560
 They're clapping in praise to God.

625
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,800
 It changed the way we looked at the world.

626
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,440
 We did not see it as it was.

627
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,600
 We saw it as it should be seen.

628
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,820
 So to let it be true of you.

629
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:59,900
 This is what Paul first recognizes

630
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,920
 about these believers in Colossae.

631
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:06,660
 He looks at me and says, "Man, your faith, it's amazing."

632
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:07,540
 But he doesn't just stop there.

633
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:08,380
 He keeps going.

634
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:09,200
 He says in verse three,

635
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,080
 "We've not only heard of your faith in Christ Jesus,

636
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:14,040
 we've heard of your love for all the saints."

637
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:17,400
 Which again, feels kind of anticlimactic.

638
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,720
 As believers, like loving people

639
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,640
 is just part of the territory.

640
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,920
 You know, this is kind of what we do.

641
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,840
 We go around and we love other people.

642
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,600
 Jesus loves, so we love as well.

643
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,660
 And yet what we need to understand

644
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:28,840
 is why this is a big deal to Paul.

645
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,200
 So in the English language,

646
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,240
 when we try to communicate love,

647
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,180
 we have one word to communicate

648
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:37,020
 a variety of different usages.

649
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,840
 So just to make this really plain,

650
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:39,880
 if I came up to you and I said,

651
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:44,520
 "Hey, your boyfriend loves you and loves pizza."

652
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:49,340
 We'd hope that those are not synonymous types of love.

653
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:50,980
 Yes?

654
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,780
 If so, we've got a bigger problem on our hands.

655
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:54,500
 But what we would likely be getting to

656
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:58,100
 is that this same word is used to communicate a variety,

657
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:00,940
 a wide range of different affection.

658
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,400
 This is not a problem in Greek.

659
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,120
 In Greek, they don't have one word for love.

660
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,660
 They have four words for love.

661
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:06,880
 Four different words.

662
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,120
 The first word is the word storge.

663
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,660
 Storge is familial love.

664
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:13,300
 It's between a mother and a child, brother and a sister.

665
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,860
 The second word is phileo.

666
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,180
 This is friendship love.

667
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:18,500
 It's brotherly affection.

668
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:21,860
 Philadelphia, the city of brotherly love.

669
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:23,780
 Phileo, Delphia.

670
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:26,260
 Eros is the third one.

671
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:29,140
 This is romantic or passionate love.

672
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:32,000
 And then the fourth is well-known.

673
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,840
 It's agape,

674
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:36,640
 which is sacrificial or unconditional love.

675
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,220
 Now, here's what's interesting.

676
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:42,660
 Of these four loves,

677
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:44,980
 agape is different than all the rest.

678
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:45,820
 It's unique.

679
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:47,540
 It's distinct from every other one.

680
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:48,380
 Why? How so?

681
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:50,060
 Why is it different from all the other ones?

682
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:51,300
 Because all the other ones,

683
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:55,060
 they're emotionally driven, right?

684
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:56,900
 Romantic love is like, oh my gosh,

685
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:57,740
 like where's my love?

686
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:58,700
 I must go to them.

687
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:01,220
 That's the way that Eros expresses itself.

688
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:03,580
 Or a mother, when she has her newborn,

689
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:05,540
 there's just a natural gravitation,

690
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:09,180
 a pull, a magnetism to love that child.

691
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:11,580
 Agape, it's not emotionally driven.

692
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:13,460
 It's consciously driven.

693
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,740
 It's not a love of feeling.

694
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:16,060
 It's a love of choice.

695
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:18,060
 It's not reactive.

696
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:20,140
 It's resilient.

697
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:21,280
 Does that make sense?

698
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,540
 It's a resilient type of love

699
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:27,780
 because it does not love in light of anything you do.

700
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:30,540
 It loves despite everything you do.

701
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,900
 This is the heart of agape.

702
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:35,900
 And Paul, as he's writing to these believers in Colossae,

703
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:39,220
 guess what kind of love he's celebrating about them?

704
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,060
 Agape.

705
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:45,420
 A love that is most uncharacteristically true of humanity

706
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:49,660
 and yet most quintessentially true of God.

707
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:50,860
 That's what he's saying.

708
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:55,860
 He's saying you're loving all the saints within your city

709
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:59,640
 with a kind of love that is not of this world,

710
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,940
 but is of a different one.

711
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:04,940
 You see, to put all of this in a sentence,

712
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:07,820
 what Paul is trying to say is that godly love

713
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:10,360
 is not just an instinctual feeling,

714
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:13,420
 but an intentional choice.

715
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:15,940
 Godly love is not just an instinctual feeling,

716
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:18,400
 it's an intentional choice.

717
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,180
 It's the kind of love that they have.

718
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:22,520
 And it's the kind of love they made a reputation for.

719
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,360
 Why is that?

720
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:27,560
 Well, as we go on, what we see is that this love

721
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:30,480
 is very characteristically dispensed,

722
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,680
 not just to those whom they are like,

723
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:36,980
 but to all people, regardless of background,

724
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:39,460
 regardless of economic status,

725
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:44,140
 regardless of their spiritual persuasion.

726
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:46,020
 Like they are all united together

727
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:47,860
 because of this kind of love.

728
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:49,340
 First John 4, eight through nine says,

729
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:52,180
 "Anyone who does not love does not know God."

730
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:54,560
 Why? Because God is love.

731
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,300
 What kind of love?

732
00:30:56,300 --> 00:31:00,580
 The kind of love that would send his only son into the world

733
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:02,460
 so that we might live through him.

734
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:05,620
 A kind of love that is sacrificing.

735
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:08,340
 A kind of love that's intentional.

736
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,740
 This is a love that's very unlike our own.

737
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:12,940
 So let me just explain it like this.

738
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:13,780
 Think about the people

739
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:16,180
 that you're naturally drawn towards in life.

740
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:17,340
 Even the people that you're sitting around right now,

741
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:18,260
 that you came with tonight,

742
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:20,980
 you're sitting beside this evening.

743
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,900
 Who are you naturally drawn towards in life?

744
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,160
 What's true of them?

745
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:28,440
 Well, for lack of a better word, they're lovable.

746
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:34,260
 There's something about them that you personally enjoy.

747
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:36,660
 Like you see them and what you see

748
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:39,140
 is a really good return on investment.

749
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:42,660
 Like a really deep sense of joy by way of their presence.

750
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:44,900
 Like you find that they're really easy to spend time with,

751
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:47,540
 or they're really funny, or man, they're really attractive

752
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:48,620
 and I like being around that.

753
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:50,300
 You know, like you see in them

754
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,020
 a variety of different things

755
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:55,580
 that help you to feel like, man,

756
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,420
 there's a benefit to being near them.

757
00:31:57,420 --> 00:32:03,540
 (congregation laughing)

758
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:05,340
 These are the people we draw near to.

759
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:08,340
 Think about the people Jesus drew near to.

760
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:13,140
 What kind of people did Jesus draw near to?

761
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:20,140
 Adulterers, addicts, blasphemers, bigots.

762
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:28,660
 Jesus did not draw near to lovable, beautiful people.

763
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:34,260
 He drew near to unlovable, broken people.

764
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:39,480
 This is what agape love does.

765
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:45,120
 You see, Jesus loved with a love

766
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:48,020
 that was unlike the world's, but just like God's.

767
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:50,780
 One that was non-instinctual, but intentional.

768
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:53,660
 And because the believers that Paul's writing to

769
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,220
 have been loved with a love like this,

770
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:57,380
 they love with a love like this.

771
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:58,740
 It's the natural outflow.

772
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:01,260
 I've received this, and now the natural response

773
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:03,500
 is to give this to other people.

774
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,700
 The Bible would say so itself.

775
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:07,300
 John 13, 34 says, "By this, all men will know

776
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:09,080
 "that you're my disciples.

777
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:12,060
 "You'll stand out if you have love for one another."

778
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:14,280
 First John 3, 10, "By this, the children of God

779
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,000
 "and the children of the devil are obvious.

780
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,060
 "Anyone who does not practice righteousness is not of God,

781
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:21,780
 "nor the one who does not love his brother."

782
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:23,100
 You see, those that have been loved by God,

783
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,300
 they love like God.

784
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:26,260
 It's our trademark, our unique signature on life.

785
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:29,380
 We don't just love by feeling, we love by choice.

786
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:32,220
 We bite our tongue when our words would hurt.

787
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:35,360
 We patiently endure when our friends are cruel.

788
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,120
 We forgive an enemy that's done us wrong.

789
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,420
 We do what's right when everybody else

790
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:42,820
 chooses to do what's wrong.

791
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:46,900
 This is the kind of love that genuine believers in Christ

792
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,040
 are marked by.

793
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:52,160
 And it's the kind of love that the world takes notice of,

794
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,660
 because it's not characteristically true of anybody else,

795
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:56,100
 but our God.

796
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:59,500
 And Paul's saying, "Hey, you'll have an amazing faith,

797
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:02,340
 "a faith that's not just full of the right mentality,

798
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:05,300
 "but is actually expressing the right reality."

799
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:07,420
 But not just that, you have a love

800
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:10,220
 that doesn't look like the world's, but looks like God's.

801
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:14,020
 That doesn't do unto others as they have done unto you,

802
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:16,980
 but does unto others as you would have them do unto you.

803
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:19,660
 But he doesn't just stop there.

804
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:22,620
 As he keeps going, Paul tells them

805
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:24,900
 that there's one more thing which I've heard.

806
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,780
 And he unpacks it in verse five.

807
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:31,260
 He says, "Because of the hope laid up for you in heaven,

808
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:33,760
 "of this you have heard before the word of the truth,

809
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,540
 "the gospel which has come to you as indeed,

810
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,820
 "in the whole world it is bearing fruit and increasing,

811
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:40,340
 "as it also does among you, since the day you heard it

812
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:43,640
 "and understood the grace of God in truth."

813
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:44,820
 You see, Paul, he addresses here

814
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:46,140
 towards the end of his introduction,

815
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:48,440
 one final notable characteristic

816
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:51,040
 of the Christians in Colossae that he's learned of,

817
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:53,240
 which is their hope.

818
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:56,140
 That's the last thing.

819
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:58,940
 Paul, in his opening introduction,

820
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:01,340
 identifies three notable characteristics

821
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:02,780
 about these believers.

822
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:03,940
 You know what they are?

823
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:09,700
 Faith, hope, and love.

824
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:16,020
 He identifies the holy triad.

825
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:17,740
 He looks at them and says,

826
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:21,360
 "You have all the markings of God on your life.

827
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:23,620
 "You have all the markings of God on your life."

828
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:26,100
 Which again, begs the question for us,

829
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:29,020
 why is he celebrating the hope they have in heaven?

830
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:30,740
 Like Paul, we get it, man.

831
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:31,580
 You know what?

832
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:32,460
 You're celebrating their faith,

833
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:34,420
 which at first seemed a little bit obvious,

834
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:35,940
 but then again, we realized faith

835
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:37,060
 isn't exactly what we thought.

836
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:37,880
 And you know what?

837
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:38,860
 You were celebrating their love,

838
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:40,220
 but love's kind of the natural outflow

839
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:41,660
 of the Christian life.

840
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:42,680
 But we get it.

841
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:43,520
 It's a different kind of love.

842
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,940
 It's a godly type of love.

843
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:47,780
 But why are you celebrating their hope in heaven?

844
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:49,700
 Like that's just part of the process.

845
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:52,320
 That's kind of formulaic to the Christian experience.

846
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,840
 You place your faith in Jesus,

847
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,320
 and then what you get is eternal life.

848
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:58,640
 That's on the other side of this agreement.

849
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,540
 Why, Paul, are you celebrating it?

850
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:05,880
 Well, we need to understand the kind of hope

851
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:09,000
 that Paul's very specifically speaking to.

852
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,600
 You see, Paul does know that the free gift of God

853
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,640
 is eternal life in Christ Jesus

854
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,860
 for those that have placed their faith in him.

855
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:17,640
 But he's saying that this hope

856
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:22,020
 is not just a hope that's looking forward to the future,

857
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:25,520
 but it's fueling them right now.

858
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,820
 That's what he's getting at.

859
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:32,180
 See, Paul is teaching us from their example

860
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:35,460
 that hope is not just an anticipation of tomorrow,

861
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:37,240
 it's a motivation for today.

862
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:40,700
 Hope is not just an anticipation of tomorrow,

863
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,500
 but it's a motivation for today.

864
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,500
 Like he's addressing the fact that, man,

865
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,540
 y'all are looking forward to one day

866
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:48,120
 when you will be with God.

867
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,400
 You are anticipating the fact that you will be in heaven

868
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,760
 at some point in the future,

869
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,400
 but your faith and your love,

870
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:56,300
 it's rooted in the fact that you have that hope right now.

871
00:36:56,300 --> 00:37:00,520
 It's not just something that's looking forward,

872
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:03,560
 it's fueling you right now.

873
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:07,520
 It's motivating your life here in the present.

874
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,080
 So just as an example,

875
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,640
 when I received the offer to come here to the porch,

876
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,320
 Brooke and I, we had about a month of time

877
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,520
 between the time at which I was offered the job

878
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:18,320
 and we signed the letter to when we moved

879
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,440
 and I had my first day.

880
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,400
 We had a month.

881
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:25,640
 When we signed the offer, we had a sealed promise.

882
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:29,360
 We had a hope laid up for us in Dallas.

883
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,160
 We knew that we were coming here.

884
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:35,040
 We had all the anticipation of arriving here in the future.

885
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,640
 We knew that we would be amongst our friends

886
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,240
 and we would have the chance to spend time

887
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,560
 with our family here in the city.

888
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,400
 And we'd get the chance to be a part of this ministry

889
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,000
 and see the way God is moving.

890
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,320
 We anticipated all of it,

891
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,520
 but it wasn't just something we looked forward to.

892
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,760
 It also impacted how we live

893
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:53,180
 within the month we had left in Houston.

894
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:55,440
 Right?

895
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,600
 What did it do?

896
00:37:56,600 --> 00:38:00,440
 It unleashed us to make the most of the time we had left.

897
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,720
 Like we were anticipating something great

898
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,320
 and so it motivated us in the present.

899
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:08,600
 We had conversations, the likes of which we'd put off.

900
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,840
 And yet now time was of the essence.

901
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,240
 We need to share the gospel.

902
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,760
 We need to commission others.

903
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,320
 We need to challenge their faith.

904
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,120
 We need to admonish the faithful.

905
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,840
 We need to do all of these different things

906
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:21,780
 to call people into the light of the gospel

907
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,360
 that we ourselves had received.

908
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:26,440
 And now we ourselves were going to proclaim.

909
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:29,640
 But not just that, it allowed us to take deep interest

910
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,880
 in investing in the relationships God had given.

911
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,160
 Like we would sit at dinners

912
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,560
 and we would linger in conversation

913
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,200
 and we would take time with friends

914
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,580
 and we would celebrate what God had done.

915
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,520
 Because we had a hope ahead,

916
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:49,200
 it caused us to have great investment where we were.

917
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:53,800
 Even Tim McGraw gets this.

918
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,000
 "Live like you were dying."

919
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,040
 You know?

920
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,000
 He's like, "Yeah, man."

921
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,840
 Like a vision of your pending doom,

922
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:03,860
 your expiration is going to motivate you right now

923
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:05,080
 in the present.

924
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,480
 So go skydive, go rock climb,

925
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,920
 go 2.7 seconds on "Bullet and Fu Manchu."

926
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,200
 Like get out there and do it.

927
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,400
 That's what he's unpacking.

928
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,000
 And Paul is saying the same thing is true

929
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,280
 when we have a hope laid up for us in heaven.

930
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:19,640
 We know, man, there's something glorious ahead.

931
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:22,800
 And that doesn't make me anxious about today.

932
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,600
 That unleashes me today.

933
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,880
 Hope of a promised future unleashes you

934
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:30,760
 to make the most of your present reality.

935
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:33,840
 Hope of a promised future, promised.

936
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,960
 It's not just preferred, that'd be really great.

937
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:38,080
 It's a promised future.

938
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:41,680
 Jesus Christ went to the cross and rose from the dead

939
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,080
 to secure the fact that we'd be with God forever.

940
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:44,920
 It's a promise.

941
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,880
 We're going to the pearly gates.

942
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,960
 We're going to be with God in eternity.

943
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,320
 And it's going to be glorious.

944
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:53,560
 We're going to get to be with all of our besties.

945
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:56,200
 But it's not just that it's a promised future

946
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,980
 that we look forward to.

947
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:03,860
 It's a present reality upon which we're unleashed.

948
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:09,040
 You see, this is what is different about Christianity

949
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,400
 than the rest of the world.

950
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:17,080
 In the face of inevitable death,

951
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:20,880
 the rest of the world has no hope to offer.

952
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:24,320
 No hope that is promised the way we've described.

953
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:28,680
 Sure, other religiosity would say,

954
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:32,360
 there's a preferred future, but you got to get to it.

955
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,040
 You got to work your way.

956
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:36,840
 You got to work from the sweat of your brow

957
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:39,320
 to get to that preferred end.

958
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:44,800
 But Christianity, the faith we have in Jesus

959
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:49,080
 does not sweat nor worry or feel any concern

960
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,040
 that this is the case.

961
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,480
 Because we don't have to ascend to God,

962
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,880
 for God has descended to us.

963
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:58,240
 He has stepped into our story.

964
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:02,760
 And in so doing, He has given us a remarkable hope.

965
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:06,120
 A hope that we not only look forward to one day,

966
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:10,000
 but we enjoy and we experience here today.

967
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,840
 In 1683, John Owen, who was a great Puritan,

968
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,240
 he was laying on his deathbed

969
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:20,320
 and he was having his secretary write a note

970
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,460
 to one of his dear friends.

971
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:22,620
 And as she began to pen the letter,

972
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:25,640
 she wrote out from John to his friend,

973
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,320
 "I'm still in the land of the living."

974
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,680
 He's on his deathbed, he's providing an update.

975
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,720
 And so she writes, "I'm still in the land of the living."

976
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:36,520
 Upon hearing it, John said, "Stop.

977
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:42,960
 "Don't say that, change that and say instead,

978
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,220
 "I'm yet in the land of the dying.

979
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:49,340
 "But I hope soon to be in the land of the living."

980
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:57,760
 You and I may not be laying on our deathbed quite like John,

981
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:03,740
 but friends, we are urgently expiring.

982
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:08,600
 Which is a really heavy thing to think about.

983
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,960
 You know, some of you, you're here for the first time,

984
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:15,240
 you're like, wow, that's how this guy's gonna wrap it up?

985
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,400
 That's where he's gonna land the plane?

986
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,440
 I told you we shouldn't have come here.

987
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,800
 Why didn't we go get food?

988
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,300
 You know, like that's a really heavy place to end.

989
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:26,080
 But it does beg the question,

990
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,640
 what are you hoping in tonight?

991
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:31,100
 Like what do you think if you achieve it,

992
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:34,660
 it'll give you security, purpose, meaning?

993
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:38,480
 Is it your job?

994
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:43,700
 That thing which you want so badly to be a part of,

995
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:47,400
 yet you're already planning to retire from it today.

996
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:50,740
 Is it your relationship?

997
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:53,100
 Despite the fact that I've stood in the altar

998
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:55,880
 of multiple weddings and I've listened to people

999
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:59,260
 make vows and account for the worst

1000
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:00,660
 of the other person's self.

1001
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:07,780
 Is it your friends?

1002
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:10,900
 Because statistically, most friendships won't last

1003
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:12,680
 beyond 10 years in total length.

1004
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:15,280
 Is it your beauty?

1005
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:20,980
 Yeah, gravity's never lost that one.

1006
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:25,860
 Is it your platform?

1007
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:26,980
 Your popularity?

1008
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:34,100
 Even though on that platform,

1009
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:35,940
 you're only as valuable to people

1010
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:38,660
 as the performance you keep up.

1011
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:46,940
 What are you searching and hoping to place your security in?

1012
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:49,620
 Where is it?

1013
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:53,380
 It would serve you well to identify it tonight.

1014
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:57,060
 And in identifying it, register with the reality

1015
00:43:57,060 --> 00:44:02,020
 that it's insufficient to save you.

1016
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:09,620
 I'm pleading with you to get that one.

1017
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:12,540
 I want so badly for you to take it home

1018
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:17,540
 and to realize that nothing apart from Christ

1019
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:18,940
 is sufficient to save.

1020
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:24,140
 Nothing apart from Christ is sufficient to secure.

1021
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:28,020
 Only He and He alone is capable of providing you a hope

1022
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:34,640
 that will never waver, will never fade, nor ever dim.

1023
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:38,260
 Why do I know that?

1024
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:44,020
 Because in Christ's life, Jesus came to give faith.

1025
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:48,940
 He lived in a way and He interacted with the world

1026
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:50,460
 that communicated to us.

1027
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:52,500
 There's not just a mentality to have,

1028
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:55,320
 there's a reality to experience.

1029
00:44:55,320 --> 00:45:02,300
 I know this because Jesus, in His death,

1030
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:04,740
 He came to show us love,

1031
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:06,940
 not just doing by what was instinctual

1032
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:10,980
 because instinct would never have led Him to the cross,

1033
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:14,060
 but by doing what's intentional and saying,

1034
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:18,580
 "Though you do not deserve me, I will initiate towards you.

1035
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:22,740
 Though you are not lovely, I will love you.

1036
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:28,180
 Though you are so very broken, I will be broken

1037
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:32,060
 that you may be made beautiful as I am."

1038
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:37,760
 And in Christ's resurrection, He shows us hope,

1039
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:43,940
 that there is hope of everlasting life out in front of us,

1040
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:48,980
 but there's hope of everlasting life available to you

1041
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:51,420
 right here, right now, tonight.

1042
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:56,300
 This is where the Apostle Paul begins

1043
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:58,940
 as he writes this letter to the Church of Colossae.

1044
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:03,540
 And this is a suitable place for us to begin tonight

1045
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:05,540
 because He commends them for their faith.

1046
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:07,140
 He commends them for their love.

1047
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:09,000
 He commends them for their hope.

1048
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,900
 What's the status of your faith,

1049
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:16,580
 your love and your hope here tonight?

1050
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:18,900
 Let me pray for us.

1051
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:20,900
 Father,

1052
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:34,080
 nothing about these evenings is coincidental.

1053
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:38,780
 Nothing about these evenings is haphazard.

1054
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:41,100
 And so, Father, as I have friends here in the room tonight

1055
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:43,980
 that feel like, "Man, my mail was just read."

1056
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:48,940
 He just peered right into the inmost parts of my soul.

1057
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:51,060
 It feels like He was talking about me.

1058
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:56,980
 They would know that was by design, God,

1059
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:59,540
 not mine, but yours.

1060
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:01,940
 For you, God, have brought them here tonight

1061
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:06,140
 that something might change right now, here in this moment.

1062
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:12,900
 That, God, the conviction they feel, it's from your spirit.

1063
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:15,340
 It's not guilt of what happened last night,

1064
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:17,740
 shame for what happened last week.

1065
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:19,360
 It's conviction to say,

1066
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:21,420
 "You don't have to go that way any longer.

1067
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:23,140
 "Come with me instead."

1068
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:28,220
 And so, God, I pray,

1069
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:31,780
 as we come to the close of this evening,

1070
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:33,280
 we wouldn't check out,

1071
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:37,460
 but we would register, God, with this truth.

1072
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:39,780
 You've been building to this moment,

1073
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:46,140
 and you want God to meet with us as we are.

1074
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:52,460
 Stir up our hearts, sharpen our minds,

1075
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:55,340
 make quick our faith, God, to follow wherever it is

1076
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:57,060
 you want us to go this evening.

1077
00:47:57,060 --> 00:47:59,020
 If it's placing hope in you, Jesus,

1078
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:01,180
 would we do so fearlessly?

1079
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:06,120
 Would we acknowledge, "Yes, I cannot save myself,"

1080
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:09,900
 that my destiny apart from you is life here now

1081
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:11,980
 and then death in the grave forever,

1082
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:13,920
 and yet I can take hope knowing

1083
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:16,900
 that you, Jesus, did live life here in the now.

1084
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:19,060
 You did die into the grave,

1085
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:21,100
 but that grave could not keep you.

1086
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:22,940
 You burst forth from its clutches,

1087
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:26,460
 and you declared victory over all of creation,

1088
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:29,420
 over all of sin, and over all of death.

1089
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:33,060
 Would I place my hope in you, God?

1090
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:34,700
 For some of us, we need to realize,

1091
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:37,300
 man, I've just intellectually ascended.

1092
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:39,620
 That's all my spiritual experience has been.

1093
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:42,100
 It's been learning more about God,

1094
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:44,020
 but I want more of him tonight.

1095
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:45,980
 I don't want just an intellectual acquaintance.

1096
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:48,340
 I want an intimate acquaintance with him tonight, God.

1097
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:50,580
 I pray that people would confess

1098
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:53,540
 and respond accordingly to that conviction.

1099
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:55,360
 And lastly, God, there are some people here

1100
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:58,620
 that need to love those whom they have felt

1101
00:48:58,620 --> 00:49:01,100
 no ounce of love towards, God.

1102
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:02,980
 Would they see in you, Christ, one

1103
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:08,660
 that did not respond to us appropriately?

1104
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:13,700
 But moved towards us radically with a love.

1105
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:15,140
 We did not deserve God.

1106
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:16,220
 Move here now.

1107
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:17,580
 Take your time, God.

1108
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:20,020
 We're waiting for you.

1109
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:22,900
 It's in Jesus' name we pray, amen.

1110
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:25,500
 Hey, if you would, let's stand to our feet together.

1111
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:28,660
 I meant what I said when I prayed.

1112
00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:30,060
 Like, we build to this moment,

1113
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:31,540
 and it's not because we're trying

1114
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:33,580
 to get an emotional draw from the room.

1115
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:35,420
 It's because this is the time

1116
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:37,900
 when God has been working through worship and his word

1117
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:39,780
 to stir up a response.

1118
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:43,300
 And I just wanna put it on the table before you.

1119
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:51,420
 God is real and active and true.

1120
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:55,260
 He wants to meet with you now.

1121
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:59,980
 How will you respond to the real and active, true God

1122
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:02,340
 that is here in all of us?

1123
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:03,180
 Let's sing.
