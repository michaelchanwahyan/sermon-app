[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:24.040]   - All right, let's do it, let's do it.
[00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.960]   What's up?
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.040]   Our friends tuning in in Porch Live, Tulsa,
[00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.040]   Scottsdale, Boise, Idaho, my friends in Dallas, what's up?
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.220]   We are back having Awaken guest speakers,
[00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.240]   all the things, we're back kicking off our fourth night
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.880]   of our dating series, Dateable.
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.360]   And I know we had some people upset after, is he dateable?
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.400]   We're like, yeah, next week, is she dateable?
[00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.040]   And then next week didn't come,
[00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.540]   and the next week didn't come.
[00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.280]   People were knocking on my DMs.
[00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.640]   I had a mom in my DMs like, you said next week,
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.800]   is she dateable?
[00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:58.840]   And I'm like, you're married.
[00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.520]   And then I'm like, she's like my daughter.
[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.560]   I was gonna say it to my daughter.
[00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.320]   And I was like, well, to that mom,
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.800]   if you're listening tonight, we're here.
[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:06.860]   We're here now.
[00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.560]   And just so excited.
[00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.600]   And like I said, if you didn't join us,
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.920]   basically what we did a few weeks ago
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.580]   is got to just walk through three questions
[00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.320]   that girls should be asking,
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.660]   and guys should be even asking themselves concerning,
[00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.880]   hey, is this guy that I potentially will be dating,
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:24.840]   is he dateable?
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.280]   According to God's standards, not culture,
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.320]   what I want, but what God wants.
[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.400]   And tonight, this one is for the boys.
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.560]   Okay, Tuesdays tonight are for the boys.
[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.140]   If you're a guy in the house and you're ready,
[00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.000]   let me hear you say, yeah.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.120]   - Yeah.
[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.760]   - Oh, I love it, manpower.
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.760]   But before I get to that,
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.860]   I would like to introduce you guys
[00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.920]   to a friend of mine and his wife.
[00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.920]   This is Ryan and Becca.
[00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.100]   Ryan and Becca Michael.
[00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.700]   And these two individuals are really special,
[00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.640]   have been through a lot this year.
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:01.800]   And I'll tell you a little bit about it.
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.960]   So I'm a friend of Ryan's and come February,
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.120]   he got the news that his kidney was failing.
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:13.820]   At just the age of 24, newly married, his kidneys failing.
[00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.080]   And it just rapidly started declining.
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.560]   His health started declining.
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.000]   And I know this is like a downer to start on,
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.200]   but has a hopeful ending.
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.360]   So we get this news and all of the friends around,
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.720]   we prayed about it and we're like,
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.320]   hey, let's see if we could be a live donor.
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.520]   And so all of us apply all these different things.
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.660]   And when I got the application,
[00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.860]   I had no idea the work that went into
[00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.160]   potentially being a live donor.
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.040]   And it makes sense.
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.780]   Like, if you think about it, like if you are selected,
[00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:43.760]   they're going to cut you open,
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.040]   take out a major organ and give it to someone.
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.080]   That's a big deal.
[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.480]   And so because it's a big deal,
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.980]   they ask a lot of questions.
[00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.560]   There's so much involved in the testing process
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.160]   to see if you're a match.
[00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.460]   Because if you think about it, how pointless would it be?
[00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.800]   How much unnecessary pain would you have to go through
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.240]   if whenever you hear, hey,
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.400]   you got my friend's kidneys failing,
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.000]   you're just like, take mine.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.840]   Just for them to open it up, try to give it to Ryan
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.700]   and to see that it wasn't a match.
[00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:14.660]   Like it would be pointless.
[00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.060]   It would be for nothing.
[00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.360]   And so they ask all of these really strategic questions.
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.940]   And out of the process, the longest part by far
[00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.780]   is what's called the consultation.
[00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.740]   Where if you go further and further in your blood,
[00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:27.860]   your blood types the same, all these different things,
[00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.020]   you sit down with all these medical professionals
[00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:31.700]   and they just drill you with questions,
[00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.900]   questions, questions, medical history,
[00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.060]   your family's medical history,
[00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.860]   your family's family's medical history,
[00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.260]   your all these different intimate details of your life.
[00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.140]   They even check your mental state,
[00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.420]   all these different things.
[00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:43.260]   Why?
[00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.060]   All of the answers through process of elimination,
[00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.540]   through other cases,
[00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.620]   what these professionals are doing is determining
[00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.500]   based off of what this person says,
[00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.780]   will Ryan's body accept this kidney?
[00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.660]   Will they be a match?
[00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:02.500]   Why?
[00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:03.320]   Because like I said,
[00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.420]   there are major implications of this surgery
[00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.300]   and we want to guarantee that these two people
[00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:10.300]   are the right match.
[00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.100]   So we want to make sure we ask the right questions.
[00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.460]   I start there because I think so many of us meet a person
[00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:19.340]   because they're good looking, attractive,
[00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:20.980]   and make us feel butterflies inside.
[00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:22.460]   We don't ask any questions.
[00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.100]   We jump right into the deep end.
[00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.140]   We open up ourself, give them our heart, all for what?
[00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.060]   Rejection,
[00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.900]   hurt,
[00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.700]   unnecessary pain that we still are experiencing
[00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.600]   the ramifications of the choice that we made
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.340]   to not make sure that, hey,
[00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.100]   am I asking the right questions?
[00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.300]   Am I doing the right pre-work
[00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.140]   before I jump into a relationship with this person?
[00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:51.980]   Am I asking the right questions,
[00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.040]   not according to my way,
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.940]   but to what God would have for me in a relationship?
[00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.420]   We don't do the hard work to make sure
[00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:04.420]   that this relationship would work
[00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:05.540]   in the way that God would want it.
[00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:08.600]   And the result is, is we jump in too soon.
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.160]   And because of that, heartbreak and pain.
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.940]   And so fellas tonight,
[00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:15.580]   and ladies, I hope you are taking notes
[00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.080]   and you're listening just as well,
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.020]   because tonight we're gonna just go through again,
[00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:25.020]   three questions that I think that God would have us ask
[00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.360]   before we jump into a relationship,
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.500]   before we even get into an exclusive dating relationship,
[00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.100]   before pursuing her, we ask these questions.
[00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:37.020]   Hey, is she dateable?
[00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:38.860]   Is she a match?
[00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.980]   Is this what God would want for me?
[00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:44.980]   Not based on what I see or I feel,
[00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:47.820]   but according to his truth and his design.
[00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:49.460]   So you're ready to do it?
[00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:50.300]   Here we go.
[00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:54.700]   First question a guy should ask is,
[00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:58.500]   who currently has her heart?
[00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:03.500]   Who currently as a single individual has her heart?
[00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.020]   Before giving her your heart,
[00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:07.860]   or before asking her to open up herself
[00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:10.140]   and to begin giving her heart to you,
[00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:13.220]   you should be able to answer right now as an individual,
[00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:16.620]   as an independent woman, who has her heart?
[00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:19.380]   What does she love?
[00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:20.920]   Who does she love?
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:24.260]   Does culture have her heart?
[00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.260]   Does any guy that will give her attention have her heart?
[00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.660]   Does her ex still have her heart?
[00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:36.360]   Does social media, gratification,
[00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.580]   people's perceptions of her,
[00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:40.940]   what has her heart?
[00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:43.740]   And I think we come to church
[00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:45.340]   and I'm gonna give you the answer.
[00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:46.740]   Hey, her first love,
[00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:50.340]   the who behind who should have her heart
[00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:53.940]   as a single individual is Jesus Christ.
[00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:56.300]   And I think we hear that and we're like, yeah, of course,
[00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:57.540]   like I want her to be a Christian.
[00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:59.180]   I want her to love God.
[00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:03.460]   But really you can tell if a person is about it or not.
[00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:05.760]   Real recognize real, all right?
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:10.220]   And you can tell if Jesus truly has her heart.
[00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:12.620]   And I don't mean that he's just a part of her life,
[00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:15.020]   but he's the point of her life.
[00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:16.980]   Jesus is her everything.
[00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:21.000]   Jesus gets all of her attention,
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.400]   all of her affections, all of her devotion.
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:27.580]   She pretty much doesn't even notice you noticing her
[00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:31.680]   because she's fixated on what Jesus has for her, not on you.
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:33.700]   Because he is her love.
[00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:36.720]   He has her heart in such a way
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:40.000]   that should gravitate your heart towards her.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.980]   Paul says this, we read this all the time
[00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:44.900]   talking about the season of singleness,
[00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:45.740]   which by the way,
[00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:48.220]   I hope that you're scoping out the women who are single.
[00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:49.660]   As single people,
[00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:53.420]   this is what Paul says should be true of them.
[00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:55.780]   First Corinthians 7.25.
[00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:57.800]   I am saying all of this, he says all these things,
[00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:00.460]   for your own good, not to restrict you.
[00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:02.820]   Like singleness isn't a restriction,
[00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:06.560]   but that you may live in a right way.
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:08.120]   What's the right way?
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:10.840]   In undivided devotion to the Lord.
[00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:16.000]   So when you ask yourself, hey, who has her heart?
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.440]   Another way, Paul's way of saying that is,
[00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:22.760]   does Jesus have her undivided devotion?
[00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:28.020]   Has she fully surrendered her life to him?
[00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:31.520]   (audience laughing)
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:33.240]   And I think that so many of us were like,
[00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:35.180]   yeah, well, everyone, especially in Texas,
[00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:37.040]   like calls himself a Christian.
[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:39.040]   Like, how can you know?
[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:40.620]   And I just wanna talk about a little bit
[00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:42.780]   of what it looks like to know
[00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:47.120]   if a girl has given her heart fully to Jesus,
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:49.840]   not just with her mouth, but with her life.
[00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:52.520]   So how can you tell if Jesus has her heart?
[00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:56.220]   Well, how do you know if anything has anyone's heart?
[00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:57.980]   It's what they kind of obsess over.
[00:08:57.980 --> 00:08:59.880]   It's what they spend all their time talking about.
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:02.040]   It's what they spend all their time doing.
[00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:03.820]   As you were writing, I was thinking about,
[00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:06.440]   there's these two guys that lead here, they're awesome.
[00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:09.120]   But every time I talk to them, here is a recent,
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:13.480]   I know the same topics are gonna come up, Bitcoin.
[00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:15.560]   They're gonna talk about Bitcoin every single time.
[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:16.640]   Or is it like Dogecoin?
[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:17.640]   Is that what it is?
[00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:18.760]   Is that right?
[00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:19.760]   Some of you, okay, yeah.
[00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:20.800]   Dogecoin, I don't know.
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.880]   Yeah, but they're gonna talk about it.
[00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:24.360]   And I'm gonna sit here and be like,
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:26.120]   yeah, yeah, yeah, I should totally invest.
[00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:26.960]   You're right.
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:28.200]   I have no idea what they're talking about.
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.440]   Some cryptocurrency in the air that we all,
[00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:32.880]   like the world's going down and we should all invest.
[00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:36.560]   But the reason why is because they're investing
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:38.960]   in what they're obsessing over.
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:45.120]   And so many of us, we talk about and participate
[00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:49.520]   and enjoy and delight in the things that have our heart.
[00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:52.760]   And so does this girl, and by the way,
[00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:54.560]   those guys, they talk about Jesus all the time too.
[00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:56.400]   Yeah, he's, you know, they love Jesus.
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:00.320]   But so many times, like we talk about,
[00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:02.400]   we meet these people that they're all just talk,
[00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:04.440]   but you look at their life and there's nothing
[00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:06.280]   that reflects an actual change.
[00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:08.400]   The Bible says in Matthew chapter seven,
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:12.180]   that you will recognize a tree by its fruits.
[00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:15.560]   Like you'll recognize a tree by its fruits.
[00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:18.000]   That a lot of time, the spiritual walk,
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.800]   a life with Christ looks like,
[00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:22.160]   it uses like this illustration of like gardening
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:23.720]   or trees and roots.
[00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:27.600]   And once someone is rooted in an abiding relationship
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:32.600]   with Jesus, they water it, they do it in proper soil
[00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:37.480]   and out produces so much fruit in their life
[00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:39.620]   that their old life dies and goes away
[00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:42.040]   and a new life with Christ comes.
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:43.280]   And there's so much fruit.
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:45.800]   What does fruit, what do I mean by spiritual fruit?
[00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:46.920]   What does that look like?
[00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:49.120]   Galatians five, verse 22 says,
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:52.320]   "The fruit of the spirit or the fruit of a person
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:55.480]   who's given Jesus their heart are these things,
[00:10:55.480 --> 00:11:00.480]   love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness,
[00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:06.040]   faithfulness, gentleness, self-control."
[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:11.040]   When you look at this woman, what marks her life?
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:17.200]   What indicates what gets her attention and her affections?
[00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:21.500]   Do these things pour out of her?
[00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:23.360]   Like if you were to try to hit her up,
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:28.040]   is she probably busy because she's too busy being the church?
[00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:32.560]   She's too busy making disciples and meeting with girls.
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:35.320]   Like is she the type of girl that whenever vacations
[00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:38.520]   come around and she finally gets time off of work,
[00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:43.040]   she goes on mission trips because she wants to go and serve
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:45.760]   and talk about what Jesus has done in her life.
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:48.040]   Is she the type of girl that every time you get around her,
[00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:51.180]   you experience this just like, she's different.
[00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:52.480]   She's different.
[00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:54.500]   There's this calming peace to her.
[00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:56.380]   There's this joy about her in the midst
[00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:58.420]   of really hard circumstances.
[00:11:58.420 --> 00:11:59.620]   There's this story to her.
[00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:02.680]   There's this thing about her that doesn't look like
[00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:05.240]   the girls that you met out at the bar.
[00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:06.880]   Doesn't look like the girls that are constantly
[00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:09.080]   blowing you up on Instagram.
[00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:10.040]   She's steady.
[00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:13.040]   She's certain.
[00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:14.340]   She's confident.
[00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:20.760]   That looks like a woman whose heart has been given to Jesus.
[00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:24.860]   And I think a lot of times the reason why this is actually
[00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:27.620]   hard for us men, I'm gonna lean in just a little bit,
[00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:30.540]   a little pressure point on us men right here.
[00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:35.540]   I think why we actually don't want a girl who has given her
[00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:42.100]   undivided attention to Jesus is because that means
[00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:44.740]   that if she's giving him her everything,
[00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:48.660]   we only get some of her and we want it reversed.
[00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:51.520]   We want her to give us everything we want
[00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:54.560]   and to give some of herself to Jesus.
[00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:57.600]   And there's this contradiction that sure,
[00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:00.080]   you want a girl that when you bring her home to mom and dad
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:02.200]   who forced you to go to church growing up,
[00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:04.640]   she can talk the talk and say, yeah, I'm a Christian.
[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:06.720]   But if she actually starts living Christ-like,
[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:09.880]   that contradicts what you want out of the relationship.
[00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:13.200]   Because if she's actually all in with Jesus,
[00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:15.160]   maybe she doesn't wanna sleep with you.
[00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:19.000]   If she's actually all in with Jesus,
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.420]   maybe she does want to go to church
[00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:24.720]   and want you to serve in the church.
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:27.180]   If she's all in with Jesus,
[00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:30.740]   maybe she actually is gonna demand the respect
[00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:35.740]   that you lead her, that you serve her, that you listen,
[00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:38.680]   that you practice the things in God's word.
[00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:42.260]   Maybe if you find a girl who's actually all in with Jesus,
[00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.220]   that means that you have to be as well.
[00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:50.180]   And so, I just, you know,
[00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:55.000]   I'm just saying, make sure
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.820]   that when you are going out to these women
[00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:01.900]   and you're looking across going, man, who is dateable?
[00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:03.740]   Who's about it?
[00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:04.580]   You're finding a woman
[00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:06.760]   who doesn't just call herself a Christian,
[00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:08.060]   but is living Christ-like
[00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:11.080]   because she has given her heart to Jesus.
[00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:13.060]   She is running the race.
[00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:15.100]   She is all out for the Lord.
[00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:18.660]   Next question we ask, if she's dateable,
[00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:21.920]   what dictates her value?
[00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:25.860]   What dictates her value?
[00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:27.020]   Well, first off, we need to answer
[00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:29.740]   just what dictates anyone's value.
[00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:31.660]   Like, where does value come from?
[00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:34.220]   Where do we get our value?
[00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:36.380]   And the reality is, the thing about value is,
[00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:40.780]   what determines something's value is who created it,
[00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:43.780]   or the inventor, the creator of that thing,
[00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:46.180]   and what we're willing to pay for it.
[00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:48.340]   Over here, I thought talking about is she dateable,
[00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:50.260]   I'd bring up the Louis Vuitton.
[00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.900]   So, when talking about LV,
[00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:55.900]   I found out from the girls on our team
[00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:59.740]   that pretty much everyone's got fake Louis Vuittons.
[00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:03.340]   That came to my surprise, and I was like, wait, what?
[00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:05.080]   You're a bunch of like, fakers?
[00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:07.060]   I thought y'all had it like that.
[00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:12.060]   And so, one of these is fake.
[00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:13.420]   Okay?
[00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:15.940]   Let's call the big girl back here, number one.
[00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:18.180]   (audience laughing)
[00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:19.420]   Little shoddy, number two.
[00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:20.740]   (audience laughing)
[00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:23.540]   And the princess with the little pink, number three, okay?
[00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:26.980]   So, big mama, the baddie, and the shoddy.
[00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:28.380]   Okay, here we go, whatever.
[00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:30.380]   Number one, number two, number three.
[00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:33.020]   Raise your hand on which one's fake.
[00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:35.180]   Here we go, is number one fake?
[00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:36.020]   Raise your hand.
[00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:39.020]   Some of you girls are like, trust me, I know,
[00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:39.860]   there's a difference.
[00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:41.180]   (audience laughing)
[00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:42.380]   You're like, the durability,
[00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:46.660]   especially in the rainy season, like, quality, quality.
[00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:48.140]   Okay, number two.
[00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:53.100]   Okay, number three.
[00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:54.740]   Y'all thought it was number three
[00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:56.460]   'cause of this strap right here, isn't it?
[00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:57.700]   That's exactly why.
[00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:02.380]   I'm gonna be honest, I don't even know, I forgot.
[00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:03.220]   (audience laughing)
[00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:07.220]   But, the point is,
[00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:08.580]   (audience laughing)
[00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:13.580]   the point, that is kind of the point, okay?
[00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:20.260]   All these bags look the same, I don't care who you are.
[00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.420]   You post a picture in one of these,
[00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:25.300]   and I'm like, she's got it, she's bougie.
[00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:30.300]   And so, you know who wouldn't agree with me?
[00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:34.380]   There's a girl who owns all three of those bags.
[00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:35.760]   And she wouldn't agree with me.
[00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:37.780]   She'd be like, those are not all the same.
[00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:38.620]   Why?
[00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:40.620]   One was made by a guy in a garage,
[00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:42.740]   the other two were made by Louis.
[00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:46.940]   And, because Louis Vuitton made those bags,
[00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:48.380]   they're different.
[00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:51.060]   Also, the reason why I did not agree
[00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:54.700]   is 'cause for one, I paid, what, like $80, I guess, maybe?
[00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:57.180]   And the other two, I paid $1,800.
[00:16:57.180 --> 00:16:59.380]   She, I don't know actually what the cost is.
[00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:02.580]   I just, I Googled and it was expensive, it was way too much.
[00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:05.180]   And yeah, Jenna, if you're watching, don't get any ideas.
[00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:10.180]   And so, I, the thing is, is she would say,
[00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:13.240]   no, no, two of those are of extreme more value
[00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:15.640]   because of who made it and what I paid for it.
[00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:19.160]   And when we're talking about a woman understanding
[00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:22.260]   her value, she needs to understand who created her
[00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:23.800]   and what he paid for her.
[00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:26.740]   Who created her?
[00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:28.360]   - God. - Was God, that's right.
[00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:31.860]   God, every week, I can count on this guy, okay?
[00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:35.120]   God, it's that kid in Sunday school.
[00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:36.620]   Jesus, every single time.
[00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:38.660]   (congregation laughing)
[00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:43.660]   God crafted and created woman with purpose,
[00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:49.040]   with a mission, with his heart, with a unique design.
[00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:52.180]   And I thank God that he created women.
[00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:54.860]   But what's so amazing about that
[00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:58.460]   is because the God of the universe is your creator,
[00:17:58.460 --> 00:18:00.180]   that means that you have more value
[00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:02.900]   than you could ever comprehend.
[00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:04.980]   And not only did he create you,
[00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:08.200]   but he is so good that he created you distinctly
[00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:10.460]   in his image.
[00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:12.480]   Genesis 1, 27 says,
[00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:15.140]   "So God created man in his own image.
[00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:17.140]   In the image of God, he created him.
[00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:20.140]   Male and female, he created them."
[00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:22.400]   You are made in the image of God
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:25.960]   and the purpose of your life is to bear his image,
[00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:28.440]   to represent his image, that when you live,
[00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:29.820]   you're not living for yourself.
[00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:32.820]   You're living as a representative of the King of kings
[00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:35.220]   and the Lord of lords who is in love with you,
[00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:38.560]   who is obsessed with you, has given you so much purpose
[00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:41.420]   and that's where your value comes from.
[00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:44.780]   You're not just made up by random chance.
[00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:48.420]   You're not just here for some watered down version of life.
[00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:50.980]   You are a daughter of the King of kings
[00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:53.340]   and men, you want a princess.
[00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:56.740]   You want someone who sees themself as such.
[00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:59.620]   Because then when she understands her value,
[00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:02.220]   when she understands what she was put on earth to do,
[00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:04.260]   there is a confidence and an assurance about her
[00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:06.620]   that will change your life.
[00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:10.980]   That's why you shouldn't settle for anything less
[00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:14.880]   than a woman who understands who her father is,
[00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:16.700]   what she was made for,
[00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:18.780]   a woman who isn't obsessed with her own image,
[00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:20.140]   but being an image bearer,
[00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:25.220]   a woman who seeks to serve that God who created her.
[00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:29.140]   What's even more crazy is he did not stop
[00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:32.060]   at simply making man and woman in his image,
[00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:37.340]   but he paid an immense price to be with them forever.
[00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:41.300]   And apart from anything else, forget the dating crap,
[00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:44.060]   forget everything else, is she, is he, I don't care.
[00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:47.680]   What I want you to know is that God loved you so much
[00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:50.060]   that he saw the sin in your world
[00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:52.340]   and that while you were a sinner,
[00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:54.800]   he sent his son to pay the price
[00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:56.400]   that you and I could never pay.
[00:19:57.660 --> 00:20:01.300]   That our sin was gonna build up a more and more debt
[00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:04.700]   that would keep us further and further away from God.
[00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:09.140]   And God wanted to be with you so bad that he said,
[00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:12.780]   "Take my one and only son."
[00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:15.140]   This is more worth than a bag.
[00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:17.820]   This is more worth than a car or a house
[00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:19.320]   or whatever you could buy in this world.
[00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:23.460]   This was his one and only son who came down to earth
[00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:27.340]   and God saw you as worth it for him to die on a cross
[00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:28.740]   for you.
[00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:32.700]   He bore stripes on his back.
[00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:35.780]   Bible says, "By his wounds, we are healed."
[00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:38.620]   First Corinthians 6 20 says that you were bought
[00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:43.180]   with a price, which was the blood of Jesus
[00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:45.460]   that was shed on the cross for you.
[00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:48.540]   And he died and they buried him.
[00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:50.540]   Three days later, he rose again,
[00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:52.540]   now claiming victory over sin
[00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:55.380]   and so that you and I could be with God, our creator,
[00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:59.220]   forever and in light of that, it changes everything.
[00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:02.260]   It changes everything about our past, present and future.
[00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:03.500]   And no matter what you've done,
[00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:05.540]   if you do not have that relationship,
[00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:07.860]   if you have never understood the value
[00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:10.920]   that you are worth, the son of God,
[00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:12.860]   coming down and dying for you,
[00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:15.300]   you should not worry about any other relationship.
[00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:17.020]   You should stop looking for a man,
[00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:18.540]   men, you should stop looking for women.
[00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:20.940]   You should look at Jesus
[00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:22.740]   and you should do everything you can
[00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:25.620]   to establish that firm relationship
[00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:28.220]   and experience the abundant life that comes from it.
[00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:32.700]   No other relationship will meet and satisfy the longing
[00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:35.220]   and the needs of your soul like he can.
[00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:36.660]   And if you keep asking the question,
[00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:39.820]   is she dateable, is he dateable, is this, is that,
[00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:43.100]   and you're missing Jesus, nothing will work.
[00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:44.820]   Jesus is everything.
[00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:45.940]   He is the glue.
[00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:48.460]   He is the answer to the equation that everyone's asking.
[00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:51.780]   It's all about Jesus.
[00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:55.220]   Jesus came down to establish a relationship with you
[00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:57.160]   so that you could be in relationship with other people,
[00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:59.440]   but without him, impossible.
[00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:02.660]   So get that one right.
[00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:05.900]   And men, do not settle.
[00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:09.740]   You make sure you care for her enough to say,
[00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:13.300]   "Hey, I'm not gonna get into this with you.
[00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:15.940]   "I'm not gonna, there's nothing more important
[00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:18.900]   "about this relationship than a relationship with God."
[00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:22.420]   And point her to where her value comes from,
[00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:24.980]   her creator and what he was willing to pay,
[00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:27.000]   the blood of his son.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.140]   And if she knows that,
[00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:34.060]   you've got yourself a woman that is dateable.
[00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:37.300]   But the reality is, is I think a lot of people,
[00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:42.120]   a lot of ladies, they like know in their minds
[00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:45.460]   that through the blood of Jesus, they're set free,
[00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:46.860]   but they don't live like it.
[00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:52.620]   They live so bound, so pent up, so afraid,
[00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:57.620]   so idol-driven by fear of man or perception of others
[00:22:57.620 --> 00:23:03.660]   or need for control, perfectionism, an image-based reality.
[00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:08.780]   You wanna find someone who understands the power
[00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:12.380]   of the blood of Jesus, and they live like it's true,
[00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:14.780]   not just with their words, but with their life.
[00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:17.660]   'Cause the reality is,
[00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:22.100]   there are a lot of things that the world tells us
[00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:24.700]   makes someone valuable other than Jesus.
[00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:26.460]   Like Jesus isn't like the ultimate,
[00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:28.900]   like here's where your worth is found.
[00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:32.140]   And so to understand where value is,
[00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:34.800]   you have to also understand where it is not.
[00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:36.380]   And I'm gonna specifically talk about,
[00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:38.820]   hey, I think these are two areas where women
[00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:41.540]   look to for value, but you're never gonna find it.
[00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:43.980]   And men, if they're searching for value in these things,
[00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:45.700]   she is not dateable.
[00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:49.940]   The first one, value is not found in looks.
[00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:54.180]   Value is not found in the outward.
[00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:55.820]   That's all in scripture.
[00:23:55.820 --> 00:24:00.420]   Value is not found in what other people think about you
[00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:01.900]   or what you think about yourself.
[00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:06.780]   And at a time where body celebration is so praised
[00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:08.180]   and so clapped for,
[00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:11.600]   why is everyone so anxious and depressed?
[00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:15.100]   Why are they constantly looking at themselves in the mirror,
[00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:17.180]   wondering if they're enough?
[00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:18.300]   If it's worth celebrating,
[00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:20.300]   why internally am I not celebrating?
[00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:24.660]   Why am I still chasing, still striving for that affirmation?
[00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:28.580]   Because that's not where true value is found.
[00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:31.900]   First Peter three, verse three says this,
[00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:35.220]   "Do not let your adorning be external."
[00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:37.660]   So do not let the reason why people praise you
[00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:40.300]   or adore you be from anything on the outward.
[00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:44.400]   The braiding of hair and the putting on of gold jewelry
[00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:46.420]   or the clothing you wear.
[00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:50.300]   "But let your adorning be the hidden person of the heart
[00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:52.060]   with the imperishable."
[00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:53.960]   It means it will not fade.
[00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:57.900]   "The imperishable beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit."
[00:24:57.900 --> 00:24:58.980]   Now, for some of you strong women,
[00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:01.700]   I'm gonna address that, just give me a minute.
[00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:03.660]   They're like, what do you mean quiet?
[00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:08.540]   "Which in God's sight is very precious.
[00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:11.420]   For this is how the holy women who hoped in God
[00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:13.460]   used to adorn themselves."
[00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:15.080]   Here's what he means by quiet and gentle,
[00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:17.980]   just to get this really quick.
[00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:20.460]   It does not mean that women need to shut up and sit down.
[00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:22.840]   It does not mean that women are here to cook and clean
[00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:24.380]   and take care of the kids.
[00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:26.600]   It does not mean that, okay?
[00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:32.880]   However, what it does mean is when it says a woman
[00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:37.440]   who is quiet and gentle, this actually word,
[00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:39.300]   it translates to tranquil,
[00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:42.460]   which also translates to a peaceful spirit.
[00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:46.220]   This same word was used to describe Jesus actually,
[00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:49.500]   which also tells me that this isn't gender specific,
[00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:52.120]   that this is a word used,
[00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:56.500]   this is a word used to describe the image bearer of Jesus,
[00:25:56.500 --> 00:26:00.200]   you and I, someone that is marked by peace.
[00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:03.780]   When you see them, you're not feeling like, oh my gosh,
[00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:05.260]   someone that's like constantly nagging,
[00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:07.900]   complaining, gossiping, well this, well that,
[00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:12.440]   and always stressed out, but simply composed and peaceful,
[00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:15.700]   because they know Jesus, the author of peace,
[00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:17.700]   the prince of peace.
[00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:19.060]   That's what this is saying.
[00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:23.780]   But before we get to that, what it is not,
[00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:27.820]   value is not found in the external.
[00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:29.980]   And fellas, you need to know,
[00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:32.460]   and you need to be able to answer this question,
[00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:36.300]   is she holy or is she just hot?
[00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:37.140]   Okay?
[00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:39.980]   Is she holy or is she just hot?
[00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:41.180]   Because I think a lot of times,
[00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:43.800]   attraction can be like drunk goggles
[00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:47.860]   that do not give us clear vision into the heart of a woman.
[00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:50.840]   The Bible says in Proverbs that charm is deceitful
[00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:52.500]   and beauty is fleeting,
[00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:55.740]   but a woman who fears the Lord is worthy of praise.
[00:26:55.740 --> 00:27:00.660]   Charm is deceitful, beauty is fleeting.
[00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:02.020]   She might be smooth with her words,
[00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:04.420]   they might come off her lips like honeycomb.
[00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:05.700]   She might be able to whisper
[00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:08.340]   and do all these weird seductive things
[00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:10.900]   and make you feel some type of way,
[00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:15.300]   but what we're seeing here is none of that
[00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:16.940]   makes a girl dateable.
[00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:21.020]   None of that is what brings a girl value.
[00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:22.740]   And if you wanna know what a girl thinks
[00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:26.420]   about her outward appearance, go to her Instagram.
[00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:28.180]   Go to her Instagram.
[00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:30.060]   Her Instagram will tell you really quick
[00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:33.140]   if she idolizes her outward appearance.
[00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:35.600]   And I wanna address something.
[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:37.220]   There's this thing I'm seeing
[00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:39.500]   leaking into Christian culture that I just,
[00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:41.160]   I haven't heard anyone talk about it.
[00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:42.860]   I'm gonna do it at the risk of,
[00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:45.060]   I don't know, tomatoes getting thrown at me.
[00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:51.420]   There are girls that I go on Instagram,
[00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:56.020]   friends, that post pictures like this.
[00:27:56.020 --> 00:28:01.240]   (congregation laughing)
[00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:05.940]   Okay, the camera's over there.
[00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:07.020]   They're facing over here,
[00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:08.140]   and I heard apparently you're supposed to
[00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:10.380]   go on your toes or something,
[00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:12.800]   and like the angle and everything.
[00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:15.620]   And the reality is there's a sunset over here
[00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:17.620]   that they're not even looking at,
[00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:20.780]   and the caption says, "Love God's creation."
[00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:25.780]   And all my brothers in Christ are like,
[00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:27.580]   "I love God's creation too."
[00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:31.820]   They're not looking at the sun,
[00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:32.980]   they're looking at the moon.
[00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:33.820]   And so,
[00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:37.160]   (congregation laughing)
[00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:43.800]   but do you know what I do?
[00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:47.620]   They get three strikes, all right?
[00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:49.780]   And then they get unfollowed.
[00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:50.620]   Wanna know why?
[00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:55.260]   What do you want me to look at?
[00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:57.300]   No, I'm being for real.
[00:28:57.300 --> 00:29:00.660]   Ask yourself that.
[00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:02.220]   What do you want us to look at?
[00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:04.060]   (congregation laughing)
[00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:08.480]   Like, there's no other answer than the back of you.
[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:14.060]   And you come to the porch time and time again,
[00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:16.340]   and I hear you celebrating.
[00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:18.520]   It's not about physical attraction.
[00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:19.720]   Look at the heart.
[00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:22.100]   But I look at your Instagram,
[00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:24.260]   and there's just this, it doesn't match up.
[00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:26.660]   I see your skin.
[00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:31.320]   I see things that as just your brother in Christ,
[00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:35.660]   I'm telling you what you post tells me about what you value
[00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:38.460]   and what you think your value comes from.
[00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:41.700]   It also tells me how much you value your brothers in Christ
[00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:43.460]   who are trying to live for Jesus.
[00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:46.660]   It matters.
[00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:50.020]   How you post matters.
[00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:52.900]   What you wear matters.
[00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:54.220]   Why does it matter?
[00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:58.320]   Because it's feeding something.
[00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:01.220]   It's feeding a false sense of where value
[00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:02.580]   and self-worth lies.
[00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:09.000]   And I know, I know the reason why you do it
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.660]   is because sadly, a lot of guys in this room
[00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:12.920]   and girls like it.
[00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:16.880]   And that tells you, oh, look, I do this,
[00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:21.240]   I get attention, I get affirmation.
[00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:24.600]   And it, for a moment, fix your loneliness.
[00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:28.440]   For a moment, it allows you to forget about your singleness
[00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:31.820]   and the endorphins released when that post comes
[00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:33.540]   and all those girls saying yes, queen
[00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:35.480]   with those clapping emojis.
[00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:37.000]   And they're saying all these different things,
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.240]   it makes you feel good.
[00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:43.340]   But if you treat yourself like bait and you dangle it up,
[00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:45.400]   the sharks will bite.
[00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:46.840]   And you don't want sharks.
[00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:50.320]   That's not the kind of men you want.
[00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:53.020]   But it's what you're communicating with what you post.
[00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:55.520]   So I'll get off my soapbox.
[00:30:55.520 --> 00:31:00.120]   But first Peter here is saying the external
[00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:02.380]   is not what makes a woman valuable.
[00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:03.220]   Then what is it?
[00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:05.400]   If it's not if she's just hot or not,
[00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:08.760]   if she's actually holy, what does it look like
[00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:11.880]   for a girl to be holy?
[00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:12.720]   He says in verse four,
[00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:17.180]   "But let your adorning be the hidden person of the heart,
[00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:22.620]   "with the imperishable beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit,
[00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:25.500]   "which in God's sight is very precious."
[00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:30.000]   Ladies, let me just say, you want that.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.840]   You don't want a man who will look at you.
[00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:38.840]   You want someone that in God's sight is very precious.
[00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:43.880]   That when God looks at you, he's like, she gets it.
[00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:50.000]   She's focusing on her soul, not herself.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.020]   She gets it.
[00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:57.800]   She gets that life is about me and men.
[00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:02.960]   May we be men who do not feed and help the enemy
[00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:06.560]   in convincing women that they have to be
[00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:09.440]   both attend physically and spiritually
[00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:11.480]   and create these unrealistic expectations
[00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:14.440]   that keeps them chasing and chasing and chasing
[00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:17.040]   and striving and striving and striving.
[00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:19.200]   May we be men who does not celebrate
[00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:23.480]   and lead them to believe that it's about the outward,
[00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:26.320]   but be men who chase after the inside of a woman,
[00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:28.800]   the heart, her soul.
[00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:33.240]   The last thing we should be asking is,
[00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:35.860]   can she follow you?
[00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:39.320]   Can she follow you?
[00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:41.940]   As you, we talked about in the Is He Datable
[00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:45.520]   that the Bible tells us the roles of how Christ
[00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:49.360]   is the head of every man and the man, the head of a woman.
[00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:50.660]   And the head of Christ is God.
[00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:54.800]   And so there's these roles we see, not ranks, these roles,
[00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:57.000]   whereas the man's responsibility,
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:01.300]   the opportunity to get to lead and servant lead his woman.
[00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:06.240]   But in order to do that, there are things that he must be
[00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:08.760]   for her to feel like he is worth following.
[00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:10.140]   He is worth respecting.
[00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:13.960]   But she has to be able to see the right things
[00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:16.120]   and be able to tell the right things.
[00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:19.920]   She is datable if she's able to follow you.
[00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:22.040]   But first you have to ask yourself as the leader,
[00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:23.960]   I had to turn it back to the men for just a moment.
[00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:25.960]   You have to be able to ask yourself and you
[00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:27.000]   and the community around you,
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.340]   a brother should be able to say, yeah, yeah,
[00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:32.500]   when I read this, you are that man.
[00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:34.920]   You are someone she can follow.
[00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:35.760]   Now we don't know yet,
[00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:38.200]   but I talk about if she actually can,
[00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:40.720]   but you are someone that is living for the Lord,
[00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:42.120]   that you are living this way,
[00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:45.340]   that we would happily send you to go and pursue a woman
[00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:46.280]   that is datable.
[00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:52.000]   Because the reality is, is if you find a girl
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:55.480]   who hasn't given her heart to Jesus,
[00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:59.920]   who hasn't found her value in the blood of Jesus
[00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:02.000]   and the price paid for her,
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.600]   the reality is, is that she won't follow you.
[00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:07.260]   She's going to need you.
[00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:10.280]   She's going to like desperately need you
[00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:12.640]   to be the source of her life,
[00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:17.220]   the lifeline to her joy and satisfaction and significance.
[00:34:17.220 --> 00:34:20.300]   One of the most attractive things when I was,
[00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:22.420]   my fiancee, Jenna,
[00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:27.420]   when I was assessing if I should ask her to be my girlfriend
[00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:29.700]   we went to this coffee, we were talking,
[00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:33.980]   and I was just asking her questions to see
[00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:36.440]   who is this girl right now?
[00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:41.020]   Like, is she an individual who understands her role
[00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:42.600]   as a daughter of the King?
[00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:46.000]   Or is she looking to me to be her only kind
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.200]   of spiritual connection to God?
[00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:50.040]   And she said this line that when she said it,
[00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:52.120]   I literally was like, marry me right now.
[00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:54.600]   She said this, she said, here's what I think.
[00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:57.160]   I think a lot of people, they idolize relationships.
[00:34:57.160 --> 00:34:59.200]   And I know that God wants us to be in a relationship.
[00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:00.240]   And I know that marriage is a good thing,
[00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:01.560]   but so many people around me,
[00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:04.320]   they're just so obsessed with idolizing relationships.
[00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:05.820]   And that tells her that they're not living
[00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:08.500]   as if Jesus is coming back tomorrow.
[00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:11.120]   Because here's what I know, JD.
[00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:12.700]   I just met this girl, okay?
[00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:14.400]   I'm like, okay, keep on listening.
[00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:18.160]   She says, JD, I, one day,
[00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:21.200]   if I die or if Jesus returns,
[00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:23.020]   I'm gonna stand before my creator.
[00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:27.320]   And he is not gonna say, well done, my good and faithful,
[00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:31.480]   married person to JD or to this person.
[00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:34.640]   He's gonna say, well done, my good and faithful, Jenna.
[00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:36.720]   At least that's what I hope he's gonna say.
[00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:40.580]   I'm on a mission for Jesus to look at me and say,
[00:35:40.580 --> 00:35:43.860]   well done, my good and faithful, Jenna.
[00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:48.460]   I don't need a relationship
[00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:50.280]   because I'm on a mission for Jesus.
[00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:53.900]   She understood the relationship
[00:35:53.900 --> 00:35:55.900]   and the opportunity she had with God.
[00:35:55.900 --> 00:35:59.000]   And when a woman understands what it's like
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.140]   to fully follow Jesus,
[00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:04.040]   it makes it that much easier for her to identify
[00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:07.140]   how to follow you and to keep following Jesus.
[00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:09.180]   What I loved about that statement from her
[00:36:09.180 --> 00:36:12.500]   is that that showed me that I did not feel responsible
[00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:15.000]   to ignite her flame for Christ.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.780]   I simply now was given the responsibility to just fan it.
[00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:20.780]   I got to fan her dreams.
[00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:24.720]   I got to encourage, I get to encourage her hopes
[00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:26.780]   for her ministry and the women around her
[00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:28.860]   and the passions that she has.
[00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:30.140]   Why?
[00:36:30.140 --> 00:36:32.360]   Because she's following Jesus.
[00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:33.980]   She doesn't need me.
[00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:37.120]   She has a real relationship with him all on her own.
[00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:40.820]   And so it's really important
[00:36:40.820 --> 00:36:43.260]   that as I'm about to read this and wrap up,
[00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:45.140]   we understand what it looks like
[00:36:45.140 --> 00:36:47.940]   to have roles as individuals,
[00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:51.260]   but then roles in a relationship with one another.
[00:36:51.260 --> 00:36:52.100]   And like we always say,
[00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:54.220]   like the Bible doesn't talk about dating.
[00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:57.400]   However, we believe that dating is a destination
[00:36:57.400 --> 00:37:00.500]   that leads to a promise, which is marriage.
[00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:03.020]   The Bible is full about helpful things
[00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:04.300]   about God's design for marriage.
[00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:06.200]   And so we oftentimes pull from that
[00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:08.000]   to tell us how we should date
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:09.980]   to align with what God would have for us for marriage.
[00:37:09.980 --> 00:37:11.260]   And if you've been to a wedding,
[00:37:11.260 --> 00:37:14.580]   you've heard the pastor read probably from Ephesians 5.
[00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:16.040]   He says this, verse 21.
[00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:18.820]   I want you to first acknowledge this,
[00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:23.820]   submitting to one another out of reverence for Christ.
[00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:26.980]   Wives and husbands.
[00:37:26.980 --> 00:37:30.160]   Wives, submit to your own husbands as to the Lord,
[00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:31.680]   for the husband is the head of the wife,
[00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:33.420]   even as Christ is the head of the church,
[00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:36.300]   his body, and is himself its savior.
[00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:37.820]   Now, as the church submits to Christ,
[00:37:37.820 --> 00:37:41.580]   so also wives should submit in everything to their husbands.
[00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:44.420]   Husbands, love your wives as Christ loved the church
[00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:45.820]   and gave himself up for her,
[00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:47.420]   that he might sanctify her,
[00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:50.040]   having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word,
[00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:52.660]   so that he might present the church to himself in splendor
[00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:55.420]   without spot or wrinkle or any such thing
[00:37:55.420 --> 00:37:59.180]   that she might be holy and without blemish.
[00:37:59.180 --> 00:38:00.500]   Go to verse 33, it says,
[00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:05.500]   "However, let each one of you love his wife as himself,
[00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:09.580]   and let the wife see that she respects her husband."
[00:38:09.580 --> 00:38:11.760]   I know that this passage mentions the S word
[00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:14.200]   that we don't like, submit.
[00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:16.280]   There's a bad connotation on this word, submission,
[00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:17.980]   but it's actually a really beautiful thing
[00:38:17.980 --> 00:38:19.760]   when you take time, I don't have time to go into right now,
[00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:22.600]   but when you take time to see how like intricate
[00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:25.000]   and the details God is about the way that he designed
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:26.520]   the relationship between man and woman
[00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:30.960]   and husband and wife to exemplify into parallel
[00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:33.720]   with his relationship with us, with Jesus with us,
[00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:38.280]   with the church, it is just amazing, it's masterful.
[00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:40.000]   And I would encourage you to really get down
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.760]   and learn what it looks like
[00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:44.600]   to understand your role in a relationship.
[00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:46.860]   But part of the woman's role we see here very plainly
[00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:51.060]   is that she is called to follow and respect the man
[00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:52.720]   as the leader of the household.
[00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:54.880]   Does not mean she's less than,
[00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:58.760]   but she gets the opportunity to follow the man.
[00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:02.680]   And you have to ask yourself, like I said, man,
[00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:06.400]   are you someone worth following?
[00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:10.720]   But is she someone who knows how to follow you?
[00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:12.800]   Or are you compromising?
[00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:13.960]   Are you settling?
[00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:17.780]   Are you looking for someone and convincing yourself
[00:39:17.780 --> 00:39:20.100]   that, yeah, she'll know how to like be in a relationship
[00:39:20.100 --> 00:39:21.160]   with God and all these different things
[00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:22.800]   and trying to convince yourself
[00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:24.280]   of something that's not a reality.
[00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:26.840]   Because if she is not ready to follow you,
[00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:29.540]   you both will end up being hurt and losing in the end.
[00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:33.960]   David had mentioned a illustration that he had heard before
[00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:36.280]   where there was this amazing race,
[00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:39.120]   marriage edition, husband and wife.
[00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:41.840]   And when you watch the race as they would come,
[00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:43.320]   you know, they're married, they're so in love,
[00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:44.160]   they haven't seen each other,
[00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:45.320]   they've gone through all these hard things,
[00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:46.360]   these different obstacles,
[00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:48.840]   and they get up to each other, high five, go.
[00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:51.960]   They don't stop and be like, so how was your time?
[00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:52.780]   Like, how was this?
[00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:53.620]   How was that?
[00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:54.700]   They look into each other's eyes,
[00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:56.360]   engage in an intimate moment.
[00:39:56.360 --> 00:39:57.320]   No, why?
[00:39:57.320 --> 00:39:59.360]   Because they were on a mission.
[00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:01.880]   They were on a mission, they were on a destination to win,
[00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:04.280]   to claim victory as a couple together.
[00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:09.120]   You wanna look for someone who is on mission with you.
[00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:13.560]   A woman that knows what it looks like to follow you,
[00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:17.240]   but more importantly, to follow Jesus with you.
[00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:21.200]   So just ask yourself, is she on the same page as you
[00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:25.340]   when it comes to the vision of the covenant of marriage?
[00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:27.260]   That is an everlasting covenant,
[00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:29.740]   that divorce is not an option.
[00:40:29.740 --> 00:40:32.260]   The divorce is not even in the category,
[00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:33.100]   it's not in the picture.
[00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:36.120]   Does she understand what you want to lead in a marriage?
[00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:38.620]   Does she understand that you have the desire,
[00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:41.900]   hopefully, to make disciples in your home?
[00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:45.300]   That the church is us, and we have a responsibility
[00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:48.060]   to invite people in, to show hospitality?
[00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:50.360]   Or does she wanna be one of those couples
[00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:52.500]   that once you get married, we have those people
[00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:54.180]   that once they got married, you never saw them again,
[00:40:54.180 --> 00:40:55.180]   and just bounced?
[00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:58.420]   But the ministry does not stop.
[00:40:58.420 --> 00:41:00.220]   The end goal is not marriage.
[00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:03.260]   If the end goal for her is marriage,
[00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:05.660]   what a sad life after your 20s.
[00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:09.880]   Like, if that's all, if that's everything,
[00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:14.660]   is marriage, like, once I get married, my life's set.
[00:41:14.660 --> 00:41:17.080]   That's gonna, I mean,
[00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:18.960]   the guy's gonna let you down real quick.
[00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:20.400]   You're gonna be like, this is it?
[00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:23.000]   This is all I planned for?
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:27.360]   You want someone who is ready to run the amazing race
[00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:30.060]   with Jesus, with you, on mission, together.
[00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:32.660]   A woman who understands that, hey, life is not about us,
[00:41:32.660 --> 00:41:34.340]   life is about serving others.
[00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:36.380]   It's not about building our own kingdom,
[00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:37.860]   it's about building God's kingdom.
[00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:40.740]   It's not about posting and building our own love story
[00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:41.860]   and sharing it with the world.
[00:41:41.860 --> 00:41:42.980]   It's about telling the world
[00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:46.160]   of the greatest love story to ever exist,
[00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:48.060]   the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:50.600]   Are you a leader worth following?
[00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:54.200]   And is she able to follow you?
[00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:57.000]   And are you both able to follow Jesus
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:00.760]   in this amazing race called life, a life with Him?
[00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:03.400]   I'll close with this.
[00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:07.520]   I know that I got this feedback from some girls.
[00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:08.960]   If you go to the comments on YouTube
[00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:11.440]   or coming down up front after the last message
[00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:12.800]   on is he dateable, they were like,
[00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:14.640]   this is all nice in theory.
[00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:16.520]   And when I write it down in my journal,
[00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:20.020]   but then I walk out and I'm like, these guys don't exist.
[00:42:20.020 --> 00:42:23.220]   First of that, I would say, that's not true.
[00:42:23.220 --> 00:42:25.000]   They exist.
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:26.500]   They exist.
[00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:27.960]   Be patient, they exist.
[00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:32.180]   But then also to that, I know that guys,
[00:42:32.180 --> 00:42:34.540]   you could be feeling the same thing right now.
[00:42:34.540 --> 00:42:37.820]   That like, man, do girls like this really exist?
[00:42:37.820 --> 00:42:39.940]   Or do relationships like this really exist?
[00:42:39.940 --> 00:42:44.780]   Could I be a man like this who really exists?
[00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:46.660]   Could God really provide something like this?
[00:42:46.660 --> 00:42:48.980]   'Cause I think that some of you are not convinced
[00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:52.220]   that you are worthy of a love life like this.
[00:42:52.220 --> 00:42:55.040]   And I will tell you something.
[00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:59.040]   Jesus rewrites history.
[00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:05.540]   He takes everything about your past and He redeems it.
[00:43:05.540 --> 00:43:07.820]   He changes it.
[00:43:07.820 --> 00:43:09.560]   He makes you new.
[00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:12.060]   No matter how many people you slept with,
[00:43:12.060 --> 00:43:15.580]   no matter how many images you've looked at,
[00:43:15.580 --> 00:43:18.540]   no matter how many relationships have ended poorly,
[00:43:18.540 --> 00:43:20.980]   how many times you've cheated on.
[00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:25.220]   And guys, I know, I know, there are many of you
[00:43:25.220 --> 00:43:28.700]   that are okay with just friends with benefits
[00:43:28.700 --> 00:43:30.740]   and hooking up every weekend
[00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:32.900]   because you've tried to emotionally connect
[00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:36.100]   with a girl before and she hurt you.
[00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:37.580]   She cheated on you.
[00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:39.500]   She left you when things got hard
[00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:41.580]   or she just got bored with you.
[00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:42.900]   And I know since then, He made the decision,
[00:43:42.900 --> 00:43:43.900]   like I'm kind of out on that.
[00:43:43.900 --> 00:43:46.160]   Maybe when I'm like maybe way later in life.
[00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:49.360]   But Jesus rewrites history.
[00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:55.980]   His love for you can change the way that you love others,
[00:43:55.980 --> 00:44:00.660]   the way that you experience love and intimacy with others.
[00:44:00.660 --> 00:44:03.840]   And I know for some of you girls,
[00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:07.620]   you might be like, check, check, check, I'm dateable.
[00:44:07.620 --> 00:44:08.460]   Where are they?
[00:44:08.460 --> 00:44:10.600]   Let's just be real.
[00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:12.820]   Maybe you're like, hello, beep, beep,
[00:44:12.820 --> 00:44:13.920]   can I get a neon sign?
[00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:19.540]   I would say to you, be patient.
[00:44:19.540 --> 00:44:26.040]   Be patient and have perspective.
[00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:33.060]   Never lose perspective on all that you have available to you
[00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:39.500]   in your already abiding relationship with Jesus.
[00:44:40.340 --> 00:44:41.980]   It's enough.
[00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:44.080]   Even when it doesn't feel like it.
[00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:46.880]   Even in those lonely hours, I've been there, it's enough.
[00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:50.820]   And trust me, you don't wanna settle.
[00:44:50.820 --> 00:44:55.060]   You'd rather be 40 and single than 40 and miserable
[00:44:55.060 --> 00:44:57.680]   in a relationship with someone
[00:44:57.680 --> 00:45:02.600]   that wasn't putting in the work to be this kind of person.
[00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:09.900]   Ladies, if this isn't you, it's worth it.
[00:45:09.900 --> 00:45:11.940]   Let Jesus begin to change your life
[00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:15.260]   and be a girl who has given her heart to Jesus,
[00:45:15.260 --> 00:45:17.400]   not just with her words, but with her life.
[00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:19.180]   A girl who understands her value,
[00:45:19.180 --> 00:45:20.940]   that she was created by the God of the universe,
[00:45:20.940 --> 00:45:23.140]   bought with a price by the blood of his son.
[00:45:23.140 --> 00:45:25.600]   And a girl who understands what it looks like
[00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:28.580]   to follow a man after God's own heart.
[00:45:28.580 --> 00:45:29.460]   You can do it.
[00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:32.260]   I know it's hard.
[00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:34.720]   I know it might seem unrealistic, but you can do it.
[00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:39.260]   After three months of testing and questioning,
[00:45:39.260 --> 00:45:42.540]   we found out that I indeed am the match
[00:45:42.540 --> 00:45:44.260]   for Ryan Michaels' kidney.
[00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:45.940]   And I get...
[00:45:45.940 --> 00:45:49.440]   (congregation applauding)
[00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:55.020]   I get to give my kidney to Ryan in two weeks from today,
[00:45:55.020 --> 00:45:57.140]   which is just unbelievable.
[00:45:57.140 --> 00:45:59.220]   I don't say that to be like, "Oh my God."
[00:45:59.220 --> 00:46:01.300]   Like, please do not come down here and say that so often.
[00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:03.200]   Don't, that's not why I'm sharing this.
[00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:08.320]   I'm sharing this because in that picture,
[00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:12.620]   we were super happy, but there were months of despair.
[00:46:12.620 --> 00:46:18.780]   Ryan on dialysis, Ryan and his wife crying to me,
[00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:24.500]   Ryan in ICU, suffering on suffering on suffering.
[00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:28.420]   But you know what made that moment so joyful
[00:46:28.420 --> 00:46:29.300]   and so exciting?
[00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:31.180]   When I got that call and they said,
[00:46:31.180 --> 00:46:33.820]   "Mr. Rogers, you are a match."
[00:46:33.820 --> 00:46:36.240]   I stood up, I began to scream, why?
[00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:38.540]   Because I knew that they were right
[00:46:38.540 --> 00:46:43.040]   because they did so much work to know that they know
[00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:45.740]   that they know that I was a match for Ryan.
[00:46:45.740 --> 00:46:47.300]   There was not a doubt in my mind,
[00:46:47.300 --> 00:46:48.540]   not a question in my mind,
[00:46:48.540 --> 00:46:52.140]   because we put in so much work to make sure
[00:46:52.140 --> 00:46:55.340]   that when I go and they give my kidney to Ryan,
[00:46:55.340 --> 00:46:56.900]   his body would be able to accept it
[00:46:56.900 --> 00:46:58.660]   because they have put in so much work,
[00:46:58.660 --> 00:47:00.580]   asked all the right questions.
[00:47:00.580 --> 00:47:03.060]   And I would say to you, it's the same way.
[00:47:03.060 --> 00:47:06.840]   When you are in a relationship, it should feel so right.
[00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:08.320]   Joy should come out of it.
[00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:09.760]   Love should come out of it.
[00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:13.480]   Peace, not chaos, excitement for what God is doing
[00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:15.360]   and the story that he's writing in your life.
[00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:16.800]   That should be what you're experiencing
[00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:20.520]   if it's marked by someone who is truly datable God's way.
[00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:22.800]   But you only know that if you're willing to go
[00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:26.520]   through the hard work, asking the right questions,
[00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:28.960]   making the right changes in your life to say,
[00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:32.200]   "I will not date how culture tells me to date.
[00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:35.560]   "I will not settle for anyone who does not understand
[00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:37.440]   "their value and worth from Jesus.
[00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:39.980]   "I will do this the right way."
[00:47:39.980 --> 00:47:44.180]   And if you will, you will experience life on mission.
[00:47:44.180 --> 00:47:46.340]   You will experience life in an amazing way
[00:47:46.340 --> 00:47:48.540]   according to what God designed.
[00:47:48.540 --> 00:47:50.260]   That's what he wants from you.
[00:47:50.260 --> 00:47:52.540]   Anything else, you're settling,
[00:47:52.540 --> 00:47:55.900]   but there's better because of Jesus.
[00:47:55.900 --> 00:47:57.060]   This is possible.
[00:47:57.060 --> 00:48:02.140]   And I want it to be possible for every person in this room,
[00:48:02.140 --> 00:48:04.980]   whether single, dating, engaged, married,
[00:48:04.980 --> 00:48:08.020]   whatever stage, you understand where your worth comes from
[00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:11.380]   and it changes the way you live your life.
[00:48:11.380 --> 00:48:17.140]   I hope that every person in here is datable,
[00:48:17.140 --> 00:48:19.020]   not because of the way they look or act
[00:48:19.020 --> 00:48:21.020]   or 'cause they do the right things,
[00:48:21.020 --> 00:48:24.380]   because they've given their life to Jesus.
[00:48:24.380 --> 00:48:25.220]   Let's pray.
[00:48:25.220 --> 00:48:28.260]   God, we just...
[00:48:32.100 --> 00:48:37.100]   I know a talk like this can potentially bring forth shame
[00:48:37.100 --> 00:48:39.480]   and guilt, and right now, God,
[00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:41.140]   I ask that you would remove that.
[00:48:41.140 --> 00:48:45.860]   You are not a God of shame, but of love and of peace,
[00:48:45.860 --> 00:48:47.460]   of mercy.
[00:48:47.460 --> 00:48:50.420]   If there's someone right now who feels uncomfortable,
[00:48:50.420 --> 00:48:52.220]   would you wrap them up in your love?
[00:48:52.220 --> 00:48:55.840]   If there's someone right now in a relationship
[00:48:55.840 --> 00:48:58.300]   that is heading down a path towards destruction
[00:48:58.300 --> 00:49:01.320]   and devastation, would you bring clarity right now?
[00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:03.960]   That they would end that relationship
[00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:06.880]   and be committed to the right relationship with you.
[00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:09.480]   I pray against the rising rates of divorce
[00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:10.520]   on this generation.
[00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:14.760]   I pray that this generation will be marked by people
[00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:18.180]   who say, "We will do the work necessary to be different.
[00:49:18.180 --> 00:49:20.960]   We will do the work necessary
[00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:25.600]   to make sure that we pursue and honor and love
[00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:29.120]   our brothers and sisters the way that God calls us to,
[00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:30.520]   trusting that it's better,
[00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:34.160]   despite what we feel or what we think or anything else.
[00:49:34.160 --> 00:49:37.720]   We trust that it's better because God, you said it's better."
[00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:45.160]   I pray, God, that heartbreak would diminish,
[00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:50.960]   cheating would stop, that disciples would be made,
[00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:54.320]   that generations on generations on generations
[00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:57.840]   are impacted because we made a stand to be different.
[00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:03.640]   Not on our own strength, not on our own good deeds
[00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:07.000]   or our own performance, but because we are people
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:08.880]   who are marked by Jesus.
[00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:12.280]   Because we trust Him with our lives.
[00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:14.160]   We trust Him with our relationships.
[00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:16.760]   Come and do your work.
[00:50:16.760 --> 00:50:19.400]   Speak to us now as we respond in worship.
[00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:20.560]   In that I pray, amen.
