[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:21.360]   - All right, how are we doing?
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.640]   Man, it's amazing.
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:24.800]   Welcome friends in the room.
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.160]   What was amazing friends who are joining us, not here.
[00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.800]   It was just the worship session we just had.
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.120]   I'm sure it was amazing if you're in Fort Worth
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.400]   or Houston or wherever you are.
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.320]   I'm gonna start us off with a story
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.240]   as we continue this series called Bad Advice.
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.360]   We just look at these cultural expressions,
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.760]   beliefs and ideas that really were fed every day
[00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.080]   that if you really think about them,
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.840]   especially if you compare them to scripture, are bad advice.
[00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.280]   We've covered a couple of them related to follow your heart,
[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.960]   why that's a bad idea and bad advice.
[00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.640]   Good people go to heaven, that's bad advice.
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.560]   Try before you buy, bad advice.
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.120]   And tonight we're gonna continue that series.
[00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.120]   I'm gonna start with a story that'll kind of give us
[00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.160]   traction for where we're going.
[00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.720]   And I'm gonna let you guys in to one of my more
[00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.120]   embarrassing moments.
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.680]   And so I'd like for us to keep this in the room
[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.280]   and in the respective rooms, wherever you are.
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.360]   And this happened, so the last semester
[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.920]   of my senior year of college, I had a good friend
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.280]   who came up and we were talking and we were buddies
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.120]   and he had a part-time job and he was like,
[00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.640]   "Hey, you should do this part-time job."
[00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.880]   I mean, I'm like banking on it.
[00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.520]   His part-time job was, he was modeling.
[00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.380]   So his, let's call this friend Matt,
[00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:27.280]   because that was his name.
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.720]   And Matt was, and he made like $300 an hour.
[00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:31.840]   He's like, "Dude, it's crazy."
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.240]   You know, he just put on a shirt and he's like,
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.080]   "There you go."
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.160]   And he's like, "Man, you should try it out."
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.280]   One year guy, and there's like 3,000 redheads
[00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.160]   on the entire planet.
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.580]   So you know, probably you're not competing against a lot.
[00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:44.420]   So go for it.
[00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.360]   And so he connected all this stuff.
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.400]   I can't believe I'm telling this story.
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.120]   He connected and he's like, "Here, here's all you need to go.
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.240]   "Here's the person that'll call you."
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.240]   They reach out, they set up this entire like shoot,
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.880]   hey, show up, here's the day,
[00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.080]   here's the place to go to.
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.260]   You're gonna go do this shoot for this like clothing line.
[00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:02.760]   It was actually in Dallas.
[00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.760]   And it was like, you know, some retail clothing place.
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.240]   So anyways, hey, show up, you'll put on these jeans
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.480]   and then you'll do this picture thing.
[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:11.160]   Show up, the day comes, a little nervous,
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.000]   not what to expect.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.840]   Get there, going in the place,
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.800]   kinda not sure what this is all gonna look like.
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.060]   Go up and I meet the lady who essentially says,
[00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.480]   "Oh yes, David, here you go, perfect.
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.180]   "Oh, here's the jeans, there's a changing room,
[00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.540]   "go put 'em on."
[00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.300]   I go to the changing room
[00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.420]   and this whole experience is new to me.
[00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.700]   And I'm not the changing room,
[00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.380]   but just, you know, the whole picture thing.
[00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.540]   And I begin to put on these jeans
[00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.980]   and I begin to realize something very quickly.
[00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.160]   Houston, we have a problem, a big problem.
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.700]   I can't fit these jeans over my legs.
[00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.700]   I'm like, they must be giving me ladies jeans or something.
[00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.540]   I check the tag and they are my size.
[00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.700]   And I'm like, oh my gosh, these are so tight.
[00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.480]   I can barely fit them up over my legs.
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.100]   I'm looking in the mirror like, this cannot be right.
[00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.620]   This is not the style.
[00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.300]   And I'm pretty sure, but then in the back of my head,
[00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:57.340]   I'm like, this doesn't look right,
[00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.900]   but maybe, you know, they're like, it's European looking
[00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.420]   and it's the style that's coming in
[00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.380]   and maybe this is what they want.
[00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.060]   And I can literally, true story, like barely walk.
[00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.800]   And so I'm like, I guess I'll make my way over to the lady
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.600]   and I'm waddling like a penguin over to her.
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.700]   And I walk up to her and without missing a beat,
[00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.340]   she goes, she looks at me.
[00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.180]   Yeah, that's not gonna work.
[00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.400]   Okay, I think we're done.
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.460]   You can go change back out.
[00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:22.440]   Literally, she sent me back to the room,
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.940]   had me change out of it and that was it.
[00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.140]   That was the short-lived, any opportunity that I had
[00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.980]   of clearly, hey, this is not for me
[00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.100]   and I need to go on a diet or something.
[00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.140]   And it was one of those moments where I was like,
[00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.620]   ouch, lady, first off, a little harsh, please.
[00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:39.900]   Not that I disagree with you.
[00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.940]   I kind of have that thought in the changing room,
[00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.000]   but still a little stronger
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.300]   than I would have wanted to hear.
[00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.660]   And the truth is, what she was doing in that moment
[00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.140]   was she was being honest.
[00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:52.480]   She was telling the truth.
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:58.080]   She was maybe being a little judgmental, if you will,
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.440]   but she was saying what was right and what was true.
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.880]   And the reason I start there is because just like
[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.120]   in that scenario where clearly this person being me
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.440]   had not aligned to the standard of modeling.
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.800]   So my modeling career didn't make it
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.720]   and I had not aligned to what they were looking for
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.540]   in the same way and all she was doing was voicing that,
[00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.280]   communicating that in the same way.
[00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.880]   Tonight, we're gonna talk about a topic
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.860]   that involves and would require, just like that lady,
[00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.000]   speaking the truth honestly and what is accurate
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.920]   and what is true, even if it can feel judgmental
[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.700]   because it fails to meet the standard
[00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.580]   and how that is a necessary part
[00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.840]   of living the Christian life.
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.000]   Specifically, we're gonna talk about a bad advice
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.120]   that contradicts this idea for Christians especially.
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.760]   So this message is really tailored
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:50.980]   to those of us who are Christians,
[00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.920]   but I think if you're still figuring this whole thing out,
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.800]   maybe you're new to church for the first time in a while,
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:56.700]   maybe you left church,
[00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.440]   maybe you're not even sure what you believe,
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.080]   maybe tonight's message will give you a little bit
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.240]   of clarity around the idea of why Christians
[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.840]   have seemed so judgmental and have missed it
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.480]   as it relates to the topic we're about to talk about.
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.640]   Because there is an indication that we're given
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.720]   inside of the Bible that this idea of judging
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.520]   or holding someone to a standard
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.920]   and speaking the truth to them is a part
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:20.880]   of living the Christian life.
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.680]   You cannot be obedient to Jesus
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.400]   if you're unwilling to do that
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.960]   or if you're unwilling to have those voices
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.600]   inside of your life.
[00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:29.600]   But at the same time,
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:30.980]   Christians have really gotten this wrong.
[00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:32.560]   If you think about in culture what people think
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.680]   of when they think of Christians,
[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.720]   being judgmental, homophobic,
[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.960]   people who are self-righteous,
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.560]   all these different adjectives that a lot of times stem
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.680]   from the fact that culture feels so judged
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.760]   by the Christians who are very quick
[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.560]   to judge others outside the church,
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.320]   but not quick to judge and care for those inside the church.
[00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.200]   Very quick to say, "Disney, I can't believe Beauty
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.280]   and the Beast, and that's crazy.
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.240]   What was Gaston doing?
[00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.060]   Oh my gosh."
[00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.140]   But they're not quick to say,
[00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:02.700]   "Hey, inside of the church, we have a divorce problem.
[00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:04.440]   This is not okay.
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.140]   Pornography's not okay.
[00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:12.440]   That covering up pedophilia
[00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.480]   as has been a part of certain denominations is not okay.
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.480]   And the church of Christ has to be much better
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:19.320]   as it relates to this."
[00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.040]   And I think you were gonna discover tonight
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:24.200]   that for many people,
[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.840]   their impression of Christianity
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:27.960]   shaped by judgmental Christians
[00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.640]   is because those judgmental Christians
[00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:31.680]   just weren't handling this issue right.
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.240]   So we're gonna look and explore that tonight
[00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:34.800]   as we look at the bad advice
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.480]   that's often said in a number of different ways,
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:39.880]   but it relates to judging.
[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.440]   Sometimes it's expressed like this,
[00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:43.560]   "Man, who am I to judge?
[00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:44.560]   It's not really my place.
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:45.520]   You do you."
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:47.160]   Sometimes it's expressed like,
[00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.160]   "Hey, only God can judge me.
[00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:50.520]   Get off."
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:51.720]   Sometimes it's expressed like,
[00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.120]   "It's not really my place to judge."
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.680]   And tonight we're gonna talk about,
[00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:58.880]   for Christians, when it is your place to judge.
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:00.360]   And that it is.
[00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.320]   And there are places where it's required.
[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:05.360]   You cannot be obedient to Jesus,
[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:06.960]   and neither can I,
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.920]   without listening and applying what it looks like to judge.
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:11.360]   And by judge for the whole night,
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:14.760]   what I mean is holding to a standard.
[00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:16.040]   If I'm placing judgment,
[00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:18.240]   or if she's judging me for not fitting in those genes,
[00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.600]   she's saying, "You don't fit the standard,"
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:22.440]   or, "This is where you're falling short of the standard."
[00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:25.000]   So by judge, I mean holding others to the standard.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   So we're gonna be in the book of 1 Corinthians.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:27.840]   If you have a Bible,
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:29.840]   you can flip over to 1 Corinthians chapter five,
[00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:31.920]   Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Acts, Roman, Corinthians.
[00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:34.080]   Here's what the letter of 1 Corinthians is.
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:35.840]   It's a letter written by the apostle Paul
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:37.280]   to the church in Corinth.
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:39.400]   Corinth is a port city in Greece.
[00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:40.440]   It's still there today.
[00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:41.280]   You can go see it,
[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:45.480]   but it's a Greek port city named Corinth.
[00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:47.440]   It's one of the largest cities in the ancient world.
[00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:48.560]   Here's what you need to know about Corinth.
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:50.000]   Corinth was crazy.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.080]   It's sin city.
[00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:52.800]   It's probably the closest equivalent
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:53.880]   to Las Vegas that we have.
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:55.960]   Like what happens in Corinth stays in Corinth.
[00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:57.440]   It was such a bad place.
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:58.280]   Like true story,
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:01.520]   you go read any sort of historical pieces from the time
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.840]   that people would call,
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:07.440]   a Corinthian girl was a slang word for a prostitute.
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:09.320]   If you wanted to bash someone,
[00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:11.160]   that's Plato who started that.
[00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.560]   He said, look, a Corinthian is a girl
[00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:15.040]   who just does not,
[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:19.320]   who gives out her body in a way that is very generous,
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:20.160]   if you will.
[00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:23.560]   That even to Corinthianize was a verb in the Greek language
[00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:24.960]   that means to have sex.
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:27.960]   So it was a city that was very much defined
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:29.720]   by this pagan living lifestyle.
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:30.880]   The temple of Aphrodite,
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:33.920]   the goddess of beauty in Greek mythology
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:36.040]   was located there with 2000 prostitutes.
[00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:38.240]   You go, there's STDs rampant,
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:39.760]   like we talked about a little bit last week,
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:40.960]   but that's the city of Corinth.
[00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:43.080]   All of a sudden inside of Corinth,
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:45.360]   these people become believers in Jesus.
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:46.680]   They step out of worshiping Zeus,
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:47.920]   they start worshiping Jesus,
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:48.840]   and they're trying to figure out
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:50.320]   how do I live this Christian life?
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:52.480]   'Cause I've only known crazy Corinth.
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:53.320]   So how do I live this?
[00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:56.080]   So Paul writes these letters to the church in Corinth
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:57.560]   and he begins to explain
[00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:58.920]   how to live out the Christian faith.
[00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:00.000]   Here's what we know about Paul.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.480]   And then we're gonna dive in,
[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:02.640]   in the church in Corinth.
[00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:05.040]   Paul clearly loved the church in Corinth
[00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:07.960]   because he writes them more letters
[00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:10.320]   than any other church that we know of.
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:14.640]   We're aware of four that he writes.
[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:15.760]   You may be going, wait, there's only two,
[00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:17.600]   first, second, third, there's actually four.
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.880]   And we know that 'cause he refers to the other two
[00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:23.100]   that we don't have in his letters.
[00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:25.320]   And he talks about these different letters
[00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.640]   that were lost to history.
[00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:29.120]   And so he loved this church
[00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:31.880]   that was full of these pagans who trusted in Jesus
[00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:33.160]   and trying to figure it out.
[00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:34.800]   And all the craziness that came
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:36.480]   with the church in Corinth,
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:39.880]   Paul, despite all of that, loved these guys.
[00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:41.920]   And he begins to write as it relates
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:44.440]   to the idea of what it looks like to judge
[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:48.360]   or to hold one another to the standard
[00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:49.200]   inside of Christianity.
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:52.560]   So we're gonna look at who we judge as Christians,
[00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:54.720]   why we judge the people that we do,
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.280]   and how we judge as Christians.
[00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:57.720]   We're gonna start in verse one of chapter five,
[00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:58.560]   and here we go.
[00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:01.120]   Paul says this.
[00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:04.280]   It is actually reported
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:07.200]   that there is sexual immorality among you
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:11.080]   and of a kind that even the pagans do not tolerate.
[00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:13.160]   And so Paul says, hey, it's actually reported
[00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:14.480]   that there's something going on in the church
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:16.440]   that I need to address, I've heard rumors of it,
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:18.040]   that there's this type of sexual immorality
[00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:20.560]   that even the pagans go, oh, dude, that is not right.
[00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:21.480]   Here's what it is.
[00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:25.300]   That a man is sleeping with his father's wife
[00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:26.600]   and you are proud.
[00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:29.040]   And Paul says, even people who have no faith,
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:31.000]   they're going, dude, you just don't do that.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.440]   That is disgusting.
[00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:34.560]   And here's what he's probably saying
[00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:36.320]   as it relates to this situation,
[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:38.240]   that he's not sleeping with his mother,
[00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:39.880]   or else Paul would have said that,
[00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:41.160]   that there's a guy inside of the church
[00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:44.260]   who became a Christian and his dad remarried.
[00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:47.340]   Maybe his mom passed away or maybe they divorced,
[00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:50.480]   but either way, his dad remarries and has a new wife,
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:52.640]   and there's a guy inside of the church at Corinth,
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:54.840]   and when you think church, don't think like this.
[00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:57.560]   It was probably between 30 and 50 people at most.
[00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:59.500]   So think like a really big, small group.
[00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:01.040]   So everybody kind of knows everybody
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:03.820]   and everything's going on, and this guy is showing up
[00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:07.560]   and he's sleeping or hooking up with his father's new wife,
[00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:09.720]   and Paul is going, even the pagans are going,
[00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:11.100]   dude, that is disgusting.
[00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:12.160]   What are you doing?
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.900]   And it says that the church is proud.
[00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:15.920]   What do you mean proud?
[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:18.040]   That Paul's saying, look, you guys are like celebrating.
[00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:18.920]   Hey, this is okay.
[00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:20.400]   Jesus died for sins like this.
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:21.240]   This is great.
[00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:22.480]   You know, at least he's a Christian,
[00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:24.800]   so everything that he does doesn't matter anymore.
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.360]   And Paul says, you've totally missed it.
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:31.340]   Verse four, shouldn't you have gone into mourning,
[00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:32.180]   verse two, I'm sorry,
[00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:33.960]   and have put him out of your fellowship,
[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:35.300]   the man who is doing this,
[00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:37.220]   that you should have cast him out.
[00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:40.100]   For my part, even though I'm not physically present,
[00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:44.620]   I'm with you in spirit as one who is present in this way.
[00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:48.980]   I've already passed judgment in the name of the Lord
[00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:50.380]   on the one who's been doing this.
[00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:52.420]   Wait a second, Paul, you've already passed judgment
[00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:54.100]   and you judged him in the name of the Lord.
[00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:56.300]   Isn't that a little bit aggressive here, Paul?
[00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:58.720]   Can you even judge someone in the name of the Lord?
[00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:01.280]   Like, judging just doesn't feel right in general.
[00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:03.920]   Paul says, I judged him in the name of the Lord.
[00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:05.680]   Wait, Paul, Christians don't judge.
[00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:07.480]   I'm one of the first Christians ever,
[00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:09.640]   and I judge, Paul would say.
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:12.200]   And I've judged him, and I'm telling you, cast him out.
[00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:15.880]   So when you're assembled, and I am with you in spirit,
[00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:18.200]   and the power of the Lord Jesus is present,
[00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:20.500]   hand this man over to Satan.
[00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:22.600]   Wowzer.
[00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:25.880]   For the destruction of his flesh,
[00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:28.960]   so that his spirit may be saved on the day of the Lord.
[00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:31.320]   Like, in other words, hand him over to his sin
[00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:32.840]   for his own good.
[00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:36.000]   Your boasting is not good.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.360]   Don't you know that a little bit of yeast
[00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:38.640]   leavens the whole batch of dough,
[00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:43.240]   that sin, an embraced lifestyle sin, is gonna seep out?
[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:45.760]   It's like cancer, it'll spread.
[00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:48.920]   Verse nine, I wrote to you in my letter
[00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:52.100]   not to associate with sexually immoral people,
[00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:55.100]   not at all referring to the people of this world
[00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:57.280]   or non-Christian people who are immoral,
[00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:59.640]   and greedy, and swindlers, or idolaters.
[00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:01.200]   In that case, you'd have to leave the world.
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:04.220]   So Paul says, when I wrote in my other letter
[00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:06.640]   about how you're not to associate or have relationships
[00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:09.000]   with people who are immoral, and greedy, and swindlers,
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.800]   I wasn't talking about non-Christians.
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:13.200]   You've gotta be in relationship with non-Christians
[00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:14.760]   who live like non-Christians.
[00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:17.200]   I wouldn't say cut off those relationships,
[00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:20.880]   but now I'm writing to say that you must not associate
[00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:23.800]   with anyone who claims to be a brother or sister
[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:28.800]   or a Christian, but is sexually immoral, or greedy,
[00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:33.100]   or idolater, or slander, or drunkard, or swindler.
[00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:35.400]   Do not even eat with such people.
[00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:37.640]   What business is it of mine to judge those
[00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:39.040]   outside of the church?
[00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:41.320]   And he would say, none.
[00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:47.640]   But are you not to judge those inside of the church?
[00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:52.640]   Inference being, yes, God will judge those outside.
[00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:58.640]   But you, expel the wicked person from among you.
[00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:00.920]   That Paul lays out the first idea from this text,
[00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:03.780]   which is who do Christians judge, or who are we to judge?
[00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:05.500]   Which is other Christians.
[00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:07.000]   And again, when I talk about judgment,
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.240]   it's holding to the standard.
[00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:09.960]   Like Paul, he basically says, look,
[00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:11.240]   there's a guy inside of your church.
[00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:12.680]   This isn't like a one-off, like hey,
[00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:15.000]   he was speeding on his camel one time, get him.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.720]   This is a guy who's sleeping in unrepentant sin,
[00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:19.600]   saying, hey look, I'm gonna sleep.
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:22.200]   Jesus died for sins like these, everything's fine.
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:24.680]   And people are saying, you should stop doing that.
[00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:27.080]   I'm like, hey, everything's totally great.
[00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:28.760]   Jesus paid for everything I've ever done wrong,
[00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:30.280]   so I'm gonna keep doing as much as I wanna do wrong.
[00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:32.280]   Paul says, look, you need to cut that guy
[00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:34.420]   off of the fellowship, do not allow him
[00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:37.240]   to be inside of the group anymore, for his own good.
[00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:39.800]   And then he goes into this idea of like,
[00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:42.400]   man, maybe you misunderstood me when I said,
[00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:44.400]   hey, don't have relationships with people
[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:45.240]   who are sexually immoral.
[00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:49.440]   I'm talking about Christians who were living a life
[00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:52.040]   that embraces the sin Jesus died for,
[00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:54.800]   who were celebrating and living the sin
[00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:55.680]   that Jesus died for.
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:57.800]   I'm not talking about non-Christians
[00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:00.780]   who live like they don't know Jesus.
[00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:03.520]   People who don't know Jesus are not who you should judge.
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:05.040]   People who are not followers of Christ
[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:06.180]   who don't say I'm a Christian,
[00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:08.260]   there's no business, he would say, judging those people.
[00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:09.800]   Who are Christians to judge?
[00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:11.680]   Followers of Christ, or they're not to judge
[00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:12.960]   someone who's outside of the church.
[00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:14.360]   Like non-believers, like if you have friends,
[00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:17.880]   a parent, a sister, a cousin, a coworker,
[00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:20.120]   a person in the apartment next to you
[00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:22.800]   who is living like a non-believer,
[00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:25.040]   or she is a non-believer, or he is a non-believer,
[00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:26.960]   and they're living in a way that reflects that,
[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:30.200]   they're just fulfilling their job description.
[00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:31.840]   Like a person who's turning to marijuana
[00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:34.440]   to find relief in life, or turning to more alcohol,
[00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:36.880]   or sleeping around, or using their body,
[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:40.560]   or chasing whatever next high to fill some void,
[00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:42.040]   they're not someone that you need to go up to
[00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:43.460]   and point out their sin.
[00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:45.940]   They're someone who's doing what someone
[00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:47.320]   who doesn't know Jesus would do.
[00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:50.040]   We don't point people who don't know Jesus to their sin.
[00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:53.920]   We point them to Jesus, and the forgiveness is there.
[00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:56.640]   There is no place for Christians to judge those
[00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:58.880]   outside of the church, Paul would say.
[00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:02.240]   And if you do, he said, you put yourself
[00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:06.920]   in the place of God, and it's sin.
[00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:10.320]   You have no business judging those outside of the church.
[00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:13.400]   God will, but inside of the church, he says,
[00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:16.280]   it's your responsibility and my responsibility
[00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:18.160]   to judge those inside of the church.
[00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:20.560]   That when someone says, hey, I'm a follower of Jesus,
[00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:22.820]   and I wanna follow him with my life,
[00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:24.840]   but is confronted with the ways that they're
[00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:26.560]   either not dating in line with that,
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:28.160]   or they're not living, or handling money,
[00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:31.200]   or whatever it is, the way that they're using alcohol,
[00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:33.240]   and they say, look, you know, I think it's fine,
[00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:34.720]   you're just making too big of a deal of it,
[00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:38.240]   and they persistently say, I'm not gonna change this.
[00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:39.360]   Yes, I wanna go to heaven,
[00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:41.120]   but I really don't care what God says.
[00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:44.400]   Paul says, that is the person that you need to step into
[00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:48.320]   and hold to the standard of following Jesus.
[00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:50.600]   And at an extreme, he's gonna say,
[00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:53.200]   even if it means at the most extreme form,
[00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:54.640]   cutting off the relationship,
[00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:57.720]   that you and I are called to hold to the standard
[00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:00.600]   and to hold accountable other believers.
[00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:03.960]   Christians are called to judge Christians.
[00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:05.280]   And if you're thinking, no, wait a second,
[00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:06.640]   that's how the Bible says judge not.
[00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:08.400]   Like, you're supposed to judge not, Jesus said judge not,
[00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:10.880]   we're gonna cover what Jesus said exactly here in a second,
[00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:12.400]   'cause if you read the rest of the passage,
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:13.880]   he's not telling you not to judge,
[00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:15.160]   he's telling you how to judge.
[00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:16.080]   And who to judge.
[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:21.360]   And so Paul says, you're supposed to judge inside.
[00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:23.120]   And by judge, I mean, hold accountable,
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:25.680]   hold to the standard that when you become a believer
[00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:30.160]   in Christ, you're saying, Jesus is my Lord and my Savior.
[00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:32.680]   And I don't wanna embrace and celebrate the sin
[00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:37.320]   that put the person I love on the cross
[00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:39.160]   that he came and died for.
[00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:42.880]   Paul says, judge and help one another inside of the church.
[00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:45.140]   I mean, so often the church is like, God, I'm just wrong.
[00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:47.400]   Tragically, and if you are stepping back in church
[00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:49.760]   for the first time in a while,
[00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:51.600]   and you see the church as being judgmental
[00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:56.160]   towards outsiders, sadly, a lot of Christian action
[00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:57.980]   has really earned that.
[00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:02.120]   Where Christians have done such a terrible job
[00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:05.940]   feeling like it's their or our job to go police the morality
[00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:08.840]   of the world outside who doesn't even believe the Bible.
[00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:09.800]   They don't believe in Jesus,
[00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:11.720]   they don't believe any of the same things that we do.
[00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:13.100]   And they're just going, why are you judging me
[00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:15.900]   based on things that I don't even believe?
[00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:18.760]   And it's not our place to point them to the morality,
[00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:20.800]   it's to point them to the only one who can fix
[00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:23.060]   the broken immorality in my heart, your heart,
[00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:25.360]   everyone's heart, which is Jesus.
[00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:26.680]   We point believers to scripture,
[00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:29.120]   we point non-Christians to Jesus.
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:31.680]   And sadly, that hasn't been the case,
[00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:33.440]   where the world has felt like Christians
[00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:34.880]   are just all up in your business,
[00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:36.280]   telling you how you should live,
[00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:37.800]   and you don't even believe what they believe.
[00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:39.960]   I mean, it's not just someone, not long ago,
[00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:41.440]   I was helping a buddy of mine move,
[00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:44.540]   and he lived in M Streets, which is just an area of Dallas,
[00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:47.460]   and he was moving to another area by White Rock Lake
[00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:48.480]   in another neighborhood.
[00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:50.540]   Loaded up his car, loaded up my car,
[00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:52.500]   over there about to help him move all of his stuff,
[00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:54.540]   get inside of the car, get a phone call from JP,
[00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:55.980]   we're talking about something related to report stuff.
[00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:58.020]   So I'm on the phone, following my friend.
[00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:01.460]   At some point, he takes a turn and I miss him,
[00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:02.580]   or I lose him for a second,
[00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:03.500]   and then I pick back up with him,
[00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:04.540]   and we're sitting at the light,
[00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:06.180]   and I begin following him to his house.
[00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:07.940]   All the while, just kind of talking on the phone
[00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:09.620]   and watching where we're gonna go,
[00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:10.760]   'cause I didn't know where we were going,
[00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:13.200]   to this new house, and I'm just gonna follow him,
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:14.040]   turn by turn.
[00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:15.920]   And we take one turn, and all of a sudden,
[00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:16.960]   we're in this neighborhood,
[00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:19.160]   and he's like taking turns and going down streets,
[00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:21.400]   and we're doing like the same loop over and over again,
[00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:22.880]   where I'm like, I think he's lost right now.
[00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:24.520]   I don't think he knows where he's going up there.
[00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:26.040]   Hey, JP, I'm gonna have to call you back.
[00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:27.680]   And I'm thinking, this guy,
[00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:29.600]   I'm just beginning essentially judging
[00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:31.080]   that he doesn't know where he's going,
[00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:34.480]   or he's lost, and we keep taking these turns after turns,
[00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:38.200]   and eventually, my friend pulled up,
[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:41.740]   and he parked the car, and he gets out of the car
[00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:44.300]   and looks back, and it's not my friend.
[00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:48.240]   It's some other dude driving the exact same car,
[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:50.000]   or the exact same type of car, Yukon.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.220]   And I was like, oh, oh, hey, how you doing?
[00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:53.060]   Good to see you.
[00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:55.040]   And he's like, there's some crazy person behind me
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:56.500]   that's following me I'm trying to lose right now.
[00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:57.420]   And I'm like, that's why he felt like
[00:19:57.420 --> 00:19:58.460]   he was trying to lose me.
[00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:02.580]   And it was this guy who was going, why are you following?
[00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:04.500]   As I sit there judging this person
[00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:08.560]   based on a set of directions and destinations
[00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:12.460]   that he'd never agreed to, he'd never even seen.
[00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:14.140]   I'm judging him based on a set of criteria
[00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:16.800]   of like, I don't think he knows where he's going,
[00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:18.800]   that he has never agreed to.
[00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:21.760]   He's never even seen or read.
[00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:25.200]   Just like the world, when it judges non-believers
[00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:28.660]   based on a set of criteria, or the Bible,
[00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:31.540]   or following Jesus, it'd look like
[00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:33.140]   that they've never agreed to.
[00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:36.000]   Most of them have never even seen or read.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.420]   And they're going, hey, why are you following me right now?
[00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:40.440]   Get off of me.
[00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:43.680]   And the church, tragically, has done such a poor job
[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:46.680]   about caring for those in its midst
[00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:49.040]   and being judgmental towards those outside.
[00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:52.700]   And Paul says, it has no basis for being in the church.
[00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:54.520]   Who you are to judge and who I'm to judge
[00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:57.480]   is fellow Christians, or who we hold accountable
[00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:00.080]   in terms of their behavior, is fellow Christians.
[00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:01.860]   He then also, inside of this passage,
[00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:05.820]   answers the question of why Christians judge.
[00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:09.180]   Why Christians judge Christians.
[00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:11.660]   Why Christians judge Christians.
[00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:16.980]   And it's because judging or holding fellow Christians
[00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:21.180]   to the standard of following Jesus is loving.
[00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:24.620]   The reason why is because judging is loving,
[00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:26.940]   or another way of saying it is that you cannot love someone.
[00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:28.060]   'Cause here's what I know.
[00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:29.740]   Like judging, if you're a young adult,
[00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:32.800]   we kind of grew up in this whole milieu or ecosystem
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:35.140]   where it's like, oh, I don't even like the word judge.
[00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:37.060]   What if we replaced it with tolerance?
[00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:38.020]   How's that one feel?
[00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:41.860]   We kind of have this really strong resistance
[00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:43.460]   to even the word of judge,
[00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:45.420]   which is why I'm trying to use what the Bible means,
[00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:49.720]   which is hold accountable, or hold to the standard.
[00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:54.660]   Encourage them to live in line
[00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:56.900]   with what they've already said.
[00:21:56.900 --> 00:21:58.740]   And why is that loving?
[00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:01.380]   Why would it be loving to judge someone?
[00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:03.800]   To say, hey, I'm gonna hold you accountable
[00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:05.380]   to the standard you agreed to.
[00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:06.820]   I mean, we've all seen like there's times
[00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:08.900]   where it clearly is the most loving to say something,
[00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:11.780]   to speak up, and it would be unloving to not say something.
[00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:13.700]   The other day I was driving home from work.
[00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:15.900]   I turn to a street that's by my house.
[00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:17.700]   It's a two lane street, driving this way.
[00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:20.700]   And I turn and I turn on the right lane to drive
[00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:21.820]   'cause traffic's coming this way.
[00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:23.740]   There's a car that's driving
[00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:25.620]   that doesn't realize it's a two lane street
[00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:26.460]   that's right next to me.
[00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:27.740]   And it just passes me on the left.
[00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:29.140]   It's not like I'm on a highway or something
[00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:30.140]   where they're going around.
[00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:31.260]   They're literally just driving
[00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:33.740]   on the two lane street on the side.
[00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:37.480]   And in that moment, I'm not like, gosh,
[00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:39.900]   I would like wave them over or tell them something.
[00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:42.180]   I just don't wanna be judgmental.
[00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:44.880]   Sure, there's a huge 18 semi truck coming right at 'em,
[00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:46.540]   but I don't feel like that would be the right thing to do.
[00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:47.620]   It's not really my place.
[00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:50.140]   Have they agreed to the standard of two lane roads?
[00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:50.980]   I don't know.
[00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:52.980]   Is it really for me to say?
[00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:56.100]   Yes, they've agreed when they got a driver's license.
[00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:58.860]   And so in that moment, I drive up, honk, honk, move over.
[00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:01.420]   It's a dumb illustration, but here's my point.
[00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:03.320]   There are clearly times where someone is headed
[00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:05.020]   to wreck their life where you would say,
[00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:10.020]   it is unloving and maybe evil
[00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:13.580]   to say, I'm just gonna let you go.
[00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:15.220]   A parent that says to children,
[00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:16.780]   I'm just gonna let you go.
[00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:18.880]   We have a two year old who wants to run into the street.
[00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:20.860]   You would say it's evil if you don't step in
[00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:22.180]   and discipline your child and say,
[00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:23.300]   stop running into the street.
[00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:25.980]   If we're just like, ah, boys will be boys, go get 'em.
[00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:28.460]   Move quick.
[00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:29.900]   We'd say that's wrong.
[00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:32.260]   In the same way, Paul says, look, there's clearly times
[00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:34.380]   where you and I, as brothers and sisters in Christ,
[00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:38.060]   are called to call one another,
[00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:42.020]   to follow Jesus, to lovingly move in and say,
[00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:44.780]   hey, I see this thing that's inside of your life.
[00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:46.620]   That's not the man that you wanna be.
[00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:49.740]   That's not the woman that you wanna be.
[00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:50.980]   Can I help you here?
[00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:53.020]   Do you think that this is the best way to date?
[00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:54.820]   The best way to, do you think that really
[00:23:54.820 --> 00:23:55.940]   he's good for you?
[00:23:55.940 --> 00:24:00.380]   That as Christians, to other followers of Christ,
[00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:04.620]   it is unloving to say, ah, what can I do?
[00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:05.660]   You know, you do you.
[00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:08.980]   Paul would say, you have a responsibility
[00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:13.380]   and you are disobedient if you don't have others
[00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:15.920]   in your life calling you to that and you're not judging
[00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:17.980]   or calling others to do the same.
[00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:23.100]   So the reason why Christians judge is because
[00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:25.740]   it is unloving to say I'm never gonna judge
[00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:30.380]   or oftentimes judging is loving or holding to the standard
[00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:31.200]   is loving.
[00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:35.900]   Paul, in this very extreme case, even shows that,
[00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:39.420]   hey, when I say separate him from the group,
[00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:40.600]   it is for his good.
[00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:43.300]   You see what the verse says, verse five,
[00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:44.140]   if you go back and look at it, he says,
[00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:46.380]   hey, I want you to separate this man from the group
[00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:48.780]   or hand him over to Satan, hand him over to his sin,
[00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:51.340]   which just essentially means, hey, we're gonna hand him over
[00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:53.580]   and let him, if he wants to live that kind of lifestyle,
[00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:55.380]   we're gonna say, dude, I'm gonna take the governor off,
[00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:57.740]   I'm not gonna hold you accountable, go get him.
[00:24:57.740 --> 00:25:01.620]   If you're saying, hey, alcohol is always gonna be
[00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:05.060]   a part of my life, I just can't do it, dude, go drink more.
[00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:07.100]   If you're gonna say, hey, look, I just like to sleep around
[00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:10.340]   and like pornography and I'm unwilling to change that,
[00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:12.700]   I will not change that, then Paul would say,
[00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:15.620]   dude, take the governor off and let him go.
[00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:16.460]   Why?
[00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:20.860]   So that his flesh may be destroyed or his sinful nature
[00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:22.420]   will be destroyed and his spirit saved
[00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:23.260]   on the day of judgment.
[00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:24.860]   What does that mean?
[00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:28.980]   Paul basically says that oftentimes,
[00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:33.240]   the quickest way back to God is deeper into your sin.
[00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:35.300]   If a person is saying, hey, I'm never gonna change,
[00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:37.140]   I will not change, I'm just gonna keep doing this,
[00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:38.500]   of course we're gonna live together,
[00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:39.580]   of course we're gonna sleep together,
[00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:41.420]   it's just the modern age, it's what we do,
[00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:45.060]   Paul would say, hands off, let 'em go and wreck their life
[00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:47.300]   and that will bring them back.
[00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:50.780]   That oftentimes, the quickest way back
[00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:53.540]   is further into their sin, in the most extreme cases,
[00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:56.660]   when they're saying, I'm choosing to embrace,
[00:25:56.660 --> 00:26:00.680]   regardless of what anyone says, the sin that Jesus died for.
[00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:05.980]   He says, even removing him from the group
[00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:07.680]   is so that eventually he'll come back.
[00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:09.300]   In other words, it's not loving to be like,
[00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:10.740]   oh, and this is Bob, he doesn't listen
[00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:12.320]   to anything Jesus says, but he's here
[00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:13.460]   to hold everybody else accountable,
[00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:16.140]   let's have a small group time, anybody want cake, huh?
[00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:17.700]   He would say, that's not loving to say,
[00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:19.900]   Bob, just keep coming, even though you are saying
[00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:22.320]   you believe Jesus, but you won't follow him.
[00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:25.020]   It's not loving for us to just say,
[00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:27.500]   hey, Bob just thinks this is a big game,
[00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:30.340]   so let's all just hold things accountable.
[00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:32.460]   And Bob's just gonna train wreck his life.
[00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:34.780]   He's saying, man, just don't waste Bob's time, your time.
[00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:37.860]   Let Bob go chase whatever sin he's saying,
[00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:40.260]   I'm unwilling to change this,
[00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:45.260]   in hopes that he'll hit rock bottom and come back.
[00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:47.700]   And Paul says, even that, even that form
[00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:49.360]   of the most extreme judgment,
[00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:52.620]   which is putting somebody outside of the small group,
[00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:56.680]   is for the good of that person, and the good of the group.
[00:26:56.680 --> 00:27:02.840]   So finally, how do Christians judge Christians?
[00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:06.360]   How do Christians judge Christians?
[00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:11.300]   So Paul, because of the extreme nature of the scenario,
[00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:13.540]   and because of really just the messed up heresy
[00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:15.180]   of the church, he really doesn't go into a ton
[00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:17.420]   of depth about the approach of how we,
[00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:19.540]   inside of the church, judge or care for one another,
[00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:21.060]   or hold one another accountable.
[00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:23.820]   The good news is, Jesus does.
[00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:26.340]   Jesus tells us very clearly some of the steps.
[00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:27.900]   And so the way that you and I judge Christians,
[00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:29.500]   or how Christians judge Christians,
[00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:32.160]   is by having the actions that Jesus lays out,
[00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:33.220]   and the attitude of Jesus.
[00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:35.460]   The actions that Jesus lays out in Matthew 18,
[00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:36.380]   we're gonna look at in a second,
[00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:38.180]   and really the attitude of Jesus.
[00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:40.300]   Jesus, as clear as any other place in scripture,
[00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:41.640]   if you're here tonight, and you're like,
[00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:44.060]   man, judging, this is why I don't like Christians,
[00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:45.500]   because they like to judge.
[00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:50.700]   I would understand why you have that perspective.
[00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:53.940]   But the reason why we're called to hold each other,
[00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:56.220]   not you, if you're not a Christian,
[00:27:56.220 --> 00:28:00.280]   but Christians accountable, is because we're commanded to.
[00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:01.660]   Not because we made it up, and we're like,
[00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:03.720]   this is some weird, fun game we play.
[00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:06.660]   It's because we're told to hold each other accountable.
[00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:08.700]   Jesus says this.
[00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:10.540]   If you have any respect for Jesus,
[00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:13.460]   he says this in Matthew 18, verse 15.
[00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:16.820]   "If your brother or sister sins,
[00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:18.920]   "go and point out their fault,
[00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:21.880]   "just between the two of you.
[00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:25.920]   "And if they listen to you, you've won."
[00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:29.540]   Jesus indicates something that's true every time.
[00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:32.740]   Anytime that you and I seek to hold one another accountable,
[00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:36.160]   or we just judge someone, the short way of saying it.
[00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:37.740]   The way that you know you have victory
[00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:39.380]   is not if you proved your case,
[00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:41.500]   and you got it all, all your answers out there,
[00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:44.780]   but if they're restored back to the group.
[00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:47.340]   If they turn and repent, like, man, I was wrong, thank you.
[00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:48.560]   He says, you won.
[00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:55.660]   And he says, if they don't listen, so you go one to one.
[00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:58.700]   And if they don't, you take two along with you,
[00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:00.520]   so that every matter may be established
[00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:02.700]   by the testimony of two or three witnesses.
[00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:04.520]   So you take one or two, and you go two to one.
[00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:05.860]   Bring someone else from the small group.
[00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:07.260]   Hey, here's what I'm seeing.
[00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:10.280]   And if they still refuse to listen,
[00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:12.940]   you tell it to the church.
[00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:15.580]   And if they refuse to listen even to the church,
[00:29:15.580 --> 00:29:17.940]   treat them as you would a pagan or tax collector.
[00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:19.680]   So church, again, in this context,
[00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:21.820]   just means like the assembly or the gathering.
[00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:23.140]   It wouldn't be like, hey, yeah,
[00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:25.020]   we want everybody next week to come, stand up,
[00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:27.020]   just yell out something if you've had this take place.
[00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:29.100]   It would be inside of the small group context,
[00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:32.340]   in our modern day era, where like, you would go to someone,
[00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:34.460]   they still saying, ah, I'm not listening,
[00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:38.220]   bring another person, still stiff arm, I'm not listening,
[00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:39.700]   and then you would bring it to the small group
[00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:43.100]   and say, look, hey, Sarah doesn't wanna be held accountable
[00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:45.180]   on this anymore, and I'm just widening the circle.
[00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:47.000]   And Jesus says, you widen the circle,
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.180]   following these steps.
[00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:51.300]   Those are the actions.
[00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:54.180]   The other places in scripture where we're told about this,
[00:29:54.180 --> 00:29:56.420]   it also makes clear certain attitudes
[00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:58.140]   that you and I are to have of Christ.
[00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:00.420]   Christ says this in Matthew chapter seven,
[00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:02.500]   where he talks about judge, and he says that you and I,
[00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:05.660]   one of the attitudes we're to have is do so humbly,
[00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:07.500]   that you and I are to have a posture of humility.
[00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:09.980]   As you go and you judge someone or you correct someone
[00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:11.820]   or you call someone out, that you and I are to do so
[00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:14.980]   following the steps of Jesus, or the actions,
[00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:17.420]   and the attitudes, and one of those is being humble.
[00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:18.260]   What does Jesus say?
[00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:21.660]   He says, do not judge, and you too will not be judged.
[00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:23.940]   Or you too will be judged.
[00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:25.900]   For in the same way that you judge others,
[00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:28.660]   you will be judged, and with the measure you use,
[00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:30.860]   it will be measured to you.
[00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:33.600]   Why do you look at the speck of sawdust
[00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:37.180]   in your brother's eye and pay no attention to the plank
[00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:38.380]   in your own eye?
[00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:39.980]   How can you say to your brother,
[00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:42.020]   let me take that speck out of your eye,
[00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:44.860]   when all the time there's a plank in your own eye?
[00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:45.700]   You hypocrite.
[00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:51.500]   First, take the plank out of your own eye,
[00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:54.000]   and then you will see clearly to remove the speck
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.900]   from your brother's eye, that Jesus didn't say,
[00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:57.880]   hey, never take specks out of other people's eyes.
[00:30:57.880 --> 00:30:59.500]   He says, look, when you approach someone,
[00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:01.140]   make sure that you deal with the stuff
[00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:03.340]   in your own life first.
[00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:05.400]   Make sure that whether you're in a conflict
[00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:07.040]   or whether you see that a problem exists
[00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:08.920]   in someone else's life, that you're quick
[00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:10.720]   to take the two by four out of your eye
[00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:12.000]   before you go like, hey, I think you have
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.520]   like a little splinter in your eye over there.
[00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:16.120]   He says, make sure that you deal with your own stuff.
[00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:18.840]   Don't judge hypocritically and be humble.
[00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:21.360]   So one of the attitudes and the other attitude
[00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:24.680]   is that we do so in a way that's gently and lovingly.
[00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:27.920]   Paul in Galatians six says this, verse one,
[00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:30.640]   brothers and sisters, if someone is caught in sin,
[00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:33.240]   so if someone has found themselves in the midst
[00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:35.640]   of an addiction, in the midst of an unhealthy relationship,
[00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:37.260]   in the midst of just unwise decisions,
[00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:40.280]   in the midst of just, man, the chaos that all of us
[00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:42.600]   bring into our life just 'cause we're all prone
[00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:44.880]   to move towards sin.
[00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:47.600]   He says, if someone is caught around you,
[00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:49.680]   if a friend, someone in your community group,
[00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:53.920]   if someone is caught in sin, you who live by the Spirit,
[00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:56.620]   or your translation may say you who are spiritual,
[00:31:56.620 --> 00:32:01.620]   if you're a spiritual person, should restore him gently.
[00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:04.560]   But watch yourselves, you may also be tempted
[00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:06.920]   that you and I are called to do so with the actions
[00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:10.960]   of Christ that he lays out and the attitude of Christ.
[00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:12.620]   So here's like what I think this looks like,
[00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:14.080]   just to be overly specific.
[00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:15.360]   So inside of your community group,
[00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:18.260]   maybe there's somebody who you see and you're doing so
[00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:20.080]   not from a posture of like, oh man, I'm trying to,
[00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:21.920]   I just hate this person, I'm jealous of what's going on,
[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:24.360]   but sincerely, I love and care about this person
[00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:27.040]   and I see them making unwise decisions.
[00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:29.760]   Sally is in your community group and Sally,
[00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:33.480]   you've noticed, has started sleeping over at her boyfriend's
[00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:36.140]   more than she should, which is ever.
[00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:38.120]   And you've just seen that she's continuing
[00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:39.640]   to sleep over there and you're like,
[00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:41.240]   hey Sally, I just wanna know.
[00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:42.880]   Or they're going on vacation,
[00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:44.800]   staying in a hotel room together and you're like,
[00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:46.680]   Sally, hey, I just wanna talk through that
[00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:48.680]   'cause I wanna make sure that I'm loving you
[00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:51.780]   and caring for you and I don't wanna allow my own insecurity
[00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:54.420]   or my own fear of coming across judgmental
[00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:57.880]   to stop me from asking good questions or caring for you.
[00:32:57.880 --> 00:33:00.240]   Hey, do you think it's okay for you and Bill
[00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:01.920]   to sleep together, Sally?
[00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:04.820]   And Sally goes, well, I mean, we're not having sex.
[00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:06.760]   We're sleeping in the same bed.
[00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:10.600]   Okay, well, first off, I'm not sure that that is still wise
[00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:11.900]   in terms of putting yourself in a place
[00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:13.700]   where you're gonna be sexually tempted with one another
[00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:14.920]   and I'm not sure how long Bill
[00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:16.400]   is gonna be excited about that.
[00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:19.380]   And so, in addition, it doesn't seem like,
[00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:20.760]   and then I bring them to scripture,
[00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:21.840]   you bring them to scripture,
[00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:25.120]   you are adhering to 1 Corinthians 6
[00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:28.960]   where it talks about flee sexual immorality, run from it.
[00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:31.980]   Don't entertain it, don't lay in bed with it,
[00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:34.800]   don't hang out with it, you're to run from it.
[00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:36.620]   Do you think that that's what you're doing right now?
[00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:39.200]   'Cause I know you love Jesus and you wanna follow him.
[00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:40.820]   And so maybe you're at a place where you're like,
[00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:43.560]   hey, I can't afford another hotel room.
[00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:45.600]   So, hey, what if I got all the girls together
[00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:47.160]   and we pitched and we bought you a hotel room?
[00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:50.520]   Or maybe you're just like, hey, I live alone and I'm afraid.
[00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:52.400]   So I like to go over to Bill's house
[00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:54.680]   'cause I don't like having, I don't know what,
[00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:56.520]   the excuse to be, but whatever it is that you just say,
[00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:58.840]   hey, I wanna seek to be a part of helping you
[00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:01.120]   in this situation, so help me understand what's going on
[00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:02.640]   because I don't wanna just sit on the sideline
[00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:05.200]   and be like, well, it's her decision, she's gotta do you.
[00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:06.640]   You're accountable to that.
[00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:08.160]   You were your brother's keeper
[00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:09.760]   and you're your sister's keeper.
[00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:12.080]   And God commands that.
[00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:14.880]   I mean, Cain and Abel,
[00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:16.640]   one of the very first sins that's committed,
[00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:19.480]   God looks at and said, are you not your brother's keeper?
[00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:22.800]   In response to Cain essentially saying,
[00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:24.360]   what am I, my brother's keeper?
[00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:27.120]   (congregation laughing)
[00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:29.240]   And so are you if you're a Christian.
[00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:31.080]   This is why being in a community group is so important.
[00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:34.240]   Or maybe you're like a guy, whatever the end of the spectrum,
[00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:35.800]   maybe you're a guy and you're like,
[00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:37.480]   there's someone in your community or your roommate
[00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:38.720]   or someone who says, I'm a Christian,
[00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:39.880]   I'm a follower of Christ.
[00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:41.760]   And you just see that every time the Rangers are on
[00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:44.640]   or the Mavs are on, like their temper just explodes.
[00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:47.320]   The language they have changes to like a sailor.
[00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:49.760]   You're like, whoa, where did that come from?
[00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:51.240]   And you can either sit there and go,
[00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:52.240]   man, that's just who he is.
[00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:54.160]   He gets really ramped up when Dirk plays.
[00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:58.480]   Or you can say, hey, I don't know if anyone's ever told you
[00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:00.080]   this and you go to him in person.
[00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:03.080]   But I just feel like I'm not gonna be loving you well,
[00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:05.320]   so I want to, and I wanna do so humbly
[00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:08.120]   'cause I may not understand and I'm just trying
[00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:11.120]   to be a friend and care for you and a brother to you.
[00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:14.800]   It seems like when you watch this sporting event,
[00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:18.040]   that your attitude and anger level flies through the roof.
[00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:19.360]   You become a different person.
[00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:21.600]   Has anyone ever talked to you about this before?
[00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:23.200]   Whatever the expression of his anger,
[00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:25.920]   or whatever the expression of whatever sin pattern is,
[00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:28.560]   that all of us have things where if you just hang around us
[00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:30.080]   for more than three minutes, you go,
[00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:32.240]   yeah, that's probably not exactly like Jesus.
[00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:34.420]   That's a little bit more selfish, materialistic,
[00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:35.920]   whatever it is.
[00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:37.760]   And the body of Christ,
[00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:39.760]   especially inside of the context of community
[00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:42.420]   is supposed to love one another enough to say something
[00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:44.320]   when they see something.
[00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:46.680]   I experience this constantly.
[00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:49.440]   Every person on our staff experiences it, hopefully.
[00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:51.520]   Last week, inside of my own community group,
[00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:53.160]   where people have to come around and say,
[00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:55.200]   hey, David, you're not being the man
[00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:57.500]   that I know you want to be.
[00:35:57.500 --> 00:36:01.360]   You're not being the friend, the co-community person,
[00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:04.460]   husband, whatever the scenario is.
[00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:06.040]   And loves me enough to say,
[00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:08.240]   speak as faithful as the wounds of a friend,
[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:09.280]   the Proverbs say, and say,
[00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:10.780]   look, here's something I see in your life.
[00:36:10.780 --> 00:36:11.960]   Can we talk through this?
[00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:14.160]   It's inconsistent with what the Bible says.
[00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:18.440]   Two weeks ago, there was someone in our community group
[00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:21.000]   who brought a significant hurt
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:22.560]   that I had created inside of the group,
[00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:26.240]   or I'd created towards her and her husband as it related.
[00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:28.480]   It was basically, we bought a house recently.
[00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:30.820]   We sold our house and bought our house,
[00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:33.680]   all in this 14-day window
[00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:35.680]   where I was gone on a retreat three days,
[00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:37.580]   then came back, left for Mexico for four days,
[00:36:37.580 --> 00:36:40.640]   and then went to Kansas to do a funeral.
[00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:42.560]   And it was this crazy town where also,
[00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:45.080]   we sold a house and bought a house.
[00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:46.320]   And it was like, yeah, from Mexico.
[00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:47.200]   Hey, how's things going?
[00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:49.320]   Anyways, point being, she's a realtor,
[00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:52.420]   and we didn't use her as our realtor.
[00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:54.160]   And we had had conversations about using her,
[00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:57.380]   and we'd gone earlier to see homes with her about it.
[00:36:57.380 --> 00:36:59.720]   And in the midst of just moving from one thing to the next
[00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:03.520]   and being self-centered without communicating to her,
[00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:05.560]   we just went and bought another house with somebody else.
[00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:06.400]   Now, if you're there, you're like,
[00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:07.840]   hey, that's not that big of a deal.
[00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:10.160]   And it wasn't for her about the commission.
[00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:11.840]   It was just about a really deep wound
[00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:13.880]   of someone who didn't communicate with her,
[00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:15.720]   and it was a big deal.
[00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:18.680]   And it was rightfully so, and it was wrong on my part.
[00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:20.120]   And it created a lot of hurt.
[00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:25.300]   And she and her husband loved me enough
[00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:27.000]   to tell me and communicate that.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.880]   And the guys inside of my group came along and said,
[00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:31.060]   look, man, here's the deal.
[00:37:31.060 --> 00:37:35.780]   You can move quick to the point where you're insensitive,
[00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:37.980]   you're self-centered, and you don't consider
[00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:40.620]   how it's gonna impact and hurt others.
[00:37:40.620 --> 00:37:41.880]   And you need to stop.
[00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:44.980]   And it's an area that I need to stop.
[00:37:44.980 --> 00:37:48.260]   And thankfully, just like the body of Christ
[00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:49.980]   is supposed to be, they don't just say,
[00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:52.120]   all right, hey, go get 'em and figure it out on your own.
[00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:53.620]   They're going, how can we help?
[00:37:53.620 --> 00:37:55.980]   We're coming around, we're gonna love you enough
[00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:59.100]   to continue to call this out, as others have.
[00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:02.380]   And that's just one of a list of 'em.
[00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:05.660]   Because anytime you're a part of the body of Christ,
[00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:07.780]   you can know you're faithfully experiencing community
[00:38:07.780 --> 00:38:09.220]   when people are coming around you
[00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:11.960]   and loving you enough to tell you the truth.
[00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:13.700]   And if no one's loving you enough to tell you the truth
[00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:14.620]   inside of your community group,
[00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:16.240]   you might be in one on the rosters,
[00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:17.940]   but you might not be in community.
[00:38:19.460 --> 00:38:23.940]   Because Christians are called to call out one another,
[00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:25.020]   to follow Jesus.
[00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:30.380]   So in summary, people that Christians judge
[00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:31.500]   are other Christians.
[00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:35.100]   The reason why that we judge is because it's loving.
[00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:36.980]   You cannot love Christians,
[00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:38.560]   you cannot love your brothers and sisters in Christ
[00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:40.460]   without calling or holding them to a standard.
[00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:43.220]   And the way that we judge is humbly, gently,
[00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:44.980]   and like Jesus said, with the attitude
[00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:46.740]   and actions of Jesus.
[00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:52.140]   Tomorrow morning, I'm gonna go to an annual physical exam
[00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:53.500]   at a doctor.
[00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:55.920]   And this is what happens when you get north of 30,
[00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:57.440]   you end up having more of these things,
[00:38:57.440 --> 00:38:59.080]   and putting on weight.
[00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:01.200]   And so, anyways, I'm going to the doctor,
[00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:03.820]   and he'll do an annual exam, and they do blood work,
[00:39:03.820 --> 00:39:04.680]   and they take care of all this stuff.
[00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:06.400]   And he'll come back, and he'll basically do
[00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:09.240]   what doctors do, which is he'll say,
[00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:11.040]   here's what the test results show,
[00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:14.400]   and here's what they don't.
[00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:16.680]   And he'll identify any places within the body
[00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:19.000]   that may not be healthy, or things that he sees,
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.080]   and say, hey, here's some things
[00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:21.580]   that I think we should change.
[00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:23.660]   Why is that relevant?
[00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:27.560]   Because my ability to get well is directly related
[00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:28.400]   on two things.
[00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:31.940]   His ability to tell the truth, if anything's wrong,
[00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:34.560]   him to say, this is where your body is not aligned
[00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:37.280]   with what should be going on, or I see some sort of lump,
[00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:38.760]   or something's wrong in your blood count.
[00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:40.440]   His ability to identify it,
[00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:43.600]   and my ability to receive it.
[00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:45.520]   And that you will not, if you're unwilling to listen
[00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:47.600]   to a doctor's advice, you're just not gonna get healthy.
[00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:48.920]   You're like, ah, no, I got this.
[00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:50.320]   If he says, David, hey, there's something serious
[00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:53.180]   you got three months, man, that's so judgmental.
[00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:55.120]   I mean, that's your opinion.
[00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:56.880]   I think I got 30 years, okay?
[00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:58.420]   So, teach his own.
[00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:00.360]   I mean, that's like ludicrous.
[00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:04.420]   And when you and I look at Scripture,
[00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:09.040]   and we say, hey, that's just God's word,
[00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:10.800]   it doesn't really have to inform our life,
[00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:12.240]   or when we see a brother and sister
[00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:14.480]   that we're walking with, living outside of it,
[00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:16.320]   and we're like, man, to each his own,
[00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:18.600]   we are saying to the brother or sister,
[00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:20.680]   I see cancer, and I'm doing nothing.
[00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:23.840]   And it feels loving in the moment.
[00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:25.720]   It feels like, oh, I just don't wanna hurt them,
[00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:27.480]   and it's not loving.
[00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:30.760]   It feels like, man, the relationship she's in,
[00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:32.940]   she's gone too far, and this is just kinda what she does.
[00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:35.320]   You know, she kinda dates crazy, 'cause she is crazy.
[00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:37.760]   It's not loving to not say something.
[00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:43.560]   And here's why, further, it matters,
[00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:45.200]   is because, just like in that scenario
[00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:47.880]   where my own health is dependent on my ability
[00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:51.760]   to receive and to have accurate diagnosis, if you will,
[00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:56.760]   the health of the church, which is the hope of the world.
[00:40:56.760 --> 00:40:59.440]   Like, if the message of Jesus is true, think about it.
[00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:02.640]   If the message of Christianity is true, that it's true,
[00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:04.380]   and every single person on the entire planet
[00:41:04.380 --> 00:41:06.120]   is gonna live forever somewhere,
[00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:07.640]   they're gonna spend eternity either with God
[00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:09.420]   or apart from God, it's the only way to Him.
[00:41:09.420 --> 00:41:11.160]   If Jesus is who He says He is,
[00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:12.760]   the church is the hope of the world,
[00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:14.160]   because it's the way that God has said,
[00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:16.560]   I'm gonna reach the world through the body of Christ,
[00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:19.280]   and the body of Christ, the hope of the world,
[00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:23.480]   will only be as effective as the health
[00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:25.800]   of the body of Christ.
[00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:30.180]   And the only way the body of Christ will be healthy
[00:41:30.180 --> 00:41:32.640]   is if those inside of it are faithful to say,
[00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:33.820]   here's the things that I see
[00:41:33.820 --> 00:41:35.460]   that don't align with God's word.
[00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:37.840]   Just like a doctor saying, here's the things that I see
[00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:39.840]   that are inconsistent with how you should be
[00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:41.460]   or your body was made, and you may be going,
[00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:42.600]   yeah, but that doesn't really add up,
[00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:43.880]   'cause the doctor has a medical degree,
[00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:46.640]   he's standing on, you're standing on God's word,
[00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:48.200]   the creator of everything that is,
[00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:50.160]   who designed all of human life,
[00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:52.040]   he designed the way that people should have marriage,
[00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:55.280]   life, money, everything, he designed you.
[00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:56.640]   He designed the only place
[00:41:56.640 --> 00:41:59.560]   you're gonna find fulfillment and purpose.
[00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:02.720]   Not standing on your own opinion, and if you are, repent.
[00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:05.920]   Nobody needs your opinion, and nobody needs mine.
[00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:10.360]   If it's outside, especially if it contradicts
[00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:11.580]   what God's word has to say,
[00:42:11.580 --> 00:42:13.940]   and the health of the body of Christ,
[00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:18.460]   the hope of the world is dependent on the health
[00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:24.020]   and the willingness of those who make up the body of Christ
[00:42:24.020 --> 00:42:26.220]   to speak and call one and all,
[00:42:26.220 --> 00:42:30.620]   to judge, to hold to the standard of the body of Christ.
[00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:32.060]   Let me pray.
[00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:33.460]   Father, we thank you that...
[00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:36.300]   (sighs)
[00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:43.900]   Just that you have given your people
[00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:47.000]   and given us instructions on how we can care for one another.
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:51.500]   And the fact that there's still parts of us that are broken,
[00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:52.500]   we don't have to live in a world
[00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:54.900]   where we have irreconcilable differences
[00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:56.740]   and just relationships have to end here
[00:42:56.740 --> 00:42:58.140]   and friendships have to end,
[00:42:58.140 --> 00:42:59.260]   but you've given us the means
[00:42:59.260 --> 00:43:03.100]   by which we can just step towards reconciling,
[00:43:03.100 --> 00:43:04.720]   being restored to one another,
[00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:06.700]   restored to relationship with you.
[00:43:06.700 --> 00:43:09.300]   Father, we know how empty it is when we run from you.
[00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:14.940]   And those of us who don't may not realize
[00:43:14.940 --> 00:43:18.380]   because we've never connected with you,
[00:43:18.380 --> 00:43:20.340]   so we've only known the emptiness.
[00:43:20.340 --> 00:43:24.140]   And I pray that you would stretch out your hand
[00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:25.980]   for anyone who doesn't have that faith,
[00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:28.500]   who doesn't have just the ability to say,
[00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:32.460]   Jesus is my Lord, my Savior, he's worthy of it all.
[00:43:32.460 --> 00:43:34.020]   He's the name above every name.
[00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:37.700]   I pray for any friends in this room who have,
[00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:40.180]   Lord, it's just so hard, we're people pleasers,
[00:43:40.180 --> 00:43:41.520]   I'm a people pleaser.
[00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:43.720]   Would you encourage and strengthen my heart?
[00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:47.420]   Help me to be humble and gentle
[00:43:47.420 --> 00:43:49.540]   and yet full of courage to move towards people,
[00:43:49.540 --> 00:43:50.500]   to care for them.
[00:43:50.500 --> 00:43:53.140]   Help my friends to do the same,
[00:43:53.140 --> 00:43:55.640]   help those of us who would claim to be Christians
[00:43:55.640 --> 00:43:59.220]   but don't have other followers of Christ in our life
[00:43:59.220 --> 00:44:01.400]   to move in that direction,
[00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:04.180]   to have your body surrounding us,
[00:44:04.180 --> 00:44:07.200]   and we're to be healthy, holy,
[00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:09.800]   because it is the hope of the world, amen.
