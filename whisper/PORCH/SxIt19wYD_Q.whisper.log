[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:24.240]   - What's up, Fort?
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.240]   So good to be with you guys tonight.
[00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.320]   I wanna say hi to our Fort Worth family
[00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.920]   that's just west of here.
[00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.840]   If you're from Houston and you're not glued to a television
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.460]   watching the World Series, congratulations,
[00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.540]   you're the only person in Houston
[00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.580]   not watching the Houston Astros currently.
[00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.840]   But we're so glad everybody's with us around the country.
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.380]   And hey, I wanna tell you,
[00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:40.780]   we are starting a brand new series
[00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.300]   and it is called "Thou Shall."
[00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.540]   Now that video got me as pumped up about "Thou Shall"
[00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.200]   as anything ever has, because I gotta tell you,
[00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.920]   I got some baggage with "Thou Shall."
[00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.140]   I'm not a "Thou Shall" person.
[00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.740]   I don't respond well to commands.
[00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:57.340]   In fact, even though I grew up in a fairly church context
[00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.420]   and I was exposed to some of these commands,
[00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:00.620]   I didn't like 'em.
[00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.420]   And so I don't know if you've ever identified with that,
[00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:03.980]   but that's where I kinda grew up.
[00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.100]   And so I would find like a loophole around anything.
[00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.060]   It didn't matter what it was.
[00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.260]   Like, "Thou shall honor your father and mother."
[00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.900]   Well, that sounds like more of a suggestion.
[00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:12.760]   I don't know how you read it,
[00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.760]   but it sounds like, you know, maybe it's a suggestion.
[00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.820]   You know, "Thou shall not get drunk with wine."
[00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.300]   Good thing I'm a beer guy.
[00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.180]   (congregation laughing)
[00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.580]   Easy, all right?
[00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.220]   You know, "Thou shall not commit adultery."
[00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:26.660]   I'm not an adult.
[00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:27.740]   (congregation laughing)
[00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.020]   I'm gonna do whatever I want with whoever I want.
[00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.100]   And so that's kinda the way I was rolling through life
[00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.620]   all the way up to and including some of young adulthood.
[00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.660]   And by the grace of God, I became a believer in Christ
[00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.100]   and I started to entrust more and more of my life
[00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.060]   over to Him.
[00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.340]   And now after almost a full decade of following Christ
[00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.340]   and trying consciously to let Him have every bit,
[00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:49.980]   100% of my heart,
[00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.640]   I am convinced that the reason I thought that way
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.220]   is not because I didn't understand the commands themselves,
[00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.320]   but it was because I did not understand
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.360]   the full context behind them.
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.320]   I'm gonna say that again.
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.340]   I believe that I rejected the commands of God,
[00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.760]   not because I didn't understand them,
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:12.520]   but because I simply didn't get the full context,
[00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.340]   the full purpose, the full reason,
[00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.080]   the full heart of God behind the command,
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.300]   the reason for the rule or the belief behind the behavior.
[00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.400]   I completely missed it.
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.600]   I had no idea.
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.040]   And so nobody likes commands without context.
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.520]   Can we just agree that nobody likes commands without context?
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:29.760]   This is why some of you right now
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.420]   are frustrated with your boss,
[00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:32.960]   because they dropped by
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.000]   and they said something that sounds like this.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.480]   Well, corporate's doing a restructure
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.180]   and there's gonna be a new rollout
[00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.720]   and basically a lot has changed
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.300]   and here are the new commands.
[00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.880]   And you lean forward like, okay, what's the why?
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.320]   And then they walk off.
[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.400]   And you're like, oh, I guess I'm just supposed to trust it.
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.040]   This is not the dumbest idea ever.
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.240]   All right, and now my whole world has changed
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.400]   and there's no context.
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.400]   There's no why.
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.220]   There's no purpose.
[00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.680]   You're just like, wow, must be nice.
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.360]   And this is what we all experienced it.
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.560]   Every single one of us experienced with our parents,
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.600]   because there are four little words
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.240]   that are given to every English speaking parent in the world
[00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.680]   and they are the words when you ask why they say.
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.800]   We're all related somehow.
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.760]   All of our parents raised us the exact same way.
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.560]   Because I said so.
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:18.640]   It's like, really?
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.160]   I mean, going, looking back, you're like, okay, first off,
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.800]   thank you for reasoning in a circle.
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.200]   Second off, restatement of your point
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.720]   is not an explanation of your point.
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.320]   But you can't say all that when you're four.
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.600]   So you just take it, all right?
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.140]   And so that's the way it's like when you grow up,
[00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.000]   you just get the command and you have no context.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.960]   And a command without context is really just a demand.
[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.140]   And nobody likes demands.
[00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.440]   I know that about you, I know it about me.
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:42.560]   Nobody likes demands.
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.160]   We don't like commands without context.
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.720]   And worst of all, you might've got this from church
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:47.760]   when you were younger.
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.000]   I did.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.040]   It was like, don't run.
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.240]   Don't run to church.
[00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:52.080]   Why not?
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.480]   Just don't run.
[00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:54.640]   Be nice to people at church.
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:55.800]   These people aren't even nice.
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:56.940]   It doesn't matter, just be nice.
[00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.220]   I mean, there's no purpose.
[00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.240]   There's no purpose given at all.
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.560]   And unfortunately, even Christians ourselves
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.280]   sometimes cause this misunderstanding.
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.120]   And here's why.
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:11.240]   It is easier to find a Christian giving commands
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.960]   than it is to find a Christian who's giving context.
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:15.920]   You know what I mean by that?
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.840]   It's easier to find a Christian in public or in culture
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.860]   or in politics or at work or at class
[00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:21.840]   or just in your friend group.
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.440]   It's easier to find a Christian
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.440]   who is all about giving the commands of God.
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.600]   You know, it's almost like they kind of
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.000]   are on patrol all the time.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.220]   And it's like, hey, don't do that.
[00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.060]   Don't drink that.
[00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.880]   Don't smoke that.
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:31.720]   Don't touch her.
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.080]   Don't even like her, you know, in fact.
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.800]   And so it's really easy to find a Christian
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.760]   who is the moral police, okay?
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.640]   But it is hard to find a Christian
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.760]   who is proposing instead of imposing
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.700]   a relationship with God, the heart of God,
[00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.560]   the context of all the commands.
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.480]   And as we launch into this brand new series
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.400]   called "Thou Shalt," it is indeed on the 10 most famous
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.680]   thou shalts and thou shalt nots in all of history.
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.680]   And what we don't wanna do is we are unwilling to risk
[00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.240]   that you might walk away and you might think,
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.500]   you know what, God is more about commands and demands
[00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:07.760]   than he is about context.
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.240]   God is somehow more about just giving rules
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.740]   than he is about giving reasons.
[00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.360]   God is somehow all about just moral behavior
[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.300]   and he has nothing to do with belief.
[00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.720]   And we are not willing to stand up and spend a few weeks
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.640]   giving you these thou shalts without investing
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.880]   really strongly in the context that they came in
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.360]   and what they mean for us.
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.560]   So get ready, we're gonna spend our entire evening
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.820]   on the single sentence before the 10 commandments.
[00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:37.520]   So if you have never spent an entire sermon,
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.500]   half an hour on one sentence, today's your day, all right?
[00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.020]   So we are gonna look very closely at one sentence,
[00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.000]   the sentence before the 10 commandments.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.880]   Nobody knows the sentence before the 10 commandments.
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.660]   That's like no one who baths before Babe Ruth.
[00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:51.040]   Nobody knows who baths before Babe Ruth,
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:51.880]   they know Babe Ruth.
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.660]   And so we are gonna actually look at the sentence
[00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:57.080]   right before the big commandments
[00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.240]   because we want you to see three crucial pieces of context
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.720]   that come before these commands.
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:07.920]   Because context matters big time and it matters to God.
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:08.880]   So what we're gonna do is we're gonna go
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.200]   to Exodus chapter 20.
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.600]   So Exodus would be the second book of your Bible,
[00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.760]   Genesis, Exodus, you don't have to go very far.
[00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.760]   Just start at the far left and start turning right,
[00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:17.980]   you'll get there pretty quickly.
[00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:21.120]   Exodus chapter 20, and we're gonna look at verses one
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.880]   and two, verses one and two, just make up one single sentence
[00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.520]   but before we go there, I want you to know a little bit
[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:27.720]   about the story of what was going on.
[00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:31.360]   So it pleased God to create a perfect world
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.800]   which fell later into imperfection and chaos.
[00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:38.440]   And he decided to redeem that world by creating a family
[00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:41.600]   that would turn into a nation that would produce a savior
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.000]   of the whole world and that of course is Jesus.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.380]   But that's 1500 years after this passage
[00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:48.360]   that we're looking at right now.
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:52.880]   Exodus chapter 20, experts are somewhere between 1446 BC
[00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:55.640]   and 1276 BC, not important, you just need to know
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:57.360]   it's a long time before Jesus.
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:59.160]   All right, and so God is in the middle of launching
[00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:03.000]   this redemptive plan for all of history.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.940]   And Israel is on the verge of becoming
[00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:07.320]   for the very first time its own nation.
[00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:09.840]   So Israel had been just a family, started with Abraham,
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:12.520]   Isaac, Jacob and Joseph, if those names are familiar,
[00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:14.020]   and the family grew and grew and grew
[00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:15.080]   and they went to Egypt.
[00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.080]   Well, they continued to multiply in Egypt
[00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:19.280]   until finally the leadership changed of Egypt
[00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:21.460]   and instead of it being a friendly place to visit,
[00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:23.760]   they were oppressed and they were enslaved.
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:26.760]   And God led them out of slavery.
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:28.360]   And were on the verge, at this time,
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.120]   they were on the verge of having land
[00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:31.120]   for the very first time.
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.540]   That's why the book is called Exodus.
[00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:35.320]   It is the exit of them from Egypt.
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:38.180]   All right, so as they are preparing for the very first time
[00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:40.920]   to go into the promised land, if you've heard that phrase,
[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:42.560]   that's where it comes from, they are on the way,
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:45.120]   they are in route to the promised land
[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:46.720]   and God looks forward and says,
[00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:49.120]   these guys are gonna need some instruction
[00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:50.240]   before they get there.
[00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:51.800]   And that's why God gave the law,
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:56.080]   the most famous section of which is the 10 thou shalls.
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:57.060]   So that's where we are
[00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:58.800]   and we're gonna go six words in right now.
[00:07:58.800 --> 00:07:59.640]   Are you ready?
[00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:01.600]   Here it comes, Exodus chapter 20, verse one.
[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:05.480]   And God spoke all these words.
[00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:08.400]   Let's close in prayer.
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:09.240]   I'm just kidding.
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:11.200]   (congregation laughing)
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.440]   And God spoke all these words.
[00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:15.880]   Now think about this.
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:18.400]   These words matter so much
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:21.080]   because of where they are in the story.
[00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:23.320]   You're in the 70th chapter of the Bible.
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:25.240]   So Genesis has 50 chapters
[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:27.480]   and Exodus has 19 prior to this.
[00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:30.120]   Think about, do a little flyby with me
[00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:33.500]   about what the previous 69 chapters of the Bible involved.
[00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:36.400]   You've got God creating a perfect world,
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:39.160]   free of any hardship at all,
[00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:41.040]   free of death, free of any of that.
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:44.520]   And people begin to immediately break God's law
[00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:47.480]   and we break this world completely.
[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:49.620]   Death comes in, sickness comes in,
[00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:51.680]   shame comes in, guilt comes in.
[00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:53.800]   All the things that you struggle with today
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:57.080]   have at least their beginnings then.
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:58.960]   And just one generation later,
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:00.720]   the sons of the very first parents
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:02.560]   actually murder each other.
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:04.360]   One murders the other, I should say.
[00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:07.520]   After that, we get the first serial murderer,
[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:09.200]   not long after that.
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.420]   And then we get people sleeping around
[00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:12.640]   with each other immediately.
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:14.920]   And then on top of that, you get people who decide,
[00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:15.920]   you know what, I wanna worship something,
[00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:17.200]   I'll just worship some tree,
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.680]   or I'll worship the ground, or I'll worship the sun,
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:22.920]   or I'll worship some golden thing that represents a bird.
[00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:24.880]   And so there is total spiritual confusion.
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:27.060]   And God who had reached out all along the way,
[00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:30.020]   just read these other 69 chapters anytime you want to,
[00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:32.280]   you'll find God persistently, persistently
[00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:33.960]   trying to reach out to humanity,
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:38.000]   trying to reach out to us, to have a relationship with us.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.320]   And he would have had every legitimate reason
[00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:43.160]   to no longer reach out to us.
[00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:47.680]   Which is why you wanna thank God that he's not like you.
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:48.760]   Because we do things like this,
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:51.200]   well, if you're not into me, I'm not into you.
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:52.800]   That's the kind of stuff we do.
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:53.720]   But God says, you know what,
[00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:55.280]   no matter how far you go from me,
[00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:57.720]   I am gonna continue to reach out to you.
[00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:59.760]   And it says, and God spoke all these words.
[00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:01.320]   That's a miracle in and of itself.
[00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:02.160]   It's the grace of God
[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.900]   that he would even decide to speak to us.
[00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:07.220]   Here's a thought you didn't have
[00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:08.480]   on the way to work probably.
[00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:11.120]   What if that hadn't happened?
[00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:14.360]   What would the world be like?
[00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:16.560]   What kind of chaos, there's the hint,
[00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:19.960]   chaos would have ensued if God hadn't spoken these words?
[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:21.560]   What if there was no governance?
[00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:22.400]   I mean, what if that happened?
[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:24.380]   As Americans, for some reason, that sounds good to us.
[00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:27.040]   We have some really misguided ideas about law and freedom.
[00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:28.520]   Sometimes people say things they don't think about,
[00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:29.620]   like, oh, what if there was no law?
[00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:30.460]   Wouldn't that be cool?
[00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:31.480]   Oh no, that would not be cool.
[00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:33.400]   You do not think about what you just said.
[00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.040]   Drive in a third world country
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:37.000]   and find out how much you miss the law.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.160]   It is absolute chaos.
[00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:42.400]   And the truth is, is without God stepping in
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:44.840]   to provide some kind of structure,
[00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:47.840]   it would have resulted in complete
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:49.760]   and utter moral depravity.
[00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:51.900]   Now here's a quote from Clay Christensen
[00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:53.840]   at Harvard Business School.
[00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:55.960]   All right, not Watermark staff, not a church,
[00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:58.700]   not the seminary, not Christianity Today, Harvard.
[00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:02.200]   "If you get rid of religion,
[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:04.800]   "you won't be able to hire enough police."
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:06.600]   End quote.
[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:10.880]   Just today in New York City, more chaos.
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:12.160]   A man, if you haven't seen it,
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.400]   a man drove a truck in an act of terror
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:16.200]   and killed eight people on the streets of New York City.
[00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:17.200]   That just happened today.
[00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:19.100]   I was here four, five, six weeks ago,
[00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:21.940]   and then that was the week of the Las Vegas incident.
[00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:24.000]   There's constant chaos in the world.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.320]   If God doesn't even restrain a little,
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:27.480]   and if he hadn't spoken up,
[00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:30.640]   our semi-safe lives would not even be semi-safe.
[00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:31.720]   And so why would he do it?
[00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:34.440]   Just commitment to us.
[00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:36.080]   So the first piece of context you're gonna want
[00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:38.440]   to remember, any thou shalls that you're gonna hear,
[00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:40.040]   you're gonna wanna know God's commands
[00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:42.640]   prove God's commitment to us.
[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:47.120]   God's commands prove God's commitment to us.
[00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:50.240]   This is so huge if you had a dad who checked out on you,
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:51.360]   because God doesn't give up.
[00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:52.640]   He leans in.
[00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:54.520]   I wanna tell you a little story about my family.
[00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:56.960]   I had a really strong, I have currently,
[00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:00.960]   a really strong command-type dad, world-class dad.
[00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:04.880]   And I have a little brother who was the worst toddler
[00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:06.880]   in the history of all of toddlerdom.
[00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:08.960]   He was rough.
[00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:11.520]   I'm talking about some unbelievable willpower.
[00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:13.080]   I'm talking about like, hey, don't do that.
[00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:15.200]   And then he does it while making eye contact.
[00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:16.920]   Like, I dare you, you know?
[00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:20.200]   And then the promised discipline comes,
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:22.120]   and then he does it again, just tears of anger.
[00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:24.120]   Not even tears of pain, just like anger.
[00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:26.080]   My father would point at him sometimes, you know,
[00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:27.760]   to get his attention, and it's like, hey,
[00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:28.600]   you better do that.
[00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:30.360]   And he would ball up his little fist and point back.
[00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:32.160]   But he couldn't straighten out his finger.
[00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:33.400]   And so he would just look back at dad
[00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:34.480]   with a little claw like this.
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:35.400]   And he would point right back at him,
[00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:36.800]   just completely fearless.
[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:38.320]   So, you know, the car seat is designed
[00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:40.920]   to keep a three-year-old or a two-year-old safe,
[00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:41.760]   a kid safe.
[00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:44.760]   And my dad had to drive with one hand on the wheel
[00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:46.960]   and one hand on the car seat
[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:49.880]   with him punching the hand and the wrist.
[00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:51.440]   And he would just make himself tired
[00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:53.280]   punching the hand and the wrist.
[00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:55.240]   He didn't have a demon to our knowledge, but it was weird.
[00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:57.960]   And so he just would go and go and go.
[00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:59.160]   And then eventually one day,
[00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:00.600]   this light bulb goes off in his head,
[00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:01.560]   and you could just see him think.
[00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:03.760]   And then he just spits all over his hand and says,
[00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:04.600]   "Your move."
[00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:05.440]   And he looks at him like, "Your move."
[00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:06.280]   Wow.
[00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:07.760]   And so this is the kind of dude we're talking about.
[00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:08.680]   I'm gonna tell you one more story just
[00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:09.800]   'cause I can't resist.
[00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:12.200]   (congregation laughing)
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:15.520]   One time he was three and a half, maybe four.
[00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:16.360]   We're eight years apart.
[00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:17.440]   So this is how I have memories of this.
[00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:18.280]   I was 12.
[00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:19.720]   And so he was three and a half,
[00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:21.680]   and afraid of my dad more than him.
[00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:23.200]   And so he's about three and a half, four,
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:24.240]   somewhere through there.
[00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:27.320]   And my dad and I were at my grandparents' house,
[00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:29.280]   but he and his mom, divorced parents,
[00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:30.240]   so he has a different mom.
[00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:31.440]   So he and his mom were home
[00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:33.360]   and dad and I were out at our grandparents' house.
[00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:34.880]   And Wade, my little brother,
[00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:37.080]   has thrown his Game Boy at his mom,
[00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:39.880]   which was just kind of normal occurrence.
[00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:41.680]   Thanks for gasping, but I mean, it was just pretty,
[00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:42.680]   it was kind of normal, you know?
[00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:45.800]   And so my dad gets him on the phone and he says,
[00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:49.360]   "Hey, I heard you threw your Game Boy at your mom."
[00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:50.360]   And he said, "Yeah."
[00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:54.600]   And he said, "Well, how about I take your Game Boy away?
[00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:55.440]   "How about that?"
[00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:56.280]   That's what dad said.
[00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:59.000]   And Wade says immediately, "How about I kick your butt?
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:13:59.840]   "How about that?"
[00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:00.680]   (congregation laughing)
[00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:03.600]   That's the kind of normal, that's normal.
[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:04.880]   I don't know where he learned it, wasn't me?
[00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:08.000]   Okay, so he, this is just kind of what's going on
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:08.840]   in our house.
[00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:09.800]   Now, I could tell you more.
[00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:12.080]   I guarantee you, when we get together for Thanksgiving
[00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:13.400]   in four weeks, this is gonna come up.
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:15.720]   We just go through them all because it's so entertaining.
[00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:17.160]   You'd be glad to know he's a functional member
[00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:19.080]   of society today.
[00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:20.000]   It all went away.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.160]   He's on scholarship playing baseball
[00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:23.320]   at University of New Orleans.
[00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:24.160]   It's super exciting.
[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:25.000]   We're really proud of him.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.520]   He's a great guy, but it took some work.
[00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:29.760]   All right, and so listen, my dad, like think about this.
[00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:31.000]   Think about what if you're dad?
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.480]   Like what if you're dad?
[00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:35.540]   A dad has a choice at this point, okay?
[00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:38.020]   You can check out completely.
[00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:40.040]   That would make you absent dad.
[00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:41.960]   You could just go hands off and laugh about it
[00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:42.920]   and hope he grows out of it,
[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:45.280]   which is to say you could be passive dad.
[00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:47.480]   You could get mad and over discipline, you know,
[00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:49.360]   and spank him too hard and blah, blah, blah.
[00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:52.060]   And you could do all that and then you'd be angry dad.
[00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:58.080]   Or you could persistently give kindhearted commands
[00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:00.560]   and you'd be a loving dad.
[00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:03.120]   This is the heart of God.
[00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:06.840]   He loves us even in our rebellion
[00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:09.160]   that is way more toddler-like than we think.
[00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:10.880]   And he leans forward into us
[00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:14.440]   and he doesn't stop giving structure to our lives
[00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:15.800]   because we need it.
[00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:19.280]   The 10 commandments are not an expression of control.
[00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:22.040]   The words thou shall are not an expression of control.
[00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:23.600]   You need to know that.
[00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:25.520]   It's God's commitment to you.
[00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:27.080]   That's why they're there,
[00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:28.720]   because he is committed to you
[00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:31.120]   and he's committed to your good.
[00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:31.960]   Six words.
[00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:32.780]   All right, let's keep going.
[00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:36.280]   Verse one, "And God spoke all these words,
[00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:41.280]   "saying, 'I am the Lord, your God.'"
[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:42.960]   Whose God?
[00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:44.280]   Your God.
[00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:46.880]   I'm your God, you're my people.
[00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:48.420]   There's a relationship here.
[00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:50.680]   You see, I'm not just speaking this randomly.
[00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:53.320]   I'm saying this to people I know
[00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:54.700]   and that people who know me.
[00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:56.840]   I am the Lord, your God.
[00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:58.840]   The commands are going to his people,
[00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:00.280]   people who know him,
[00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:02.200]   people who know that he's committed to them,
[00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:04.000]   and people who are ready to obey.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.320]   Not just the I'm the Lord and I'm in charge.
[00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:09.040]   I'm the Lord and I'm your God.
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:11.560]   You belong to me and I belong to you.
[00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:13.200]   It's relational.
[00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:15.040]   Everybody was taught this when you were a kid.
[00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:16.100]   Everybody knows.
[00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:18.580]   You obey people you know.
[00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:21.200]   Mom, dad, teacher, yes.
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:23.720]   Man with beard and candy and white van, no.
[00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:26.440]   We don't know him, so we don't obey him.
[00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:28.000]   But it says the Lord, your God,
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.080]   meaning everything I'm about to tell you
[00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:33.900]   is spoken within the context of an existing relationship.
[00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:36.120]   The commands I'm about to give you
[00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:38.680]   are not going to create a relationship.
[00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:40.560]   We're already in one.
[00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:44.460]   So the second piece of context that you're gonna want
[00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:49.120]   for the 10 commandments is that God gives commands to us
[00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:53.480]   after he has started a relationship with us.
[00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:57.280]   Relationship first, then commands.
[00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:59.660]   Always, even in the 10 commandments.
[00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:01.560]   Relationship first, and then obedience.
[00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:03.400]   Relationship, then obedience.
[00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:06.580]   This is huge because it means for us
[00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:10.080]   that you can't get into a relationship with God
[00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:11.680]   by obeying commands.
[00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:16.120]   You can only maintain a relationship with God
[00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:18.320]   by obeying commands.
[00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:20.940]   All you can do is keep fellowship with God.
[00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:23.800]   You can't create an initial fellowship with God.
[00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:25.960]   It is impossible.
[00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:27.880]   You cannot do it.
[00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:29.880]   And if you're like, oh, really, are you sure?
[00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:31.680]   Let's get Jesus' thoughts on the subject.
[00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:32.520]   I would love to do that.
[00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:34.760]   Check this out in John chapter 14.
[00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:36.800]   This is fast forward 1,500 years.
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:39.840]   Listen to this, the way Jesus captures this.
[00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:43.560]   If you love me, that's a relationship,
[00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:45.520]   you will keep my commandments.
[00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:46.840]   That's obedience.
[00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:50.120]   If you love me, if there's a relationship here,
[00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:51.860]   if there's a real relationship here,
[00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:53.720]   then you are going to keep my commandments.
[00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:56.520]   As a natural outworking of that relationship.
[00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:58.360]   If you love me, you'll keep my commandments.
[00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:00.080]   Now, there are two mistakes that people try to make
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:01.820]   with this principle.
[00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:03.800]   That relationship comes first and then obedience.
[00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:04.760]   Here are the two mistakes.
[00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:06.680]   They get the order wrong.
[00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:09.200]   And so they think, I am gonna be so obedient
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:11.520]   that somehow God is going to love me.
[00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:12.920]   I am gonna clean myself up.
[00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:14.420]   I am gonna stop sleeping around.
[00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:15.540]   I have had it with him.
[00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:16.500]   I'm breaking up with him.
[00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:17.560]   I knew I should have done it.
[00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:19.640]   And I am gonna start listening to my friends
[00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:21.360]   and I'm gonna start reading the Bible.
[00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:23.360]   And it's just gonna be different from here on out.
[00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:26.040]   And then God will be pleased with me enough at least.
[00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:28.320]   I'll meet him in the middle and we'll have a relationship.
[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:30.720]   Okay, this is just something natural we do as people
[00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:32.960]   is we think we're gonna obey our way
[00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:34.500]   into a relationship with God.
[00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:37.200]   That's a mistake because the Bible says
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.920]   that a relationship with God is based on grace.
[00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:42.560]   That is a gift from him to you through faith,
[00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:44.760]   which means you trust him, you depend on him,
[00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:47.920]   you rely on him and then the obedience comes afterward.
[00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:50.320]   You can't obey your way into a relationship with God.
[00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:54.040]   You trust your way into a relationship with God.
[00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:56.920]   And so that's the first error is people try to obey
[00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:58.720]   and they think that will win them a relationship.
[00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:00.480]   The other mistake people commonly make,
[00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:03.480]   this is increasingly common, I'm sad to say,
[00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:06.800]   is that people just leave off the whole obedience part.
[00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:09.000]   It's like, I've got a relationship with God
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.240]   and I don't need to do anything else.
[00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:12.720]   Therefore, there's no commandments, freedom in Christ.
[00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:14.220]   And so people say, you know what?
[00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:16.620]   I've got this relationship with God and so I love him.
[00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:17.560]   And so, you know what?
[00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:20.000]   Let's not get all legalistic buzzword about it.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:20.840]   You know what?
[00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:23.080]   Let's not get all uptight and mechanical about it.
[00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:25.240]   I've got a relationship with God, so why obey?
[00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:27.920]   And I'm telling you, you might want to discern
[00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:30.120]   whether or not you love Jesus the way you think you do
[00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:31.880]   because he says right here,
[00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:35.480]   if you love me, you will obey my commandments.
[00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:39.200]   Not if you love me, you will find ways to talk yourself out
[00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:41.720]   of my commandments and claim freedom in Christ.
[00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:43.720]   It says, if you love me, you'll keep my commandments.
[00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:45.800]   Relationship and then obedience.
[00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:47.960]   Start to finish in your Bible, it's amazing.
[00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:51.960]   And God is saying, I give you this law.
[00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:54.220]   I give you these commandments
[00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:56.880]   to govern our existing relationship.
[00:19:56.880 --> 00:20:00.220]   Now, there's one piece of cleanup I need to do on this.
[00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:02.040]   The truth is, you're in a relationship with God
[00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:03.880]   whether you want to be or not
[00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:08.120]   because he created you and that's the way it works.
[00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:09.700]   You know, you don't get to pick your mom,
[00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:11.160]   you don't get to pick your dad.
[00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:14.240]   You can pretend, but you don't get to pick your God either.
[00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:15.520]   Not really.
[00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:17.720]   There's one God who created you.
[00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:21.120]   And by the way, being an atheist or denying God
[00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:23.840]   or denying the scripture actually is not an exemption
[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:25.920]   from the 10 commandments because the government
[00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:27.220]   thinks some of these are important.
[00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:28.720]   Like thou shalt not kill.
[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:30.120]   I mean, can you imagine killing someone
[00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:31.980]   and telling the judge, no, I'm an atheist, man.
[00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:33.520]   I don't do the 10 commandments.
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:36.240]   That's not gonna work.
[00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:38.240]   The government will put you in adult timeout.
[00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:40.280]   If you steal or if you kill people,
[00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:42.180]   you will actually be secluded from society.
[00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:43.480]   That's the way this works.
[00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:46.620]   And so I'm not saying that you are only in a relationship
[00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:48.760]   with God totally if you choose to be.
[00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:50.720]   Of course, you've gotta opt in and give your trust to him
[00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:53.240]   and that's a choice that only you can make.
[00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:55.000]   I'm saying you get to decide whether you wanna be
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   in a rebellious relationship with him
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.880]   or a cooperative relationship with him.
[00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:01.200]   And if you decide to be in a cooperative relationship
[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:03.960]   with him, then these commands especially
[00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:05.520]   are there to help you flourish.
[00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:07.240]   All right.
[00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:10.220]   Verse one, again.
[00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:14.400]   And God spoke all these words,
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:17.400]   saying, "I am the Lord your God,"
[00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:21.760]   and then the last bit, "who brought you out of Egypt,
[00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:23.580]   "out of the house of slavery."
[00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:25.400]   Hello, you think there's some context?
[00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:27.560]   Out of the house of slavery.
[00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:29.980]   You are here because I freed you.
[00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:32.440]   The only reason you're even here,
[00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:34.060]   the only reason we're having this conversation
[00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:35.280]   is because you prayed to me
[00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:37.240]   and despite everything wrong you'd ever done,
[00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:40.920]   I chose to answer you and so now consequently, you're free.
[00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:42.560]   You exist in a state of freedom.
[00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:44.440]   You've already started to complain about it,
[00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:48.200]   but you exist right now in a state of complete freedom.
[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:51.880]   And the word slavery right here signals to us as we read
[00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:56.520]   that every one of these commands is a ticket to freedom.
[00:21:56.520 --> 00:22:01.440]   Every one of these commands is a way to stay free.
[00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:04.240]   The reason God, why would God mention the past like this?
[00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:06.000]   Oh God, you know, don't mention the past.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.500]   Why would he mention the past?
[00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:13.800]   Because he's saying the slavery of the past is no more
[00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:15.600]   and what I'm about to tell you right now
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:17.140]   is the way to stay free.
[00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:21.900]   Thou shalt not commit adultery in order to stay free.
[00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:25.880]   Thou shalt rest once a week in order to stay free.
[00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:28.360]   Thou shalt not covet each other's wives
[00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:31.460]   or husbands or houses in order to stay free.
[00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:34.760]   That's the spirit behind these commandments.
[00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:36.920]   That's a huge, huge distinction.
[00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:40.600]   So the third piece of context you'll want tonight
[00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:42.040]   before we keep going in the series later
[00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:45.780]   is that God's commands are given to preserve freedom.
[00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:47.640]   How good is God?
[00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:52.120]   God's commandments are given to preserve freedom.
[00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:54.120]   It's not 10 commandments because I said so.
[00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:56.040]   It's not Bible because I said so.
[00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:58.760]   It's 10 commandments because I want you to be free.
[00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:00.320]   I want you to stay free.
[00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:02.720]   I gave you a gift and I want you to preserve it.
[00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:07.760]   And ironically, ironically, we believe,
[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:09.360]   we believe that God's commandments
[00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:12.260]   actually reduce our freedom.
[00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:14.520]   How bizarre and insane is that?
[00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:17.520]   We actually think that if we adopt the commands of God,
[00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:19.580]   that we're somehow gonna be the ones who miss out.
[00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:21.760]   Like if we do these thou shalts and thou shalt nots,
[00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:23.280]   we're gonna have less life instead of more.
[00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:25.360]   We're gonna have less freedom instead of more.
[00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:26.360]   But here's the curve ball.
[00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:27.840]   If you're sitting there thinking,
[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:29.320]   oh, if I follow the commands of God,
[00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:31.660]   I don't get to have my sex or I don't get to have my stuff
[00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:33.560]   or I don't get to have my relationship.
[00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:35.680]   You don't even realize that the relationship
[00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:38.160]   or the sex or the stuff has you.
[00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:40.000]   You are currently not free.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.580]   Listen to what Jesus says, John chapter eight.
[00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:48.280]   "Truly, truly, I say to you,
[00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:53.280]   "everyone who practices sin is a slave to sin."
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:57.600]   That means if you think your favorite sin expression,
[00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:59.540]   whatever it is, you pick it.
[00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:02.100]   Self-obsession, chasing money, you pick.
[00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:05.240]   If you think your favorite sin expression
[00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:06.480]   is a ticket to freedom,
[00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:09.040]   you are actually already enslaved to it.
[00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:12.880]   I experienced this.
[00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:15.360]   Pornography for me was just a world of curiosity
[00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:16.400]   when I was 14.
[00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:20.240]   But when I was 21, it was a world of bondage.
[00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:24.840]   I started to practice sin and I became a slave to sin.
[00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:26.720]   It started to own me.
[00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:30.240]   And I might've even told you I was free, but I wasn't.
[00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:32.480]   I started to practice, but then I got caught.
[00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:34.080]   See, that's the way it always works.
[00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:35.640]   So this happens when you like,
[00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:37.160]   if you might notice this happening,
[00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:39.640]   if you drink wine socially,
[00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:42.520]   but then all of a sudden you're drinking wine solutionally.
[00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:44.360]   Like now it's a solution.
[00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:46.480]   Like instead of like, oh, you know what?
[00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:48.200]   People like me better and the jokes are funnier.
[00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:50.000]   And I'm gonna have a glass of wine at this thing.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.400]   Now, all of a sudden, you gotta have a glass of wine
[00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:52.560]   every time you come home from work
[00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:54.760]   and you find yourself looking forward to it.
[00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:58.020]   And all of a sudden it's gone from a social thing
[00:24:58.020 --> 00:24:59.120]   to a solution thing.
[00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:00.600]   Something broke you.
[00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:03.660]   And you're not as free as you think you are.
[00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:06.140]   This happens in relationships.
[00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:07.100]   That happens between people.
[00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:09.420]   You get into a relationship and it starts to go good.
[00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:10.900]   And you're like, oh man, this is like,
[00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:12.660]   this is a serious option for the rest of my life.
[00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:14.300]   I mean, I'm like, we are thinking about this.
[00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:15.460]   This is getting serious.
[00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:18.140]   And then all of a sudden you start sleeping together
[00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:20.660]   and they become the focal point of your entire life
[00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:22.560]   where you can't even imagine life without them.
[00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:24.500]   No matter how bad they treat you,
[00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:27.120]   no matter how much your mama doesn't like him or her,
[00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:29.520]   no matter how much the friends around you are saying
[00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:31.460]   that this is alarming and not the right relationship.
[00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:32.620]   And all of a sudden you find yourself
[00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:34.620]   enduring all kinds of abuse and hardship
[00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:35.900]   and weirdness and drama.
[00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:39.240]   And the option for you to put down the relationship is gone.
[00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:42.140]   You've lost freedom because you started to practice sin.
[00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:44.980]   That's the way it always works.
[00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:47.860]   Everyone who practices sin is a slave to sin.
[00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:49.460]   But praise God, two verses later he says,
[00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:52.360]   "If the Son of God sets you free, you'll be free indeed."
[00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:58.720]   So in summary, God's commands prove God's commitment to us.
[00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:01.140]   God gives commands to us
[00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:03.220]   after he has started a relationship with us.
[00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:05.140]   And thirdly, God's commands are given
[00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:07.020]   to preserve our freedom.
[00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:10.660]   I'd love to close by telling you a story this evening.
[00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:13.320]   So there came a time in my life that was pretty rough.
[00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:14.380]   I'd call it kind of the low point.
[00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:16.360]   I was pretty young, so it's hard to call it the low point,
[00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:17.200]   but I know that it was.
[00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:19.220]   I was an early teenager.
[00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:20.940]   And I told you my parents were divorced
[00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:24.140]   and they had been since before I even had a memory.
[00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:25.980]   And I was living with my mom
[00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:29.340]   and I basically got into junior high
[00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:32.340]   and decided I wanted to overrule my mom
[00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:33.580]   and I just wanted to be a thug.
[00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:36.020]   And so I started smoking weed.
[00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:37.260]   I know that's crazy.
[00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:39.380]   And so, but I started smoking weed.
[00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:40.940]   I ran from the police, almost got arrested,
[00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:43.340]   stole my mom's car to go joyriding.
[00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:44.840]   I was sleeping around already
[00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:46.460]   and I was just not a nice kid.
[00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:47.820]   I was not a good guy.
[00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:49.740]   And you look back at that and you think,
[00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:50.700]   "Ah, it was kid stuff."
[00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:51.540]   It wasn't, man.
[00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:53.200]   I was guilty and I knew it.
[00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:55.380]   And the situation really came apart for me.
[00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:57.300]   Started failing out of school, no lie.
[00:26:57.300 --> 00:27:00.900]   And then the situation really fell apart.
[00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:02.460]   My mom married the wrong dude
[00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:04.420]   and there was a domestic violence situation
[00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:07.480]   that was kind of ongoing for about six months.
[00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:09.700]   And I was put in some pretty tough positions.
[00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:14.120]   And this guy put my mom in the hospital twice.
[00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:15.620]   So that's what it was like in the house
[00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:16.980]   for a brief period of time.
[00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:19.900]   Thankfully, my mom knew that she was valuable enough
[00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:22.020]   to extract herself from that situation
[00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:22.900]   and to move the kids out.
[00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:26.100]   So we did, but it was really, really, really hard.
[00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:29.340]   And in the midst of that, I sat down
[00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:30.180]   and I started thinking,
[00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:32.660]   "You know, I do have another option
[00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:33.940]   now that mom's out, mom's safe.
[00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:37.080]   I mean, I could go live with dad with all his rules."
[00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:39.180]   And I started to think about it.
[00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:41.140]   Like, do I really want, you know?
[00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:43.060]   I was a punk and I knew it.
[00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:45.380]   I had an older brother who was a few years down the road,
[00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:46.220]   farther down this road
[00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:47.700]   and he was reaping even more destruction.
[00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:49.740]   And I thought, "You know what?
[00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:50.900]   I wonder if I should go live with dad."
[00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:52.780]   And I started to think about it, kind of weigh my options.
[00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:54.060]   Hmm, is the law worth it?
[00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:56.780]   Is it worth it to get all the commands?
[00:27:56.780 --> 00:27:57.740]   'Cause he was a tight dad.
[00:27:57.740 --> 00:28:00.460]   I mean, he was ruling with a tight fist.
[00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:01.940]   Was it worth it?
[00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:04.440]   And I started replaying memories from my whole life.
[00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:07.060]   And I noticed that every time he spanked me,
[00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:09.600]   he always explained before and he hugged after.
[00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:13.300]   And I noticed that after every little league game,
[00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:16.020]   win, lose, play bad, play good,
[00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:17.580]   he was always telling me he loved me
[00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:19.300]   and that it was enough.
[00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:21.940]   And that every time he pushed me really hard,
[00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:24.100]   he would tell me that he loved me no matter what.
[00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:27.540]   He always called, he always wrote,
[00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:28.780]   he never broke a promise.
[00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:32.500]   And he did all this from miles and miles and miles away.
[00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:36.020]   I got birthday cakes every time I went over to his house.
[00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:36.860]   I'd already had a birthday party,
[00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:38.380]   it didn't matter, dad's buying a birthday cake.
[00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:40.180]   So it was constant.
[00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:42.900]   I thought, I grew up thinking, this is crazy now knowing,
[00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:45.420]   but I grew up thinking that 20-somethings
[00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:47.900]   had nothing better to do than drive to East Texas
[00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:49.940]   from DFW to hang out with their T-baller.
[00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:52.060]   Like I thought that that's what 20-somethings did.
[00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:53.400]   They just drive all over Texas
[00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:55.380]   to hang out with their four-year-old or their five-year-old
[00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:57.980]   or their eight-year-old because that's what my dad did.
[00:28:57.980 --> 00:28:59.260]   I was so convinced.
[00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:01.940]   And so as I weighed my options
[00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:04.180]   of all the chaos that was outside of me
[00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:06.700]   as an early teenager and all the chaos I knew
[00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:07.740]   was inside of me,
[00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:11.860]   I could see the heart behind my father's discipline.
[00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:13.760]   And I chose to move in with him.
[00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:16.220]   And I knew when I got there,
[00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:18.100]   his controlling hands were gonna come on in
[00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:20.520]   and it was gonna be like, the law has come to town.
[00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:22.260]   Sure enough, here's our first conversation.
[00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:23.100]   Hey, if you act like a thug,
[00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:24.220]   I'm gonna send you back to East Texas.
[00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:25.980]   Okay, got it, knew that was coming.
[00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:28.100]   And so he was a firm dad,
[00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:30.340]   but I knew the intent of his heart.
[00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:32.340]   I knew that Hebrews 12, six,
[00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:34.760]   that God disciplines those he loves
[00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:36.500]   was part of my dad's heart.
[00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:37.420]   It was his heart.
[00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:41.340]   And it made it easy to move in closer to him.
[00:29:41.340 --> 00:29:43.940]   My dad and I have an amazing relationship to this day.
[00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:46.460]   And so what I wanna tell you is,
[00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:50.820]   if you can see the heart behind the commands of God,
[00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:52.460]   you will be attracted.
[00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:55.340]   You will move closer.
[00:29:55.340 --> 00:29:57.160]   If you know it's not just control
[00:29:57.160 --> 00:29:58.400]   and it's not just limiting freedom,
[00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:01.140]   it's not, as we say, trying to rip you off,
[00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:02.900]   but it really is trying to set you free.
[00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:06.620]   If you can see that, then you will move closer to God.
[00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:08.460]   We won't be able to keep you away
[00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:11.500]   because you'll see his heart
[00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:12.820]   and you'll know what he intends for you.
[00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:14.740]   And when you feel those commands of the Bible,
[00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:16.300]   there's no secret, there's commands in the Bible.
[00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:17.740]   Of course there's commands in the Bible.
[00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:19.700]   But when you feel those bump up against you
[00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:21.300]   and demand a change from you
[00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:22.980]   or demand a sacrifice from you,
[00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:25.300]   all of a sudden you will like it
[00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:29.460]   because you know it's a father forming you.
[00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:35.100]   Romans 8 says that he's bringing us all into his image.
[00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:38.700]   He predestined us to be conformed into the image of Christ.
[00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:40.660]   That means that every command of God is for your good
[00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:42.980]   so that you will look like Christ
[00:30:42.980 --> 00:30:45.660]   and you will stay free from whatever Egypt
[00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:47.420]   he brought you out of.
[00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:48.460]   That's the goodness of God.
[00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:50.300]   But if you can't see that,
[00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:53.460]   you'll stay away and you'll be suspicious.
[00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:56.360]   And you'll think, I'm not gonna give my life to God.
[00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:57.740]   But if you can see the heart,
[00:30:57.740 --> 00:30:59.800]   if you can see the context behind the command,
[00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:01.900]   which is why we wanted to invest an entire night
[00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:03.540]   in one sentence, because we know
[00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:06.420]   if you can see the heart behind the command,
[00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:10.100]   you'll come closer, just like we all do.
[00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:12.300]   Let's pray together.
[00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:18.080]   Thank you, Father in heaven,
[00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:20.180]   that you saw fit to speak to us
[00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:22.060]   even when we were undeserving,
[00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:23.580]   even when we had turned our back on you
[00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:26.340]   in every way imaginable,
[00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:28.780]   when we suspected you that your commands
[00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:30.420]   would just make us uncreative,
[00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:33.120]   when we thought that your commands would make us bored,
[00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:35.780]   when we thought that your commands would lead to less life,
[00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:38.540]   you still pressed forward and you still pursued us.
[00:31:38.540 --> 00:31:42.620]   Thank you, God, that you saw fit to do that.
[00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:46.740]   God, help us to see that you discipline those whom you love.
[00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:48.440]   Help us to sing just like David did,
[00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:49.800]   things we thought we would never sing,
[00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:52.400]   like we love your law, we meditate on your law,
[00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:54.400]   day and night, oh, how we love your statutes,
[00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:55.440]   sweeter than honey.
[00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:58.520]   Give us a heart to see, God.
[00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:00.560]   Give us eyes to see past the thou shall
[00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:03.560]   and help us not be suspicious of your mouth that speaks it.
[00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:08.640]   Because you're trying to have a relationship with us.
[00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:10.760]   You're trying to keep us free.
[00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:13.760]   The only reason you ever regulate life is to make it better.
[00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:16.300]   Teach us to believe it, God.
[00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:19.220]   In Jesus' name, Amen.
