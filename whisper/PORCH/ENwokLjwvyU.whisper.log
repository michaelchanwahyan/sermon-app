[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.760]   What's up, everybody in the room?
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.840]   Everybody tuning in.
[00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.040]   Hey, this is Crew and Monroe, who I talk about all the time.
[00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.520]   And Crew, this is one of his last weeks of summer.
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.800]   And he has never been to a porch.
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.720]   And so he wanted to come see it.
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:47.440]   So now--
[00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.080]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.000]   Wait, what?
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.440]   No, she hasn't.
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.400]   Oh, she hasn't either.
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.720]   Yeah, she has not been to another one either.
[00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.480]   But hey, can you all say hi and bye?
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.400]   All right, now you're going to go with Ramsey.
[00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.520]   And you've got to go home to mama,
[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.800]   or I'm going to be in trouble.
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.920]   So all right.
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:05.680]   Hey, bye, y'all.
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:06.600]   Walk with Ramsey.
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.760]   Listen good.
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.120]   Don't tell mom about the cookies.
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.200]   All right, so hey, everybody, bye.
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.720]   Yeah, love you.
[00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.760]   If you're joining us online or in the room,
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.200]   those are my kids who are here.
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.760]   And I had an illustration that was going to open with Monroe.
[00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.960]   And JJ, our production director, was like,
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.600]   do you just want to bring them up there
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.640]   rather than do a picture?
[00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.960]   And my honest answer was, it depends on how long they last
[00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.320]   before the meltdown happens.
[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.760]   And so if you saw my son running around the aisles, I apologize.
[00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.160]   I tried to tell him, we're not that kind of church.
[00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:43.120]   And he didn't quite get it.
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:52.880]   And so on June 29, 2018, my wife gave birth to our daughter.
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.360]   And we had had-- yeah, thank you.
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.880]   You just saw it.
[00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.720]   There's the proof.
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:58.600]   I'd had a son.
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.440]   And having a daughter is just such a different deal.
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:02.720]   And I would see that over time.
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.480]   I mean, she's the most girly girl, which I'm not saying
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.800]   everybody has to be, but just the most girly girl person
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.120]   I've ever met in my life.
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.160]   I mean, my son is constantly like, let's wrestle.
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.680]   Let's fight.
[00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:13.560]   Can we compete?
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.440]   And she is like, oh, let me hold the baby.
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.320]   Let me hold the baby.
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.680]   And having a newborn has only made her even more like,
[00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.680]   now I have a real live baby doll.
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.880]   And I mean, she wants to wear dresses all day long.
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.440]   And she changes outfits like 16 times a day, which is only
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.840]   like three less than her mom.
[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.720]   And she-- I'm totally kidding.
[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.600]   And I'm going to be in trouble for that later.
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.960]   But it just is a different thing.
[00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.120]   Because when you raise a son, you're kind of like, all right,
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.800]   man, there's a lot of dysfunction
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.240]   in the world caused by men.
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.920]   Together, we're going to get their son.
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.000]   You're trying to raise him and just teach him to be God's man
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.280]   and not just somebody that contributes
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.800]   to the chaos in the world around you.
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.920]   And then when you have a daughter, you're like, OK,
[00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.600]   now I have to protect you from all
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.280]   of the craziness and the crazy men in the world around you,
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.120]   which is a much more significant thing.
[00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.240]   It's one, you're just, hey, just don't contribute.
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.720]   And the other one is, oh, no.
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.400]   And I've just seen it play out.
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.200]   And raising her, I know there's going
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.600]   to be a lot of milestones in her life
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.560]   that will be significant ones.
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:19.120]   When she grows up and goes into middle school
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.240]   and is embarrassed of mom and dad or hits puberty,
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.920]   that one's going to be real interesting.
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.600]   Or when she can drive a car for the first time
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.760]   or when she goes on her first date
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.760]   or when she goes off to college, it's
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.960]   just these milestone moments in front of us.
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:40.720]   And another milestone will be how she interacts
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.960]   with the faith or does she become a believer.
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:44.800]   Hopefully, she does.
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.080]   We certainly pray that she does.
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.080]   But the question in tonight's wrap-up of FAQ
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:56.040]   that I want to answer will have a great deal with whether
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.680]   or not she does follow Christ.
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.680]   It's a question that has prevented a lot of people
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.000]   and confused a lot of people and discouraged a lot of people
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.240]   from following Christ.
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:13.280]   And it's the question of, is the Bible sexist?
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.040]   Is the Bible sexist?
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.160]   Like, is Christianity, is Jesus, does it
[00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.840]   have a preference over men?
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.200]   Is the message of the New Testament
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.320]   and of the Bible as a whole, is it sexist?
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.240]   And so that's what I want to walk through tonight.
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.640]   And let me say a couple of prefaces before we dive in.
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.800]   When it comes to exactly what exactly is sexist
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.840]   and what's not, there's some subjectivity to it.
[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.680]   There's an opinion related to it.
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.000]   And certain things are just clearly
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.840]   showing a discrimination over someone's sex.
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.300]   And then there's other things where it just candidly isn't.
[00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.440]   In fact, in reading and preparing and studying,
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.920]   increasingly, there's a lot of division
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.080]   over even what is sexism.
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.720]   For example, if I said, hey, on the first date,
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.160]   he opened the door for you.
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.000]   Is that sexist or not?
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   Now, we're in Texas, so most of us would say, no.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.120]   That's not sexist.
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.880]   That's sweet.
[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.400]   But there's a lot of people increasingly
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.360]   that would say, no, that's sexist.
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.960]   How dare you think that I can't open my own door?
[00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.000]   What's wrong with you?
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.960]   That's a thing.
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.800]   Even the idea of opening a door and holding it
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:22.160]   open for a woman, is that sexist or sweet?
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.280]   Many of us would say sweet, but there's people in the world
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:24.880]   that would say it's not.
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.640]   In other words, there's some subjectivity.
[00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.160]   In fact, even on paying for a first date, which I would
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.960]   highly encourage, if you're going to take her on a date,
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.400]   and you're going to take her time, you are paying.
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.600]   But even that is sweet as that.
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:42.720]   And if it needs to be said, I mean,
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:43.960]   you could look it up right now.
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.560]   Paying for the first date, is it sexist?
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.120]   You're going to hit lots and lots of Cosmopolitan magazine
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.040]   and different things pop up.
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.560]   So there's some subjectivity in regards to that.
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:59.200]   But I want to make the case that the person of Christ
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:03.760]   is the single most pro-woman person who has ever lived.
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.960]   And I also want to make a case that the Christian movement
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:10.720]   has been the single greatest force for human rights,
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.920]   period, but for women in general,
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:17.880]   and is the most pro-force for women that has ever existed.
[00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:20.440]   In order to do so, I've got to cover a lot of historical
[00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:23.920]   ground and bring a lot of us into a bigger perspective
[00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.840]   on why that is the case, and candidly,
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:27.520]   why you think the way that you do.
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:33.520]   But before I go there and bring up some historical
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:37.240]   and academic and research-based things, I want to say this.
[00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:40.360]   If you have been in a church context,
[00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.400]   I'm speaking specifically to the ladies,
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:48.360]   and you have felt discouraged, inferior,
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:52.440]   less than in any way, I am sorry.
[00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:55.240]   And that is not at all consistent
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.800]   with what we're going to see in Scripture.
[00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.440]   And we're going to walk through God's design
[00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:00.280]   and God's creation.
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.440]   And I know a lot of people maybe just listening
[00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:05.040]   down the road or listening online have felt that
[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:05.880]   and experienced that.
[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:07.600]   And if you've ever experienced anything like that for me,
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.520]   will you please forgive me?
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.520]   Because that is not God's heart.
[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:15.120]   And His design is so incredible and beautiful,
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:17.360]   and His image is reflected.
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:20.840]   And I hope that tonight is a strengthening
[00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:24.360]   of God's amazing design in male and female.
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:25.560]   So I want to walk through four things.
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.600]   I want to walk through the world before sin,
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:29.160]   as God designed it.
[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:32.280]   Then I want to walk through the world before Christ
[00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:34.600]   and the world of women before Christ.
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.120]   And then I want to walk through the world of women
[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:39.480]   because of Christ and men.
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:42.960]   And then our world today without Christ.
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:45.440]   So first we're going to cover the world very quickly,
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:46.600]   the world before sin.
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.080]   So this is Genesis chapter one.
[00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:49.560]   If you take notes, the world before sin,
[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:51.040]   God creates the world.
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:53.880]   And on the very first page of the Bible,
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:57.120]   He says, "Let us make mankind in our image."
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:01.280]   And it says this, Genesis chapter one,
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:04.520]   as in the first chapter, first page.
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:10.560]   "In the image of God, God created mankind."
[00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:12.480]   In the image of God, He created them.
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:15.720]   Male and female, He created them.
[00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:17.200]   One of the biggest lies in our world right now
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:21.080]   is that either men exclusively, uniquely,
[00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:23.560]   or even majorly reflect the image of God.
[00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:24.400]   That's not true.
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:28.640]   From page one, God said, "Male and female
[00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:31.520]   "have been created to reflect the image of God."
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:33.680]   And the masculine qualities,
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:36.000]   and even that has gotten so distorted.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.960]   But inside of males and females,
[00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:43.440]   you see the image of God reflected in our world.
[00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:46.260]   And every person that is in this room
[00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.040]   or ever listens that has ever lived
[00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:53.040]   has eternal value, biblically speaking.
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:55.540]   Not because of how they look, where they work,
[00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:58.600]   where they were born, what they've done or haven't done,
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:03.080]   but because they have been made in the image of God.
[00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:05.520]   And nothing can take that away.
[00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:07.480]   Nothing can change that.
[00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:09.720]   And as Christians, because the Bible says that,
[00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:12.200]   we have a framework now to approach the conversation.
[00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:13.360]   In other words, a lot of people in life,
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:17.200]   without the Bible, without a compass,
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:20.580]   something that's informing how they think
[00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:23.300]   and how they believe and what is right and wrong,
[00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:25.560]   they're going off their opinion.
[00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.080]   And there's a lot of people inside of the world
[00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:30.460]   that are fighting for something based on their opinion.
[00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:32.480]   And as Christians, we have the strongest argument
[00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:34.640]   for, hey, here's why every person is worthy
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:36.840]   of being treated with respect and dignity and care,
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:39.640]   regardless of what they've done or haven't done
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:42.280]   or who they are, because they have been made
[00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:45.200]   in the image of God, unlike anything else in creation.
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:50.200]   They're a divine image bearer of such great value,
[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:53.400]   Jesus would give his life on the cross for them.
[00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:56.080]   So that was God's design.
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:10:00.720]   And he created man in his image and he put him on earth.
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:03.000]   And that lasted about three minutes.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.800]   And sin entered the world and everything got fractured.
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:10.280]   And all of a sudden, this working together relationship
[00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:15.280]   of male and female became riddled with division,
[00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:21.240]   animosity, hostility, a desire for one another's roles,
[00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:24.720]   a rejection of God, a fracture in relationships
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:27.900]   and the ability to keep relationships.
[00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:31.840]   And eventually, because of the product of sin
[00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:35.240]   and our world, that led to some real big distortions.
[00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:37.800]   I mean, we say that list would be too great to number
[00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:40.160]   throughout history, but one of the divisions that happened
[00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:45.160]   was abusive leadership and relationship styles from men.
[00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:55.100]   And God never created the world to be one
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:11:00.120]   where one male or female treated with less dignity
[00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:06.340]   the opposite sex because they were of the opposite sex.
[00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:10.060]   But sadly, that is the case today in many places
[00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:12.520]   and is sin anytime it exists.
[00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:17.520]   So I wanna paint a picture of the world before Jesus arrived
[00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:22.260]   or candidly, the world that Jesus arrived into.
[00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:26.580]   Because like I said, the way that you think about rights,
[00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:30.140]   people, has been so shaped, whether you're a Christian
[00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:32.880]   or not by the Judeo-Christian, in other words,
[00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:35.820]   by biblical thinking, that we just take it for granted.
[00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:37.980]   We think everybody, we think our founders,
[00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:39.500]   we hold these truths to be self-evident.
[00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:41.060]   All men are created equal.
[00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:43.020]   That's not accurate.
[00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:44.860]   They believe those are evident for them
[00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:46.060]   or they believe those are self-evident.
[00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:48.960]   There's a lot of people in human history that would disagree
[00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:52.840]   and in candidly, a tragic way,
[00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:55.220]   they didn't fully live out those beliefs.
[00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:57.680]   And yet, there's a lot of people around the world today
[00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:00.280]   that wouldn't say men and women are equal.
[00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:02.160]   Billions that wouldn't say that.
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:04.400]   The reason why we think that is because of Christian
[00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:07.140]   influence in the way that we think in our society,
[00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:09.800]   whether or not it's as strong as it once was.
[00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:11.960]   That is a biblical idea and as Christians,
[00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:14.720]   we have the benefit of saying, this is what God says.
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:18.160]   Every person, male and female, deserves dignity and respect.
[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:19.760]   But that wasn't always the case
[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:21.660]   in terms of the culture.
[00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:22.500]   What do I mean?
[00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:25.940]   So, second point, the world before Jesus.
[00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:26.780]   Let me paint a picture.
[00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:28.680]   Anyone know when Christianity was started,
[00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:31.600]   what the name of the empire that existed was?
[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:32.440]   Roman Empire.
[00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:34.600]   You saw the movie Gladiator, boom, you got it.
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:36.680]   All right, Roman Empire conquered the known world
[00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:38.820]   and here's how the Romans thought about men and women.
[00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:39.960]   So, I'm gonna cover a few buckets.
[00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:41.120]   How they thought about women,
[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:43.520]   how they thought about marriage as it related to
[00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:46.240]   a woman and male's or husband's role inside of that
[00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:48.120]   and daughters specifically
[00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:51.460]   because it is so distant from how we think about it,
[00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:53.120]   it's jarring.
[00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:54.820]   But the world that Jesus showed up in,
[00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:57.440]   the world before Jesus' influence took place,
[00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:59.180]   here's some of the teachings.
[00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:01.640]   Women were seen as legally worthless.
[00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:02.800]   If they were married, they were the property
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:04.080]   of their husband.
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:06.560]   They couldn't make the decision to get married.
[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:10.560]   They were underneath the decision making of their father.
[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:12.840]   They were not just seen legally
[00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:13.960]   as they couldn't testify in court,
[00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:16.280]   they didn't have those types of rights.
[00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:18.200]   Some of the most prominent teachers of the day
[00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:21.040]   taught this outright.
[00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:22.440]   Teachers, you've heard the names before,
[00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:23.600]   you don't remember anything they wrote
[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:25.040]   'cause you did, you know,
[00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:28.200]   the, whatever the abbreviated version of reading
[00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:32.400]   in high school thing is, but teachers like Aristotle.
[00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:34.400]   You know what Aristotle thought about women?
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:40.740]   This comes from his book, The Generation of Animals.
[00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:45.280]   The female, as it were, is a mutilated male
[00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:46.760]   without a soul.
[00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:51.360]   How about that, tweet that.
[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:54.080]   That's Aristotle.
[00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:57.520]   Not a Christian, by the way, hopefully that's clear.
[00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:59.320]   Plato, you maybe heard of Plato.
[00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:01.440]   Remember Plato, Plato's Republic,
[00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:02.760]   he wrote a letter called Timaeus,
[00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:04.040]   or he wrote a work called Timaeus,
[00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:07.360]   and in it he says, "It is only males
[00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:12.160]   "who were created by the gods and are given souls."
[00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:15.200]   It's only men who have souls.
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:18.080]   Those, this is crazy, man,
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:20.400]   those who live rightly, men who live rightly,
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:24.200]   in this life will return to the heavens,
[00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:25.880]   but those who are cowards
[00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:29.180]   will come back in the nature of women.
[00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:33.600]   You will be reincarnated.
[00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:36.820]   I mean, that's shocking to you, why?
[00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:39.560]   Because there's something inside of you that says,
[00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:41.480]   oh dude, that is messed up, man,
[00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:43.080]   we did not cover that in high school
[00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:45.520]   whenever we were doing the cheat sheets,
[00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:47.320]   or whatever, what is that called?
[00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:49.280]   Spark notes, there it is.
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:52.000]   Bunch of cheaters up here in the front.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.360]   Went through high school,
[00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:55.160]   reading the spark notes version of everything.
[00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:57.360]   All right, it didn't get any better in Jewish culture.
[00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:59.720]   So, hey, that man was Romans, they worshiped Zeus,
[00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:02.660]   Aphrodite, you know, probably the Jewish men and women,
[00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:04.360]   which should have had a better understanding
[00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:06.580]   'cause they had the Old Testament,
[00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:09.960]   but they were not living in light of that.
[00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:12.740]   In Jewish culture, women were forbidden to learn.
[00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:15.000]   Education was not something offered to women.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.080]   Women were not allowed in the synagogue to hear teaching.
[00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:22.800]   Josephus, the most famous historian of Jewish descent,
[00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:25.080]   he's where we get so much of our Jewish understanding
[00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:29.000]   outside of the Bible, he said this, this is powerful.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   "The woman is in all things inferior to the man."
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.840]   Got really quiet in here, didn't it?
[00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:41.440]   And you hear that and it's like, what?
[00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:43.220]   And one, the Talmud, which is kind of a commentary
[00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:46.160]   on Old Testament, just rabbinical teaching, said,
[00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:48.300]   "I would rather have the Torah burned
[00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:49.960]   "than have it taught to a woman."
[00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:53.920]   Yeah, there's a first century prayer that was recorded
[00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:57.060]   that said, "Blessed are you, eternal God,
[00:15:57.060 --> 00:16:00.300]   "who's not made me a Gentile, a woman, or a slave."
[00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:02.660]   Can you imagine you show up to church
[00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:04.420]   and that's how Josiah started the announcement,
[00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:05.260]   hey God, we just wanna pray.
[00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:07.100]   At first, I just wanna thank you, God.
[00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:12.940]   I mean, it's so jarring, it's insulting.
[00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:15.040]   And the reason it's insulting is because Jesus
[00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:16.600]   did something that would change everything.
[00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:18.660]   It didn't just change the general perspective on women,
[00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:20.480]   it changed the way that people thought,
[00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:21.640]   even about daughters.
[00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:23.480]   Did you know that in the Roman Empire, which again,
[00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:24.760]   remember, that's where this whole thing started,
[00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:29.760]   Christianity launched from, for every 100 women,
[00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:35.400]   there was 140 men, why?
[00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:40.400]   Because when couples, Roman couples would have children,
[00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:45.420]   if it was a male, by law, it was required
[00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:47.940]   that they raise the child, it's called the law of Romulus,
[00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:51.320]   or the law of Rome, is the first law, if it's a male.
[00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:54.340]   But if it was a female, only the first,
[00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:56.540]   if she was a first born female, was she required to be kept.
[00:16:56.540 --> 00:16:59.220]   And a practice called exposure, which is horrific
[00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:02.780]   when you hear it, would take place where people
[00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:06.060]   would have a baby girl, and then they would expose it,
[00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:10.860]   or leave it out in the road, roadside, to die.
[00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:12.780]   There's a first century letter of a Roman soldier
[00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:14.460]   that wrote to his wife, and she was pregnant,
[00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:17.900]   and he said, if while I'm away at war, you deliver the child,
[00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:21.620]   if it is a boy, keep it, if it is a girl, discard it.
[00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:27.100]   There was inscriptions found in a city,
[00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:28.740]   basically a city of Delphi, and they basically
[00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:31.400]   had a census taken of all the families, first century.
[00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:36.840]   Out of 600 families, they got the list
[00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:38.640]   of everybody's family, 600 of them.
[00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:43.000]   Six had more than one daughter.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.520]   Think about that.
[00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:52.360]   The context, and the abuse, and the distortion
[00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:58.540]   towards God's design of men and women was horrific.
[00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:03.120]   And this was the world in which Jesus showed up,
[00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:05.940]   and nothing would be the same as a result.
[00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:10.440]   As it related to marriage, the average age of marriage
[00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:15.440]   for Romans and for Jewish daughters was between 12 and 13.
[00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:19.360]   In fact, Josephus writes that a Jewish daughter
[00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:22.880]   should get engaged at 12, so that by the time she hits 13,
[00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:25.240]   she will have all of her reproductive years
[00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:26.480]   to attempt to give birth to children.
[00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:27.720]   Now, you hear that, and you're like,
[00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:30.320]   "Ha, no, he didn't, uh-uh!"
[00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:35.040]   'Cause for us, it's like, man, that is illegal
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:40.040]   and messed up, and the daughter had no choice in the matter.
[00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:43.480]   And I'm gonna show you in a second how Christianity,
[00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:47.460]   even in the first century, that went away for Christians.
[00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:52.200]   But the rights to divorce, sexual, sleeping around,
[00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:54.520]   basically, was commonplace for husbands.
[00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:57.000]   But if a wife did it, she could be put to death.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.080]   This was not a culture that even suggested
[00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:01.320]   there was equality.
[00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:04.640]   It was, in law, you're a fool if you think that there is.
[00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:06.880]   The greatest teachers of the day made clear.
[00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:13.480]   And Christianity would show up and change all of that.
[00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:17.840]   There were two occasions, the Roman Senate,
[00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:19.520]   again, the Roman Empire had a Senate,
[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:22.600]   kinda like we do today, on two occasions,
[00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:25.520]   two different bills were put before the Senate
[00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:28.160]   to mandate marriage for men.
[00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:30.040]   Think about that.
[00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:32.040]   That comes before all the craziness in our government.
[00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:33.280]   If they were at a place where they had to go,
[00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:36.500]   "Okay, we've gotta do something to get men to marry,"
[00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:38.200]   which honestly wouldn't be that bad of a deal, guys,
[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:41.560]   pull the trigger, but all that today, in that day and age,
[00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:44.280]   he's saying men wouldn't marry because they could
[00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:46.720]   sleep around with whoever they wanted, prostitutes.
[00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:48.320]   Why would I want the responsibility and burden
[00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:49.680]   that comes along with that?
[00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:54.080]   And so that's the world before Jesus.
[00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:57.080]   Much of the world today exists, as we'll see in a second,
[00:19:57.080 --> 00:20:01.840]   but I wanna look at how Jesus would show up and say,
[00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:05.200]   "You have broken and you are distorting one of the,
[00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:07.760]   "half of the image bears on the planet,
[00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:11.280]   "and it is an offense to God."
[00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:16.000]   And so the world of women because of Jesus.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.640]   As I said, Jesus would show up,
[00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:21.200]   and from the jump, everything would change.
[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:22.840]   One of the first conversations,
[00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:25.960]   the longest conversation Jesus has
[00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:27.160]   with anyone in the New Testament,
[00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:28.880]   you know who it's with?
[00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:30.200]   A woman.
[00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:32.480]   It was uncommon for men to speak to women in that day.
[00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:36.120]   To make eye contact could have been seen as inappropriate,
[00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:37.480]   certainly to someone who wasn't your wife,
[00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:38.960]   not to speak to them, and Jesus shows up,
[00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:40.200]   we're told in John chapter four,
[00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:41.480]   and he's walking through the road,
[00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:43.040]   and there's this woman who comes up to a well
[00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:45.360]   to get a drink of water, and Jesus begins to go
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:47.040]   into this long conversation with,
[00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:49.320]   it's the longest conversation he has with anybody,
[00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:51.980]   and it's the very first time he tells anyone,
[00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:54.600]   I'm the Messiah.
[00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:57.720]   And it was a woman who'd been divorced five times.
[00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:59.160]   She was an outcast among outcasts.
[00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:00.480]   She wasn't even Jewish.
[00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:04.680]   And he said, "You're exactly the type of person I came
[00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:09.380]   "to restore your dignity and your worth
[00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:13.120]   "to you and to the world around you."
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:15.480]   And in John chapter four, the disciples see him,
[00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:17.200]   they walk up on Jesus having this conversation,
[00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:19.800]   and they're astonished because he's talking to a woman.
[00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:21.480]   It says this, John chapter four, verse 27,
[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:23.260]   "His disciples just then came back.
[00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:27.200]   "They marveled that he was talking with a woman,
[00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:30.140]   "but no one said, 'What do you seek?'
[00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:31.800]   "or 'Why are you talking to her?'"
[00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:34.480]   And they marveled.
[00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:35.440]   Do you ever read those verses?
[00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:36.820]   You're like, "Why would they marvel he's talking to,
[00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:38.180]   "because it didn't happen."
[00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:41.440]   They were seen as less than,
[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:46.060]   other than to Jesus, who said,
[00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:47.940]   "They're loved, they're not less."
[00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:50.500]   And he would do so over and over and over again.
[00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:53.920]   Jesus, unlike the time that discouraged women
[00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:57.240]   or barred women from learning, had women disciples.
[00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:59.040]   The word for disciple is a learner
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:00.200]   that would follow him around,
[00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:01.300]   that were a part of his group,
[00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:03.920]   that he taught actively, proactively.
[00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:06.160]   In fact, if you remember the Mary and Martha
[00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:07.400]   conversation and interaction,
[00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:09.400]   which maybe if you've been in church, you've heard,
[00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:11.280]   that they go over to Martha's house,
[00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:13.000]   and Martha's in the kitchen, she's cleaning
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.120]   and making pita bread or whatever they had
[00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:16.320]   for meals back then.
[00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:19.780]   And her sister Mary was sitting at the feet of Jesus,
[00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:21.740]   and Martha's like, "What are you doing, Mary?
[00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:23.000]   "Get in here and help me cook.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.540]   "That's not for us, that's for them."
[00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:29.420]   And Jesus says, "She's not going anywhere.
[00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:32.560]   "She's chosen what is better."
[00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:33.760]   But he actively encouraged it.
[00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:37.380]   In fact, in that day, sexual sin,
[00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:40.880]   distortedly, was always attributed to the male.
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:43.480]   The law didn't teach that, but it would be taught
[00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:45.240]   that sexual sin would have been
[00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:48.200]   because the woman drew the man off sides.
[00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:52.060]   And so a woman was caught in adultery in John chapter eight,
[00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:55.220]   and the law said both the man and the woman
[00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:56.740]   should have been thrown before Jesus.
[00:22:56.740 --> 00:23:01.740]   But the religious leaders caught the woman
[00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:03.640]   threw her before Jesus.
[00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:08.560]   And he bends down, tenderly writes something,
[00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:11.920]   and as they say, "The law says she should die.
[00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:12.940]   "What do you say?"
[00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:18.780]   He stands up and he says, "Let whoever has not sinned
[00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:20.100]   "go to the first stone."
[00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:25.800]   Ironically, the only one who had not sinned was him.
[00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:30.060]   And they walk away, one by one,
[00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:33.500]   and Jesus, just there with the woman, says,
[00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:35.540]   "Where are your accusers?"
[00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:37.420]   She says, "They've gone."
[00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:42.280]   And he says, "Go and sin no more."
[00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:47.060]   I don't condone what you've done, and I don't condemn you.
[00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:49.380]   I came to die for you,
[00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:52.340]   because you are an image bearer of God.
[00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:55.860]   And you may live in a society that doesn't promote that,
[00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:58.780]   push that, but that's the truth.
[00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:04.760]   We see this consistently taught after Jesus died
[00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:07.740]   and rose and ascended to heaven by his followers.
[00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:09.860]   Peter would say this in 1 Peter chapter three,
[00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:11.100]   and we're so used to this
[00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:12.620]   that it's no longer profound to us,
[00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:15.220]   but it was jarring to the first century,
[00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:17.580]   who lived in that context that I'm describing.
[00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:20.540]   1 Peter chapter three, verse seven says,
[00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:23.460]   "Husbands, in the same way,
[00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:27.340]   "be considerate as you live with your wives.
[00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:32.100]   "Treat them with respect or honor
[00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:34.520]   "as the weaker partner,
[00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:38.260]   "and as heirs with you of the gracious gift of life,
[00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:40.220]   "so that nothing will hinder your prayers."
[00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:41.780]   So he's talking to husbands, and he says something,
[00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:42.620]   and this is where people go,
[00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:46.300]   "Well, ah, okay, weaker partner, that's it, Bible sexist."
[00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:50.940]   Peter's saying something pretty profound.
[00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:52.900]   He's saying, "Hey, when it comes, husbands,
[00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:53.980]   "here's how I want you to treat, you know,
[00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:56.060]   "the Jewish society, everyone around says their property,
[00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:57.560]   "you don't have to listen to them.
[00:24:57.560 --> 00:24:59.980]   "If they step out of line, you can do basically anything."
[00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:03.220]   Nope, I want you to live and be considerate
[00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:04.900]   of their feelings, of who they are.
[00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:06.220]   I want you to live, not just,
[00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:07.860]   don't even treat them with equal.
[00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:10.100]   It says, "Treat them with honor."
[00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:12.820]   How do you honor someone?
[00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:16.060]   Everyone, I mean, you've probably never thought about it,
[00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:18.340]   but instinctively, most of us probably know,
[00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:19.980]   if the Queen of England came in this room,
[00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:21.580]   you would know, and you'd give her your seat,
[00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:22.420]   and you would know how to honor her.
[00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:23.700]   You would defer to them.
[00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:26.540]   And that's what Peter just said.
[00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:27.860]   It's a whole new day.
[00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:30.980]   You treat them with honor and with respect.
[00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:34.260]   So what about the weaker vessel or partner?
[00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:37.060]   The same word, it's translated for delicate.
[00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:39.660]   And then today, bizarrely, there's something of like,
[00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:41.540]   "Oh, no, I'm not weaker, I'm not weaker.
[00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:42.980]   "Look at me, I'm so strong."
[00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:48.900]   And Peter is saying, "Hey, treat them with a delicacy,
[00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:52.740]   "or be more gentle and respectful with them."
[00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:54.380]   It has nothing to do with value.
[00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:55.420]   People immediately run to value.
[00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:56.580]   You saying I'm weaker, you saying I'm less?
[00:25:56.580 --> 00:26:00.380]   No, this is a bottle of water.
[00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:02.260]   This is an iPhone.
[00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:05.820]   If I drop this, nothing happens.
[00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:08.060]   If I drop this, like I did last week,
[00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:09.360]   the screen could break.
[00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:11.700]   Which one is more valuable?
[00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:15.320]   The water?
[00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:16.620]   Really?
[00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:17.940]   You're buying your water, bro.
[00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:18.860]   It's a phone.
[00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:22.740]   Something being more delicate
[00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:25.380]   doesn't make it any less valuable.
[00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:26.220]   In fact, there's plenty of things
[00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:27.820]   that are much more valuable.
[00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:29.700]   And Peter is saying, "Hey, you are accountable."
[00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:32.440]   When he says, "Your heirs, they are co-heirs with you
[00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:33.820]   "of the gracious gift of life."
[00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:35.180]   He says, "They are heirs.
[00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:36.260]   "They have a Father in heaven
[00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:37.400]   "who you're gonna give an account to.
[00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:40.040]   "You are dating or married to the boss's daughter.
[00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:43.080]   "You should tread lightly."
[00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:46.300]   That's what he just said.
[00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:48.460]   And clap for that, there you go.
[00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:50.180]   And then he said something that even is more profound.
[00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:51.340]   Hey, and if you don't do this,
[00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:52.740]   when you break down the verse,
[00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:54.740]   everyone goes, "Weaker partner, you saying I'm weaker?
[00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:55.940]   "Huh, binge press right now?
[00:26:55.940 --> 00:26:57.260]   "Let's go, let's go."
[00:26:57.260 --> 00:27:01.100]   It's like, he's saying,
[00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:07.260]   "You use your strength to serve, protect, die to yourself."
[00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:09.820]   And if you don't, it will hinder your prayers.
[00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:13.880]   I mean, so that nothing will hinder your prayers.
[00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:18.440]   As in, if you don't treat the boss's daughter well,
[00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:20.680]   he's not going to listen as closely.
[00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:23.080]   This was radical.
[00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:26.880]   And it would continue to be radical,
[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:28.200]   as we're gonna see it change
[00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:29.680]   to have people flock to the church.
[00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:33.320]   In Galatians chapter three, verse 26 to 28,
[00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:38.320]   the very first writing that we see as blatantly clear,
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:41.140]   men and women are totally equal,
[00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:45.120]   is Galatians three, verse 26.
[00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:47.720]   "In Christ, all of you are children of God through faith.
[00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:50.340]   "All of you were baptized into Christ,
[00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:51.660]   "have clothed yourself with Christ.
[00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:56.300]   "There's neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free,
[00:27:56.300 --> 00:28:00.300]   "nor is there male or female.
[00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:02.800]   "For all of you are one in Christ Jesus."
[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:07.800]   He is saying, everyone is now defined most by Christ.
[00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:13.820]   And that is the most significant thing about a person.
[00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:16.000]   Thomas Cahill was a historian that wrote,
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.440]   "This was the very first time
[00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:19.340]   "in all of ancient literature we can find someone,
[00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:22.000]   "hey, there is no difference,
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.740]   "male and female are totally equal."
[00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:27.140]   And we hear this and we go, dude, that's so crazy.
[00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:29.320]   At the time that people would think
[00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:30.660]   that even needs to be said.
[00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:32.520]   This was new.
[00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:35.600]   And when the New Testament was new,
[00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:36.880]   this was revolutionary.
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:39.680]   And it's the reason you think the way that you do.
[00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:40.920]   And let me just tell you what happened.
[00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:42.120]   As we would see in church history,
[00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:43.380]   and if you study any of this,
[00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:44.600]   there's a great book by Rodney Stark
[00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:45.660]   called "The Rise of Christianity."
[00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:46.980]   He's got so many different great works,
[00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:50.040]   but he just tracks with incredible documentation,
[00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:51.380]   the explosive movement of the church.
[00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:53.440]   And one of the things that you see with the church
[00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:55.120]   is that when the New Testament was new,
[00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:59.160]   when this movement began, women flooded to the church.
[00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:02.920]   Two thirds of the first century church was women.
[00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:06.920]   In a time where two thirds of the people
[00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:11.520]   alive on earth were men, they flooded there.
[00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:13.200]   To say that the New Testament or the Bible
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:14.880]   or Christianity has shown an instance
[00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:17.560]   would have been laughable to them.
[00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:19.740]   Because women found for the very first time,
[00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:22.080]   I can show up and I am treated with dignity.
[00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:25.200]   Unlike, remember the categories I referenced earlier?
[00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:26.840]   Of hey, when it came to marriage,
[00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:28.640]   when it came to children, when it came to daughters,
[00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:30.760]   women flooded there because of the rights
[00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:31.800]   and the way that they were treated
[00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:33.240]   with dignity so distinctly.
[00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:35.160]   In fact, Roman historian, there's so many of them
[00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:36.000]   and I don't have time to list them all,
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.960]   but one of the different critics of Christianity
[00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:40.800]   of the day who would write,
[00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:42.700]   whenever they would wanna burn in a dig,
[00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:44.120]   they would say, look, Christians,
[00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:47.600]   they're just made up of a bunch of poor people and women.
[00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:50.520]   That was one of the biggest attacks that they would give.
[00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:53.560]   There's a guy named Menaeus Felix,
[00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:54.400]   we'll just go with Felix.
[00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:58.040]   He wrote an apologetic work called "Octavius"
[00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:00.040]   and his criticism was that Christianity
[00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:04.740]   is made of the lowest of society and gullible women.
[00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:09.100]   Over and over, there's critiques of like,
[00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:12.920]   it's just women and nobody's in there.
[00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:16.080]   Because women found a home and they found dignity
[00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:18.720]   and every socioeconomic sense flooded to the church
[00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:21.200]   because it was there that they found and were treated,
[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:23.400]   you are made in the image of God.
[00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:24.880]   They were given leadership opportunity.
[00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:26.800]   In Romans chapter 16, we don't have time to go there,
[00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:28.400]   Paul is writing and he says, hey,
[00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:31.600]   our sister Phoebe greets you.
[00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:35.320]   She's a deaconess in the church of Acacia.
[00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:36.160]   What's a deaconess?
[00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:38.100]   It is a leader inside of the church.
[00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:40.360]   The Roman historian Pliny the Elder,
[00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:41.800]   which is like a great rapper name,
[00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:43.800]   but he wrote something and he was not a Christian
[00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:44.640]   and he basically was like,
[00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:47.800]   I'm trying to figure out this Christian movement and cult.
[00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:49.900]   So I found two Christians.
[00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:52.840]   I found these two slave women
[00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:56.720]   who were deaconesses at their church.
[00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:58.020]   Here's what they told me.
[00:30:58.020 --> 00:31:05.360]   That a slave that had no worth in the eyes of Rome
[00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:11.520]   was given leadership, dignity and value and women flooded.
[00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:12.760]   Unlike marriage, like I said,
[00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:14.500]   the average age of 12 or 13.
[00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:17.440]   Inside of the Christian church, women,
[00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:19.760]   it wasn't just, hey, you're gonna marry 'cause I said.
[00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:23.080]   Women were given for the first time the choice
[00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:27.360]   to marry when they wanted to.
[00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:30.040]   And the average age moved up to 18,
[00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:33.300]   which is thankfully in striking zone of being legal.
[00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:38.300]   But when you compare that to 13, it was radical.
[00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:41.600]   And not only that, inside of marriage,
[00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:44.080]   men were told something that is like,
[00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:46.720]   duh to us, but was radical of the day.
[00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:50.600]   Hey, you don't sleep with anybody but her
[00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:53.720]   and you honor her and you died to yourself
[00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:58.720]   and you love each other and you pursue oneness together.
[00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:00.680]   And by the way, you don't divorce her.
[00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:01.920]   Women didn't have the right to divorce
[00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:04.240]   and men were told, hey, you cannot divorce her.
[00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:06.240]   You stay with her and you make it work
[00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:08.260]   and you fight for her.
[00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:09.680]   All of which is beautiful today
[00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:12.700]   and we're all like, yay, that's how it should be.
[00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:15.240]   No one had ever seen it be like that.
[00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:18.940]   And women flooded in because they were given something
[00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:20.940]   that they had never had before.
[00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:23.280]   Dignity, tragically.
[00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:28.000]   And the church flooded with these.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.280]   And in terms of children or daughters,
[00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:34.940]   as I said, there was a vast under population of women
[00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:36.360]   because daughters were given up
[00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:38.540]   and Christians began to change that
[00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:41.100]   because Christians would redefine adoption.
[00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:43.860]   I mean, this is so historical, so stay with me, everybody.
[00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:46.120]   Adoption, how you think of it, what do you think of?
[00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:48.520]   First thing that comes to mind?
[00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:50.620]   A baby, right?
[00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:52.900]   Brad and Angelina, 17 kids walking around.
[00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:54.340]   That's not how Rome thought of it.
[00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:56.780]   Adoption was a legal process that adults did.
[00:32:56.780 --> 00:32:59.780]   In other words, every emperor that you've ever heard of
[00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:01.740]   or will ever hear of, and your Spark Notes section
[00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:03.260]   doesn't even know what emperors I'm talking about,
[00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:04.520]   all were adopted.
[00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:06.960]   Why?
[00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:07.900]   Because at that day and age,
[00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:10.320]   if somebody had a valuable estate,
[00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:12.220]   they would go, well, look at my kids
[00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:14.140]   and this is not a good idea.
[00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:15.240]   I'm gonna adopt him.
[00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:17.480]   And they would hand select.
[00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:20.060]   Adoption was among adults until Christians showed up
[00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:22.340]   and all those babies laid out by the riverside
[00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:23.800]   or laid out by the road, they'd show up
[00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:24.940]   and they would adopt them.
[00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:26.780]   They would take them into their homes
[00:33:26.780 --> 00:33:32.780]   'cause they said every person is valuable, has dignity.
[00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:38.060]   Abortion became extinct among Christian communities.
[00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:41.780]   This is even a reference in early Christian literature.
[00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:43.700]   And there's so much debate around our topic.
[00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:46.220]   You know who was not pro-choice in the first century?
[00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:47.360]   Women.
[00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:50.720]   And don't lose me on all the political leanings of today.
[00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:53.380]   They were not given a choice.
[00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:54.660]   Men were.
[00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:57.720]   And Christians said, no, you don't commit abortion anymore.
[00:33:57.720 --> 00:33:59.280]   And as a woman, you go, well, you know,
[00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:00.320]   maybe she wanted one.
[00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:02.740]   They were never given a choice.
[00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:04.720]   Abortion happened because of abusive men
[00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:07.840]   who said she's pregnant and I don't want the baby.
[00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:09.760]   And this is a time where there's no antibiotics,
[00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:10.760]   there's no doctors.
[00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:12.700]   The ways that happened was gruesome
[00:34:12.700 --> 00:34:14.440]   and left the woman sterile.
[00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:16.700]   And Christians said, no.
[00:34:17.460 --> 00:34:22.460]   And they introduced a revolution
[00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:27.460]   that your thought process throughout this message
[00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:30.820]   is directly connected to.
[00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:32.500]   Whatever feelings, emotions, concerns,
[00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:33.380]   things that you're thinking of,
[00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:35.380]   of like, ooh, that's weird, I'm not comfortable with that,
[00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:40.380]   is because that revolution would go far and wide
[00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:45.500]   as the church would go far and wide.
[00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:49.260]   Finally, a world today without Jesus,
[00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:50.100]   and I gotta hurry.
[00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:54.940]   Still today, any time the presence of the people of God
[00:34:54.940 --> 00:34:56.460]   and the word of God and the son of God
[00:34:56.460 --> 00:34:58.140]   has not impacted people's life,
[00:34:58.140 --> 00:35:03.140]   today in our world, there is not an appropriate equality
[00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:08.260]   based on the image of God that exists in male and female.
[00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:09.980]   In other words, any time that Christianity
[00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:12.700]   and the message of Jesus has not begun to spread place,
[00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:13.540]   all over the world today,
[00:35:13.540 --> 00:35:16.540]   people still think like the Romans did.
[00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:17.380]   What do I mean?
[00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:18.540]   Here's some examples, man,
[00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:20.060]   I'm gonna touch the tip of the iceberg
[00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:21.300]   'cause it is tragic.
[00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:22.460]   Billions of people live
[00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:23.740]   and they don't think like you think.
[00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:24.580]   It's not natural.
[00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:27.060]   It's been informed by the people of God
[00:35:27.060 --> 00:35:28.580]   and the word of God.
[00:35:28.580 --> 00:35:32.620]   In China, there was a 40 million gap
[00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:35.740]   or 40 million number of quote unquote missing girls
[00:35:35.740 --> 00:35:38.780]   because of decades of the one child, one mother,
[00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:41.780]   one child, one mother, one child, one child.
[00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:45.660]   The one child policy that led to sex selective abortion.
[00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:48.940]   China said you can only have one kid.
[00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:52.060]   And through the process of infanticide
[00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:53.420]   and sex selective abortion,
[00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:56.900]   now 40 million less women live
[00:35:56.900 --> 00:35:59.620]   or 40 million less women than men.
[00:35:59.620 --> 00:36:03.820]   United Nations has estimated, this was from 2022,
[00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:08.820]   between 150 and 200 million more boys than girls are alive
[00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:12.940]   because of selective abortion in sub-Saharan Africa,
[00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:14.900]   Asia, and the Middle East.
[00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:19.580]   In Africa, female genital mutilation
[00:36:19.580 --> 00:36:26.460]   impacts the lives of 3 million girls every year.
[00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:33.300]   That is all of the population of Dallas every year.
[00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:38.800]   People who were made in the image of God have a soul.
[00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:41.180]   Who Jesus gave his life for on the cross.
[00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:43.180]   It is not normal the way that you think.
[00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:46.940]   Child marriage is a global issue.
[00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:48.860]   12 million under the age of 18
[00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:49.980]   get married every single year.
[00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:52.940]   In Afghanistan, significantly, especially since the fall
[00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:55.420]   and the rise of the Taliban earlier this year,
[00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:57.900]   has become the worst place for women to live today
[00:36:57.900 --> 00:37:00.760]   according to Human Rights Watch and the Georgetown Institute.
[00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:04.540]   Only 7% of women have a bank account or access to one.
[00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:06.220]   80% of women are not employed
[00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:08.840]   due to the Taliban's restrictions on where they can work,
[00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:11.940]   when they can work, and what they should wear.
[00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:13.520]   The Taliban has banned secondary
[00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:15.140]   or higher education at any level.
[00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:17.440]   They dictate what they wear, how they can travel,
[00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:20.580]   if they can work, what kind of cell phones they can have.
[00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:21.760]   And you may think, well, man,
[00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:23.160]   we've all seen crazy Taliban.
[00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:24.320]   Let's go Saudi Arabia.
[00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:26.360]   Saudi Arabia, today, women do not have the freedom
[00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:27.280]   to leave the country.
[00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:28.400]   They cannot get a passport.
[00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:29.680]   They cannot travel outside of their house
[00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:31.080]   without the permission of their guardian.
[00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:31.920]   Who's a guardian?
[00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:33.320]   Their dad or their husband.
[00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:36.840]   They cannot get married without a co-signing of their dad
[00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:38.320]   on the marriage contract.
[00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:42.600]   And they cannot leave that marriage under any circumstances.
[00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:45.160]   The husband can marry whenever, whoever he wants,
[00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:47.120]   and marry up to four women at one time.
[00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:49.960]   Saudi Arabia didn't allow women,
[00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:52.380]   you know, Saudi Arabia, our president just flew over there
[00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:53.940]   to get more oil deal.
[00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:59.040]   Until 2018, women could not drive cars in Saudi Arabia
[00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:04.500]   and could be prosecuted or even have significant costs
[00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:07.740]   to themselves if they showed an ankle in public.
[00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:11.220]   And this world that has not been touched by Jesus
[00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:14.980]   does not believe equality is something that is true
[00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:15.820]   or should be reflected.
[00:38:15.820 --> 00:38:20.260]   In Iran, FIFA World Cup, everybody familiar with that?
[00:38:20.260 --> 00:38:25.680]   May 29th, 2022, which is, oh yeah, that's this year,
[00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:27.900]   the World Cup was taking place.
[00:38:27.900 --> 00:38:31.020]   And in Iran, they had qualified to semifinals
[00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:32.820]   or they were qualified and they had a game
[00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:34.860]   that was gonna take place inside of Iran.
[00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:40.420]   At the game, women who attempted to enter into the arena
[00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:44.100]   or into the stadium, despite having purchased tickets,
[00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:45.660]   were sprayed with pepper spray
[00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:49.700]   because women are not allowed to see sporting events.
[00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:52.740]   And this is everywhere.
[00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:55.180]   We don't have time to go into all the different Qatar.
[00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:57.260]   In order for women to get married,
[00:38:57.260 --> 00:38:59.580]   she has to have the permission of some guardian in her life.
[00:38:59.580 --> 00:39:04.580]   And if she leaves the house without her husband's permission,
[00:39:04.580 --> 00:39:07.380]   if she refuses to have sex,
[00:39:07.380 --> 00:39:10.140]   if she refuses or leaves and does something
[00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:12.460]   without telling him, she has been deemed as disobedient
[00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:14.340]   and there are consequences.
[00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:17.360]   This doesn't even cover Indonesia, India, Pakistan.
[00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:21.980]   Anytime the people of God are not anchored
[00:39:21.980 --> 00:39:25.300]   to the word of God and that presence is not felt there,
[00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:27.220]   the way that you think is not normal
[00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:30.260]   and let me just, this is the last thing I'm gonna cover.
[00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:33.700]   This is existent in our culture today
[00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:38.280]   that reams and yells, you sexist bigots.
[00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:42.220]   And yet American Western culture
[00:39:42.220 --> 00:39:44.780]   increasingly is influenced in a way
[00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:46.240]   that is apart from Jesus.
[00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:48.140]   And when that happens, a couple of things happen.
[00:39:48.140 --> 00:39:51.180]   You either undervalue women or you misvalue
[00:39:51.180 --> 00:39:52.220]   and value the wrong things.
[00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:53.060]   What do I mean by that?
[00:39:53.060 --> 00:39:55.380]   Our culture swings to the other pendulum and says,
[00:39:55.380 --> 00:39:57.380]   hey, women, you're valuable because of what's
[00:39:57.380 --> 00:39:59.820]   between your legs or what your body looks like
[00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:04.660]   or your sexuality or a host of other different things.
[00:40:04.660 --> 00:40:06.620]   What do I say that every cultural,
[00:40:06.620 --> 00:40:10.300]   epitome of culture in every direction, movies, music,
[00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:12.920]   everything communicates this message on a daily basis
[00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:16.700]   and it objectifies women, which is sexist.
[00:40:16.700 --> 00:40:17.540]   What do I mean?
[00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:18.820]   Here's some of the more popular songs.
[00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:21.320]   This is from "Freaky Deaky" by Tyga and Doja Cat.
[00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:22.160]   Ready?
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:23.740]   My little shorty, always on time.
[00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:25.140]   I pick you up, come outside.
[00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:26.020]   Let's go for a ride.
[00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:28.720]   Body likes December on summertime.
[00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:33.300]   Itty bitty waist, but I'm just gonna let y'all
[00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:34.300]   read the rest of it.
[00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:37.720]   (congregation laughing)
[00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:44.980]   You don't think a culture that continues to listen
[00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:46.500]   and some of the top songs in music.
[00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:47.340]   Let's go to the next one.
[00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:48.780]   WAP, Cardi B.
[00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:52.120]   (congregation laughing)
[00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:55.300]   Excuse me, hold on, we're almost done.
[00:40:55.300 --> 00:40:57.140]   There's some horrors in this house.
[00:40:57.140 --> 00:40:59.740]   Repeat times 12.
[00:40:59.740 --> 00:41:03.580]   (congregation laughing)
[00:41:03.580 --> 00:41:05.540]   I'm not even gonna read the rest of it.
[00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:13.500]   But as Christians, let me just speak to you ladies
[00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:16.340]   really quick and all of us.
[00:41:16.340 --> 00:41:22.220]   A culture that encourages or promotes women,
[00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:25.900]   calling themselves or other people whores
[00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:31.780]   is an inferior, toxic, evil culture.
[00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:35.500]   And identifying yourself, yeah,
[00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:37.400]   you can golf clap for that or what.
[00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:40.200]   (congregation applauding)
[00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:42.300]   And as Christians, we have never thought
[00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:43.860]   all cultures are created equal.
[00:41:43.860 --> 00:41:46.340]   We think we have a superior culture in Christ
[00:41:46.340 --> 00:41:48.500]   that says women are made in the image of God.
[00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:49.620]   They have eternal value.
[00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:51.900]   They're worthy of being treated with dignity and respect
[00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:53.620]   and their value does not come from their body,
[00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:54.780]   what they wear, what they look like.
[00:41:54.780 --> 00:41:56.780]   It comes from the fact that they're made in the image of God
[00:41:56.780 --> 00:41:58.680]   and men, we have a responsibility to make sure
[00:41:58.680 --> 00:41:59.940]   we don't participate, communicate,
[00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:02.620]   encourage anything that further objectifies sexually.
[00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:04.060]   And women, you have a responsibility to make sure
[00:42:04.060 --> 00:42:06.700]   you don't continually endorse or promote things
[00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:11.700]   that say I am valuable because of my sex or my body.
[00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:13.500]   And we see the drift happening.
[00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:18.500]   And so it undervalues, misvalues or it redefines.
[00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:22.360]   I mean, this is how tragically in need of Jesus
[00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:23.560]   our culture is.
[00:42:23.560 --> 00:42:29.240]   The nominations for woman of the year among NCAA
[00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:31.900]   came out last week or have been out recently.
[00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:35.360]   One of the nominations was Leah Thomas.
[00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:42.520]   Leah, for the first three years of college, swam as a man
[00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:50.720]   and swam the final year as a female.
[00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:57.560]   I mean, nothing but love and care and concern
[00:42:57.560 --> 00:43:02.540]   for anyone who doesn't know Jesus.
[00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:04.860]   But when we have a society that says,
[00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:08.360]   where are my whores at?
[00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:13.960]   And the winner of a women's award
[00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:18.580]   swam with the men 18 months ago.
[00:43:18.580 --> 00:43:25.560]   You can see we are assaulting the image of God on humanity.
[00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:39.520]   As I think about my daughter, and if you're in the room,
[00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:46.640]   I hope you know, no matter what story you have,
[00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:50.000]   no matter what amount of pain, damage, goods,
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:55.800]   however you see yourself, you have such eternal value.
[00:43:55.800 --> 00:44:00.440]   It would be impossible to overstate how valuable you are
[00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:02.160]   no matter what you've done, where you're from,
[00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:06.280]   what you look like, 'cause you are an image bearer
[00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:07.960]   of God Almighty.
[00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:11.080]   And he gave his life on the cross for you.
[00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:13.040]   And he gave his life on the cross for every person
[00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:17.440]   who's ever lived, because they are made in his image.
[00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:21.760]   And he set on fire a revolution
[00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:23.720]   that all people should be treated with dignity
[00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:27.880]   and with respect, 'cause they are made in my image.
[00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:30.840]   My kids, you just saw 'em, I've shared before,
[00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:33.300]   have had to teach or I've had to help them understand
[00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:35.000]   what the value of a coin is.
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:38.440]   They've been doing chores around the house
[00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:39.880]   and they'll get paid in various amounts.
[00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:42.680]   I'm teaching them, oh, that's a quarter.
[00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:45.120]   Oh, that's a nickel.
[00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:46.800]   That's a dime, that's a penny.
[00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:48.140]   For us, you're like, duh.
[00:44:48.140 --> 00:44:50.880]   But when you can't read, you can't fully understand it,
[00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:52.480]   you're like, oh, how do you know if it's a quarter?
[00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:53.360]   Is it silver?
[00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:56.320]   No, there's ones that are silver that are not quarters.
[00:44:56.320 --> 00:44:57.700]   Okay, is it because it's big?
[00:44:57.700 --> 00:44:59.800]   Is it like, hey, the smaller it is, the less it's worth?
[00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:01.760]   No, the dime really threw that thing off.
[00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:04.960]   Is it, like, what is, how do I know what the value of it is?
[00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:07.240]   Whose image is on it?
[00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:12.880]   How do you know how valuable you are,
[00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:16.480]   whose image is on you?
[00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:21.040]   And no matter what happens for the rest of your life,
[00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:24.060]   you are of an eternal value.
[00:45:24.060 --> 00:45:27.000]   And anyone who treats you as less
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:33.920]   is operating against God's design, an amazing creation.
[00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:38.240]   And now as Christians, we're called to go promote
[00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:42.940]   a superior culture to a world that desperately needs it.
[00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:45.200]   Let me pray.
[00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:50.160]   Father, I pray for anyone who's carrying baggage
[00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:54.220]   from hurt related to you, hurt related to the church,
[00:45:54.220 --> 00:45:55.940]   hurt done in the name of you
[00:45:55.940 --> 00:45:58.600]   that wasn't an accurate representation of your plan,
[00:45:58.600 --> 00:46:00.200]   your love, your design,
[00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:03.480]   that you would heal and bind up those hurts,
[00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:06.080]   that they would have a conversation if they need to.
[00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:09.400]   I pray for anyone who has never trusted in Jesus
[00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:10.760]   as the payment of their sin,
[00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:12.600]   has never accepted the eternal gift
[00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:14.600]   that God, you gave us through your son
[00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:16.920]   because you loved us so much and saw our value
[00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:19.920]   as of eternal worth.
[00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:21.320]   Tonight would be that night.
[00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:23.080]   We love you.
[00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:25.400]   Thank you for Jesus, who's changed the world
[00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:26.840]   and is changing our lives.
[00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:28.280]   We worship him in song, amen.
