[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.460]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.520]   All right, Porch, how we doing?
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:32.020]   Let's go.
[00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.520]   Let me hear it from you.
[00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.120]   Hey, it's great to be here together.
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.040]   You know, I don't know what else you could have
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.540]   had planned for this evening, but I
[00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.400]   know that you making the choice to be with us here
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.240]   is quite the honor.
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.640]   So thanks so much for choosing to be here with us
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.880]   this evening.
[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.540]   Not only those of you here in the room, which you look great,
[00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.200]   you know, glad to have you, but also all of you
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.040]   tuning in from all over the nation.
[00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.000]   Like, it's so amazing that God's doing something
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.500]   significant here in Dallas, but he's
[00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.240]   doing something significant all over the nation.
[00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.800]   And so we're grateful that you would choose to trust us
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:03.520]   with your time.
[00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.360]   Special shout out to Porch's live Fresno, Fort Worth, Tulsa.
[00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.160]   We love that y'all are tuning in, as always.
[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.160]   Well, Porch, we have been in a series in the book of Colossians
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.800]   and tonight we come to the fateful end.
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.520]   I know, that's how I feel.
[00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.360]   But before we get there, I'll start off with a story.
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.240]   I've shared this before, but I remember
[00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.240]   when I was 16 years old, making my way out
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.900]   from schools into the day and going to the pickup line.
[00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.960]   My dad was there and as always, he
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.000]   was sitting in the circle drive ready to pick me up and take me
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.500]   home.
[00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.660]   And so I make my way out.
[00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.660]   I see him sitting where he's always sitting.
[00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:40.720]   I throw open the door.
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.740]   I toss my bag into the backseat.
[00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.740]   I begin to climb up into the car.
[00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:45.580]   I sit down.
[00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.000]   I buckle myself in.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.820]   And he looks at me.
[00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.140]   He's like, bro, what are you doing?
[00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.340]   Well, he didn't say bro, because that's not
[00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.300]   how dads talk to sons.
[00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.480]   But he said, what are you doing?
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.000]   Is it obvious?
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.620]   Please don't make me go back in there.
[00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.320]   Like it's the end of the school day.
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.320]   We're going home.
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.320]   I worked all day.
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:03.480]   It's time to get out of here.
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.200]   Fired up, brother.
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.280]   Like, let's get out.
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.000]   You're not going home with me.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.160]   What are you talking about?
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.880]   Of course we are.
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.160]   We do this every single day.
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.560]   Like I get in the car, throw my bag in the back,
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.040]   buckle myself in, we drive home.
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.520]   What do you mean we're not going home together?
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.480]   You're not driving home with me today.
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:25.340]   And then he proceeded to toss me my own set of car keys.
[00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.300]   Yes, you can imagine my enthusiasm.
[00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.020]   I had been working year after year,
[00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.900]   mowing grass, saving up that hard earned money
[00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.980]   to pay for my portion of the vehicle.
[00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.300]   And so he throws me the keys.
[00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.060]   And he says, it's your son.
[00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.220]   Well, where is it?
[00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.580]   That's the catch.
[00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.460]   You've got to find it.
[00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.060]   What does that mean?
[00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.460]   It's in the parking lot.
[00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.900]   So I have no idea what this truck looks like,
[00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.380]   where he has it parked.
[00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.860]   So what do you think my response is in this moment?
[00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.580]   Like, are you serious?
[00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.180]   Like, no.
[00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.220]   I was enthused.
[00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.540]   I was like, man, like, where's that?
[00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:04.180]   Let me get out of here.
[00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.720]   And so I hopped out of the truck and I
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.300]   ran full on sprint into the parking lot.
[00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.500]   And I'm up and down the aisles and I'm clicking that clicker
[00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.500]   as fast as possible because I want to find my truck.
[00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.140]   Like, this is huge for me.
[00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.220]   Like, this is the secret.
[00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.900]   The passage into a whole new way of living.
[00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.360]   Like, this is going to give me a freedom the likes of which
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.660]   I've never known before.
[00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.340]   And so I'm moving up and down the aisles.
[00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:25.500]   I'm looking everywhere I can.
[00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:26.660]   I'm searching high and low.
[00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:27.980]   And wouldn't you believe it?
[00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:34.660]   I finally find it at the very back of the parking lot,
[00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.660]   looking fresh and clean and ready for our departure.
[00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.860]   How crazy would it have been if I unlocked that truck,
[00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.780]   I hopped up into the cab, I started tuning the stereo,
[00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.420]   reading the manual cover to cover, I hopped out
[00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.740]   of the truck and I started inspecting all the contours
[00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:56.540]   and lines of its body.
[00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.340]   Like, what would it--
[00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.500]   how crazy would it have been if I spent all that time
[00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.500]   learning as much about that truck as possible
[00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.180]   and yet I never drove it off the lot?
[00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:12.300]   How crazy would that be?
[00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:13.700]   It wouldn't make any sense.
[00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:14.200]   Why?
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.180]   Because that truck, it's meant for more.
[00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:18.900]   Like, it's not meant to stay where it is.
[00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.340]   It's meant for action.
[00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.100]   It's supposed to get out onto the road.
[00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.940]   It's supposed to lead me into the sunset
[00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.460]   and into a broader future.
[00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:27.700]   So let me ask you this, Porch.
[00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.940]   How crazy is it for us to receive the keys
[00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.220]   to a whole new way of life in Christ
[00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.060]   yet never take action on that life either?
[00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:38.720]   How crazy would that be?
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.260]   You see, we've been journeying through the book of Colossians
[00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.020]   and we've learned a lot up to this point.
[00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.180]   It's been weeks up until this time.
[00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.220]   And what we've been studying as we've made our way
[00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.300]   is we've learned the message of the gospel and the majesty
[00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.300]   of Christ's supremacy and the mysteries of his sufficiency
[00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.140]   and the myriad of threats we face along the way
[00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:58.300]   and the markings of genuine belief.
[00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.220]   We've learned so much.
[00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.940]   And yet as we come to the final page tonight,
[00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.220]   chapter 4 of the book, which if you have the Bible,
[00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:06.520]   you can turn there with me now.
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.060]   As we turn to the very end of this letter
[00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.980]   from the apostle Paul, which he's been telling us
[00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.660]   is all about, man, if you want maturity in life,
[00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.020]   then you need clarity of Christ.
[00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.220]   As we move to the final page,
[00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.440]   he tells us clarity doesn't just lead to your maturity,
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.960]   it also leads to a whole new activity.
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:32.220]   It changes the way you move through the world.
[00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:37.700]   That as we behold Jesus, yes, as Paul's repeatedly unpacked,
[00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:40.340]   yes, as you behold him, you do become like him,
[00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.020]   but not only that, you begin to believe like him,
[00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:43.860]   which is what?
[00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.860]   That there's a mission, that there's not just a message
[00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.980]   and a mystery and a majesty and a myriad of threats.
[00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:51.100]   No, there's a mission that we're supposed to be a part of,
[00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:54.120]   that God, he is saving the world,
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.900]   that he's rescuing people, that he's overcoming evil,
[00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.460]   that he's given purposes for us to fulfill,
[00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:01.820]   that this is what Jesus believed.
[00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.900]   And he fulfilled the mission
[00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.060]   and then handed us our marching orders.
[00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:07.760]   And he said, now you go and do it too.
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.220]   Like we have a part to play.
[00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:13.540]   And so what Paul wants to talk to us about tonight
[00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.620]   is how do we play that part?
[00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:18.460]   What does it look like for us to take everything
[00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:23.460]   we've learned and now live it in the real world?
[00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.900]   That's what he's taking us to.
[00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:29.020]   How is it that we joined the mission of Jesus Christ
[00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:31.500]   to save the world?
[00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.660]   He's gonna give us some steps.
[00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:36.620]   The first of which we find in verse two
[00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:39.980]   of Colossians chapter four, which says this,
[00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:42.300]   continue steadfastly in prayer,
[00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:45.580]   being watchful in it with thanksgiving.
[00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:48.260]   You see the first step that Paul is gonna teach us tonight
[00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.140]   is that we should pray with devotion.
[00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:52.740]   We should pray with devotion,
[00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:54.780]   which may feel a little anticlimactic to you.
[00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:57.240]   So you're telling me that's it?
[00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:01.700]   Like we have appeared into the mysteries of the gospel.
[00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:05.860]   We have postulated on the majesties of God.
[00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:08.980]   We have pointed out all the spiritual frauds of our day.
[00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:10.060]   And that's the takeaway.
[00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:11.340]   Like that's what you're telling me.
[00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:12.700]   Just pray about it a little bit.
[00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:14.780]   That's what you want me to walk away tonight with.
[00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:17.180]   Thank you so much for wasting the last nine weeks
[00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:18.020]   of my life.
[00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:21.200]   Here's the thing that you need to understand.
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:25.780]   Paul has a very different understanding of prayer
[00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:28.180]   than we so often do.
[00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:31.100]   You see, he sees something in prayer
[00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:35.160]   that we too frequently forget, which is this.
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:39.060]   That prayer is powerful.
[00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:42.000]   That it's powerful.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.400]   Some of you are like,
[00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:47.020]   "Man, I could have forecasted you were gonna say that."
[00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:48.280]   But here's the thing.
[00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:50.960]   Like don't tune out yet because I want you to catch the fact
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:53.840]   that this is such a momentous part
[00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:57.520]   of not just this chapter, but this book.
[00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:59.880]   Because you see the disciples, the followers of Jesus,
[00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:01.840]   they come to him in Luke chapter 11,
[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:02.680]   and they look at him and they say,
[00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:05.840]   "Jesus, would you teach us how to pray?"
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:06.800]   That's what they ask him.
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.200]   And it's the only instance in the entire Bible,
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:10.960]   specifically within the gospel accounts,
[00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:12.100]   where his disciples come to him and say,
[00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:15.120]   "Hey, will you teach us this exactly?"
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:17.840]   What would you have asked Jesus to teach you?
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:19.440]   How to walk on water?
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.040]   How to perform some miracles?
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:22.960]   How to debate your opponents?
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:24.640]   How to make a public speech?
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:25.800]   Like what would you have asked?
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:27.320]   Like what would you have had him teach you?
[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:29.040]   They could have asked him anything.
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:30.680]   Like this is the son of God.
[00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:34.800]   Like this is deity in flesh.
[00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:35.640]   And they look at him and they say,
[00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:36.920]   "Would you teach us how to pray?"
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:37.760]   Why?
[00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:39.400]   Why do they ask that?
[00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:42.760]   Because they'd seen him pray.
[00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:46.560]   And they'd seen the difference it made.
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:49.440]   You see, as they saw Jesus,
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:53.080]   what they saw was a man that looked unlike
[00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:54.680]   any other man they'd ever known.
[00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:57.800]   The gospel writers, they're emphatic about this.
[00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:58.880]   Matthew 7 tells us,
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.080]   "And when Jesus finished these sayings,
[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:05.160]   the crowds were astonished at his teachings,
[00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.760]   for he was teaching them as one who had authority
[00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:08.760]   and not as their scribes.
[00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:09.720]   He stood out."
[00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:11.080]   John 6, it tells us,
[00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:12.480]   "Simon Peter answered him,
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:15.560]   'Lord, to whom shall we go?
[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:18.600]   You and you alone have the words of eternal life.'"
[00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:21.560]   And we've believed, we've come to know,
[00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:24.240]   you're the Holy One of God, not someone else.
[00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:26.040]   You are, you're the Holy One of God.
[00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:27.280]   You have the words of eternal life.
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:28.960]   Where else would we go?
[00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:31.800]   Mark 4 tells us,
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.240]   "And they were filled with great fear.
[00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.760]   And they said to one another,
[00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:40.120]   'Who then is this that even the wind and the sea obey him?'"
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:42.960]   Later in Mark, it says,
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:46.880]   "And when the centurion who stood facing him upon the cross
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:49.800]   saw the way that he breathed his last, he said,
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:53.640]   'Truly, this man was the son of God.'"
[00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:55.800]   Because mortal men do not die like that.
[00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:58.440]   They do not die with their life in their own hand.
[00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:00.880]   There's no one like him.
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:03.320]   Like Jesus spoke and moved and taught and served
[00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:04.480]   and loved in a way,
[00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:06.680]   the likes of which we have never before seen.
[00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:09.480]   And I would argue it is largely, not entirely,
[00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.240]   but largely due to the fact
[00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:15.800]   that he pulled from the power of his prayer life.
[00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:20.040]   That he pulled from the power of his prayer life.
[00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:21.160]   Like all throughout the gospels,
[00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:23.680]   if you just trace the miracle-making moments
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:24.840]   of his ministry,
[00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:27.680]   what you'll find is on the front side or on the backside,
[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.480]   either preceding or proceeding,
[00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:32.520]   those moments is a moment of prayer.
[00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:36.640]   You see, Jesus rhythmically retreated to be with God.
[00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:39.800]   So he rhythmically repeated the works of God.
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:43.800]   He would retreat to be with him.
[00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:48.200]   And because of it, he would repeat the works of God.
[00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:50.880]   And here's what's crazy.
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:52.000]   You listening, porch?
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:58.120]   Paul's telling us how we can tap into the same source,
[00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:00.840]   how we can access the same power.
[00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:04.880]   Jesus says it in John chapter 14.
[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:07.640]   He says, "Truly, truly, I say to you
[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:09.440]   that whoever believes in me
[00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:11.880]   will also do the works that I do."
[00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:16.080]   Like everything he did, hello, it's available for you.
[00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:19.520]   Like you can do it, but not just that, keep listening.
[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:23.640]   "And greater works than these will she do
[00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:25.520]   because I am going to the Father."
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:26.720]   Where's Jesus right now?
[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:29.200]   He's not here.
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:30.320]   He's with the Father,
[00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:32.960]   which means greater works are available to you and I.
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:35.920]   How do we access it?
[00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:40.680]   "Whatever you ask in my name,
[00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:43.840]   whatever you pray,
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:47.040]   this I will do that the Father may be glorified in the Son."
[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:48.680]   Which sounds pretty incredible, right?
[00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:50.240]   Like, do you want some of that in your world?
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:51.480]   Like, I would take some of that.
[00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:52.320]   That's why Paul tells us,
[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:55.120]   "Hey, then continue steadfastly in prayer.
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:56.680]   Be watchful in it with thanksgiving."
[00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:58.520]   He says that we should be steadfast.
[00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:01.480]   As we pray, we should be focused.
[00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:02.440]   We should be devoted.
[00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:03.680]   If you look at the original language,
[00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:06.200]   what it's saying there is that we should be singularly,
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:09.960]   undividedly committed to one pursuit.
[00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:13.760]   Another translation says that we should be devoted to prayer.
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:16.940]   So think about something that you were recently devoted to.
[00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:18.560]   Training for a marathon,
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:20.680]   saving up to buy a house,
[00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:22.800]   working to pay off debt,
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:25.000]   trying to get that guy or that girl's attention.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:25.840]   You know, like what,
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:27.720]   I don't know what it is that you were devoted to
[00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:29.000]   here recently,
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.900]   but what was true of your devotion?
[00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:35.120]   The degree of your devotion
[00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:38.240]   informed the degree of your decisions.
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:40.640]   Like if you wanted that,
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:43.040]   then you would do whatever it took to get there.
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:44.280]   I love Abraham Lincoln.
[00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:48.620]   He says that discipline is choosing what we want most
[00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:50.140]   over what we want now.
[00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:52.620]   That's devotion.
[00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:57.620]   It's I'm willing to do discipline to get what I want most.
[00:12:57.620 --> 00:13:00.140]   Even if it means I have to forgo some things
[00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:01.280]   that I want right now.
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:04.660]   That's how Paul is saying we should pray.
[00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:06.580]   He's saying we should pray with that kind of devotion,
[00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:07.420]   with that kind of intensity,
[00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:08.300]   with that kind of urgency.
[00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:11.100]   You know, like that's what he's articulating.
[00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:13.000]   But here's the reality, Porch.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.780]   Many of us, we can't give prayer that kind of devotion
[00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:18.380]   because we've given that kind of devotion
[00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:19.940]   to something else entirely.
[00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:26.460]   We can't give God in prayer,
[00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:27.400]   through humble pursuit,
[00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:28.980]   the kind of devotion he deserves
[00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:31.580]   because we've given that sort of devotion
[00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:33.260]   to something else altogether.
[00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:38.300]   Like some of you are so devoted to your job.
[00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:39.980]   Like we're coming into review season.
[00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:41.860]   And so you've got to finish well, you know,
[00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:42.940]   I'm about to sit down with my boss.
[00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:45.100]   He's about to review how I've done this last year.
[00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:46.680]   And I want to like race to the finish line.
[00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:47.520]   I want him to look at me and say,
[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:49.260]   "Man, I'm so glad we hired you.
[00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.780]   You're the best pickup we've ever gotten."
[00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:53.060]   And so you're devoted to that.
[00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:54.780]   Others of you, summer's here,
[00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:56.640]   sun's out, guns out, you know,
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:58.540]   you're working out, you're hitting the gym
[00:13:58.540 --> 00:13:59.820]   because it's full season, baby.
[00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:01.180]   Like you're doing everything in your power
[00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:03.460]   to show up and show out there.
[00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:05.580]   Some of you, you're just devoted
[00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:07.120]   to getting through the week.
[00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:11.780]   Like it's miserable Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday,
[00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:12.780]   but the weekend will be better.
[00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:13.780]   Or that trip will be better.
[00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:14.780]   Or that event will be better.
[00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:16.620]   Or that extracurricular I have coming up,
[00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:18.100]   that will be better.
[00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:20.140]   Some of you, you're so committed.
[00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:22.660]   You're so devoted to your community.
[00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:23.780]   That instead of going and talking to God,
[00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:25.340]   you're just talking to other people.
[00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:28.380]   Believers, yes, but other people about it.
[00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:29.980]   You're confessing sin, you're investing in relationship,
[00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:31.560]   making strategic deposits in the lives of people.
[00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:32.500]   You're serving others.
[00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:36.020]   You know, you're doing everything you can in community.
[00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:38.180]   And here's the reason, and it could be something else.
[00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:39.380]   You know, it doesn't have to be those things.
[00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:40.300]   It could be something else.
[00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:42.380]   What is it though that you are devoted to?
[00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:44.460]   Answer it.
[00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:47.220]   Like, what would you write down for that?
[00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:49.420]   All of us are devoted to something.
[00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:54.420]   And I'm not saying that these things are intrinsically bad.
[00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:57.540]   I'm not saying they're unworthy of your devotion.
[00:14:57.540 --> 00:15:00.140]   But what I am saying is some things are more deserving
[00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:02.420]   of your devotion than others.
[00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:07.220]   And prayer's at the top of that list.
[00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:11.940]   Like, prayer should be our first priority,
[00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:13.240]   not our last resort.
[00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:17.700]   Like, it's not the thing you do
[00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:19.780]   whenever you run out of options.
[00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:24.040]   It's the thing you do before you look to other options.
[00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:29.060]   Leonard Ravenhill, British evangelist, author,
[00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:31.600]   just one fiery individual, he said this.
[00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:36.660]   "No man is greater than his prayer life.
[00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:40.940]   "The pastor who is not praying is playing.
[00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:46.060]   "The people who are not praying are straying.
[00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:49.260]   "We have many organizers, but few agonizers.
[00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:52.720]   "Many players and payers, but few prayers.
[00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:55.700]   "Many singers, but few clingers.
[00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:58.240]   "Lots of pastors, but few wrestlers.
[00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:01.440]   "Many fears, few tears.
[00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:03.240]   "Much fashion, but little passion.
[00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:08.080]   "Many interferers, few intercessors.
[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:10.480]   "Many riders, but few fighters.
[00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:13.820]   "Failing here, we fail everywhere."
[00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:17.560]   Why is that?
[00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:18.880]   What's Leonard getting at?
[00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:24.680]   A prayerless person is a powerless person.
[00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:29.240]   A prayerless person is a powerless person.
[00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:32.500]   Some of you, with whatever that thing,
[00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:35.800]   the object of all your attention in life is right now,
[00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:38.080]   you have worked so hard.
[00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:39.840]   You have checked all the traps.
[00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:42.040]   You have strategized to the best of your ability.
[00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:44.080]   You have given a good college try.
[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:48.460]   You have absolutely poured on everything you have to give
[00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:50.780]   to change that situation.
[00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:56.240]   But man, you're just shooting blanks
[00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:59.080]   because you've not prayed about it.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.540]   There's no power in your attempt
[00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:06.260]   because there's no power apart from God.
[00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:15.300]   So what are we supposed to pray for?
[00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:16.580]   Two things, real quick.
[00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:17.580]   We won't spend a ton of time on this.
[00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:18.420]   The first thing that we pray for
[00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:19.260]   is we pray for opportunity.
[00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:21.460]   That's what Paul talks about in verse three.
[00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:23.720]   He says, "At the same time, pray also for us,
[00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:26.260]   "that God may open to us a door for the word
[00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:27.340]   "to declare the mystery of Christ,
[00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:29.360]   "on account of which I'm in prison."
[00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:31.740]   This is crazy.
[00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:32.620]   Just picture it.
[00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:35.680]   Paul is sitting in prison,
[00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:37.260]   bound under Roman authority,
[00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:39.880]   very likely persecuted in this moment,
[00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:42.220]   but his prayers are not that God
[00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:44.020]   would open the door to his cell.
[00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:47.140]   His prayers are that God would open the door
[00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:50.180]   for an opportunity to share the gospel.
[00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:53.300]   That's convicting.
[00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:55.740]   Like some of us, myself included,
[00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:57.900]   have been in moments where we have been begging,
[00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:00.180]   "God, please, just get me out of here.
[00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:02.060]   "Like I've been working so hard in this,
[00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:04.000]   "and yet it's not at all what I expected.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.320]   "Like God, I'm ready for the next thing.
[00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:08.060]   "I feel so stuck right now.
[00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:10.180]   "Please, won't you lead me out?
[00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:11.400]   "Won't you open a door?
[00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:12.600]   "Won't you make a way?"
[00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:15.680]   And yet God is standing on the other side,
[00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:17.400]   knowing well what's behind that door,
[00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:19.860]   and he's saying, "I love you too much to open it.
[00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:23.340]   "I will leave you where you are.
[00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:26.500]   "Do not focus at the opportunities out ahead.
[00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:29.700]   "Focus on the opportunities here at hand.
[00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:31.500]   "Think about the now.
[00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:33.980]   "Work here in the moment."
[00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:34.900]   I love it.
[00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:36.760]   This isn't even in my notes,
[00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:38.580]   but when you look at Adam and Eve,
[00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:40.840]   before Eve ever comes along,
[00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:42.340]   God's got Adam lined up, man,
[00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:43.840]   and that brother wants a wife.
[00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:46.200]   He's like some of you.
[00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:50.700]   And so he's waiting, and he's waiting, and he's waiting,
[00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:52.860]   and you know what he does, though?
[00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:53.800]   Rather than getting frustrated,
[00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:55.900]   "God, why won't you send her?"
[00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:57.180]   He goes to work.
[00:18:57.180 --> 00:19:00.400]   He names every animal in that garden.
[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:05.480]   That brother sees the opportunity.
[00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:08.040]   He did good work.
[00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:11.860]   And then God opened the door in his own time.
[00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:15.180]   Some of you need to trust that the Lord does love you.
[00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:19.700]   He is good, and he will open the door at the right time,
[00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:20.980]   but perhaps he hasn't opened it yet
[00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:23.360]   because right now he's already opened a door
[00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:25.320]   that he's waiting for you to walk through.
[00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:28.080]   (man whistling)
[00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:29.760]   So you pray for opportunity.
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:32.360]   Verse four tells us that we pray for clarity.
[00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:33.560]   Says that I may make it clear,
[00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:34.960]   which is how I ought to speak.
[00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:36.720]   I love this, coming from the apostle Paul,
[00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:37.920]   because next to Jesus,
[00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:39.760]   he's the best preacher we've ever seen,
[00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:41.440]   and yet he's praying for clarity.
[00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:44.240]   Some of you, you feel so unfit to share the gospel.
[00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:47.960]   You feel so unfit to talk about your spirituality
[00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:50.400]   because you're not a poetic savant,
[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:52.440]   because you're not a master orator,
[00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:55.760]   and yet Paul's saying, "Man, just preach it plain, brother.
[00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:58.000]   "Like, just tell 'em how it is.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.600]   "Be understandable."
[00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:02.200]   He prays for clarity.
[00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:03.960]   We should pray for clarity, too.
[00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:05.840]   This is the first step to saving the world
[00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:07.080]   that we should take, porch.
[00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:09.480]   We pray with devotion.
[00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:12.740]   But as we go to verse five, Paul gives us the next.
[00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:14.780]   It says, "Walk in wisdom toward outsiders,
[00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:17.780]   "making the best use of the time."
[00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:18.920]   The second step that Paul gives us
[00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:20.960]   is that we walk with wisdom.
[00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:23.200]   Paul says we walk, which incidentally,
[00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:25.800]   is a pretty underwhelming activity
[00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:27.760]   if you're describing the Christian life.
[00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:28.600]   Like, that's it?
[00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:29.420]   We walk?
[00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:30.880]   Like, couldn't we put something better in there?
[00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:34.360]   Like, we fight, you know, or we march, or we wrestle.
[00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:36.340]   Like, I don't know what your better descriptor would be,
[00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:38.400]   but Paul says, "No, we walk."
[00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:41.000]   Like, this is the way we move through the Christian life.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:41.840]   We walk.
[00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:43.720]   Why does he choose this?
[00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:45.960]   Because this was the primary mode of transportation
[00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:48.840]   for every single person in the ancient Near East.
[00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:51.400]   If you wanted to get from point A to point B,
[00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:54.160]   more likely than not, you were walking there.
[00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:58.480]   All of Jesus's ministry, he walked from town to town.
[00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:01.840]   This was something you did every single day.
[00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:03.200]   It was ordinary.
[00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:04.720]   And in the same way,
[00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:10.680]   our spiritual life consists of walking every single day.
[00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:12.280]   I love it.
[00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:14.160]   Like, Paul is telling us,
[00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:18.720]   "Your Christianity should look ordinary.
[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:19.960]   "It shouldn't be extraordinary.
[00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:21.000]   "It shouldn't be reserved.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.160]   "And when you're here on Tuesday nights,
[00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:23.200]   "you show up on Sunday mornings,
[00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:25.280]   "you're around that group of Christian friends."
[00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:27.160]   Like, Christian's not a switch you flip
[00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:30.200]   whenever you're in the proper context.
[00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:32.840]   Now, that would be an extraordinary expression.
[00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:35.240]   No, it's an ordinary expression.
[00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:38.160]   It is an everyday, day by day,
[00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:40.760]   rise and grind type of life.
[00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:43.640]   It's ordinary.
[00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:45.440]   And it's good that this is the case
[00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:48.440]   because it requires our consistency.
[00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:53.200]   I love the way one commentator put it.
[00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:56.000]   "The Christian walk merely consists
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   "of two steps repeated over and over and over again.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.640]   "Put off the old and put on the new."
[00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:07.040]   Which is a reference to Colossians chapter three.
[00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:11.240]   You see, Paul's point here
[00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:13.640]   is that we should live in such a way
[00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:17.200]   that our actions back up our convictions.
[00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:18.240]   Because the world,
[00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:22.160]   the world is far less interested in your talk
[00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:24.460]   and they are far more interested in your walk.
[00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:30.680]   They wanna believe how you behave.
[00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:33.480]   They don't want to adopt
[00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:35.480]   something you yourself have not adopted.
[00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:39.600]   So Christian, it's imperative
[00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:43.440]   that your convictions are supported by actions.
[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:47.720]   That you don't grumble against other people or complain.
[00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:51.120]   But instead you reserve your words.
[00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:53.320]   You bite your tongue
[00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:56.320]   because you know that you should speak only if it builds up.
[00:22:56.320 --> 00:23:02.160]   It means that you don't run into frantic, stress out.
[00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:03.080]   Everything is breaking.
[00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:04.760]   Like it's all going into chaos.
[00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:08.120]   Like you don't worry when things fall on red alert
[00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:11.840]   because you know that you need not be anxious.
[00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:14.760]   But in everything about prayer and petition,
[00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:16.400]   you present your requests to God.
[00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:19.680]   We're supposed to walk in wisdom.
[00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:21.480]   We're supposed to live in a way
[00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:24.840]   that looks wildly odd to the watching world.
[00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:28.280]   Like I preach up here every week.
[00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:34.540]   And I do so with a kind of animation and intensity
[00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:37.040]   because I don't wanna look casual
[00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:38.840]   about the things we talk about.
[00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:41.560]   No, I want to back up all of my convictions
[00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:43.600]   with urgency and action.
[00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:46.320]   I want you to see I believe this stuff
[00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:50.040]   and we should live in a way that believes it too.
[00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:52.320]   Believers are known by their behavior.
[00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:54.120]   So what do your behaviors look like?
[00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:59.000]   So what's the walk supposed to look like?
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.280]   Well, I don't know if you've done much walking in your life.
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:03.440]   Not just to and fro from here and there,
[00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:06.440]   but concerted, deliberate exercise.
[00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:09.520]   Something that Brooke and I have recently picked up.
[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:11.800]   And so every time I know that we're gonna go on a walk,
[00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:13.740]   I'm always preceded with two questions.
[00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:15.240]   I've got to know a couple of different things
[00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:18.520]   before I set out and hit the open trail.
[00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:22.320]   Number one, I always wanna know where are we walking?
[00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:26.040]   Like, is this just a casual stroll around the neighborhood
[00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:28.480]   or is this over the river and through the woods
[00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:29.320]   kind of stuff?
[00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:30.720]   Like, are we going on an adventure
[00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:32.120]   or are we gonna be back in 30?
[00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:35.040]   I just wanna know where are we going?
[00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:38.680]   And then I wanna know how are we planning to walk?
[00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:42.360]   Is it leisurely or are we moving hastily
[00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:44.840]   with a brisk pace and a lot of purpose?
[00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:48.000]   I need to know because it's going to determine
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.240]   my expectation.
[00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:50.680]   Paul thankfully looks at us
[00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:51.880]   and he answers those same questions.
[00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:55.660]   He tells us where we walk and how we walk.
[00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:58.080]   He's already told us how we walk.
[00:24:58.080 --> 00:24:58.960]   We walk in wisdom.
[00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:00.060]   That was the point.
[00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:01.260]   You walk with wisdom.
[00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:02.100]   What's wisdom?
[00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:02.920]   What does that even mean?
[00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:03.860]   Well, according to the Bible,
[00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:05.640]   wisdom is judging correctly
[00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:06.680]   and following the best course of action
[00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:07.940]   in a given situation.
[00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:11.580]   It's like that friend you call,
[00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:13.980]   whenever the bottom falls out,
[00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:14.820]   you don't know what to do,
[00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:16.500]   but they always have the right answer.
[00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:18.020]   They always know what to do.
[00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:19.860]   That friend has what?
[00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:20.900]   They have wisdom.
[00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:23.860]   They have street smarts.
[00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:26.680]   They know how to succeed in any situation.
[00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:29.100]   We're supposed to walk with a kind of wisdom
[00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:31.220]   that's characterized similarly.
[00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:34.360]   We walk this way.
[00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:37.860]   And what it does is it leads us to look pretty odd,
[00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:40.500]   but that's okay
[00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:43.420]   because uncommon people make uncommon moves.
[00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:47.300]   Uncommon people make uncommon moves.
[00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:49.640]   If people are not walking up to you and saying,
[00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:50.620]   man, you're just different.
[00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:51.460]   Like you just,
[00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:53.500]   you don't strike me as the average,
[00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:55.700]   ordinary run of the mill individual.
[00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:57.720]   Like, why are you the way you are?
[00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:59.580]   Why do you do the things you do?
[00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:03.340]   You're probably not that uncommon
[00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:06.220]   and thus you're probably not walking in wisdom.
[00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:07.440]   The way of the Christian walk
[00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:09.800]   is not the way of the world's walk.
[00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:12.060]   It looks abnormal.
[00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:14.460]   So how abnormal do you look?
[00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:18.220]   Paul says in 2 Corinthians 6,
[00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:19.340]   verses two through four,
[00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:21.580]   behold, now is the favorable time.
[00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:23.140]   Behold, now is the day of salvation.
[00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:26.420]   We put no obstacle in anyone's way
[00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:28.680]   so that no fault may be found in our ministry.
[00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:29.920]   But as servants of God,
[00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:31.820]   we commend ourselves in every way.
[00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:35.300]   We're willing to walk in a way
[00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:39.600]   that commends ourselves and our gospel to other people
[00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:41.740]   by great endurance and afflictions
[00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:43.540]   and hardships and calamities and beatings
[00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:44.980]   and imprisonments and riots and labors
[00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:46.000]   and sleepless nights and hunger.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.020]   And it goes on.
[00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:49.240]   That's pretty odd that people would do that
[00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:50.380]   to lead others to Christ.
[00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:51.740]   Yes?
[00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:53.480]   Like that's not the way of the world.
[00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:54.460]   You should look different.
[00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:56.420]   You should be uncommon.
[00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:59.340]   And yet this sort of uncommonality,
[00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:02.180]   what it does is it allows us to walk in a way
[00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:08.340]   that presents a persuasive case
[00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:10.540]   that Jesus is who he says he is
[00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:13.500]   and he is worthy of following
[00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:15.660]   because we ourselves are following him too.
[00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:18.220]   That's how we walk.
[00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:19.900]   Where do we walk?
[00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:21.660]   We walk towards outsiders.
[00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:25.780]   I love that Paul doesn't just say we walk with God.
[00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:28.500]   No, we walk toward outsiders,
[00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:31.060]   not towards your holy huddle,
[00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:32.480]   not towards your Christian clique,
[00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:33.700]   not towards your friend group
[00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:36.060]   that you see each and every day of the week.
[00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:38.260]   No, you walk towards outsiders.
[00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:39.820]   That's where you walk.
[00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:42.700]   Not away from them, but to them,
[00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:45.020]   which is an intimidating prospect.
[00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:45.840]   I get it, man.
[00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:47.340]   Like I'm an introvert, you know?
[00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:50.060]   Like I'm quite all right just doing me.
[00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:51.940]   Like I don't necessarily need to be around people.
[00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:53.500]   I don't like to be the center of attention.
[00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:55.940]   I enjoy going to movies by myself.
[00:27:57.460 --> 00:27:58.440]   And yet,
[00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:03.640]   and yet as one pastor said,
[00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:06.140]   your personality type does not get to determine
[00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:07.100]   your purpose.
[00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:12.940]   Like there's a variety of hardwirings in this room,
[00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:17.300]   but if you're a believer, a follower of Christ,
[00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:22.300]   you and I and all alike have the same purpose,
[00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:25.540]   which is to know God and to make him known.
[00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:28.860]   We walk toward the outsider.
[00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:30.900]   And we do so by seizing every moment,
[00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:32.780]   by making the best use of time.
[00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:35.500]   I remember in college, one of my best friends today,
[00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:36.340]   I didn't know him at the time.
[00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:38.340]   I knew of him, he and I were not close,
[00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:40.860]   but I would see him at the gym every single day.
[00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:42.580]   Like I would go and he'd be there.
[00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:44.500]   And the reason he stood out to me was not just because
[00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:46.500]   we were at the gym every single day around the same time.
[00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:47.680]   Like that's pretty average.
[00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:49.260]   What was uncommon about this brother
[00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:52.020]   is he was there with four to five other guys
[00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:53.620]   and they were all working out together
[00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:54.900]   and they weren't just working out together.
[00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:56.740]   They were reading Bible verses
[00:28:56.740 --> 00:28:58.380]   and they were taking that as fuel and motivation
[00:28:58.380 --> 00:28:59.780]   to like deadlift PRs.
[00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:02.020]   It was the weirdest thing in the world,
[00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:03.460]   but I couldn't help but notice.
[00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:04.980]   And so later on in our friendship,
[00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:05.940]   I finally looked at him and I was like,
[00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:09.380]   "Brother, like what was going on back there?
[00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:11.860]   Like one guy would hit you with Romans 5.8
[00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:15.900]   and you would walk up and you would max rep right there.
[00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:17.020]   Like, how did that work?
[00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:19.140]   What were you doing?"
[00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:20.100]   And I love it.
[00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:20.940]   He looked at me and he was like,
[00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:25.380]   "You know, it's a couple hours every day
[00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:26.700]   that I could either spend on myself
[00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:28.340]   or I could spend on someone else.
[00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:33.180]   And so, because Christ was willing to give his time for me,
[00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:34.680]   I will give my time for them."
[00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:38.900]   Make the best use of the time.
[00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:42.360]   Walk with wisdom towards outsiders.
[00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:44.660]   The last step he gives us in verse six,
[00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:46.460]   the final step for saving the world.
[00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:49.180]   Let your speech always be gracious,
[00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:50.380]   seasoned with salt that you may know
[00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:52.660]   how you ought to answer each person.
[00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:55.180]   The third step that Paul gives
[00:29:55.180 --> 00:29:57.540]   is he tells us to speak with grace.
[00:29:57.540 --> 00:29:58.580]   Speak with grace.
[00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:02.860]   Which means that our speech should be marked
[00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:07.700]   with an abnormal, undeserved kind of kindness.
[00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:08.580]   That's what grace is.
[00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:10.740]   Grace is unmerited favor.
[00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:12.260]   It's meant you don't deserve this,
[00:30:12.260 --> 00:30:15.420]   but I'm going to extend to you my love,
[00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:17.100]   my kindness, my compassion.
[00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:21.020]   And so that's how we're meant to speak.
[00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:22.900]   There should be a friendliness to the way
[00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:24.780]   in which we talk to other people.
[00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:28.820]   Like at my last job, we had this six foot rule on staff
[00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:31.000]   that if anybody was ever within six feet of you,
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.900]   you should engage them and you should do so kindly.
[00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:35.500]   And so I took this to heart.
[00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:37.440]   I thought it was a really good principle.
[00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:40.540]   And so I'm doing this and I'm at church on a Sunday
[00:30:40.540 --> 00:30:43.380]   and I see a guy and he's within my radius.
[00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:44.660]   And so I spring into action.
[00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:46.220]   I'm like, "Hey man, how's it going?"
[00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:48.700]   And he was like, "What is with this place?
[00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:53.260]   You're the sixth person to come up and tell me hello.
[00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:56.460]   This is the nicest place I've ever been.
[00:30:56.460 --> 00:30:57.700]   What are y'all doing?"
[00:30:57.700 --> 00:31:00.580]   And I was like, "Man, you know,
[00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:05.300]   Jesus was welcoming to us when we were new.
[00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:09.260]   And so we're welcoming to those that are new themselves."
[00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:10.260]   And he looked at me,
[00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:13.380]   he said, "Man, I think the world could use
[00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:14.460]   a little bit of that."
[00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:16.300]   I was like, "It's funny you should say that.
[00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:18.100]   The Bible would agree."
[00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:20.900]   You know, like that's what Paul's pointing to.
[00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:25.100]   Paul is saying that our speech should be gracious.
[00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:28.100]   It should be gracious and it should be seasoned with salt.
[00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:29.860]   Which if you've run in Christian circles long enough,
[00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:33.140]   you've heard that idea, you know, salt of the earth.
[00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:35.060]   But what does it even mean?
[00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:38.520]   Well, in the ancient world, salt had two specific purposes.
[00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:41.420]   It was used for seasoning and preserving.
[00:31:41.420 --> 00:31:43.060]   And our speech should be the same way.
[00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:45.900]   Like your speech should have some flavor.
[00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:48.180]   Like no one likes to eat bland food
[00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:50.180]   and no one likes to hear a bland gospel.
[00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:54.640]   Like there should be some flavor in the way you talk.
[00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:59.640]   Like it is odd that we can get animated and interested
[00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:03.560]   in all manner of things, business and politics
[00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:05.260]   and sports and fashion.
[00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:07.980]   And yet we can remain unanimated
[00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:10.380]   and uninterested in the person of Jesus.
[00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:13.060]   That's crazy.
[00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:15.820]   That makes no sense.
[00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:20.620]   Every single thing is going to dust.
[00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:22.700]   It's all gonna wash away.
[00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:25.960]   It's all gonna wear out, except for who?
[00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:28.900]   The person of Christ that has made it available
[00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:32.500]   that we all can live with him forever and always.
[00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:36.620]   So why would we not get jazzed up and energized
[00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:38.300]   at the thought of him?
[00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:40.200]   We should be deeply animated.
[00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:44.820]   There should be salt, seasoning, flavor, excitement,
[00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:47.560]   enthusiasm in the way that we talk about him.
[00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:50.140]   There's no one like him.
[00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:52.140]   He's incomparable.
[00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:54.940]   He is wondrous beyond imagination.
[00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:59.380]   And yet we just talk about him like this.
[00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:04.340]   How do you think he talks about you?
[00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:10.860]   I hope it's not like that.
[00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:15.840]   And in fact, I know it's not like that
[00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:18.360]   because you need only read this
[00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:20.920]   to see that he would go every depth.
[00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:22.760]   He would go every length.
[00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:25.920]   He would move every width to get to you.
[00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:29.420]   So how are you talking about him?
[00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:31.800]   But it's not just that our speech should be seasoned
[00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:35.160]   with flavor and fire and fullness,
[00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:36.800]   but it also should prevent corruption.
[00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:38.240]   Like it should preserve.
[00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:39.540]   Like, what does that mean?
[00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:43.920]   A simple way to put it is it should be encouraging.
[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:44.760]   What does encouragement?
[00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:46.680]   Encouragement doesn't tear people down.
[00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:48.880]   It holds them up.
[00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:49.720]   It builds them up.
[00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:52.160]   Literally, the definition of an encouragement
[00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:54.840]   is to put courage into someone.
[00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:56.720]   And that's what we should do.
[00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:58.720]   We should speak encouraging words.
[00:33:58.720 --> 00:33:59.960]   That's what Paul says in a different letter.
[00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:01.080]   He says in Ephesians 4, 29,
[00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:03.620]   "Let no corrupting talk,
[00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:07.600]   "that which is not characteristic of a preservation
[00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:09.600]   "of preserving nature,
[00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:11.320]   "let no corrupting talk come out of your mouth,
[00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:13.720]   "but only such as is good for building up,
[00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:14.600]   "as fits the occasion,
[00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:16.320]   "that it may give grace to those who hear."
[00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:18.320]   This is how the believer is meant to speak.
[00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:21.700]   Like Charles Spurgeon, favorite preacher, he said this,
[00:34:21.700 --> 00:34:24.160]   "No reason exists why the preaching of the gospel
[00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:26.220]   "should be a miserable operation,
[00:34:26.220 --> 00:34:28.680]   "either to the speaker or to the hearer."
[00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:30.040]   There's no reason.
[00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:31.960]   It doesn't need be miserable.
[00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:35.400]   It can be both full of flavor and it can be encouraging,
[00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:36.600]   which I just love.
[00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:39.440]   Like the gospel, it is full of gravity.
[00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:41.680]   It is the most weighty, significant,
[00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:45.080]   meaningful thing in all the world.
[00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:47.560]   Some of you are here and you've never heard it.
[00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:48.800]   Welcome.
[00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:52.280]   You will hear no better news anywhere else.
[00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:55.200]   It is full of gravity.
[00:34:55.200 --> 00:35:00.760]   And it is full of gladness.
[00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:04.420]   The Christian life is not a tragedy.
[00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:09.200]   It's a comedy, not in the sitcom sort of way,
[00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:13.720]   but in the way that knows there's a happy ending ahead
[00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:16.880]   because Christ Jesus has won.
[00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:18.600]   He has overcome the dead.
[00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:22.100]   (congregation applauding)
[00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:29.240]   So that gives us every reason to share the good news.
[00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:31.240]   To share the good news.
[00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:32.640]   How does that make you feel?
[00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:37.940]   (congregation cheering)
[00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:39.700]   I know for some of us, that's the response,
[00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:42.940]   but listen, man, like I once sat in your seat
[00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:45.500]   and I would hear these moments come along.
[00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:48.100]   We're at the end of the conference, the end of the series.
[00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:49.080]   Oh no, like,
[00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:52.800]   the evangelistic guilt trip.
[00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:58.140]   It's been so great, but now I'm supposed to get out there
[00:35:58.140 --> 00:35:59.120]   and do it, man.
[00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:02.420]   I dreaded moments like these.
[00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:05.440]   'Cause I didn't feel capable.
[00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:06.560]   I didn't feel worthy.
[00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:10.920]   I didn't honestly want to share the gospel.
[00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:12.640]   I was quite content knowing God
[00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:14.640]   and letting someone else make him known.
[00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:20.300]   So why does God choose to use you and me
[00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:21.680]   to share the good news?
[00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:23.960]   Like, this is hard.
[00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:25.000]   I know I'm an introvert.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:26.360]   I mean, this is part of my story.
[00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:27.320]   This is a hard thing.
[00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:30.080]   And I also know that God could do this some other way.
[00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:32.500]   Like, he could write it in the sky.
[00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:36.300]   Believe in my son for the forgiveness of your sins
[00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:37.260]   and life everlasting.
[00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:40.300]   Like, he could put it up there in plain English.
[00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:43.700]   So why does he choose to use you and me?
[00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:45.540]   Well, why do we share about anything?
[00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:48.140]   The answer is easy.
[00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:49.780]   Because we think it's great.
[00:36:49.780 --> 00:36:51.460]   That's why we share about things.
[00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:52.280]   We believe they're great.
[00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:53.520]   That's why you talk about your spin class
[00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:55.060]   or that new restaurant or the show you're watching.
[00:36:55.060 --> 00:36:56.220]   You think it's really great.
[00:36:56.220 --> 00:36:58.020]   And as you shared, you believe that other people
[00:36:58.020 --> 00:36:59.620]   will think it's great as well.
[00:36:59.620 --> 00:37:01.480]   It's easy why we share.
[00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:05.400]   A better question is why does God want us to share?
[00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:06.760]   Why does he want us to?
[00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:10.780]   And I believe this is the thing that's so amazing.
[00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:15.240]   Because when we consider the answer to that question,
[00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:20.320]   it reveals the state of our affections for him.
[00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:22.500]   See, there's no question.
[00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:25.160]   Does God want me to share the gospel?
[00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:26.400]   No, there's no question.
[00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:29.240]   The question instead is,
[00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:33.680]   why don't I want to tell other people the gospel?
[00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:38.340]   Which is a really heavy thing to consider.
[00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:41.140]   And yet it's a really amazing thing to process.
[00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:44.440]   Because God in his kindness,
[00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:46.980]   I just think this is brilliant.
[00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:50.780]   He has chosen to use you and me
[00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:52.700]   to tell the world about Jesus
[00:37:52.700 --> 00:37:54.420]   rather than some other method
[00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:56.500]   because he knows in so doing,
[00:37:56.500 --> 00:38:00.600]   he will expose what the state of our love for him is.
[00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:08.480]   He leads us into places of evangelism
[00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:11.380]   and causes us to consider whether we do
[00:38:11.380 --> 00:38:14.500]   or we do not want to share this good news,
[00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:17.780]   that it might trigger a spiritual check engine light
[00:38:17.780 --> 00:38:20.520]   on the dashboard of your heart,
[00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:26.300]   that you might willingly see it pop the hood
[00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:29.100]   and evaluate, God, what's wrong with me?
[00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:33.620]   Why don't I want to tell others of you?
[00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:37.780]   Like God's heart for evangelism,
[00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:40.780]   it's not to make this whole thing feel like a tour duty
[00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:41.700]   or time to serve.
[00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:45.040]   Like he's not trying to obligate you into working for him.
[00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:46.020]   That's not his objective.
[00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:48.240]   It's not a, I did my part, now you better do yours.
[00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:49.340]   That's not his end.
[00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:51.980]   No, he calls us to share the hope of Jesus
[00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:55.460]   because in the process of doing it,
[00:38:55.460 --> 00:38:59.380]   it regularly reveals how much we love him.
[00:38:59.380 --> 00:39:02.820]   Then here's the crazy thing.
[00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:04.420]   And I need you to hear this
[00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:09.180]   because it's masterful from the master.
[00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:16.460]   He wants you so much, longs for your heart so much
[00:39:16.460 --> 00:39:18.980]   that he would implement a strategy
[00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:23.280]   to expose whether you want him in return.
[00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:26.660]   And if the answer to that question is no,
[00:39:26.660 --> 00:39:30.900]   then the solution to that answer is what?
[00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:37.540]   Then tell yourself the good news
[00:39:37.540 --> 00:39:40.300]   of a God who would seek and save even the likes of you.
[00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:45.540]   Before you tell others, tell yourself.
[00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:47.180]   You be reminded.
[00:39:47.180 --> 00:39:49.160]   Have your affections grown cold?
[00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:53.980]   Then repeat the story of a God that would save anybody.
[00:39:54.980 --> 00:39:59.620]   And let your affections blaze once again.
[00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:08.500]   How do I know that this is the way God's working
[00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:12.260]   as he tells us to go out and to fulfill the great commission,
[00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:14.140]   to proclaim the good news,
[00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:16.100]   to share the hope we have in Jesus?
[00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:16.940]   How do I know, man?
[00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:18.500]   Like, how am I so confident
[00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:21.140]   that he so badly wants to be connected to you
[00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:22.300]   that he would do this,
[00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:23.600]   that he would implement a strategy
[00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:26.000]   that would expose whether we want him in return?
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:29.180]   Because he sent his son at a time
[00:40:29.180 --> 00:40:31.740]   when we did not want him,
[00:40:31.740 --> 00:40:33.340]   yet he wanted us anyways.
[00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:38.740]   This is the gospel that Jesus Christ came
[00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:42.620]   and he sought after a people that did not love
[00:40:42.620 --> 00:40:45.040]   nor were willing to return the kind of affection
[00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:47.600]   he so freely lavished upon them.
[00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:54.560]   Like Jesus is a God come man that was so devoted to us
[00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:57.120]   that he considered us his first priority,
[00:40:57.120 --> 00:40:58.640]   not his last resort.
[00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:03.000]   Like all along he's seen you and he said,
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:06.620]   you're my first, you're my choice pick.
[00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:08.640]   You're not the one that I guess I'm gonna settle for
[00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:11.200]   'cause they said, no, I can have whoever I want
[00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:13.400]   and I want all people to come to me.
[00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:16.040]   And so I'm coming to you, I'm moving to you,
[00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:19.700]   I'm devoted to you 'cause I want to bring you home.
[00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:22.500]   But he's not just devoted to us,
[00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:25.580]   he also walks towards us.
[00:41:25.580 --> 00:41:30.180]   Like when we were not on the inside, but on the outside,
[00:41:30.180 --> 00:41:35.180]   Jesus walked towards us and with love in his heart,
[00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:39.540]   he walked past us and up Calvary's Hill
[00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:41.600]   where we ourselves were meant to walk.
[00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:46.160]   And it's not just that he would walk towards,
[00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:49.480]   it's also that he would speak grace to us.
[00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:54.480]   That as he hung upon that cross
[00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:56.860]   and he stared down at a people
[00:41:56.860 --> 00:41:59.260]   that wanted nothing to do with the likes of him,
[00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:02.800]   he would speak these words, father, forgive them.
[00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:05.860]   They do not know what they are doing.
[00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:10.520]   How do you change the world?
[00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:17.880]   You pray, you walk and you speak.
[00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:20.000]   And the reason we know this is the case
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   is because Christ himself has done the same for you and me.
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:27.220]   Let me pray for us.
[00:42:27.220 --> 00:42:30.980]   Father,
[00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:38.300]   I pray that there would be no mistake in this room, God,
[00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:41.200]   just how badly you want for us.
[00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:43.880]   So badly, God, does your heart burn
[00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:45.600]   for the people in this room.
[00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:51.840]   That you would send your one and only son
[00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:55.940]   to do what we could not, to live life so very perfectly.
[00:42:55.940 --> 00:43:01.720]   Yet not only that, he also bore the death we deserve, God,
[00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:03.160]   the wages of sin is death.
[00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:05.440]   And yet he said, I will go in your place.
[00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:07.040]   I will die your death.
[00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:08.760]   I will take the hit.
[00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:12.640]   And he rose forth from that grave.
[00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:14.240]   And as he did, so he said,
[00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:16.640]   and because I have done all of these things,
[00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:20.040]   believe in me and come with me where I am.
[00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:21.840]   Be with me for all eternity.
[00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:23.440]   Everything else is a waste.
[00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:25.360]   It's all going to wash.
[00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:27.840]   It's all going to rubbish.
[00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:32.680]   But not you, if only you place your faith in me,
[00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:34.080]   you go on forever.
[00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:37.000]   We go on forever.
[00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:43.080]   God, I pray that you would move here in this space.
[00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:45.080]   As we come God here to the last song,
[00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:47.980]   I just ask that we would just have
[00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:50.240]   an honest moment with you.
[00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:54.040]   So often we come into this room and for some of us, God,
[00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:56.860]   I know 'cause I myself was the same.
[00:43:56.860 --> 00:43:58.560]   We just put on a front.
[00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:01.900]   We keep up the show.
[00:44:01.900 --> 00:44:05.200]   We play the part and yet God tonight, right now,
[00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:08.800]   this moment can be honest and authentic and real.
[00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:12.160]   For you God are honest and authentic and real
[00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:13.960]   in your love for us, God.
[00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:15.320]   We love you.
[00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:18.840]   We rejoice God for we have reason to rejoice.
[00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:21.920]   The Christian life has a happy ending.
[00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:26.320]   And it's all because of the name of Jesus.
[00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:28.120]   Amen.
[00:44:28.120 --> 00:44:38.120]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
