[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:20.520]   - All right, we're back, let's do it.
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.120]   Hey, help me welcome our Porch Live locations.
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.640]   I'm gonna say all of them and then let's all go ballistic.
[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:26.800]   Okay, here we go.
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.440]   Welcome Porch Live North Houston.
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.040]   Porch Live Tulsa.
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.720]   Porch Live Indy.
[00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.880]   And a special welcome to Porch Live Fort Worth.
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.240]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.440]   All of our friends tuning in live wherever you are,
[00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:43.980]   my friends in the room in Dallas,
[00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.040]   we're so glad that you are here.
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.740]   We're taking a break from series.
[00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.080]   We just wrapped up POV,
[00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.240]   point of view from the disciples and those around Jesus.
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.080]   And I'm really excited we're heading tonight.
[00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.120]   Before I do that, if you're just now tuning in,
[00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.200]   if you're listening at a later day, watching a later day,
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.000]   we just announced our Awaken theme, the rehearsal.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.380]   It's gonna be awesome, September 3rd through 5th.
[00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:07.680]   Check it out at awaken.live.
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.360]   But that's then, tonight, I wanna start off.
[00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.920]   Raise your hand if you have ever been ripped off or scammed.
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.400]   Uh-huh, yep.
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.840]   Hi, my name is JD Rogers.
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.240]   I have been ripped off and scammed.
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.100]   I wanna talk about one of the biggest scams to exist.
[00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.420]   And some of you, even my Enneagram sevens
[00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.200]   might get really upset about this
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.600]   because you love adventure and thrill
[00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.080]   and spontaneity or whatever.
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.280]   Spirit Airlines.
[00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.120]   Let me just get on my soapbox real quick.
[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:46.240]   Unless you like stuffing wrinkly clothes into a backpack,
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.440]   it's a scam.
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.220]   Because I remember my first time using Spirit.
[00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.960]   I got into Expedia, comparing all my prices,
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.000]   and I'm like, it's like 200, 200, 200,
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.040]   and it's like $53.
[00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.860]   And I'm like, dang, all right, click.
[00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.420]   Y'all have all been there, you've been there.
[00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.460]   So I click on it and it's like, well, pay to,
[00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.420]   or add a bag, $75.
[00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.260]   And I'm like, all right, I mean, I need a bag,
[00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.380]   you know, whatever.
[00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.940]   Click on it, and then it's like, oh, select a seat, $25.
[00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.120]   I'm like, select a seat?
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.820]   No other airlines made me do that.
[00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.300]   And I look at the end of it, and it's like $10 cheaper.
[00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.280]   And I'm like, you know what, whatever.
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.380]   I thought it was gonna be way cheaper, but I'll do it.
[00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:24.580]   It's $10 cheaper.
[00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.020]   So then I click it.
[00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.060]   This is when I knew I was scammed.
[00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.060]   I get to the airport and I'm looking at, you know,
[00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.260]   United, Delta, all these different ones.
[00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.100]   I'm like, those are nice.
[00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.900]   And then I see that yellow.
[00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:36.880]   (audience laughing)
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.660]   And I'm like, all right, it's quaint.
[00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.100]   And so I get on, you know, and I'm like, excuse me,
[00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.620]   sorry, sorry, you know, sorry, ow, ow, sorry.
[00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.180]   And I get into my seat and it's like, you know,
[00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.160]   and then my bag that I paid, you know, $85,000 for
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.980]   is in my lap pretty much.
[00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.000]   And it's the only time I can look around and see like,
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.780]   this plane isn't the safest thing.
[00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.160]   Like, why is it called Spirit, first off?
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.320]   I mean, am I about to?
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.460]   And so I'm sitting on the plane,
[00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:09.300]   but that just came to me from the Spirit, you could say.
[00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.700]   So, okay, sorry.
[00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.940]   My friends are viewing me.
[00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.880]   Where was I?
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.160]   Oh yeah, so I'm sitting there, I'm looking around,
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.800]   I'm like, this doesn't seem very safe.
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.160]   I think I got scammed.
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.160]   It was the only time I actually ever listened
[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.820]   to the like flight attendant's instructions.
[00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.460]   I'm like looking for my mask,
[00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.220]   'cause I'm like, this does not look safe.
[00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.180]   It needed to say, I got off,
[00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.720]   and the first thing I said was, man, that was a ripoff.
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.680]   I start there because I wanna talk about
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.700]   one of the biggest ripoffs or scams that the world sells us.
[00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.700]   And it's sexual freedom and sexual exploration.
[00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.620]   Because the world sells us that sexual freedom
[00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.480]   comes with no cost.
[00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:02.140]   But that's the biggest scam that culture sells us.
[00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.660]   And some of you might not be convinced of that.
[00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.340]   I hope that by the end of the night, you will see
[00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.100]   that culture says, hey, in order to be free,
[00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.540]   you can do what you want, when you want with your body,
[00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:17.820]   'cause it's your body.
[00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:22.500]   And whatever makes you happy, do it.
[00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.820]   Well, when people are feeding that to a bunch of hormone,
[00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.400]   raging, all the things, testosterone,
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.500]   that make up young adults who are single
[00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.420]   and have sex drives, and we hear,
[00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:35.220]   do what you want with your body,
[00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.220]   and do what makes you happy, we're like a bunch of rabbits.
[00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:39.060]   It's insane.
[00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.500]   And so the problem is, culture says,
[00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.700]   this is what makes you feel free.
[00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.060]   This is what makes you have fun.
[00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.700]   But here's why we're having this talk tonight.
[00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:52.980]   The title of my message tonight
[00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.700]   is simply Battling Sexual Sin.
[00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.340]   And the reason why I wanted to have this talk
[00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.180]   is because last week, if you were here with us,
[00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.100]   DMARV wrapped up POV talking about shame.
[00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:04.900]   And he asked all of you to write down a thing
[00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.020]   that makes you most shameful on a card
[00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:08.180]   and to bring it forward.
[00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:09.820]   And the team got together on Wednesday
[00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.940]   and we went through thousands upon thousands of cards
[00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:16.860]   and our hearts were broken because our very own people
[00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.740]   represented in this room, praise God,
[00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.500]   hopefully they were set free.
[00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.260]   But here's a lot of what we saw.
[00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:27.480]   And guys, I just spent some time with all of these cards,
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.500]   and I mean card after card.
[00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:38.060]   Lust, porn, sex, women, sexual abuse, sexual thoughts.
[00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.400]   I'm sorry, God, you know what I did.
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.460]   Porn, sex, masturbation.
[00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:50.180]   My struggle is with pornography.
[00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:55.100]   Homosexuality, sexual sin that I choose to do.
[00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:57.340]   Boys taking advantage of me.
[00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:00.100]   Past sexual perversion, past sexual sin
[00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:01.180]   and lustful thoughts.
[00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:06.180]   Prostitution, lust, masturbation, lust, pornography.
[00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:09.260]   Pornography and masturbation, porn.
[00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:15.580]   Jealousy, embarrassment and my sexual sins.
[00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:21.740]   Broken relationships, porn, lust, sexual abuse,
[00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:27.020]   masturbation, porn, lust, sexual abuse,
[00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:31.300]   masturbation, homosexuality, secret sexual sin.
[00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:34.520]   Over and over and over again.
[00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.860]   And it just did something to me.
[00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:39.900]   And we're starting off, I'm just gonna tell us,
[00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:42.460]   it's gonna be more on the serious side of a message,
[00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:45.500]   just brother to brothers and sisters.
[00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:48.760]   We've all just been wrecked this week.
[00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:55.060]   To just see card after card of people acknowledging,
[00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:57.300]   I think you're not as surprised.
[00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.460]   I think that you know the fact that you wrote in a card,
[00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:01.960]   you are saying, hey, I've been buying a lie.
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:05.220]   I've been ripped off.
[00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:06.480]   I've been scammed.
[00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:10.140]   But my fear is, is that a lot of us
[00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:13.060]   have written those things on a card before.
[00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:16.660]   And some of you might have written on this card
[00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:21.060]   and this week found yourself maybe not feeling as much shame
[00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:24.380]   because of the cross, but still in your sin.
[00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:27.660]   That you left your shame at the stage
[00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:29.060]   and down in this bucket,
[00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:31.720]   but the struggle was still waiting for you
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:33.700]   when you got home.
[00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:37.820]   And tonight, it's a message of both challenge and hope.
[00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:40.240]   Because on this side of heaven,
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:43.660]   we will constantly be battling all types of sin,
[00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:45.620]   but specifically in our young adult years,
[00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:48.020]   I mean, it just seems that we will really be battling
[00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:51.660]   sexual sin as single young adults,
[00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:54.780]   as married young adults, it doesn't go away.
[00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:59.580]   But in this battle, I think a lot of us wonder,
[00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:02.480]   can I actually be free?
[00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:07.640]   Can I actually defeat this addiction?
[00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:11.000]   Can I win the battle against sexual sin?
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   And I wanna tell you, the answer is through Jesus, yes.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.800]   You can, you can, because of Jesus.
[00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.160]   And so tonight will be, like I said,
[00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:26.160]   a message of challenge and hope, hope in Jesus.
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:30.600]   Because left to ourself, we cannot, and we'll see that.
[00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:34.480]   My hope for this message is that you would see
[00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:38.680]   that your story does not end with your sexual past.
[00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:43.440]   Your story does not end with what's happened to you sexually
[00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:46.360]   and you are not defined by what you have done
[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:48.940]   or currently are doing sexually.
[00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:53.160]   That you can, with Jesus, defeat your sexual sin
[00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:56.280]   because culture, like I said, it's throwing at us Tinder
[00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:59.480]   for hookups, Snapchat for sexting, porn sites,
[00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:02.800]   now virtual reality porn, Twitter for anything you want,
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:06.360]   hookup culture, OnlyFans, all these different things.
[00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:08.560]   Culture says, take this if you wanna be free,
[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:13.560]   yet bound, shamed, addicted.
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:21.240]   And so tonight, I wanna break the chains of sexual addiction
[00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:26.000]   and sexual sin with the power that Jesus offers.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.520]   I wanna do that by taking a look at one
[00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:30.160]   of the greatest kings in the Old Testament.
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:31.000]   So if you have your Bible,
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.160]   open up to 2 Samuel chapter 11.
[00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:37.520]   And we're gonna look at King David,
[00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:43.320]   a man that if he had taken care of his sexual sin,
[00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:45.080]   rather than it taking care of him,
[00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:47.840]   he was a man marked for most of his life
[00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:50.560]   in the story of 1 Samuel and 2 Samuel
[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:52.680]   by a man after God's own heart,
[00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:55.760]   a man categorized by great faith,
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:58.480]   the young boy that when everyone else was afraid,
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:01.280]   of the giant Goliath, he in faith got up
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:03.120]   and declared who his God was,
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:06.000]   and he knocked him down with nothing but a sling and a stone
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.880]   that's who he was, a man of great faith.
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:11.400]   But sadly, that's not where his story ended
[00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:14.240]   because not only was he marked by faith,
[00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:16.800]   but one of the things that David is marked by now
[00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:20.160]   to generations after generations is his greatest failure.
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.920]   And we're gonna read about that right here
[00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:25.780]   in 2 Samuel chapter 11, verse one.
[00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:29.300]   (pages rustling)
[00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:31.140]   In the spring of the year,
[00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:33.500]   the time when kings go out to battle,
[00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:37.860]   David sent Joab and his servants with him in all Israel,
[00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:40.020]   and they ravaged the Ammonites and besieged Rabbah,
[00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:42.580]   but David remained at Jerusalem.
[00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:46.500]   It happened late one afternoon
[00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:48.060]   when David arose from his couch
[00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:50.500]   and was walking on the roof of the king's house
[00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:53.420]   that he saw from the roof a woman bathing,
[00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:55.540]   and the woman was very beautiful.
[00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:57.500]   And David sent and inquired about the woman,
[00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:59.740]   and one said, "Hey, is not this Bathsheba,
[00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:03.580]   the daughter of Elion, the wife of Uriah, the Hittite?"
[00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:06.420]   So David sent messengers and took her,
[00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:09.940]   and she came to him, and he lay with her.
[00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:13.260]   Now she had been purifying herself of her uncleanness.
[00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:17.500]   Then she returned to her house, and the woman conceived,
[00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:19.440]   and she sent and told David,
[00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:23.660]   "I am pregnant, and you are the father."
[00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:25.940]   I mean, a real-time Jerry Springer happening right here
[00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:26.780]   in 2 Samuel.
[00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:30.660]   Today, we're gonna look at the first few verses
[00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:34.700]   that were the path that led to David's failure,
[00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:37.860]   the battle that he had with his sin that he lost,
[00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:39.540]   but hopefully it was not for nothing,
[00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:42.780]   that we can redeem it by using it as an example
[00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:44.140]   to how we should live our life.
[00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:45.260]   I think one of the problems
[00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.980]   that people still struggle with sin year after year
[00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:51.180]   is because they do everything they can to attack the sin.
[00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:55.260]   No porn, no porn, no sex, no sex,
[00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:59.660]   and they give no attention to the path that led to the sin.
[00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:03.420]   They don't spend time rewinding the tapes and backing up
[00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:06.100]   because maybe it's a little uncomfortable or a little uneasy
[00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:08.260]   or honestly, it just takes a lot of effort.
[00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:09.260]   So we'd rather say, "No, no, no,
[00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.020]   "I just won't text them anymore,"
[00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:12.860]   or, "No, no, no, I just won't get on that site anymore.
[00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:14.540]   "I won't do those things,"
[00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:16.500]   but yet you're not strong enough,
[00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:18.500]   and you keep doing it and keep doing it.
[00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:23.420]   So just really simply put tonight for my note takers,
[00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:26.240]   five steps to win the battle against sexual sin.
[00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:30.380]   Five steps, they're gonna be all R's, nice and neat for you.
[00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:33.940]   Five steps to win the battle against sexual sin,
[00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:35.460]   just going verse by verse
[00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:37.460]   in the path that led to David's failure.
[00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:41.920]   Verse one, "In the spring of the year,
[00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:44.280]   "the time when kings go out to battle."
[00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:46.980]   It's like Samuel was exposing my man David
[00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:49.900]   'cause David was a king meant to be in battle.
[00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:52.060]   So he's just emphasizing,
[00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:54.940]   yeah, the spring of the year,
[00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:57.700]   the time when kings were supposed to be at battle,
[00:12:57.700 --> 00:12:59.300]   hint, hint.
[00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:04.300]   David sent Joab and his servants and all Israel,
[00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:08.740]   everyone else but himself.
[00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:12.180]   And they ravaged the Ammonites and besieged Rabbah,
[00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:15.540]   but David remained at Jerusalem.
[00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:17.080]   I mean, it's like Samuel is writing
[00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:19.620]   and really wanting us to notice something here
[00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:21.140]   that was already wrong.
[00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:25.820]   The first problem that David made is our first step
[00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:27.620]   to battling against sexual sin.
[00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:31.020]   The first step to fight sexual sin is to remember
[00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:34.740]   who you are and what you are called to do.
[00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:38.460]   Remember who you are and what you are called to do.
[00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:40.800]   So what is Samuel trying to show us here?
[00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:42.800]   Who was David?
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:47.740]   A king anointed by God,
[00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:52.740]   chosen to lead God's chosen people into great purpose,
[00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:54.140]   into great heights,
[00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:57.260]   to be the strongest nation in all the land.
[00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:02.120]   That was who he was, chosen by God to be royalty.
[00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:04.640]   And what was he called to do?
[00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:09.360]   Go to war, lead the war.
[00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:13.200]   The reason why I wanted to start with remembering
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:15.460]   who you are and what you are called to do
[00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:19.180]   is because remembering requires something mental.
[00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:21.240]   And if you don't take away anything tonight practical,
[00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:22.820]   here's what I want you to take away.
[00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:27.080]   You will be what you think you are.
[00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:31.080]   You will be or you will do
[00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:35.320]   based off of what you believe you are.
[00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:39.980]   In this moment, we see David clearly forgot who he was
[00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:42.700]   and what he was called to do.
[00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:46.740]   Because if he remembered,
[00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:51.740]   I am a king anointed and chosen by the God of the universe
[00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:57.100]   called to lead and stand up and be a man and go to war,
[00:14:57.100 --> 00:15:01.180]   it would have changed everything about this moment.
[00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:03.680]   But because he forgot who he was
[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:06.100]   and his purpose and his calling,
[00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:08.820]   because he neglected his character and his calling,
[00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:13.020]   he found himself home when everyone else was at war.
[00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:15.420]   That is often when you will fall
[00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:16.940]   is when you are at home,
[00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:18.840]   when you're meant to be in the battle.
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:22.940]   So for David, that's great.
[00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:25.680]   King, anointed by God, job, go to war.
[00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:29.100]   As a Christian in 2022, who are we?
[00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:30.580]   What are we called to do?
[00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:33.140]   First Peter puts it really simple for us.
[00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:38.300]   First Peter 2, nine says, but you are not like that.
[00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:40.340]   If you read the previous verses, he's talking about,
[00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:43.220]   you're not like the world, you're not like darkness,
[00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:45.020]   you are different.
[00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:46.540]   That's us.
[00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:49.620]   You are a chosen people.
[00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:52.220]   See the parallel between David chosen to be king,
[00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:56.020]   we are a chosen people, not only chosen and just people,
[00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:59.060]   but you are royal priest.
[00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:03.580]   In Christ, we inherit who he is,
[00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:07.140]   therefore you and I, we're royalty.
[00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:09.620]   It gets even better.
[00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:11.020]   We're a holy nation.
[00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:15.900]   Lastly, we are God's very own possession.
[00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:21.820]   That is who you are, chosen, royalty,
[00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:24.380]   a nation set apart,
[00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:29.320]   and you are personally important to God.
[00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:32.160]   You are his very own possession.
[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:35.780]   And then he says, as a result, look at it,
[00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:36.880]   just right there in the text.
[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:39.900]   As a result, because of who you are, here's what you do.
[00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:42.380]   As a result of who you are,
[00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:47.380]   your calling is show others the goodness of God.
[00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:52.500]   For he called you out of darkness into his wonderful light.
[00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:55.300]   So who are you?
[00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:58.580]   Royalty, chosen, God's very own possession.
[00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:00.080]   What are you called to do?
[00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:02.820]   Walk away from darkness, step into his wonderful light
[00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:04.620]   and live like it.
[00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:06.940]   Step into the battle against darkness,
[00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:09.000]   wage war against your flesh
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.040]   and live as if you are a chosen child of God.
[00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:16.380]   And so when the enemy tries to come and lure you away
[00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:18.120]   and try to get you and culture tries to get you
[00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:23.040]   to forget who you are, you have to remember,
[00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:25.240]   remember what this verse says.
[00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:27.520]   Every single one of you, but despite what you feel,
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:28.760]   despite what you've been told,
[00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:31.320]   despite other people have treated you,
[00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:34.560]   you are chosen in God's very own possession.
[00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:38.100]   And you have a responsibility now to live like it's true.
[00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:42.980]   But if you forget, you will live like the world.
[00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:45.800]   Darkness will look really appetizing to you.
[00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:48.760]   Sexual sin will suddenly sound really good to you
[00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:52.060]   because when we go and choose to follow
[00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:53.280]   the temptation of sexual sin,
[00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:56.240]   it's because something in us feels like it's lacking.
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:18:00.080]   The reason why I want to start with a mental practical step
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:04.480]   is because mentally, when I talk to young adults
[00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:08.120]   who fell again to porn, fell again to hooking up,
[00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:13.120]   fell again to lustful desires and fantasizing, masturbation,
[00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:17.380]   I'll ask them about their day and I'll say,
[00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:18.880]   what, tell me about your day.
[00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:21.420]   All right, why did you do that?
[00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:22.400]   Why did you do that?
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:23.880]   Why did you do that?
[00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:26.640]   And what it always comes down to slowly but surely
[00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:30.220]   is what we can track is it started with a belief.
[00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:36.220]   For a lot of times, guys, something made them feel insecure.
[00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:40.640]   A girl neglected them, rejected them.
[00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:43.040]   A girl's never said yes to them.
[00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:44.560]   A girl cheated on them.
[00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:46.760]   Their dad never showed his approval of them.
[00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:49.320]   There's a void, there's something lacking.
[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:50.720]   And so they go searching and you know
[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:52.980]   who never puts them down?
[00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:54.240]   The person on the screen.
[00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:57.120]   You know who never neglects them?
[00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:58.680]   Porn's always there.
[00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:01.480]   You know what's always there for them to go
[00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:05.160]   and to meet that need and to fill that void with?
[00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:07.440]   A screen, an image, a person.
[00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:09.380]   But I'm telling you, it's a scam.
[00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:13.180]   It's telling you this is where you can find freedom.
[00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:14.560]   This is where you can find life.
[00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:16.640]   This is where you can fill that void.
[00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:19.040]   But then you know what you feel after.
[00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:22.040]   And you have to wake up and remember,
[00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:24.520]   no, no, no, when I feel this way,
[00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:26.520]   when my thoughts are going down a dark path,
[00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:28.360]   when I feel insecure, or ladies,
[00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:30.840]   when you don't feel worthy, or you feel invalidated,
[00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:32.760]   or you don't feel chosen, or like you're enough,
[00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:34.200]   or if you just look like someone else
[00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:35.540]   and you're struggling with comparison
[00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:37.160]   and you wanna run to wrong guys
[00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:39.040]   or all these different things,
[00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:42.400]   you have to stop and simply remember,
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:45.880]   the world will rip me off.
[00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:50.880]   But in Christ, I am royalty, I'm chosen,
[00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:53.440]   I'm God's very own possession.
[00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:57.680]   Therefore, I have a responsibility to live like it's true
[00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:59.120]   by displaying the goodness of God,
[00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:01.720]   by knowing God and making Him known.
[00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:03.500]   That is who I am.
[00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:05.340]   That is what I'm called to do.
[00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:09.000]   Not by my own strength, but His.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.880]   David, his first problem was he forgot who he was.
[00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:16.100]   Step number two,
[00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:20.700]   recognize where you're susceptible.
[00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:22.600]   Look at verse two.
[00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:26.440]   It happened late one afternoon.
[00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:28.240]   I just love how Samuel keeps like
[00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:30.080]   giving us more details than we asked for.
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:33.280]   It happened, let's say around four or five o'clock,
[00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:37.160]   give or take, when David arose from his couch.
[00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:39.000]   I'm like, they got couches back then?
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.240]   Leather, you know, what kind was it?
[00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:46.160]   Was walking on the roof of the king's house.
[00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:49.180]   You ever heard of idle time is the devil's playground?
[00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:51.720]   He's walking around on the roof.
[00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:55.200]   That he saw from the roof a woman bathing
[00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:57.640]   and the woman was very beautiful.
[00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:01.000]   If we're gonna fight the battle against sexual sin,
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.820]   we have to recognize where we are susceptible
[00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:05.520]   to fall to sexual sin.
[00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:07.800]   Another way of saying this is we have to look for patterns.
[00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:10.320]   Patterns often point to problems.
[00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:12.000]   If you have a reoccurring problem in your life,
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.340]   if you have an addiction in your life,
[00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:15.640]   look at the pattern that leads to the problem.
[00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:21.040]   I am convinced with the more and more of you that I meet,
[00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:24.400]   and as I think back to my like single years,
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:28.000]   my high school years, 99% of sexual sins
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.360]   I think would go away if we got rid of couches.
[00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:32.760]   I'm serious.
[00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:36.280]   Like, you know what I'm saying, Josiah?
[00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:39.840]   Like, couches are always just a spot
[00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:41.720]   where no good takes place.
[00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:46.540]   Your girl's sitting across, it's late,
[00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:47.960]   your parents go to bed,
[00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:51.720]   the movie lights hitting her just right.
[00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:54.280]   Probably like George Lopez on the TV, I don't know.
[00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:55.720]   (audience laughing)
[00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:56.800]   You're like, is it hot?
[00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:57.900]   Like, what's going on?
[00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:00.600]   Toes start connecting.
[00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:05.240]   Yeah. (laughing)
[00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:10.680]   There's like two responses, toes, toes.
[00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:13.680]   (audience laughing)
[00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:18.520]   But the point that I'm trying to articulate here
[00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:21.520]   is you need to think about the times,
[00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:22.880]   like ask yourself this question,
[00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:24.640]   write it down and think about it.
[00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:27.720]   When the devil attacks, where am I?
[00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:32.240]   When and where does he attack?
[00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:36.020]   When does he present sexual sin?
[00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:40.880]   Oftentimes, it's when we are alone,
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:43.480]   isolated, and on our couch.
[00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:45.740]   I don't know what the couch is for you.
[00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:48.440]   The couch might be your room alone at night.
[00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:52.900]   The couch might be in your Instagram DMs
[00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:55.140]   when you said you're gonna delete Instagram.
[00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:58.740]   The couch might be when you take them home in the car
[00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:00.660]   and you should have walked them to your door,
[00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:03.080]   but you stayed inside for too long.
[00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:05.500]   I don't know what the couch is in your life,
[00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:07.180]   but you need to think about the patterns
[00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:08.900]   that point to your problem.
[00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:11.980]   When do you fall to sexual sin?
[00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:13.860]   And some of you might be thinking right now,
[00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:16.080]   what even classifies as sexual sin?
[00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:18.740]   Is making out sexual sin?
[00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:21.020]   I'm gonna leave that between you and the Lord.
[00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:22.420]   I'm not gonna say yes or no.
[00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:26.980]   Here's what I'll say just to give it to you straight.
[00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:28.580]   Let's be big boys and big girls.
[00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:35.460]   Sex, oral sex, sex in ways that shouldn't be sex,
[00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:42.900]   getting too handsy, making out while bumping and grinding,
[00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:46.300]   getting hot and steamy, you know what I'm talking about.
[00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:50.860]   Being alone, looking at things
[00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:52.840]   that cause you to be sexually aroused,
[00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:55.100]   entertaining yourself.
[00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:57.620]   And then just to make sure I hit everything,
[00:23:57.620 --> 00:23:58.900]   if you and your significant other
[00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:00.520]   or the person that you tend to hook up with
[00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:02.820]   had to ask yourself, are we towing the line?
[00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:04.540]   Yes, you are.
[00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:05.380]   You're towing the line.
[00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:07.260]   If you have to ask yourself, I think we're towing the line,
[00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:08.980]   it's 'cause there's something in you telling you
[00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:12.820]   that you're towing the line and you need to reel it back.
[00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:18.720]   And you need to look and go, in light of all those things,
[00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:21.000]   when I fall to porn, when I fall to masturbation,
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.560]   when I fall to hooking up, when does it happen?
[00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:24.520]   When does it start?
[00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:25.600]   Where am I?
[00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:28.200]   If it's when you're in your house alone
[00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:29.780]   because you don't have a roommate in your room,
[00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:30.620]   get a roommate.
[00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:33.120]   If you live alone in an apartment
[00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:35.920]   and you're hooking up all the time, get three roommates.
[00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:39.240]   Like, but I'm an introvert.
[00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:42.820]   Wanna be free, get three roommates.
[00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:44.300]   I'm serious.
[00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:45.740]   If you're saying, well, I don't have community,
[00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:48.680]   I don't have people, move to where they are.
[00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:53.800]   If it's apps on your phone, get rid of the apps.
[00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:57.520]   Whatever it is that is the pattern
[00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:00.520]   that leads to you falling to sexual sin,
[00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:02.280]   recognize where you're susceptible
[00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:05.360]   and remove it out of your life.
[00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:09.560]   David was meant to be at war.
[00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:12.120]   He was on the couch.
[00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:13.580]   Proverbs 18 one says,
[00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:16.220]   "Whoever isolates himself, seeks his own desire,
[00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:19.680]   "he breaks out against all sound judgment."
[00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:23.740]   When I'm in isolation, there's a word that's helped me.
[00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:26.060]   It's an acronym called HALT.
[00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:28.260]   And when I'm any of these things,
[00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:31.080]   I literally have to halt and think about what am I doing
[00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:33.840]   and where do I need to go to get out of this situation?
[00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:38.840]   Hungry, angry, lonely, tired,
[00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:43.260]   and add bored, HALT-BA, all right?
[00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:48.700]   When I'm hungry, angry, lonely, or tired or bored,
[00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:50.320]   I gotta get up and do something
[00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:52.420]   'cause I know I'm susceptible to fall.
[00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:57.140]   I have to rearrange my life to not fall to sexual sin
[00:25:57.140 --> 00:26:00.700]   because I have recognized where I'm susceptible.
[00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:02.220]   Recently, what that looked like for me,
[00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:05.100]   I spend way too much time scrolling on TikTok
[00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:07.300]   and put something in me,
[00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:08.420]   it's like, well, if you're gonna be speaking
[00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:10.020]   to young adults, you gotta be relevant
[00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:11.660]   and know all the things.
[00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:13.580]   It's not worth it.
[00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:14.660]   It's taking time.
[00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:15.660]   So you know what I did?
[00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:19.200]   Hold down that little nice shaky thing, delete.
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:23.100]   Some of you, you think, oh, I can't live without it.
[00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:25.420]   You can, you can.
[00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:28.580]   For me, friends wanna hang out,
[00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:31.580]   but I haven't spent time relying on God
[00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:32.720]   and being with God that day.
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:34.380]   And something in me thinks, wait,
[00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:37.380]   can you be self-sufficient today?
[00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:40.060]   'Cause it usually starts with me.
[00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:42.180]   If I'm gonna go down a path that leads to sin,
[00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:45.500]   it starts with thinking that I can do life without God.
[00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:49.640]   So I have to rearrange my plans and go, God, I need you.
[00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:53.420]   Recognize where you're susceptible
[00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:55.260]   and rearrange accordingly.
[00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:58.260]   The next one, resist the urge
[00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:01.300]   to give in to your sexual desires.
[00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:07.860]   Verse three, and David sent and inquired about the woman.
[00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:12.220]   David sent and inquired about the woman.
[00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:14.860]   He saw a woman bathing on the roof.
[00:27:14.860 --> 00:27:20.040]   And in that moment, he had a decision.
[00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:22.740]   He could have said, oh, that ain't my wife,
[00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:25.280]   and kept walking and said, what did he do?
[00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:26.220]   (imitates car horn)
[00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:30.180]   Like he like looked and sat, and it says he inquired.
[00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:34.140]   And I don't have to explain what sexual urge is, correct?
[00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:36.060]   We're old enough in this room?
[00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:37.500]   Yeah, Christian, oh yeah.
[00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:39.180]   (congregation laughs)
[00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:42.340]   It's the, my mind's telling me no, but my body,
[00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:44.260]   that thing that comes alive in you
[00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:47.060]   as a young man and young woman, yes, okay, you all know.
[00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:50.740]   And some of you might be thinking,
[00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:55.740]   well, if God gave us sexual urges and sexual desires,
[00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:59.340]   why would we not be able to explore them?
[00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:02.780]   Why would we not to be able to entertain them,
[00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:07.780]   pleasure ourselves, find out more about who we are sexually?
[00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:10.260]   Something I've learned about us is
[00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:12.160]   when it comes to sexual sin, especially,
[00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:14.380]   we are never more creative as individuals
[00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:15.820]   until we're justifying sin.
[00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:20.700]   We're never more creative till we're justifying sin.
[00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:22.700]   And so you get the urge and you're like,
[00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:25.620]   well, I won't go all the way.
[00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:28.420]   Well, we'll just do this.
[00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:31.300]   Well, I'll just watch, and I won't actually do anything,
[00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:32.900]   I'll just watch.
[00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:35.220]   Or it's just, it used to be full on videos,
[00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:38.420]   now it's just images and it's not that big of a deal.
[00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:40.020]   It's not that big of a deal.
[00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:41.960]   It's not that big of a deal.
[00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:43.740]   And instead of resisting the urge,
[00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:45.180]   you feed it like David did.
[00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:47.220]   He could have turned away, but he fed it.
[00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:50.100]   It says he went and he inquired more.
[00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:51.820]   This is like the modern day,
[00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:55.460]   you're scrolling on Instagram and a picture pops up
[00:28:55.460 --> 00:28:56.500]   on your explore page or something,
[00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:58.460]   and it's a girl in a bikini or a guy
[00:28:58.460 --> 00:29:00.140]   doing some shirtless thirst trap thing.
[00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:03.500]   You could have kept scrolling.
[00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:04.460]   You could have got off.
[00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:05.980]   You could have done anything else, but what'd you do?
[00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:06.980]   Click.
[00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:11.140]   You went and inquired about this lady or about this man.
[00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:12.740]   And you went to their profile,
[00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:14.820]   you saw more bikini pictures that you liked,
[00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:17.400]   that got you sexually aroused, the urge came.
[00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:18.240]   Now what do you know?
[00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:20.220]   Oh my gosh, how is my laptop in my lap?
[00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:22.380]   I'm just watching YouTube videos.
[00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:24.020]   Oh, I guess I'll type in the website.
[00:29:24.020 --> 00:29:25.660]   Oh, I'm at this porn website.
[00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:28.280]   And then you're guilty because you looked at porn again.
[00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:30.640]   And you're going, how did I get here?
[00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:34.180]   Well, if you trace it back in that moment,
[00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:39.180]   you had a decision, get off, resist the urge or feed it.
[00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:41.740]   And if you continue to feed it,
[00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:44.220]   it will only get more and more hungry
[00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:47.100]   and it will lead you down a path to destruction.
[00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:49.820]   That's what we see in David's life.
[00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:54.380]   He could have walked away, but he inquired about the woman.
[00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:57.980]   And it says the woman was very beautiful.
[00:29:57.980 --> 00:30:02.200]   I wanna say something with care and compassion.
[00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:03.240]   I just, while I was reading this,
[00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:06.920]   I kind of got just an excuse I hear a lot
[00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:08.920]   from young adults after they fall sexually
[00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:10.920]   with someone else.
[00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:13.920]   Guys will oftentimes, well, bro,
[00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:16.520]   she was giving me all the signals.
[00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:18.700]   We did it because the way she was texting me,
[00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:22.500]   she came onto me, she, she, she.
[00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:25.240]   And I wanna say to my brothers,
[00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:28.700]   quit blaming women for your lack of self-control.
[00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:31.120]   You are the leader.
[00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:35.540]   You are in control of what you do.
[00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:37.340]   You need to own up for your actions.
[00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:43.360]   Ladies, well, he begged and he was so sweet.
[00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:44.840]   He texted me all these sweet things
[00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:46.000]   and we were emotionally connecting.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.420]   He told me about his parents' divorce
[00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:48.680]   and he never shares that.
[00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:52.100]   (congregation laughing)
[00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:57.460]   To you, with compassion and care, I say,
[00:30:57.460 --> 00:31:00.460]   quit blaming men for your lack of self-worth.
[00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:04.960]   You deserve more.
[00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:08.560]   You are worth a man who will see you as God's daughter,
[00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:11.460]   as royalty, as chosen, as his own possession,
[00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:12.840]   and treat you accordingly.
[00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:16.400]   Last person I wanna speak to, to the abused.
[00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:18.900]   To the person who says,
[00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:21.620]   "Hey, there wasn't actually anything I could do."
[00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:22.820]   That's part of my story.
[00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:26.280]   And to you, I wanna say, it is not your fault.
[00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:28.460]   It is not your fault.
[00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:29.700]   You are not marked by that.
[00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:31.980]   A lot of you wrote down sexual abuse in this bucket,
[00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:33.800]   and that does not have to define who you are,
[00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:37.100]   but it also does not have to define your future decisions.
[00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:38.100]   Just because you were hurt
[00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:41.700]   does not mean you have to keep hurting yourself.
[00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:45.760]   I had to wake up and take actions for my own choices
[00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:46.700]   and say, "I have a choice.
[00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:48.980]   "I can keep blaming this moment
[00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:51.540]   "and continue to let it reproduce more and more hurt
[00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:52.760]   "in my life and in others,
[00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:56.460]   "or I can take responsibility for who I am in Christ."
[00:31:56.460 --> 00:31:59.360]   And you can too, in Christ, you can.
[00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:00.500]   But don't do it alone.
[00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:06.420]   All of us, we are called to resist the urge.
[00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:07.400]   And you might be thinking,
[00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:11.480]   "JD, you don't understand my sex drive, bro.
[00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:13.580]   "You don't understand my urge.
[00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:16.240]   "I got passions, I got feelings.
[00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:17.360]   "I can't stop.
[00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:18.460]   "It's all I think about.
[00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:19.480]   "It's all I see.
[00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:20.600]   "It's everywhere.
[00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:22.240]   "I best get to lock myself in my room
[00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:24.280]   "if I don't want to get the urge."
[00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:29.280]   And I would say to you, you're being ripped off.
[00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:30.780]   You're being lied to.
[00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:35.160]   This verse, I remember when I was single
[00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:38.060]   and fighting sexual sin and thinking,
[00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:41.320]   "I cannot stop doing this.
[00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:43.020]   "I cannot break free.
[00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:45.880]   "This is just so, I'm addicted to this.
[00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:47.640]   "What do I do?"
[00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:48.880]   And I read this.
[00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:52.180]   First Corinthians 10, 13, it says,
[00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:54.740]   "No temptation has overtaken you
[00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:56.680]   "that is not common to man."
[00:32:56.680 --> 00:33:00.460]   The first thing we see is your sin is not unique to you.
[00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:04.480]   You are not alone in what you are facing.
[00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:06.800]   You are not the only one with this raging sex drive
[00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:09.920]   or this urge that you were called to rein in
[00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:12.540]   and to do according to God's design.
[00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:13.740]   It's not unique to you.
[00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:17.040]   Where you are faithless, look what it says.
[00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:20.500]   "God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted
[00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:23.520]   "beyond your ability, but with the temptation,
[00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:26.460]   "he will also provide the way of escape
[00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:29.340]   "that you may be able to endure it."
[00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:33.420]   That's crazy.
[00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:35.360]   God is faithful.
[00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:38.400]   Left to myself, left to yourself,
[00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:39.420]   you're like, "Bro, I can't.
[00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:40.440]   "I can't resist the urge.
[00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:41.740]   "I can't, I can't."
[00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:43.600]   I'm like, "I can't, I can't."
[00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:44.740]   That's correct.
[00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:47.700]   You cannot, but God can.
[00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:49.240]   Jesus in you can.
[00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:52.600]   The power of the Holy Spirit in you can
[00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:54.320]   because God is faithful.
[00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:55.980]   Left to ourself, we are faithless.
[00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:57.120]   That's why we run to porn.
[00:33:57.120 --> 00:34:00.200]   That's why we run to sex, but God is faithful.
[00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:01.380]   How is he faithful?
[00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:03.220]   To give you the strength to endure it
[00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:07.400]   according to his spirit and to give you a way out.
[00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:11.020]   That means that if you find yourself with sexual temptation
[00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:13.160]   or an opportunity to choose your sin,
[00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:16.140]   God has already determined that you are strong enough
[00:34:16.140 --> 00:34:18.860]   to say no to that and yes to him.
[00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:20.940]   That's what that says to me.
[00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:23.780]   You have the strength because of Jesus in you
[00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:25.940]   to say no, to resist.
[00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:27.820]   I think what we have to be honest with ourself is
[00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:30.000]   is we like our sin.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:31.900]   We like our sex.
[00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:33.240]   We like our porn.
[00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:39.720]   We need a faithful God to help our faithless flesh.
[00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:45.420]   We have to wake up every day and say, God, I need you.
[00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:48.940]   I need you to give me the strength
[00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:52.240]   and to show me the way out.
[00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:55.060]   And God is faithful to do it.
[00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:58.180]   You will have to yourself cannot resist the urge,
[00:34:58.180 --> 00:35:00.380]   but he in you, greater is he who is in you
[00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:01.980]   than he who is in the world.
[00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:03.820]   He can.
[00:35:03.820 --> 00:35:05.840]   He will.
[00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:07.700]   He will.
[00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:12.000]   For David, he provided a way of escape.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.340]   Look at this.
[00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:16.800]   He went and inquired about the woman.
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:19.620]   And then one said, is not this Bathsheba,
[00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:22.640]   the daughter of Elion, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?
[00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:26.560]   Basically he's saying, yo, bro, wake up, red flag.
[00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:30.020]   This woman, she's someone's daughter
[00:35:30.020 --> 00:35:31.620]   and she's someone's wife.
[00:35:31.620 --> 00:35:34.880]   I don't see King David anywhere written on this woman.
[00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:36.900]   She is not yours.
[00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:39.620]   What to say?
[00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:41.740]   So David sent messengers and took her.
[00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:45.500]   He didn't listen, but God provided the way of escape
[00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:47.740]   through community, which is step four,
[00:35:47.740 --> 00:35:51.380]   run from sin and towards community.
[00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:53.920]   But actually listen to them.
[00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:55.780]   Don't do what David did.
[00:35:55.780 --> 00:35:57.940]   He had one of his boys being like,
[00:35:57.940 --> 00:36:01.160]   hey, King, I don't think that woman is for you
[00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:02.060]   to have sex with.
[00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:03.980]   And he said, go and get her.
[00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:05.820]   I want what I want.
[00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:07.680]   I want what I want.
[00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:09.780]   Do what I want.
[00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:12.740]   And I think this is why a lot of us have problems
[00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:15.920]   letting people speak into our dating decisions
[00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:18.240]   or who we date or how we date.
[00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:19.740]   This is why we don't like people telling us
[00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:21.260]   that we should probably get off social media
[00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:24.940]   because it's causing anxiety or us falling to sexual sin.
[00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:26.340]   This is probably why we don't like people saying,
[00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:28.100]   hey, you shouldn't live alone,
[00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:29.780]   or hey, you should move to Dallas
[00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:31.200]   to get around more community.
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:35.340]   We actually don't like running to community because why?
[00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:39.260]   We go to people to get validated, not corrected.
[00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:42.620]   We want people to simply validate
[00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:45.380]   what we've already decided we're going to do.
[00:36:45.380 --> 00:36:49.260]   We like people who will say, whatever makes you happy.
[00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:53.020]   Because that's what the world does.
[00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:56.580]   We want people who are gonna pat us on the back
[00:36:56.580 --> 00:36:59.600]   and tell us everything we want to hear.
[00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:03.180]   But that's not what you need.
[00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:04.480]   You need this guy in your life.
[00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:08.220]   You need people who will lovingly seek to challenge
[00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:11.620]   and correct you with compassion and care
[00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:13.100]   because they love you
[00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:16.320]   and they have your best interests in mind.
[00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:18.660]   That's the kind of people you need around you.
[00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:22.020]   You need soldiers in the battle with you.
[00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:26.420]   A man who goes to war by himself is sure to fall,
[00:37:26.420 --> 00:37:29.140]   but there is strength in numbers.
[00:37:29.140 --> 00:37:31.500]   There is strength in the pack.
[00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:33.240]   It's he who is isolated
[00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:36.480]   that the prowling lion seeks to devour.
[00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:38.880]   He knows if I can get them alone,
[00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:39.760]   that is when I can attack.
[00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:41.600]   You've all seen National Geographic.
[00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:45.240]   And now the wolves wait for the baby gazelle
[00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:48.880]   to get just far enough away from its mother and attack.
[00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:53.880]   Or now the lions wait for the sick elephant or something
[00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:56.820]   and attack.
[00:37:56.820 --> 00:38:01.160]   The Bible says that the enemy is like a roaring lion
[00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:02.940]   seeking someone to devour.
[00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:05.140]   He is prowling, waiting for the person
[00:38:05.140 --> 00:38:08.740]   who would rather run to their sin than to their community.
[00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:10.780]   And that's when he attacks.
[00:38:10.780 --> 00:38:13.580]   He who is alone is sure to fall.
[00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:16.940]   I think about all those videos back in the day
[00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:19.500]   where people are soldiers even today in war movies
[00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:21.460]   when they're back to back with their guns.
[00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:23.060]   Like, got my six.
[00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:25.100]   They're going all around like this.
[00:38:25.100 --> 00:38:26.660]   We need that.
[00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:29.700]   We need people who will recognize our blind spots
[00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:31.320]   that we can't see.
[00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:33.360]   We need people who will see our patterns and go,
[00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:36.840]   hey, hey, every time you go out with them,
[00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:39.040]   you gotta get a call the next morning.
[00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:41.160]   Is this a good idea?
[00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:45.040]   Hey, I haven't heard about your prayer life
[00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:48.320]   or your time in God's word, what's going on.
[00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:52.000]   But instead, we want people who will simply validate us,
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.200]   not correct and challenge us.
[00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:58.600]   And the result, we run to sin and not towards the Lord.
[00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:02.700]   We have to do what it takes to fight sin
[00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:05.200]   because sin will fight us.
[00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:07.340]   We have to do what it takes to make war against sin
[00:39:07.340 --> 00:39:09.620]   because there's a war coming for us.
[00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:11.400]   Ephesians six tells us that we don't battle
[00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:12.860]   against flesh and blood.
[00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:14.720]   We battle against a cosmic force,
[00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:18.360]   a dark power who is coming to steal, kill, and destroy
[00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:20.460]   and take your life.
[00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:23.320]   And oftentimes how he does that is how he did it with David
[00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:25.020]   through one decision.
[00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:26.600]   It was just one decision.
[00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:27.840]   You maybe have done it so many times,
[00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:29.520]   but this one time you got caught
[00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:31.200]   or this one time they got pregnant
[00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:33.480]   or this one time it led to an abortion that hurt,
[00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:35.040]   this one time it led to abuse
[00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:37.640]   and it went further than you ever thought it would.
[00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:38.800]   I don't know what it was for you,
[00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:40.400]   but you were convinced on the front end,
[00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:41.840]   it was minimized and you were told,
[00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:44.000]   hey, it's just one sin, it's just one thing,
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:44.960]   don't worry about it.
[00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:48.300]   And on the back end, it caused so much destruction.
[00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:54.120]   That's why we must run to community when we battle sin.
[00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:56.640]   You can not battle alone.
[00:39:57.640 --> 00:39:59.440]   I wanna close with this.
[00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:02.720]   Why does this matter?
[00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:06.960]   Some of you might think right now this is just ridiculous.
[00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:09.340]   Another Christian guy telling you it's just
[00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:11.760]   to stop having sex and to save yourself
[00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:13.800]   and all these different things.
[00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:15.160]   And you're like, man, this is so dated
[00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:16.460]   and this is so irrelevant.
[00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:19.640]   Why are y'all so passionate about this?
[00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:20.960]   Why do y'all talk about porn all the time
[00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:23.660]   and hookup culture and all these things all the time?
[00:40:23.660 --> 00:40:25.960]   That bucket's full of it.
[00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:30.880]   Of people acknowledging, man, this brings so much hurt,
[00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:32.260]   so much hurt.
[00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:35.620]   Like it did David.
[00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:37.520]   He didn't just get her pregnant.
[00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:40.840]   If you know the story, after that moment,
[00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:44.680]   he has to go on and take Uriah, her husband,
[00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:47.160]   off the battlefield, so now his sin is affecting
[00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:49.280]   his fellow soldier, it's affecting,
[00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:51.760]   your sin affects more people than just you.
[00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:54.000]   Like it did Uriah, he takes him off the battleground
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   and he says, hey, get drunk and sleep with your wife
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.240]   'cause he's trying to hide up the fact
[00:40:57.240 --> 00:40:59.000]   that he slept with his wife.
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.320]   But Uriah's a man of integrity and he won't sleep
[00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:04.820]   with his wife because his boys are back at battle.
[00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:07.640]   He says it's not right.
[00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:09.800]   And so David ends up having to send Uriah
[00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:12.680]   to the front lines of the war to be killed
[00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:14.320]   to cover up his sin.
[00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:16.000]   It was so much more than just a decision.
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.400]   It was so much more than just a one-night stand
[00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:22.600]   because after this, the baby ended up not even living.
[00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:27.320]   And as you read the rest of the life of a man
[00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:29.200]   who was a man after God's own heart,
[00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:31.280]   who was marked by courageous faith,
[00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:32.680]   you see that the rest of his life,
[00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:34.180]   David was just never the same.
[00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:39.460]   He walked with a limp the rest of his life.
[00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:44.000]   And although his sin did not define him
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:47.600]   like we learned last week, his sin did not define him.
[00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:52.600]   However, it brought a lot of unnecessary pain
[00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:56.600]   and consequences on his life.
[00:41:56.600 --> 00:42:01.920]   Your sin today as a single young adult,
[00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:05.980]   six months into marriage, as a single young adult,
[00:42:05.980 --> 00:42:10.280]   your decisions today are affecting your marriage
[00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:11.540]   if that's what God has for you.
[00:42:11.540 --> 00:42:13.560]   It's affecting your parenting
[00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:14.800]   if that's what God has for you.
[00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:16.840]   It's affecting your future generation
[00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:18.340]   of grandkids and grandkids.
[00:42:18.340 --> 00:42:21.200]   The decisions you make today matter.
[00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:25.160]   One of the ways that mine have been affected,
[00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:27.520]   when I, one of the reasons why I was so afraid to get married
[00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:29.880]   is because my past is just riddled
[00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:31.880]   with sexual brokenness and sexual sin.
[00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:34.480]   And one of the reasons why I was always afraid
[00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:36.520]   to speak on stage is 'cause I never wanted
[00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:37.760]   to tell anyone about that.
[00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:40.300]   So I always thought, well, if I speak on stage,
[00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:41.840]   I'm gonna be a fraud.
[00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:45.800]   And it wasn't until finally I opened up for the first time
[00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:49.560]   and I began to experience freedom from shame and guilt
[00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:53.120]   from my past and learning that Jesus came down
[00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:55.240]   and died a sinner's death on a cross
[00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:58.440]   and he hung my sexual sin to the cross.
[00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:02.200]   And he was buried in a grave, in a tomb.
[00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:03.280]   He rose again.
[00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:06.280]   He brought victory over my sin.
[00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:09.760]   And because of that, the old passed away
[00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:11.980]   and I was a brand new man.
[00:43:11.980 --> 00:43:19.480]   But even still, riddled with reminders of my past,
[00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:23.320]   afraid to be known, especially by a woman.
[00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:27.920]   When I met Jenna, my now wife, I was like,
[00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:32.440]   oh my gosh, I am so afraid 'cause I'm really into this girl.
[00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:34.080]   And if you've actually ever been vulnerable
[00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:36.160]   with someone that you really care about,
[00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:39.280]   it's so scary because you're like,
[00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:41.280]   man, I'm gonna give this piece of myself to you
[00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:43.720]   and you could like really mess me up.
[00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:45.760]   Like you could break up with me
[00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:47.720]   and like, that's gonna really hurt.
[00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:51.040]   And so I remember when we were dating,
[00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:55.200]   I was like, all right, I'm gonna tell her about all my past
[00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:59.200]   and see how she responds because if she can't accept
[00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:01.680]   like what Jesus has done in my life and change,
[00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:03.200]   like I can't marry this girl.
[00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:05.580]   Like I have to marry someone who sees me as new,
[00:44:05.580 --> 00:44:06.420]   but what if she doesn't?
[00:44:06.420 --> 00:44:07.360]   I really like her.
[00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:08.200]   I shouldn't tell her?
[00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:09.160]   No, I shouldn't.
[00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:13.000]   Going back and forth, I remember being so nervous
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:16.200]   and we sat down for dinner and I could like barely eat.
[00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:18.880]   I don't think I ate a bite actually.
[00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:21.580]   And I sat down and I was like, okay, I just gotta talk.
[00:44:21.580 --> 00:44:27.260]   And I began to let her in to all of my past
[00:44:27.260 --> 00:44:30.400]   and my sexual sins and struggles and brokenness.
[00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:35.000]   And she's listening and she's listening, she's nodding.
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:38.320]   And I'm like, oh my gosh, what's she about to say?
[00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:42.700]   And I finished tears streaming down my face saying,
[00:44:42.700 --> 00:44:44.880]   this is me.
[00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:48.360]   I'm new in Christ, but this is all of me.
[00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:51.860]   And she looked at me and she said something
[00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:53.000]   I'll never forget.
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   She said, thank you for trusting me with who you were.
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:03.280]   I'm not really worried about that man.
[00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:05.080]   What I wanna know is who is the man
[00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:06.520]   sitting across from me today?
[00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:12.860]   And what does this stuff look like to this man today?
[00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:18.240]   And it was like, wow.
[00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:19.520]   And why did it feel like that?
[00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:22.360]   Because in that moment I felt free.
[00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:24.640]   Because I'm like, who I am today is not a man
[00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:27.200]   who's defined by his sexual sin.
[00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:32.380]   And the last step to battling sin is to respond rightly.
[00:45:32.380 --> 00:45:35.120]   Respond rightly.
[00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:41.160]   When you fall, when you are tempted,
[00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:45.520]   your proper response is to run to the cross.
[00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:48.320]   For it is sufficient to meet your every need.
[00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:50.720]   Whether you're tempted by sin
[00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:52.360]   or whether you have given in to sin,
[00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:54.120]   the cross is your solution.
[00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:56.800]   And I think the reason why I was so afraid
[00:45:56.800 --> 00:45:59.160]   to bring my sin to Jinnah was because deep down
[00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:00.840]   there's something in me that's still afraid
[00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:02.680]   of my sin with God.
[00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:05.000]   I come before him and I confess what I've messed up
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:06.280]   or what I've looked at or what I've done.
[00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:08.220]   And I'm thinking, what's he thinking?
[00:46:08.220 --> 00:46:09.060]   What's he thinking?
[00:46:09.060 --> 00:46:10.000]   What's he thinking?
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:14.040]   And just like Jinnah reminded me of the gospel,
[00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:16.520]   hey, thank you for informing me of the old man.
[00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:18.980]   Who's the new man that I'll be dating?
[00:46:18.980 --> 00:46:24.440]   God is saying to you tonight, hey, that's who you were,
[00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:26.560]   but that's not who I see.
[00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:28.040]   That's not who you are.
[00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:32.280]   Therefore, remember who you are and what you're called to do.
[00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:35.640]   Recognize where you're susceptible.
[00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:39.080]   Resist the urge and choose me.
[00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:43.120]   And in the face of temptation, run to community
[00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:45.000]   and respond rightly.
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:49.360]   And if you do, watch how your battle
[00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:51.120]   against sexual sin will change.
[00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:54.720]   God is not done with you.
[00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:56.400]   God is not done with us.
[00:46:56.400 --> 00:47:01.360]   God wants to rewrite sexuality
[00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:03.800]   and all of these things with this generation
[00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:06.120]   who wanna trust him with his design, starting with us.
[00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:07.320]   In this room, I believe it.
[00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:09.080]   I believe if we do this again next year,
[00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:12.400]   we can see things change,
[00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:15.600]   but you've gotta be willing to fight the battle well.
[00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:18.960]   And if you do, it'll affect everything.
[00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:20.160]   It'll change everything.
[00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:21.360]   If you'll trust God with this,
[00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:24.000]   it'll change everything about your future marriage,
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:26.680]   your future singleness, your future parenting,
[00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:28.120]   all of these things.
[00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:32.440]   But it has to start with the right response,
[00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:35.000]   coming to him, trusting him with wherever you're at
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:36.960]   on the spectrum of this message.
[00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:38.360]   I pray you will.
[00:47:38.360 --> 00:47:39.200]   Let's pray.
[00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:47.040]   God, this is heavy.
[00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:51.240]   And sometimes it can feel like,
[00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:53.200]   man, we don't even know where to begin.
[00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:56.280]   And so I just pray right now, spirit,
[00:47:56.280 --> 00:47:58.280]   that you would come and you would meet
[00:47:58.280 --> 00:48:00.080]   every need of the person in the room.
[00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:02.480]   For the person who is feeling bound
[00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:04.120]   by something sexual tonight,
[00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:06.880]   would you just show them which part of the process
[00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:07.720]   you want them to take?
[00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:09.560]   And it might just be to respond to you,
[00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:13.480]   to your grace and to your kindness and to your mercy
[00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:15.200]   that is readily available to them.
[00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:17.400]   If it's a person going,
[00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:21.560]   man, in the face of sexual urges and desires,
[00:48:21.560 --> 00:48:23.280]   I've ran to my sin and not from it.
[00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:24.400]   Would you give them the strength?
[00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:28.360]   Would you show them that you are ready to resist?
[00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:31.680]   God, I don't know.
[00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:32.640]   You just, you know.
[00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:34.440]   You know everything going on in this room.
[00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:35.480]   And I pray right now,
[00:48:35.480 --> 00:48:37.720]   if there's anyone feeling condemnation,
[00:48:37.720 --> 00:48:40.920]   if there's anyone feeling like you're angry,
[00:48:40.920 --> 00:48:45.480]   would they feel your gentleness in this song?
[00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:48.600]   Would they feel your desire
[00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:50.760]   not to go and perform differently,
[00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:55.760]   but to remember whose they are in you
[00:48:55.760 --> 00:48:57.320]   and the calling that they have on their life
[00:48:57.320 --> 00:48:58.720]   because of what you've done?
[00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:01.400]   Because we are free,
[00:49:01.400 --> 00:49:03.440]   because our sexual sin doesn't define us,
[00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:06.000]   we respond now in worship.
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:08.960]   It's in your name that I pray, amen.
