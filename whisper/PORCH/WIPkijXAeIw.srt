1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,420
 (rock music)

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:23,340
 - Tribute to Jimi Hendrix or something.

3
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:24,180
 How we doing?

4
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:25,020
 (audience cheering)

5
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:26,340
 Come on.

6
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,060
 Welcome to the porch.

7
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:32,500
 So glad you're here, Fort Worth, Houston, around the world.

8
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,780
 We're glad you're tuned in with us this evening.

9
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:37,580
 My name is JP and I have the privilege

10
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:39,380
 of diving into God's word with you.

11
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:41,980
 And recently, so like last week,

12
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:44,700
 this friend of mine gave me a Nest.

13
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:45,740
 You guys know what these are?

14
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:48,500
 Like the smart thermostat.

15
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,220
 Anybody have one?

16
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:52,000
 Dude, they're amazing.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,700
 They're so cool 'cause they save you money

18
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,340
 and they like know when you're home and when you're not

19
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,300
 and it like adjusts the temperature,

20
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,980
 the climate of your house and it's pretty incredible.

21
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:02,300
 So there's a shout out for Nest.

22
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:04,940
 But so he gives me one and he's like,

23
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:07,060
 hey, we can install it in your house.

24
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:08,420
 It will take about 15 minutes.

25
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:10,580
 And so I called him, you know,

26
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:14,220
 I guess it was like last Thursday and he comes over

27
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,420
 and so it took me about 15 minutes

28
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:18,340
 to find the screwdriver, okay?

29
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:19,860
 And so then like another 15 minutes

30
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,300
 to remove the first screw.

31
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,380
 And then about 45 minutes later,

32
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:27,140
 like I had unplugged these five wires to my old thermostat

33
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:28,740
 and had hooked up the five wire,

34
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:29,980
 which is just dangerous, let's agree,

35
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:32,740
 but I had hooked up the five wires to the new thermostat

36
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:34,860
 and I'm excited and we like,

37
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,860
 you program it to your internet,

38
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:38,860
 like you have to put in your WiFi password

39
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:39,860
 and all that, it's amazing.

40
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:44,460
 And then I'm getting this error message.

41
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,500
 Like it's not working.

42
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:50,340
 And he had said early on, hey, we should flip the breaker.

43
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,180
 Like we should turn off,

44
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,640
 You're supposed to turn off the breaker before you do this.

45
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,300
 But I had already touched the wires

46
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,140
 and they didn't shock me,

47
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:58,460
 so I'm like, low voltage wires, it'll be fine.

48
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:00,420
 And as we're hooking it up,

49
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,140
 and we like Google the error message

50
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:04,540
 and we can't figure out what's going on,

51
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,180
 and so we call customer service.

52
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,820
 It's about, let's see, so it's about 10 p.m. at this point.

53
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,300
 We're on the phone with customer service.

54
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,100
 They're like, okay, let's troubleshoot this,

55
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:16,020
 which has me running back and forth to the breaker box.

56
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,180
 Flip the breaker, flip it on, flip it off, flip it on.

57
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,500
 Move this wire, plug it here, plug it here, plug it here.

58
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,740
 And I'm just trying to figure out

59
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:24,440
 why this thing's not working.

60
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:29,440
 And lo and behold, so about 11.15 p.m.,

61
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,020
 I'm on the phone with customer service.

62
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,900
 We've escalated to tier two.

63
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:36,500
 And I've got to get up at 5.45 a.m. the next morning.

64
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,700
 So I'm like, okay, buddy, I need you to level with me.

65
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,780
 Like, how much longer will this take?

66
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:43,180
 Like, 'cause man, I've got to go to bed.

67
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:44,580
 And how sure are you that you're actually

68
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:45,660
 gonna be able to fix this problem?

69
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,260
 And he's like, man, it's gonna take me

70
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:50,020
 about 20 more minutes of troubleshooting.

71
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,380
 And then I'll just be able to tell you

72
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,220
 what's wrong with it.

73
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:54,580
 I don't know that we'll actually be able to fix it.

74
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:55,700
 And I'm like, okay, peace out.

75
00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:00,700
 So basically, I undo that one.

76
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,660
 And I unplug the five wires.

77
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,660
 I get my old thermostat.

78
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:07,220
 I'm like, hey, we have to go back to where we started.

79
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,980
 And we'll pick this up some other day.

80
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,860
 But I've got to go to sleep, got to catch some Zs.

81
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:15,500
 And so put the old one back up.

82
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,900
 And it doesn't work.

83
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,820
 You know, an irony of ironies,

84
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,780
 there's another family staying with us this night

85
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,780
 because their AC was out.

86
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:29,380
 How hysterical, how hilarious is that?

87
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,380
 And so they're staying with us

88
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,540
 because their AC didn't work.

89
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,700
 And now, and this is like after Monica said,

90
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,100
 why do you have to do this so late?

91
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:36,940
 And I wouldn't do this.

92
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,540
 And so like, she's like biting her tongue

93
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,180
 from the big, I told you so.

94
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:43,460
 And now the old thermostat doesn't work either.

95
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:47,140
 Turns out what had happened was,

96
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:49,820
 because I didn't flip the breakers early on,

97
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:54,820
 I actually shorted out my main AC unit, okay?

98
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:58,500
 Yeah, yeah.

99
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:06,380
 I destroyed the very thing I was trying to make better.

100
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:12,340
 And as you think about why, it's because, two reasons.

101
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:17,020
 One, because I had missed some key instruction early on.

102
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:20,780
 I overlooked out of convenience

103
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:23,980
 some very important instruction early on.

104
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:26,500
 And not only that, but I misunderstood the consequences.

105
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,100
 I thought, oh, you want me to flip the breaker

106
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,100
 so I don't get shocked.

107
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,340
 No, I want you to flip the breaker

108
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,940
 so you don't have to spend hundreds of dollars

109
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,380
 repairing your AC.

110
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:38,580
 Oh, so I just misunderstood the consequences.

111
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,820
 And we ended up in a hot mess.

112
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,660
 And as, thank you.

113
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,900
 And as I think about that,

114
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:50,220
 and as I think about that, and I look at our country,

115
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:54,260
 I'm asking this about our country.

116
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:57,460
 How did we end up in this hot mess?

117
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:00,460
 How did we get here?

118
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,900
 This is crazy.

119
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:06,020
 The most controversial election of all time.

120
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:08,460
 We're moving toward the date where we vote.

121
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:12,100
 Most of us are discouraged, scratching our head,

122
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,380
 not knowing what to do.

123
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,020
 Some of us are very opinionated.

124
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,740
 We think we have the right answer.

125
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:17,980
 And we figured it out.

126
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:21,220
 And so we're very vocal and we're just kind of discouraged.

127
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,740
 How did we get in this hot mess?

128
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:27,740
 And I think it's because we missed some key instructions.

129
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:32,820
 And we've misunderstood the consequences,

130
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:36,060
 specifically this generation, our generation,

131
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,060
 your and my generation.

132
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,980
 Call us millennials if you please.

133
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:44,140
 But I think we've made some mistakes.

134
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:47,700
 See, last year, marriage, an institution invented by God,

135
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,580
 was redefined for the first time since creation.

136
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:56,140
 We almost lost our religious liberty.

137
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,900
 Our right to bear arms came under fire.

138
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,740
 A mother's right to end the life of her child in the womb

139
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,980
 is the holocaust of our day.

140
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:05,660
 And our options for presidents are less than desirable.

141
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:10,660
 We have a narcissistic reality TV star billionaire

142
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:13,540
 and the wife of an adulterous man

143
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,380
 considered by some to be a criminal.

144
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:20,540
 And the biggest concern among millennials

145
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,780
 is global warming.

146
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:24,540
 I'm serious.

147
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:28,300
 And I'm not saying global warming's not important.

148
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,300
 Like we should certainly preserve this earth.

149
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,800
 God has called us to.

150
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,640
 But how did we get into this hot mess?

151
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,580
 And I want to kind of tell you,

152
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,140
 I want to lead with what I think it is.

153
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,300
 It's very interesting.

154
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,540
 I hope you'll hang in there with me.

155
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:43,180
 I think it has to do with one of the greatest desires

156
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:45,140
 in the room this evening.

157
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,060
 Sex.

158
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:53,060
 I think that a huge part of our government's problem

159
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:58,500
 actually has to do with sex, how we want it,

160
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,660
 whenever we want it, wherever we want it,

161
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:04,300
 however we want it, without consequences.

162
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,620
 And when I say we, I mean us.

163
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,820
 Like you and me, those of us here,

164
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:11,620
 our generation, this demographic.

165
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:12,940
 And so this evening we're talking about

166
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,700
 how sex has impacted government

167
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,100
 and why it should matter to us.

168
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:20,620
 And I know that our desire is to express love physically

169
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,140
 with whomever we want.

170
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:26,360
 And we want to avoid the consequences.

171
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,980
 And I think it's caused some of our political issues,

172
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:34,760
 especially on the topic of the redefinition of marriage

173
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:38,740
 that occurred on our watch on April 28th, 2015,

174
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,220
 and the topic of abortion.

175
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,780
 That honestly I'm encouraged

176
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,740
 because I think we millennials

177
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,700
 are actually taking ground on it.

178
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,580
 So listen, let me give this disclaimer up front.

179
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:48,940
 Stay with me, hang in there.

180
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:52,380
 You think you know what I'm gonna say, okay?

181
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:57,060
 I understand generally who I am speaking to.

182
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:01,700
 I have given my entire adult life

183
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:05,140
 to ministering to and through millennials

184
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:08,540
 at a cost to me for the love of you.

185
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,820
 And the reason I have done so is for three reasons.

186
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:14,020
 Number one, because I trusted Christ

187
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:16,500
 as a young adult in my 20s.

188
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,380
 I came into a relationship with Jesus Christ

189
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,820
 and it changed everything about my life.

190
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:23,660
 Number two, second reason,

191
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:26,140
 because I think you are the single most powerful demographic

192
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,260
 on the face of the planet.

193
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:30,460
 If anyone is going to change the world or save the world,

194
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:32,900
 it is going to be God working through you.

195
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:39,260
 And number three, because the majority of your peers

196
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:43,700
 are following their feelings

197
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:48,060
 and doing what they think is wise in their own eyes

198
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,980
 and they're leaving the church

199
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:53,460
 and abandoning a biblical worldview in droves

200
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,100
 and I believe it will hurt them

201
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,420
 and I believe it will hurt you and I love you

202
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:01,100
 and I don't want you to hurt, so I need you to listen.

203
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:04,820
 Please, I'm asking you this courtesy, this favor.

204
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:09,460
 Please listen to me for the next 35 minutes.

205
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,180
 Give me 35 minutes of your life.

206
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,900
 Some of you will disagree with me,

207
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,340
 some of you will hate me,

208
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:17,680
 some of you will be very, very angry.

209
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:23,280
 Please give me 35 minutes, hang in with me 'til the end

210
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:26,060
 and you can strengthen your argument against me

211
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:28,620
 if you'd like.

212
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,580
 If you agree with what I'm saying,

213
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:33,620
 you can strengthen your argument with what I'm saying.

214
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:36,140
 You may agree with half and disagree with the other half.

215
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,340
 I don't know where you're at,

216
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:40,180
 but I wanna talk to those of you in the room

217
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,660
 that just don't care

218
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:47,780
 because I don't think you can be a follower of Jesus Christ

219
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:51,700
 and not care about these issues.

220
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:55,300
 And so you're the ones I'm most

221
00:09:55,300 --> 00:10:01,380
 desiring to speak to tonight and if you disagree,

222
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,780
 I just ask you the courtesy to write down the things

223
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,740
 that you disagree with and then let's engage

224
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,560
 in a discussion.

225
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,060
 I'd love the opportunity to learn from you.

226
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:12,340
 I'll stay as late as I need to.

227
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:15,780
 I'll schedule other meetings, I'll take phone calls,

228
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:16,960
 I'll read emails.

229
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:20,480
 I would love the opportunity to learn from you.

230
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,660
 Thank you.

231
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:27,720
 And so tonight we're gonna talk about two things done,

232
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,140
 two things we've done wrong

233
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:33,180
 and what I believe is the solution.

234
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:35,260
 Specifically how we've overlooked instruction,

235
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:38,080
 how we've misunderstood the consequences

236
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,660
 and what we need to do now.

237
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:43,860
 Abraham Lincoln said, "We are a government of the people,

238
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,700
 "for the people, by the people."

239
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,260
 Here's what that means.

240
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:52,200
 The government should do whatever is in the best interest

241
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,620
 of the people.

242
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:58,300
 And we may disagree what that is,

243
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,500
 but I thank you ahead of time for listening.

244
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,660
 And so the first point this evening is we've overlooked

245
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,420
 God's clear instruction.

246
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,780
 We've overlooked God's clear instruction.

247
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,900
 Do you remember when I shorted out that AC?

248
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,500
 It's because I missed this one simple instruction

249
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,520
 that I was to flip off the breaker

250
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,020
 and I thought it wasn't an important instruction

251
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:20,500
 and it led to grave consequences.

252
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,000
 And so what we've done as a generation is we fed

253
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,860
 our preferences over God's truth.

254
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:28,420
 We followed our heart and sought out our own desires

255
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:32,560
 and we've considered his truth an inconvenience,

256
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,800
 like taking time to flip a breaker.

257
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,600
 James chapter one, verse 21 says,

258
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,220
 "Therefore get rid of all moral filth and the evil

259
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:42,720
 "that is so prevalent and humbly accept the word of God

260
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,560
 "planted in you, which can save you.

261
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,320
 "Do not merely listen to the word and so deceive yourself.

262
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,080
 "Do what it says."

263
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:53,280
 Anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says

264
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,840
 is like someone who looks at his face in a mirror

265
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,120
 and after looking at himself goes away

266
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,900
 and immediately forgets what he looks like.

267
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,060
 Here's what James means.

268
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:03,200
 Jesus' brother's writing this and he's saying,

269
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,760
 hey, if you read the word of God

270
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,960
 and you don't make a change,

271
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,360
 it's like you looking in the mirror,

272
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,180
 seeing your hair all disheveled,

273
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,600
 seeing something on your face

274
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,080
 and walking away without making a change.

275
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,720
 The word of God is meant to change you,

276
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,720
 to conform you to the image and the character

277
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,020
 of his son Jesus Christ.

278
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:21,280
 But whoever looks intently into the perfect law

279
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,640
 that gives freedom and continues in it,

280
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,600
 not forgetting what they have heard but doing it,

281
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,240
 they will be blessed in what they do.

282
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,200
 And so primarily when our generation,

283
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,080
 yours and my generation is trying to figure out

284
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,520
 what is right, we don't follow James' instructions.

285
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,320
 We don't turn to God's word.

286
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,240
 We don't open the scriptures and say,

287
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,800
 God, what would you have for me?

288
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,120
 We follow our feelings and our opinions.

289
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:51,840
 Even when this issue of redefining marriage came up,

290
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:55,120
 we said this is about love.

291
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,880
 I wanna make a case that it's actually about sex.

292
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,720
 See, God doesn't have an issue with who you love.

293
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,960
 But any sexual act, listen closely,

294
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:09,360
 is condemned in the scriptures when it is not

295
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,000
 between a married husband and wife.

296
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,960
 I'll give you some scriptures.

297
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,680
 Leviticus 18, verse 22 says,

298
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,480
 do not have sexual relations with a man

299
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,960
 as one does with a woman.

300
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,960
 That is detestable.

301
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,440
 And you could argue that this is abolished with the law

302
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,560
 and this is the Old Testament law,

303
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,120
 but it's brought back up in the New Testament.

304
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,560
 First Corinthians chapter six, verse nine,

305
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,320
 or do you not know that wrongdoers

306
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,640
 will not inherit the kingdom of God,

307
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,640
 do not be deceived neither sexual and moral,

308
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,960
 nor idolaters, nor adulterers,

309
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,080
 nor men who have sex with men.

310
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,280
 You may say that word means something else.

311
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:42,200
 There is no theological credible scholarship

312
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,080
 that would support you in that view.

313
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,480
 That word can only mean,

314
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,040
 it's two words actually in the Greek,

315
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,160
 that can only mean men having sex with men.

316
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,720
 It's consensual, it's not rape.

317
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,960
 This was written to a homoerotic class

318
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,160
 or homoerotic culture much more than ours.

319
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,840
 The president of the time, the emperor, had two gay lovers.

320
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,760
 First Timothy chapter one, verse 10 says,

321
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,760
 we also know that the law is made not for the righteous,

322
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,280
 but for the lawbreakers and rebels,

323
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:11,000
 the ungodly and the sinful, the unholy and irreligious.

324
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,680
 For those who kill their fathers or mothers or murderers,

325
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,200
 for the sexually immoral,

326
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,400
 for those practicing homosexuality.

327
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,920
 And then Romans one, I'll get to in a minute,

328
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,440
 but I want you to know something.

329
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:25,160
 All these refer to the pursuit of the sexual act,

330
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,480
 not to the feelings.

331
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:32,360
 It is not sin to be attracted to someone of the same sex.

332
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:37,360
 I'm not gonna argue if you were born that way or not.

333
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,480
 Okay?

334
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,400
 People are born all kinds of ways.

335
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:46,000
 They're all, since Genesis chapter three,

336
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,440
 people are born with all kinds of ways.

337
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,120
 I have all sorts of desires within me

338
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,280
 that are not best for me.

339
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:56,640
 But it's when you take that desire

340
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,040
 and you do something with it

341
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,280
 that clearly goes against what the scripture says,

342
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,680
 you have to ask, what are we doing?

343
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:07,400
 So on our watch, we've allowed the government

344
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,160
 to redefine an institution created by God, marriage,

345
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,600
 to allow for a sinful act that he clearly condemns.

346
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,000
 And so why talk about this?

347
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,080
 Listen, why not talk about pornography tonight

348
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,280
 or heterosexual sin or materialism?

349
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,320
 Can we agree on something?

350
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,000
 Maybe it's your first time at the porch.

351
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,200
 Can we agree that we talk about those issues

352
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,000
 100 times to one?

353
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,520
 Can we agree that every other night you come in here

354
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:32,920
 and I'm talking about materialism or pornography

355
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:36,160
 or fornication or some other issue,

356
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:41,840
 but tonight we're talking about these two issues.

357
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:46,440
 And those issues have not been before the government

358
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,680
 like this one has.

359
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:52,840
 Or this other abomination that is happening on our watch,

360
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:56,000
 mostly among your peers and my peers

361
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,520
 is the issue of abortion.

362
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:06,000
 This is dealing with the perceived consequence of sex.

363
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,200
 Friends, I'm so grieved

364
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:14,840
 by the research that was done on this topic this week.

365
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,520
 My heart is completely broken.

366
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,800
 There are over one million abortions a year

367
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,880
 in the United States of America today.

368
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:27,680
 Yes, today over 2,500 babies were killed

369
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,280
 at the will of their mother today.

370
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,120
 And if you've made this decision,

371
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,280
 I know right now you are so uncomfortable.

372
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,960
 Can I just tell you something?

373
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:39,400
 I know it's a fourth of the women here

374
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,600
 and so many of you men have supported this

375
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,440
 and been a part of it.

376
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,280
 Can I tell you something?

377
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,840
 I love you, God loves you.

378
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,320
 He's not mad at you.

379
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,320
 He sent his son to die for this.

380
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,920
 Okay, he has a plan for you.

381
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,840
 He has a plan for your children.

382
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,160
 He has a plan for this story.

383
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:59,520
 He has a plan for your testimony

384
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,240
 that involved that action in the same way

385
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,080
 that I talk about pornography

386
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:07,240
 and set those engaged in pornography free.

387
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,520
 God working through me,

388
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,560
 you can set those free by telling your story

389
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,840
 no matter how uncomfortable it is.

390
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,640
 And God will use it in tremendous and incredible ways.

391
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,280
 But you've gotta stay with me tonight.

392
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,320
 Do not just get so focused.

393
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,080
 Don't get in your head.

394
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,240
 Stay with me word for word as I progress.

395
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,920
 Don't just get stuck in your head

396
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,480
 and begin to think about the past.

397
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,000
 Look forward, let's look forward together.

398
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 A friend of mine who owned two abortion clinics

399
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,100
 and profited from the death of 40,000 babies

400
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:45,520
 before becoming a Christian was asked,

401
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,340
 "How do you sleep at night?"

402
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:51,580
 And she said, "Well,

403
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:58,060
 "Jesus either died for all of them or none of them,

404
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:02,020
 "and I choose to believe that he died for all of them."

405
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:05,860
 In reality, the Scripture teaches that he did.

406
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:10,220
 And so because we are talking about God's word,

407
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,180
 I need to show you where it says this is wrong.

408
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:14,180
 Essentially anywhere the Bible condemns

409
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:16,260
 killing another human.

410
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,620
 Certainly life begins at conception.

411
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:19,500
 That's been debated.

412
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,660
 Psalm 139, the author of life said

413
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,260
 that he formed you in your mother's womb.

414
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:25,500
 When John the Baptist, that's Psalm 139.

415
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:29,020
 When John the Baptist heard the news of Jesus Christ

416
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:32,100
 in the womb of Elizabeth, he leapt, leaped.

417
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,300
 That's Luke chapter one, verse 41.

418
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,020
 But then there's this, Exodus 21.

419
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,340
 I'll read it quickly.

420
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:39,180
 Verse 22, "If people are fighting

421
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,540
 "and hit a pregnant woman,"

422
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:42,660
 interesting that here this part of the law

423
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,980
 talks about a pregnant woman,

424
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,540
 "and she gives birth prematurely,

425
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:46,880
 "but there is no serious injury,

426
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,460
 "the offender must be fined

427
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,300
 "whatever the woman's husband demands

428
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,500
 "and the court allows.

429
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,560
 "But if there is serious injury,

430
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,980
 "you are to take life for life, eye for eye,

431
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:59,380
 "tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,

432
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:02,280
 "burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise."

433
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:06,700
 God is saying here if you hurt the baby's arm

434
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:09,780
 that he cares and asks for justice.

435
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:15,820
 And the unborn among us, friends, are the least of these.

436
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:18,460
 They cannot defend themselves.

437
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:20,460
 They cannot speak up for themselves.

438
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,540
 They cannot address injustices against them.

439
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:24,140
 They cannot march, they cannot cry,

440
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:25,700
 they cannot do these things.

441
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,660
 And Jesus says in Matthew 25, verse 45,

442
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,480
 "Truly I tell you, whatever you did not do

443
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:32,280
 "for one of the least of these, you did not do for me."

444
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:37,580
 Kathy Ireland, a now pro-life advocate,

445
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,860
 was interviewed by someone and just said,

446
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,940
 "Are we sure it's a life in there?

447
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:45,780
 "I just don't know that we can be sure

448
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:48,540
 "that's a human in there."

449
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:53,080
 And she responded, "Let me ask you a question.

450
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,820
 "If you are going to tear down a building

451
00:19:55,820 --> 00:20:00,480
 "and before you hit the button releasing the explosives,

452
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,940
 "or before you swung the wrecking ball,

453
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:05,580
 "someone said, 'I think there might be a life in there,'

454
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:08,460
 "would you move forward?

455
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:11,020
 "Or would you search that building top to bottom,

456
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:14,780
 "making sure there was not a life in there?"

457
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:18,700
 It is a scientific fact that every abortion

458
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,740
 performed in the US is performed on a being

459
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:23,300
 so fully formed that its heart is beating

460
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:26,580
 and its brain activity can be measured on a EEG machine.

461
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:30,860
 We must stop defending this heinous crime against God

462
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:32,940
 and do everything within our power to put an end

463
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,580
 to this Holocaust in our midst.

464
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:39,540
 And if you've had an abortion, and I know many of you have,

465
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:42,180
 you know firsthand how it impacts more than the baby,

466
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:45,220
 and your story is powerful.

467
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,200
 Please tell it.

468
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:51,460
 I think one of the reasons that we would engage

469
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:54,980
 in these activities against the word of God

470
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:58,460
 and the will of God is because we've misunderstood

471
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,060
 the consequences.

472
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,540
 That's my second point this evening,

473
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:03,780
 is that we have misunderstood the consequences.

474
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:08,460
 See, when I didn't get shocked by installing that thermostat

475
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:10,540
 I thought that I had avoided the consequences.

476
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:13,260
 In reality, the consequences came much later

477
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:17,140
 and they were costlier and they were more uncomfortable

478
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,880
 than I could have imagined.

479
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,440
 And so friends, we are sitting in the consequences

480
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,700
 of the pursuit of sexual freedom

481
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,220
 and our efforts to avoid the consequences.

482
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:31,420
 Our sexual freedom has cost us actual freedom.

483
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:34,300
 We have celebrated the consequences.

484
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,940
 Let me read to you from Romans one.

485
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:38,660
 David started it two weeks ago.

486
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,700
 He ended here in verse 25.

487
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,540
 I'll recap verse 24 and 25.

488
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:44,060
 "Therefore God gave them over,"

489
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:47,160
 talking about his judgment, his wrath on a nation,

490
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,980
 "gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts

491
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:52,860
 "to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies

492
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:53,820
 "with one another."

493
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:56,480
 They exchanged the truth about God for a lie.

494
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,500
 They exchanged the truth about God for a lie.

495
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,820
 Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts.

496
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:06,300
 Even their women exchanged natural sexual relations

497
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,000
 for unnatural ones.

498
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,660
 In the same way, the men also abandoned

499
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,380
 natural relationships with women,

500
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,860
 natural relations with women,

501
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:15,220
 and were inflamed with lust for one another.

502
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:17,220
 Men committed shameful acts with other men

503
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:20,580
 and received in themselves the due penalty for their error.

504
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:23,320
 "Furthermore, just as they did not think it worthwhile

505
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,620
 "to retain the knowledge of God,

506
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:27,460
 "so God gave them over to a depraved mind

507
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:30,940
 "so that they do what ought not to be done.

508
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:34,660
 "They have become filled with every kind of wickedness,

509
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:37,380
 "evil, greed, and depravity.

510
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:40,980
 "They are full of envy and murder and strife

511
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:43,160
 "and deceit and malice.

512
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:46,500
 "Their gossips, slanders, God-haters,

513
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,520
 "insolent, arrogant, and boastful.

514
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,100
 "They invent ways of doing evil.

515
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,480
 "They disobey their parents.

516
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,820
 "They have no understanding, no fidelity,

517
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:55,780
 "no love, no mercy.

518
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,860
 "Although they know God's righteous decrees

519
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:00,260
 "that those who do such things deserve death."

520
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,260
 Listen, listen.

521
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:04,400
 "They not only continue to do these very things,

522
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,680
 "but also approve of those who practice them."

523
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:12,020
 They approve of those who practice them.

524
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:14,620
 This is an indictment on our generation.

525
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:17,660
 This is an indictment on millennials.

526
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:25,460
 Why would God care about something like homosexuality?

527
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:29,660
 Because he is a loving God who loves people

528
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:32,540
 and he loves relationships.

529
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:35,740
 And so let me make this point, if I may,

530
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:36,660
 over the next few minutes.

531
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:41,660
 Those who identify as homosexual are 150% more likely

532
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:44,620
 to deal with depression, anxiety, and alcohol

533
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,620
 and substance abuse.

534
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:48,660
 That comes from the American Public Health Association.

535
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:52,180
 The homosexual lifestyle includes a 200% higher rate

536
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,020
 of suicide.

537
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:55,500
 That comes from the American Public Health Association.

538
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,500
 And so some would say, "Well, this is because the church."

539
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,340
 Have you heard that?

540
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,780
 "This is because the church."

541
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:02,020
 It is just absolutely not true

542
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:04,980
 because in Sweden where there is no church,

543
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:08,180
 because in Sweden, the most secularized country

544
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:12,620
 on the planet, okay, it's 300% suicide.

545
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:15,780
 Homosexuality is celebrated in Sweden, okay?

546
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:18,900
 Couples can get married there and live completely

547
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,940
 unpersecuted by the church at all.

548
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,860
 And the suicide rate has increased.

549
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:25,340
 The same in the Netherlands, which has seen higher rates

550
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:27,460
 of depression, bipolar, panic disorder, OCD,

551
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:28,980
 and psychiatric disorders.

552
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:32,820
 The 2005 Oxford Journal of Epidemiology found

553
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:37,820
 that 78% have at least one STD.

554
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:42,140
 The US CDC said that while only 3%

555
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:45,180
 of the American population identifies with homosexuality,

556
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:48,700
 this group is responsible for 50% cases of syphilis,

557
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:53,460
 60% cases of gonorrhea, 90% of gay men report

558
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:55,900
 chronic or recurrent viral infection.

559
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:59,580
 Over 75% of all HIV cases in the last five years

560
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,420
 are among the homosexual community.

561
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:04,380
 Until 1982, AIDS was called GRID,

562
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:06,980
 Gay-Related Immune Deficiency Syndrome.

563
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,060
 And why is this?

564
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:10,540
 Because a man was not designed,

565
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:12,160
 and I'm using that word designed,

566
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,820
 to have sex with another man.

567
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:15,940
 Likewise, with women.

568
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:18,860
 It goes against the creator's desire,

569
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:22,020
 and it is not a political situation,

570
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,700
 it's a spiritual situation.

571
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,940
 You invite in the wrath of God

572
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:28,880
 on an individual in a country, a nation.

573
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:33,900
 You have to hear me out, you have to listen to this.

574
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:44,360
 It's always harmful to go against God's intended purpose.

575
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:48,740
 In 2005, Oxford Journal of Epidemiology,

576
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:52,640
 the American Obituary Report said

577
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,660
 that a practicing homosexual person's life expectancy

578
00:25:55,660 --> 00:26:00,420
 is 20 years shorter than their heterosexual counterpart.

579
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:03,720
 20 years shorter, two decades.

580
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:06,360
 Only 1% of homosexual men die from old age.

581
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:12,500
 And some of this is because the promiscuity

582
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:16,260
 around the LGBTQ community.

583
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:18,340
 In a study in the Journal of Sex Research surveyed

584
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:21,300
 2,583 couples, not a single couple,

585
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:24,960
 not one of the 2,583 sustained a monogamous relationship

586
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,340
 despite being openly married.

587
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:29,820
 The average numbers of partners was between 101 and 500.

588
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,300
 Male couples who identify as gay

589
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:33,020
 are 50% more likely to divorce.

590
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,380
 Couples who identify as lesbians,

591
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:37,740
 167% more likely to divorce.

592
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:39,540
 And so here's what you're saying,

593
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:40,840
 'cause some of you, you're angry right now.

594
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,980
 Listen, you would say

595
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:46,660
 that they should be able to do what they want,

596
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:49,440
 the government shouldn't speak into these such things.

597
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,460
 As someone engages in homosexual activity,

598
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,740
 they are more likely to be anxious,

599
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:54,780
 more likely to be depressed,

600
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:57,260
 more likely to commit suicide, get sick more often,

601
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:59,460
 more likely to be promiscuous and divorced,

602
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:02,540
 and cut 20 years off their life.

603
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:05,400
 And you would say, "In love, I love them."

604
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:09,780
 And I would say, "I love them more than you do."

605
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:13,520
 I've sat with them, I've prayed with them,

606
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,720
 I've wept with them, I've talked with them.

607
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:19,580
 I've read Scripture with them, I've counseled them,

608
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:20,560
 I've listened.

609
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:25,940
 I've been patient, I've heard rebuttals,

610
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:28,480
 I've looked at the facts,

611
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,860
 and I've pleaded the one thing that I can't do is say,

612
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:32,860
 "God would say it's okay, keep doing that.

613
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:35,700
 "God loves you and you're hurting yourself."

614
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:36,660
 And you say, "But I love them,

615
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,100
 "they should have the freedom."

616
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,420
 I love them more.

617
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:45,120
 That's what I am trying to show you.

618
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,180
 God loves them even more than you do.

619
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:53,200
 I don't want them to die 10, two decades earlier.

620
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,100
 Some say it's hate speech, it's not,

621
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,860
 it's the opposite of hate speech.

622
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,940
 The truth sounds like hate to those who hate the truth,

623
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,060
 a friend of mine said.

624
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:07,060
 And if you make same-sex marriage a civil rights issue,

625
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:10,100
 you cannot stop at just same-sex.

626
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:12,460
 As I said earlier, people are sexually attracted

627
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:15,040
 to multiple adults, people are sexually attracted

628
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,660
 to children, people are sexually attracted

629
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:20,660
 to all sorts of things, and so where did their rights end?

630
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:23,460
 Ben Carson, black man, said it well, when he said,

631
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:26,940
 "Do not regard your sin as my skin."

632
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:31,540
 But why do I care what the government does?

633
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:33,720
 It's not a theocracy.

634
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:36,120
 Why should the government speak into this?

635
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:39,900
 You have to understand the role of the government.

636
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:45,860
 It's to reward behaviors that make for a better land.

637
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:49,360
 This is why the government rewards a man and a woman

638
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,620
 staying together in the home.

639
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:52,280
 The longer they stay together in the home,

640
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,780
 the more the government rewards them

641
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:54,960
 with tax benefits and such.

642
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:55,800
 Why?

643
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,020
 Because it is a proven fact that

644
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:00,220
 when there's a mom and a dad in the home,

645
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:02,100
 their kids are less likely to go to prison,

646
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:05,620
 they're less likely to be on government financial assistance

647
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:07,380
 and so it actually helps the government.

648
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:10,260
 The government is doing what is in their best interest.

649
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:14,160
 They actually save money by rewarding this behavior.

650
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:17,380
 It's like if we said, well, we love ice cream,

651
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,420
 we all love ice cream, so the government

652
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:20,700
 should give us free ice cream,

653
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,580
 and the government comes and says, okay, you're right.

654
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:24,220
 Because you all love ice cream,

655
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,840
 you can have all the ice cream you want.

656
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,340
 It's free, it's on us.

657
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:28,940
 All that does is cost the government

658
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:31,740
 and it costs you obesity rates would skyrocket,

659
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:33,920
 people would begin to die earlier,

660
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,460
 and it would not be good for the land.

661
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:37,180
 And I'm not trying to be silly.

662
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:39,460
 I'm trying to show you the government's role

663
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:44,060
 and why it matters on this issue, on these issues.

664
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:46,620
 Friends, emotions have beat out logic on this one.

665
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:49,200
 Emotions.

666
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,580
 As millennials have raised up,

667
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:55,660
 we think we know better than thousands and thousands

668
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,140
 and thousands of years.

669
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:02,220
 Abortion is obviously also not best for the land.

670
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:04,900
 For those who have an abortion,

671
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:08,020
 the suicide rate associated with an abortion

672
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:13,020
 is six times higher among the women who choose to abort

673
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:16,460
 versus the moms that have the child.

674
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:18,440
 Six times higher suicide rate.

675
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:22,160
 They have an increased risk of preterm birth,

676
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,820
 lower fertility rate for women who have had an abortion,

677
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:27,120
 a higher fatality rate for infants,

678
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,020
 born to mothers who have had abortion,

679
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:32,260
 and for the child, abortions are not safe.

680
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:34,400
 Someone always dies.

681
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:39,640
 And I know that if you had one,

682
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,960
 you're probably not gonna be able to hear

683
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,100
 anything else I said.

684
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:45,380
 'Cause you're gonna be focused on your consequences.

685
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:47,700
 I want to remind you that God loves you,

686
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,980
 he has a plan for you and he has a plan for your children,

687
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,860
 and his grace is enough.

688
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,940
 Please stay in there with me.

689
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:55,440
 Less than you say, well, what about rape?

690
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,940
 Less than 1% of abortions are the decision of a woman

691
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:58,860
 who has been raped.

692
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:01,440
 Less than you say, what about the mother's life or health?

693
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,760
 Less than 1% of abortions are to save the mother's life.

694
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:10,260
 More than 50% of all abortions are repeat offenders,

695
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:13,620
 and the vast majority of abortions are due to inconvenience,

696
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:16,380
 well over 90% of abortions.

697
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:18,060
 The number one reason is because a baby

698
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:20,460
 would impact my school or my work.

699
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:23,900
 See, we want sex without consequences.

700
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:29,400
 And so some of you, you're here and you think about,

701
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,520
 some of you might be thinking,

702
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,120
 well, what about racial reconciliation?

703
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,120
 Why didn't that make your list?

704
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,760
 Why aren't we talking about that?

705
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,080
 I'd love to remind you that we did,

706
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:43,840
 we spent an entire night on that one issue alone

707
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,600
 just a few weeks ago, and it is an issue,

708
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,480
 make no mistake about it.

709
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,320
 And I do believe that black lives,

710
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,640
 absolutely, they do matter,

711
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,060
 and that's why I'm talking about this,

712
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:55,820
 because I wanna show you something.

713
00:31:55,820 --> 00:32:02,100
 Did you know that over 15 million African Americans

714
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:05,580
 have died by abortion, which is 43 times more

715
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:07,840
 than violent crimes since 1973?

716
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,940
 You see violent crimes, that's the second bar,

717
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:14,940
 abortion, that's the last one, 15.5 million.

718
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:17,480
 If you believe that black lives matter like I do,

719
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,580
 you better believe this issue matters,

720
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:21,200
 because let me tell you something,

721
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,520
 the most dangerous place in America

722
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:26,660
 for an African American is inside their mother's womb.

723
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:31,500
 And that's the truth, it's statistically a fact.

724
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:36,000
 And because I believe your lives matter,

725
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,820
 I'm begging you to understand that this matters.

726
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:43,860
 That was first said by a black pastor, by the way.

727
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:45,560
 And my point is this, government unions

728
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:48,020
 between same-sex couples do not make for a better land.

729
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:50,140
 Moms having a choice to end the life of their babies

730
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:51,780
 do not make for a better land.

731
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:53,740
 And so I know that if you're here

732
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:55,500
 and you participated in these things,

733
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:58,500
 it feels so unloving to address it in this way.

734
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:01,300
 And I want you to know it's uncomfortable for me too.

735
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:04,020
 I stand up here, I'm scared.

736
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:06,460
 And sometimes when I'm weak in my flesh,

737
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:08,620
 I'm like, what, they're gonna hate me.

738
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:12,860
 Most of 'em will disagree with me.

739
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:19,980
 I want you to know, I think it's kept us quiet too long.

740
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:22,900
 Being afraid to offend others.

741
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:27,580
 The Proverbs say, "Faithful are the wounds of a friend."

742
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:29,540
 We've gotta be able to talk about this.

743
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:32,680
 We've gotta be able to address this issue.

744
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:38,340
 If you're here and you're attracted to the same sex,

745
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:41,220
 I'm not trying to change your attraction, man, I'm not.

746
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:44,520
 We do not do reparative therapy here.

747
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,840
 We do not practice it.

748
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:50,040
 I'm trying to change what you do with your attraction.

749
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:54,360
 What does Jesus mean when he calls you to die to yourself?

750
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:57,760
 Why does he say in Matthew chapter 19

751
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,500
 that you have an incredible gift to be used for the kingdom?

752
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,380
 I believe that you do.

753
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:04,660
 You are more than your sexual orientation.

754
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:08,540
 In fact, it's dehumanizing that you want to be identified

755
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:10,120
 by your sexual orientation.

756
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:15,060
 And so with both of these issues,

757
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:18,900
 you're gonna hear this, what people should be able to do,

758
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:21,020
 whatever they want to do with their body.

759
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:24,940
 God disagrees.

760
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:29,720
 In 1 Corinthians 6, 19 and 20, he says,

761
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:32,580
 friends, do you not know that your body is the temple

762
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:34,580
 of the Holy Spirit who is in you,

763
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:36,300
 who have you received from God?

764
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:38,900
 He says, "You are not your own, you were bought at a price."

765
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:41,660
 See, God knows what it's like to lose a child.

766
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:45,980
 He lost his son on a cross for you, for me, for our sin.

767
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:49,820
 Do you not know that your body was purchased

768
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,740
 by the blood of Jesus Christ?

769
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:53,620
 You are not your own, you were bought at a price.

770
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:58,620
 Therefore, honor God with your body because it's his temple.

771
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:03,360
 This past week, our house was vandalized.

772
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:07,780
 Specifically, someone had spray painted graffiti

773
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:08,620
 on our home.

774
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:16,200
 As you hear that, you may think,

775
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,720
 I have the right to be upset about that.

776
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,400
 Why?

777
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,380
 Because it's my house.

778
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:28,120
 When my children were inside, the place where we live,

779
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,060
 it's our home.

780
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:32,720
 And someone came onto our property

781
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:36,080
 and they destroyed a part of our property.

782
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:41,040
 And it's okay.

783
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,120
 Got a great sermon illustration out of it.

784
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:49,160
 But God is saying, your body is his temple.

785
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:53,840
 Do not vandalize his temple.

786
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:56,280
 It belongs to him.

787
00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:00,100
 It was purchased by him.

788
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:05,860
 I know that some of us wanna give people

789
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:07,720
 the freedom to hurt themselves.

790
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:10,680
 I'm telling you, I don't think that's loving.

791
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:11,720
 So what do we do?

792
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:14,560
 My third and final point this evening

793
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:18,080
 is we must return to God, his word,

794
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,920
 his desires, and his people.

795
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:25,800
 See, what's happened is we've made following our heart,

796
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:29,280
 our God, instead of following God's heart.

797
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,900
 I'm telling you this evening, don't follow a heart

798
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:34,360
 that's not chasing after the heart of God.

799
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:38,040
 Do not follow a heart that's not chasing

800
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,960
 after the heart of God.

801
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,960
 Second Chronicles 7, 14, speaking of the temple,

802
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:47,280
 this is before that our bodies became the temple of God.

803
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,800
 Before the Holy Spirit resided in us,

804
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,800
 Solomon built a temple and dedicated it to the Lord.

805
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:57,080
 And he said this, "If my people who are called by my name

806
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:59,660
 "will humble themselves and pray and seek my face

807
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:01,120
 "and turn from their wicked ways,

808
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:04,240
 "then I will hear from them and I will forgive their sin

809
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,600
 "and will heal their land."

810
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,760
 Can we heal their land?

811
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,640
 Can we read that together?

812
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,600
 Can we read that together this evening?

813
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:13,640
 Yes, good, okay, me and my friend,

814
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,240
 we're gonna read this together, ready?

815
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,520
 (congregation laughing)

816
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:20,520
 "If my people who are called by my name

817
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:25,360
 "will humble themselves and pray and seek my face

818
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,720
 "and turn from their wicked ways,

819
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:32,560
 "then I will hear from heaven and I will forgive their sin

820
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,840
 "and will heal their land."

821
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,680
 Amen.

822
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,080
 We have to return to God.

823
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:42,040
 I made a mess of my thermostat.

824
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,520
 I made a mess of my air condition.

825
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,960
 I made a mess of the situation.

826
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,080
 I was in a hot mess.

827
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:49,560
 I woke up the next morning, I called an expert.

828
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:52,360
 I begged and pleaded, "Can you please come over today?"

829
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:55,600
 He came over, he knew exactly what to do.

830
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,920
 He knew exactly what had happened.

831
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,680
 He knew I had shorted out my AC.

832
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,520
 He went in there, he repaired it,

833
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:04,560
 he swapped out the thermostat, he put the nest on.

834
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,240
 He put the nest on, all within minutes,

835
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,320
 the situation was resolved.

836
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:14,280
 Your sin and the sin of our country is no problem for God.

837
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,160
 He can resolve it in a moment.

838
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,360
 He can touch Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump right now

839
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,000
 and save them both.

840
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,840
 He can make them the most radical Christians

841
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,680
 you've ever thought of.

842
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,400
 He's that big, he can do that.

843
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,160
 He can do incredible things, but are we praying for that?

844
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:34,400
 Have we spent hours on our knees begging him for that?

845
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,120
 Have we pleaded with him more than we've posted on Facebook

846
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,760
 or shared our opinions or shot over a YouTube video?

847
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,040
 Have we begged God?

848
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,760
 Have we taken off of work

849
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:45,440
 and spent an entire day on our face?

850
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:50,440
 Lord, please, please, please save our country.

851
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:55,080
 God, help us, we need your help.

852
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:58,560
 Our problem is not a problem for God,

853
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,600
 the creator of the heavens and the earth.

854
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:03,800
 He can effortlessly remedy this,

855
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,440
 but we need to start by turning to him.

856
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,280
 I'm just gonna give you some application now.

857
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,320
 One, confess your sins personally.

858
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:12,640
 Sex outside of marriage of any kind,

859
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:16,940
 any abortion that you've participated in,

860
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:20,200
 confess it, repent, turn from it, don't hide it,

861
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:23,160
 don't feel like you gotta take it to your grave, you don't.

862
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,880
 God loves you, he's crazy about you, he delights.

863
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:29,000
 The scripture says he delights in forgiving you.

864
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,320
 He delights in it.

865
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,840
 He finds joy when you come to him with your sin

866
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,840
 to forgive you.

867
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:38,640
 Spend extended time in prayer.

868
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:43,440
 I think you should seriously, prayerfully consider

869
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,760
 taking a vacation day between now and November 8th

870
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:52,040
 and going somewhere and praying the entire day,

871
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,080
 pleading with God.

872
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:57,880
 Your hope is not in a vote,

873
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,400
 but your vote should reflect who your hope is in.

874
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:04,160
 Your hope is not in a vote,

875
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:07,280
 but your vote should reflect who your hope is in.

876
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,400
 And so to cast a vote, I would not do so

877
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:12,000
 without lots and lots of prayer.

878
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:17,920
 If abortion or same-sex attraction is a part of your journey,

879
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,640
 please not only receive grace and forgiveness,

880
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:22,480
 but tell your story.

881
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,820
 It's a powerful tool in the hands of God.

882
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:27,080
 I've seen him do incredible work.

883
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,800
 I've had a front row seat here for the past 10 years

884
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,560
 watching him do incredible work

885
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,600
 through people who will tell their story.

886
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:38,000
 And some of you, and I know this is no small ask,

887
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,200
 but I've gotta ask some of you to do something

888
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,080
 very difficult and very important.

889
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:47,840
 I need some of you to move to Washington, D.C.

890
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:52,480
 I need some of you to run for politics.

891
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:56,360
 I need some of you to learn to navigate Washington, D.C.,

892
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,640
 to begin to study it.

893
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:00,600
 I know that not all of you can, but if you can, you should.

894
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:04,520
 Some of you are here, you're 27 years old,

895
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:05,480
 and eight years from now,

896
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:08,040
 I would love to personally vote for you

897
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,680
 for the President of the United States of America.

898
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:13,960
 And so you need to learn and you need to study.

899
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:16,680
 And some of you, right now, the Lord may be calling you

900
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,960
 to something like this, that you would go

901
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:22,000
 and spend your entire life

902
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,640
 to fighting these battles that matter to God.

903
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,440
 And I don't just mean the two that we discussed tonight.

904
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,800
 That you would learn the ins and the outs,

905
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:35,800
 that you would redeem a biblical worldview in our land.

906
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:42,440
 We need to learn to winsomely engage on this topic.

907
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:44,680
 And so when we meet with someone who disagrees,

908
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,720
 they should know three things.

909
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,560
 They should know, first, that we love them.

910
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:52,360
 Secondly, they should know that we disagree and why.

911
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,160
 And then thirdly, they should know the hope

912
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:57,400
 that the gospel of Jesus Christ offers.

913
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,920
 If they do not know these three things,

914
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,360
 if it's not clearly apparent in our dialogue

915
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:04,360
 or discussion with them, then we failed.

916
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:10,560
 If you're a follower of Christ,

917
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,520
 you need to know what God's word says.

918
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,840
 This is a game of truth, and I'll be honest,

919
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,480
 I've taught some of this before

920
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,840
 in a much more pastoral way, less political way.

921
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:21,720
 You can go find those messages online.

922
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:25,240
 But the truth is more and more difficult to find.

923
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:28,040
 But it's always found here.

924
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:31,080
 It's always found right here.

925
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:37,080
 And so make sure you belong to a church

926
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:38,520
 that teaches the whole truth,

927
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:42,560
 and a community that will help you follow God's heart

928
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,760
 as opposed to your own.

929
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:49,080
 God working through you is the solution.

930
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,400
 So get ready, friends.

931
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:54,640
 We, you and me, all of us,

932
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,880
 God and His sovereignty had you here tonight.

933
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:59,320
 We have work to do.

934
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:05,240
 Could you imagine a land?

935
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:08,280
 Or could you imagine that in our lifetime

936
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:12,280
 that we would see the last baby killed?

937
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:14,040
 That it would never happen again

938
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:16,520
 because of God working through your life?

939
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:18,880
 Could you imagine in our lifetime

940
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:23,800
 if we've seen the LGBTQ community infiltrate the church

941
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,400
 in ways that are positive,

942
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,760
 that they would stand up and tell their story

943
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,680
 and talk about how they are resisting

944
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,520
 the natural urges of their flesh

945
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,920
 to hold out for something that is better,

946
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:38,200
 something that is more godly, an eternal reward,

947
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:41,680
 and not doing so out of anger,

948
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:45,520
 and not doing so feeling like they got ripped off,

949
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,920
 but doing so believing that God

950
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,840
 has something better for them?

951
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:52,960
 Can you imagine this land?

952
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:56,240
 You have an opportunity.

953
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:01,820
 In summary, understand God's clear instruction.

954
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:04,880
 Understand the consequences

955
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:07,420
 of not observing God's clear instruction.

956
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:13,420
 And return to God His word, His desires, and His people.

957
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:19,840
 Behind me is the sun over the horizon.

958
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:27,560
 When the Constitution was signed

959
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:30,240
 by all the delegates in 1787,

960
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:33,280
 Ben Franklin sat there.

961
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,860
 Some of them came in reluctantly.

962
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:40,200
 And Mr. Franklin was in his 80s.

963
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:44,080
 And as the document was signed,

964
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:47,440
 he confessed that he had spent many days daydreaming,

965
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:50,160
 looking at the back of Washington's chair,

966
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:53,880
 'cause on the back of Washington's chair was a painting.

967
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:56,040
 It was a sun over a horizon.

968
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:57,860
 And Mr. Franklin had wondered,

969
00:44:57,860 --> 00:45:01,800
 is that sun rising or is that sun setting?

970
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:07,780
 And as the Constitution was signed,

971
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:12,360
 he said that today, over the land of America,

972
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:14,200
 I believe it is rising.

973
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:17,800
 I celebrate with you that it is rising.

974
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:20,000
 Friends, today, tonight, this evening,

975
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,840
 I stand before you and tell you I believe it is setting.

976
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:34,160
 I believe that we may be the generation

977
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:37,960
 that loses our country to the hands of the enemy.

978
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:42,760
 And I beg you to care,

979
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:49,680
 to stop following feelings and emotions in your heart

980
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:55,560
 and care enough what God's word says

981
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:58,920
 and speak it boldly and winsomely

982
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:01,840
 and learn your message and tell your story

983
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:04,480
 and engage everyone you can

984
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:08,240
 and beg and plead for a revival.

985
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,560
 Are you a follower of Christ?

986
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:16,280
 Then follow Christ with everything.

987
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:20,800
 Follow Jesus with your all.

988
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:23,760
 Live a life that matters

989
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:30,120
 and save our land so that the sun would rise again.

990
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:33,760
 I'm gonna pray that you would.

991
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:41,000
 Father, as we move to singing a song,

992
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,800
 worshiping you,

993
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:49,920
 God, the creator of the heavens and the earth,

994
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:56,000
 Father, I beg you to help us,

995
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,160
 to save us,

996
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:04,880
 to redirect a stir in our hearts,

997
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:07,960
 a vision so much bigger than us,

998
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:09,680
 one that we can't lose sight of.

999
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:13,040
 Father, if I've said anything,

1000
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:15,480
 Holy Spirit, powerful God,

1001
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:19,440
 if I've said anything that is inconsistent with your desire,

1002
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:22,160
 I pray that it would be forgotten even now

1003
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:25,280
 before anyone gets up from their chair,

1004
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:27,840
 anyone who's listening, that it would be forgotten.

1005
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:31,640
 But God, anything that I said

1006
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:33,760
 that is completely consistent with your character

1007
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:35,920
 and your will and your desires revealed to us

1008
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:38,160
 through your scriptures and your Holy Spirit,

1009
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:41,840
 allow it to stir in our hearts and our minds

1010
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:43,360
 until we are moved to action.

1011
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:50,480
 Father, help us to defend those

1012
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:52,320
 who cannot defend themselves.

1013
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:57,360
 Father, help us to make what has been said

1014
00:47:57,360 --> 00:48:01,240
 to be about love actually about love.

1015
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:05,120
 Father, help us to engage the lost,

1016
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:09,040
 heal and strengthen your church,

1017
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:12,920
 and use us, God.

1018
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:18,360
 May millennials be the most powerful force,

1019
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:22,920
 the most powerful demographic of people

1020
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:25,800
 this world has ever seen.

1021
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:29,520
 In the name of Jesus.

1022
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,720
 Amen.

1023
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:41,720
