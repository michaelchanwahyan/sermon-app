[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.720]   - Gather here.
[00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.600]   Ah, this is fun, Cupid, we're back in it.
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.800]   And so, as I thought about tonight,
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.620]   you know, the thing, there's a part of this,
[00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:16.680]   which I love to do, and then there's a part of this
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:17.920]   that I'm just burdened to do,
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.040]   'cause it causes me to do a lot of reflecting,
[00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.840]   a lot of wrestling with the scripture.
[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.320]   I feel like this week, particularly,
[00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.680]   just a lot of wrestling in the past 48 hours, even,
[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.360]   with a scripture.
[00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.760]   But as I thought back on my own dating life,
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.080]   like, I wish that I had this, okay?
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.400]   And so there's a part of me that's like,
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.000]   man, this is, you guys are here,
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.440]   and I wish that someone would have told me
[00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.540]   that, you know, all the things that I was doing,
[00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:41.960]   that they would have said, hey, those are wrong,
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.140]   and here's the way, and I could, you know,
[00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:45.800]   sort the truth from the lies,
[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.720]   and that's, I think, one of the most difficult things,
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.960]   is the world is constantly trying to get your attention,
[00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.280]   and so there's just a part of me that says,
[00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.800]   no, no, the world is doing it so wrong.
[00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.040]   And so, as I thought about how to start this tonight,
[00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.880]   I just, I want you guys to watch this clip.
[00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:08.600]   So here's my question for you.
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.160]   Do you know where you're going?
[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.760]   Do you know where you wanna be?
[00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.000]   Okay, we're talking about dating,
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.240]   and so as you consider dating,
[00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.180]   do you have a destination in mind?
[00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.080]   Because we all agree, like, there's something different
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.680]   when, there's something different from, like,
[00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.600]   putting in a destination into the GPS
[00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.120]   and driving intentionally to that destination.
[00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.560]   Remember when you would do it in high school?
[00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.200]   You kinda cruise the strip,
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.680]   or whatever you guys would call it, right?
[00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.640]   You just kinda drive aimlessly, okay?
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.800]   I did this, maybe I'm the only one in the room,
[00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:38.820]   but we would just kinda, you know,
[00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.920]   hey, mom and dad, I'm gonna go driving,
[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:41.760]   and like, driving where?
[00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:42.680]   I don't know, just around.
[00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.360]   So that's, some of you, that's how you date.
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.040]   Like, you just go dating.
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.880]   Where's that going?
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.540]   I don't know, just kind of around, right?
[00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:50.880]   And then some of us, right,
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.560]   we understand that we have to go somewhere,
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.720]   and so strategy is this simple.
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.040]   I have a friend who graduated from Harvard Business School,
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.600]   and he was the lead strategic consultant
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.760]   of a leading hedge fund, and he says,
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:05.740]   "Strategy is this simple.
[00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.120]   "It's knowing where you are, knowing where you wanna be,
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.220]   "and then taking a step in that direction."
[00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.160]   Or he would say, "Formulating a plan to get there."
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.040]   And so for me, as I ask you guys,
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.400]   do you know where you want to go?
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.080]   Like, if I wanna go towards the back of this room,
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.600]   if I wanna head that direction,
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.680]   then I need to be facing that direction.
[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.640]   And I know that seems like common sense,
[00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.960]   but some of us, we're saying, "Hey, we wanna be there,
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.800]   "but we're facing here when it comes to dating."
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.120]   We're going the wrong way,
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.960]   and we need to hear that at a head level and a heart level.
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.280]   And so tonight, I wanna talk about what it looks like
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.040]   to go the right way.
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.960]   What it, 'cause if we're not doing it the right way,
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.540]   right, we're doing it the wrong way,
[00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.640]   and the wrong way's gonna get us to the wrong location,
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.280]   the wrong destination.
[00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.960]   We're gonna continue to beat our head against the wall,
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.780]   and here's the crazy part about this.
[00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.600]   This is just pure logic.
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.600]   Most people, by most I mean the majority, over 50%,
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.840]   do this the wrong way.
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.680]   How crazy is that?
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.760]   Right, they don't end up in the right destination.
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.120]   Literally, statistically, most people do not end up
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.160]   where they wanna be, and so how are you going to change that?
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.520]   Right, and the world has all of this,
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.280]   these rules and regulations for you.
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.000]   In fact, the myth this week,
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.320]   'cause we're busting these myths,
[00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.360]   the myth this week is that there's all of these rules
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.360]   to dating, there's not a bunch of rules.
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.360]   There's really just a few rules.
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.880]   So what the world tells you is that there's all of these
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.120]   rules to dating, and kind of above and beyond all of them
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.320]   is to follow your heart.
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.100]   Okay, in fact, I did a Google search, rules to dating,
[00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.680]   and it showed me 9,300,000 results.
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.200]   I'm talking dozens and dozens of books
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.000]   titled rules to dating.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.080]   I think, yeah, there you go.
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.760]   Just 9,300,000 results on a search,
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.380]   rules to dating, in quotes.
[00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:59.480]   How crazy is that?
[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.500]   And then above all of them, it says, and follow your heart.
[00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.480]   And so what I want you to know tonight
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.520]   is that there's not that many rules to dating.
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.440]   I wanna make this simple, and really,
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.960]   I wanna make it worry-free for you.
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:15.000]   I wanna bring it down, and I wanna tell you,
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.480]   don't follow your heart, inform your heart.
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:18.960]   That's what the scripture says.
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:20.840]   Inform your heart.
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.680]   Tell your heart where it should go.
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.840]   Show it what is right so that it knows
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.800]   to pursue that thing, right?
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.400]   Because if you show it the wrong things,
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.920]   it's gonna chase the wrong things,
[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:35.920]   and I think so many of us, we're going the wrong way.
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:39.040]   And so I know you're like, simple, worry-free,
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.000]   that's not dating.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.960]   Well, the reason it's not dating
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.800]   is 'cause it involves our heart.
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.680]   Frankly, it's our heart that makes this difficult.
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.440]   It's us giving our heart to someone,
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.480]   or not knowing who to give our heart to,
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:51.960]   and then when they take it,
[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.160]   and they do the wrong things with it,
[00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.760]   and then it's broken, and we're left hurt,
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.160]   and there's all of these things that are fallout
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.600]   from this word called dating that we're here to talk about.
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.440]   And so Jeremiah 17, nine says,
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.200]   "The heart is deceitful above all things,
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.560]   "and beyond cure, who can understand it?"
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.340]   Tonight, I just wanna give you a biblical dating strategy
[00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.360]   that goes beyond follow your heart.
[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.480]   Here's really what I wanna do.
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:17.400]   You're gonna leave here,
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.840]   and most of you in the room tonight,
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.520]   most of you that wanna be married,
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.040]   you will be married, most of you.
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.240]   Okay, if that's your heart's desire,
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.800]   most of you, you will be.
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.240]   It's just a reality, okay?
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.580]   And then about half of you will be divorced.
[00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:36.440]   Just another reality, it's just a statistic.
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.480]   And the statistic, we know,
[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:42.160]   is the same in the church and out of the church.
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:43.880]   And so what I wanna do for you,
[00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.360]   as the Spirit makes alive to us the word of God,
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.800]   is I wanna curve that statistic.
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.720]   Okay, I just wanna give you a better chance
[00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.680]   when you leave here than a 50/50 ending rate, okay?
[00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.720]   A 50/50 disaster rate, it's really higher than that
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.680]   because so many marriages that stay together
[00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.320]   aren't really marriages at all.
[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.200]   So the disaster rate is so much higher than 50%.
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.360]   And I just wanna leave you here with a better chance
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:10.280]   of having a good, healthy, God-honoring relationship
[00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:12.400]   because God has some things to say to this.
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.360]   And so people, when they follow their heart,
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.200]   they come up with these really stupid ideologies.
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:18.780]   And I don't know how else to say it other than that,
[00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:21.640]   just really stupid ideas when they follow their heart.
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.180]   And so I heard this on the radio the other day.
[00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:24.800]   They're like, this girl's on the radio
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.040]   and she's talking about these people dating
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.360]   or thinking about getting married.
[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.080]   And she's like, well, of course they're gonna live together
[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.080]   before they get married.
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.880]   Like, of course they're going to.
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.480]   And like, who would ever wanna marry someone
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:36.640]   without living together?
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:37.780]   And I just thought about that.
[00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:40.520]   And so I said, I wanna look at the data.
[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.680]   And so we built a graph to show you today.
[00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:43.960]   And so here's the data.
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:45.440]   This is pure logic, okay?
[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.920]   This is secular information, all right?
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:49.600]   So before you get angry, before you leave,
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.960]   I'm just presenting the facts to you.
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:53.320]   Think about this with a clear mind.
[00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:54.840]   You see that black line?
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.920]   Okay, that black line is the cohabitation rate.
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:58.800]   Simple as that.
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:02.140]   You see, before 1970, it was virtually nonexistent.
[00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:03.320]   In fact, it was illegal.
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:05.720]   Did you know that cohabitation today is still illegal
[00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:07.920]   in four states, in the United States of America?
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.080]   Fact, okay?
[00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:11.360]   And so before 1970, virtually nonexistent.
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:14.560]   You see how drastically it declines, or it inclines.
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:15.800]   Okay, that red line?
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.680]   That red line is the divorce rate.
[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.120]   And you see how rapidly that increased, right?
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:22.880]   Right with, along with, as cohabitation increases,
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.440]   the divorce rate increases.
[00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:26.040]   Okay, but you say, well, wait a minute.
[00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:28.720]   You say, wait a minute, JP, right there about 1985,
[00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:31.240]   it seems like the divorce rate is going down a little bit.
[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:33.760]   Okay, that's in numbers, not percentages, okay?
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:34.800]   So let me show you this.
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.480]   That blue line right there?
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:42.560]   That blue line, that is the marriage rate.
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:44.640]   You see what's happening?
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:46.880]   You see how that starts to go down?
[00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:49.220]   So people aren't getting divorced less.
[00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:51.840]   The divorce statistic has remained the same.
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:55.600]   The numbers are less because people are married less.
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.040]   That is just information.
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:58.920]   That's just data.
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:00.920]   You see how logic can debunk these things in the world
[00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:03.760]   that God says, no, no, no, no, I don't want you to do that
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:06.080]   because I love you and I want you to be
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:07.600]   in a healthy, God-honoring marriage.
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:10.060]   Where do you want to be, let me ask you.
[00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:13.200]   If you're dating, I hope one of the places
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.840]   where you want to be is in a marriage,
[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:16.080]   but not just in a marriage.
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:17.420]   Like if you said that, when I say, hey,
[00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:18.260]   where do you want to be?
[00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:19.080]   You say, I want to be in a marriage.
[00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:19.920]   No, you don't.
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:25.000]   You want to be in a God-honoring marriage.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.100]   You want to be in a healthy marriage
[00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:29.720]   to a wife or a husband who loves you
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:32.600]   as God has called them to, who cares for you.
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:35.000]   You want to be in an uncommon marriage,
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.300]   in a marriage that rarely exists today.
[00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:43.160]   Between two people who are fully committed to God first
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:45.080]   and then love each other out of the overflow
[00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:47.440]   of that commitment, that is what you want
[00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:50.360]   if you are looking to get married and want to get married.
[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:53.920]   And so tonight, I just want to talk about
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:56.800]   how to get pointed in the right direction.
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:59.000]   How to stay within the lines.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   Like what are the principles
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.200]   that the Scriptures tell us to?
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.520]   I'm telling you, it's not a bunch of rules.
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:06.800]   It's just some kind of big principles to think through
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:09.960]   that are pretty self-evident, self-explanatory.
[00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:11.040]   And then before you leave here,
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:12.520]   just understanding the destination,
[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:13.800]   where we're actually going.
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:15.960]   And so yesterday was February the 4th.
[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:17.080]   Here's what that means for me.
[00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:19.840]   If I'm doing a Proverb a Day, on the 4th day,
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:20.880]   I read Proverbs 4.
[00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:23.640]   On the 27th day, I read Proverbs 27.
[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:25.000]   And so kind of go along with that.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.320]   And so yesterday was the 4th.
[00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:28.520]   I read Proverbs 4, and I just felt like the Lord
[00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:31.600]   gave me this verse to put before you.
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:36.600]   And so this is Solomon, the wisest man in all the world,
[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:37.640]   writing this thing.
[00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:39.960]   And so what's interesting is he's going to say,
[00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:41.160]   so he has all of this wisdom.
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:42.800]   Solomon, he writes this book
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:44.920]   called the Book of Wisdom, or Proverbs, right?
[00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:46.280]   He's the wisest man ever to live
[00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:47.720]   in the history of humanity.
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:49.120]   And he scribes these things down,
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:51.440]   and he gets down to this Proverbs 4.23,
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:52.760]   and it's a verse you've heard again.
[00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:54.440]   Again, much like Proverbs 31,
[00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:56.520]   it's one of those that either wants to make you throw up
[00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:58.500]   or like, yeah, that's truth.
[00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:01.000]   And so it's that one that says, guard your heart.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.480]   Right, you ever heard that, guard your heart?
[00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:05.720]   Yeah, we don't know what that means, man.
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:07.000]   That's one of those things pastors say
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.520]   that sounds like, yeah, guard your heart.
[00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:10.200]   You're like, yeah, that's what I'm gonna do.
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:13.120]   I have no idea what that means, you know?
[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:14.840]   And so today I wanna talk about what does that mean?
[00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:16.040]   What does it mean to guard your heart?
[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:19.000]   'Cause the scripture's gonna say, it's gonna tell us.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.680]   And so this is what the wisest man
[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:21.960]   in the history of the world says.
[00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:23.720]   He says, above all else,
[00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:25.800]   and all this other stuff I've written down,
[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:27.480]   I've given you some real truths,
[00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:29.320]   I've given you some things to think about,
[00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:31.080]   I'm the wisest man ever to live,
[00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:35.800]   above everything else, guard your heart.
[00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:37.640]   For it is the wellspring of life.
[00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:39.520]   What does that mean, the wellspring of life?
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:40.880]   Here's what that means.
[00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:43.160]   It means that everything else in your life
[00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:46.040]   comes out of your heart's desires.
[00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:47.320]   Do you get that?
[00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:50.160]   That which your heart seeks, your body follows,
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:51.760]   your life follows.
[00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:53.800]   And so when your heart wants something, right,
[00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:55.280]   if you're not careful, then all of a sudden
[00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:57.400]   your whole entire life is over there.
[00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:58.560]   You feel that?
[00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:01.720]   You want something, and then your whole life,
[00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:04.400]   the trajectory of your life is following your heart.
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:06.440]   Guard your heart, above all else,
[00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:08.280]   for it is the wellspring of life.
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:10.040]   Life springs from it.
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:13.080]   Put away perversity from your mouth,
[00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:14.960]   keep corrupt talk from your lips,
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:16.600]   let your eyes look straight ahead,
[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:18.880]   fix your gaze directly before you,
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:20.520]   make level paths for your feet,
[00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:22.680]   and take only ways that are firm.
[00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:25.160]   Do not swerve to the right or to the left,
[00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:27.280]   but keep your foot from evil.
[00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:30.600]   (congregation laughing)
[00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:34.120]   So it directs the rest of our life.
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:35.120]   And so what do we need to do?
[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:36.920]   The first thing that we need to do
[00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:39.760]   is to give our heart instruction.
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:42.480]   Okay, I want you to give your heart instruction.
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:44.560]   I want you to think about it like this.
[00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:46.280]   Your heart is like a GPS.
[00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:48.840]   It is going to lead you.
[00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:49.680]   It is.
[00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:51.520]   It's going to tell you where to go.
[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:55.120]   But what is the first thing you have to do with the GPS?
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:58.080]   You have to input your destination.
[00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:01.360]   So you tell your heart, this inner working device,
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:03.320]   this GPS inside of you,
[00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:05.480]   you ultimately, you tell it where to go,
[00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:06.320]   you inform it.
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:08.480]   And so what are the Proverbs before 23?
[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:09.840]   You can mark this in your Bible.
[00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:11.320]   The Proverbs before 23, it says,
[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:12.880]   hey, this is the truth.
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:14.040]   Write it on your heart.
[00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:15.120]   Bound it around your heart.
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:17.320]   Do not forget these things I've told you.
[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:21.040]   This is the scripture, the holy word of God.
[00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:24.280]   And so you inform your heart with the truth
[00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:27.120]   of the creator of the heavens and the earth.
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:29.040]   You set the destination in your heart.
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:32.680]   You let your heart know, hey, this is where we're going.
[00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:33.680]   And then it will direct you.
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:36.520]   If you do not let it know where you are going,
[00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:38.800]   it will lead you off a cliff, man.
[00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:43.520]   It will lead you off a cliff.
[00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:46.420]   It's going to lead you, but you gotta tell it where to go.
[00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:52.000]   Woody Allen said,
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   when he had an affair with his wife's daughter,
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.360]   the famous line, the heart wants what it wants.
[00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:05.360]   Woody Allen was right.
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:08.760]   The heart does want what it's want.
[00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:12.400]   When his relationship with Soon-Yi did not last long,
[00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:14.520]   we know now that it's no longer existing.
[00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:17.240]   Evidently, the heart didn't want it very long.
[00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:18.840]   But that's how some of us think.
[00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:20.440]   We think with our heart.
[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:22.220]   Listen to your heart.
[00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:26.000]   Got more of that.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.240]   And so I want to exhort you tonight
[00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:33.260]   to not let an uninformed heart direct you.
[00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:36.640]   If you're not doing this God's way,
[00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:38.480]   I mean, this is cheesy, but it's true.
[00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:39.480]   If you're not doing it God's way,
[00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:40.400]   you're doing it the wrong way.
[00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:41.400]   If you're doing it the world's way,
[00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:43.120]   you're doing it the wrong way.
[00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:46.720]   And so we've gotta recalibrate our heart, our GPS,
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:48.300]   and say, okay, what is God's way?
[00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:50.120]   That's the way I'm committed to doing it.
[00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:51.080]   He created everything.
[00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:51.920]   He loves me.
[00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:52.740]   He's real.
[00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:53.880]   I'm gonna be with him forever.
[00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:56.680]   He's purchased me by the blood of his son, Jesus Christ.
[00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:59.240]   And so I might as well do this thing the way that he wants.
[00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:00.200]   He's like a loving dad.
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:01.020]   So God, what do you want?
[00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:02.480]   How do you want me to do it?
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:05.080]   And so you're telling your heart what to pursue.
[00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:07.680]   If not, your heart's gonna tell you what to pursue.
[00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:10.200]   You're either telling your heart what to pursue
[00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.400]   or your heart is telling you what to pursue.
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:15.800]   And the reality of it is, is what you feed your heart,
[00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:18.360]   that's what it's going to lead you to.
[00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:19.440]   Okay, this is truth now.
[00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:20.840]   I want you to hear this.
[00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:24.840]   What you put in your heart, what you feed your heart,
[00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:26.360]   that is what it's going to lead you to.
[00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:29.280]   So if you're feeding your heart junk from the tabloids
[00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:32.920]   and gossip from the TV and junk from music,
[00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:34.120]   I'm not trying to be legalistic now,
[00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:36.160]   I'm just being honest with you.
[00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:38.160]   If that's what you're feeding your heart,
[00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:39.680]   that's what it's going to lead you to.
[00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:41.240]   It's gonna start saying, hey, that's familiar,
[00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:43.200]   that's familiar, that's what you want, that's what you want.
[00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:44.200]   You want him.
[00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:45.920]   You want it that way.
[00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:47.280]   That's what he's going, right?
[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:48.360]   That's what he's saying.
[00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:51.640]   And your heart's screaming that, right?
[00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:53.480]   It works like Netflix.
[00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:57.000]   You guys got Netflix, anybody?
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.680]   Love me some Netflix.
[00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:01.120]   We don't have cable, we just have Netflix.
[00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:05.280]   And so here's what Netflix does, is it's smart, this Netflix.
[00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:08.560]   It knows what shows I like, okay?
[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:10.280]   It sees what shows I watch, and then it says,
[00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:12.680]   hey, here's some suggestions for you, Jonathan.
[00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:14.320]   And so what it does, if you go on my Netflix,
[00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:16.840]   what it suggests to you is Dora the Explorer
[00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:19.280]   and My Little Pony, because that's what my little girls
[00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:20.600]   watch all day long, right?
[00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:22.360]   Dora the Explorer, My Little Pony.
[00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:23.880]   And so you go on it, it starts to suggest it.
[00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:26.080]   So what happens, right, when I watch that documentary
[00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:28.320]   that was intriguing to me about pornography,
[00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:31.240]   which I didn't watch, but I was really tempted to,
[00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:33.200]   it starts saying, oh, pornography, here's what you want,
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:34.960]   here's what you want, this is what you want.
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:37.480]   Your heart works the same way.
[00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:40.280]   When you feed it crap from the TV,
[00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:42.320]   it's like, this is what you want.
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:44.640]   Go after that, that's what you want.
[00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:47.040]   When you go on Pinterest and you start, oh,
[00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:50.320]   lusting after a wedding dress, you know,
[00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:53.140]   that's what you want, that's ultimate.
[00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:55.680]   Nervous laughter.
[00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:57.080]   (congregation laughing)
[00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:01.440]   Please, no elbows tonight, no pointing, okay?
[00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:06.400]   And so don't let an uninformed heart guide you,
[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:09.600]   but don't let a misinformed heart guide you either.
[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:10.840]   Let me ask you this, guys,
[00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:12.840]   don't let a misinformed heart guide you.
[00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:17.360]   Can a Christian be madly in love,
[00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:19.040]   head over heels in love,
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:21.360]   with someone who is no good for them?
[00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:22.720]   Let me ask you like this, can a Christian,
[00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:25.460]   can a follower of Jesus be head over heels,
[00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:27.640]   madly in love with a non-believer?
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:30.240]   Absolutely they can.
[00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:34.000]   Oh, I've sat with them, they have wept in my office.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.720]   You're telling me what, I can't what?
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:37.880]   I'm not telling you anything, dude.
[00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:40.360]   2 Corinthians 6, 14, it's in the scripture.
[00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:41.320]   That's not me, that's God,
[00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:42.600]   that's the creator of the heavens and the earth.
[00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:44.480]   He loves you, by the way.
[00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:46.040]   See that pain that you feel right now?
[00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:49.680]   It's gonna pale in comparison to the pain that you feel.
[00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:52.040]   When a loving God says, hey, don't do that.
[00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:53.960]   He's not mad at you, he's not angry at you.
[00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:56.560]   He looks at you and he loves you.
[00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:58.400]   And he says, I want life for you.
[00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:00.560]   I teach that, every single time I've taught that,
[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:02.200]   it's gotten me an angry email.
[00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:04.880]   And so one of you guys will email me angrily.
[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:06.920]   And I'm just like, what are you,
[00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:08.780]   I'm the messenger, man.
[00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:11.200]   It's black and white in the word of God.
[00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:13.360]   God loves you, he's not trying to rip you off.
[00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:15.040]   He's trying to save your heart.
[00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:17.440]   Okay?
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:18.680]   He's trying to help you.
[00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:24.560]   He's trying to help you not be a statistic.
[00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:28.020]   Give you greater than 50/50 chance.
[00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:33.000]   You ever felt like, so can the heart,
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:33.960]   the heart wants what it wants.
[00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:35.040]   Sometimes the heart, you ever feel like
[00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:36.920]   you're going the right way,
[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:38.440]   and all of a sudden you're not?
[00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:39.960]   You feel like you're on track, you know,
[00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:41.560]   you're not listening to GPS,
[00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:43.280]   you're just kind of driving by your senses,
[00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:45.320]   by your emotions, like I'm certain I'm going the right way.
[00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:47.680]   And you look up and you've been going
[00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:50.660]   like the 180 degrees in the wrong direction.
[00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:53.840]   Only me, you know?
[00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:55.960]   This is what it's like.
[00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:57.640]   We've gotta follow something other than
[00:17:57.640 --> 00:17:59.760]   an uninformed or a misinformed heart.
[00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:05.160]   Proverbs 24 says, put away perversity from your mouth.
[00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:07.060]   Keep corrupt talk far from your lips.
[00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:08.480]   Let your eyes look straight ahead.
[00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:10.240]   Fix your gaze directly before you.
[00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:12.000]   Make level paths for your feet.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.160]   And take only ways that are firm.
[00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:18.560]   Okay, and so it's telling us the way that we should go,
[00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:19.400]   the way that we should go.
[00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:20.760]   But this idea of dating,
[00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:22.720]   you're really trying to find someone.
[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:25.640]   You're trying to identify a person
[00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:28.640]   who you're willing to spend the rest of your life with.
[00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:30.480]   And so what are those things that you're supposed
[00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:32.080]   to be identifying in them?
[00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:33.200]   What are you looking for?
[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:35.160]   And so I'm supposed to guard my heart,
[00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:36.360]   I'm supposed to protect it,
[00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:38.280]   I'm supposed to feed it healthy truth
[00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:39.760]   so it knows what's to look for.
[00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:40.840]   And so what should it look for?
[00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:41.880]   Well, the scripture says,
[00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:44.160]   and so my second point is protect your heart
[00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:46.040]   from people going the wrong way.
[00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:47.320]   There's people all around you,
[00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:49.920]   even this evening here, who are going,
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:52.240]   who are headed the wrong direction,
[00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:54.920]   and you don't want your heart to latch onto one of them.
[00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:56.720]   Because if you do, then they're gonna pull you
[00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:58.160]   in the wrong direction.
[00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:01.080]   They're gonna be driving down the wrong direction.
[00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:04.280]   Okay, and so what are those things that we can look at?
[00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:06.240]   I think there's three things, directly from the scripture.
[00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:07.680]   Number one, the speech.
[00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:09.400]   Number two, their focus.
[00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:12.200]   And number three, where they actually physically go.
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:14.480]   And so let's just talk about their speech for a second.
[00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:16.440]   This is something that you would observe in them.
[00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:18.300]   This is key, guys.
[00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:19.800]   This is key, ladies.
[00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:22.420]   Okay, their words are going to show you
[00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:24.040]   the contents of their heart.
[00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:27.520]   It's going to show you the way that their GPS works.
[00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:30.800]   This is straight from Jesus Christ himself,
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:32.360]   Matthew 12, verse 34, it says,
[00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:36.520]   "For out of the overflow of the heart, the mouth speaks."
[00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:38.520]   The words that come out of the mouth show,
[00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:41.040]   display the content of their heart.
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:42.680]   And so if they're angry, right,
[00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:47.120]   if they're constantly angry, they got an angry heart.
[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:50.880]   Right, and so some of you, some of you are here tonight,
[00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:53.120]   and you're angry, and the reason you're angry
[00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:54.620]   is because you're not married.
[00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:58.720]   And it can be seen on you.
[00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:01.020]   Now you thought, man, I will never be 37.
[00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:04.000]   Or 42, or whatever, and single,
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.280]   that's just not what I thought.
[00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:07.640]   I didn't think this in the way it was going.
[00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:08.840]   And so now you're angry.
[00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:10.760]   Maybe you're angry at God, maybe you're angry at men,
[00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:11.720]   maybe you're angry at women.
[00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:13.420]   I don't know what you're angry at.
[00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:20.360]   But I strongly suggest that you go to the Spirit of God
[00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:22.380]   and say, what is it that you would have for me?
[00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:24.240]   Because I know James 1:19 says,
[00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:25.800]   "Our anger does not bring about
[00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:29.000]   "the righteous life that God desires."
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.080]   And so it's the great irony there
[00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:32.680]   is the reason you're not married
[00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:35.080]   is because you're angry that you're not married.
[00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:38.600]   You know, that's the thing that's keeping you single.
[00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:42.080]   How do they talk, do they gossip,
[00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:43.400]   are they talking about others?
[00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:44.800]   The person who's talking about others
[00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:46.520]   has nothing else to talk about,
[00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:47.640]   and is not someone you wanna spend
[00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:49.560]   the rest of your life with.
[00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:51.960]   That they're showing you the contents of their heart.
[00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:54.000]   Are they honest?
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:54.920]   Are they truthful?
[00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:58.040]   Girls, be honest, okay?
[00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:00.000]   Like, I'm gonna ask you a question,
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.740]   I want you all to shout no, okay, ready?
[00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:06.920]   Would you like to go have coffee with me?
[00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:10.840]   Okay, let's do it real loud, like heartfelt, ready?
[00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:12.280]   One more time.
[00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:14.120]   Excuse me, beautiful.
[00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:14.960]   Say, girl.
[00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:19.240]   ♪ The very first time ♪
[00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:20.880]   Hey, come here, baby, come here.
[00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:25.880]   Hey, would you like to have coffee with me?
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.880]   That's right, you see how that works?
[00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:32.800]   It's okay, why?
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:36.000]   That's a good reason.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.480]   (congregation laughing)
[00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:39.040]   Yeah, that's a good reason.
[00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:42.760]   Here's the deal, no, why?
[00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:46.520]   I'm not feeling that, I'm not attracted to you,
[00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:48.680]   your breath stinks, I don't like that shirt,
[00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:50.680]   you need to comb your hair, you need to grow up,
[00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:52.160]   you're not very godly, I don't know why,
[00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:54.160]   whatever the reason is, but it's not
[00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:56.680]   because you gotta change your sock drawer, okay?
[00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:58.680]   So help him along.
[00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:00.640]   If there's a reason that he doesn't want,
[00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:02.800]   like you don't wanna be on a date with him, right?
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:04.960]   Let him know so that he, you know, somebody else,
[00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:06.320]   maybe he has something he can change,
[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:07.440]   something within his power,
[00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:08.440]   or you're just not feeling that,
[00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:10.960]   but I feel like, ladies, like you feel like
[00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:13.680]   all of your authority and power has been taken away,
[00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:15.320]   and you've taken this word to submit,
[00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:16.480]   which is in the Bible, and I get it,
[00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:19.180]   but you think that now that means you can't be honest.
[00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:22.760]   And I want you to know you can be honest.
[00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:25.480]   You don't have to be hurtful, so don't hear me say that,
[00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:27.480]   okay, you don't have to be hurtful.
[00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:29.440]   Guys are like, yes, you don't have to be hurtful.
[00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:30.840]   (congregation laughing)
[00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:34.720]   But you can be honest, you know, and you can be confident,
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:36.600]   and you can look 'em in the eyes with dignity
[00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:39.320]   and just say, hey, that's not where I'm at right now.
[00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:43.600]   You know, or, you know, don't say I'm not open
[00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:46.000]   to dating if you are, 'cause I'm not,
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.120]   I don't wanna do that.
[00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:51.940]   Just whatever honesty is, that's what you can say, okay?
[00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:53.560]   There's nowhere in the scripture, I searched for it,
[00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:55.920]   there's no allotment in here to be anything
[00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:59.800]   less than honest, okay?
[00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:01.640]   I know that's crazy, it's like, what does he say
[00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:03.960]   to be honest, I don't, that's crazy.
[00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:05.600]   No, it's not, it's just biblical.
[00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:08.000]   It's just from the scripture.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.760]   Guys, be intentional, amen?
[00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:14.480]   It was a weak amen.
[00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:18.360]   Well, here's what that means, okay?
[00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:21.360]   It means, it may be obvious to you where you're at.
[00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:25.200]   Like, you may be there on a date, you know,
[00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:28.800]   at Chewy's or whatever, but she may not know that.
[00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:30.240]   And so, all you gotta do is just kinda talk
[00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:32.480]   about where you're at, hey, it's good to be here
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:35.060]   with you on a date, you know?
[00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:36.280]   (congregation laughing)
[00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:37.520]   You feel that?
[00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:39.520]   'Cause she's like, wait, is he, am I a friend,
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:41.760]   am I in the friend zone, or what's going on?
[00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:42.880]   Is this like, you're on a date, like,
[00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:44.440]   with your sister on a date, or?
[00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:47.360]   You know, and so, it's good to be here with you
[00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:51.280]   on a date at Chewy's, you know, and here we are,
[00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:55.200]   you order the enchiladas, I got the quesadillas.
[00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:57.440]   Great to be here with you on a date, you know?
[00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:59.480]   (congregation laughing)
[00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:01.880]   And see, 'cause some of us, we're doing this thing
[00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:04.580]   we like to call affectionately here, friendationships.
[00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:07.620]   You know, and here's what that is.
[00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:09.200]   That's where you get all of the affirmation
[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:12.000]   from the opposite sex that you need through a friendship.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.200]   And that's foolish.
[00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:17.200]   And it's not God-honoring.
[00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:18.140]   And it's hurtful.
[00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:20.360]   Because what you're doing, you're thinking,
[00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:21.880]   hey, well, she's just a friend,
[00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:23.400]   she knows she's just a friend.
[00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:25.640]   He knows he's just a friend,
[00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:28.960]   I don't mean just to pick on the guys.
[00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:31.680]   He knows he's just a friend, and he doesn't.
[00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:32.920]   His heart's done drifted.
[00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:36.000]   So you just, hey, this is where we're at,
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.760]   this is what I'm doing, this is where I'm headed,
[00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:40.720]   I'm just being intentional, not intense, but intentional.
[00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:43.080]   This is what's going on, I want you to know.
[00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:44.400]   Hey, this is where I see this going,
[00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:47.960]   this is the destination I have in mind.
[00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:49.800]   This is where this isn't going, I gotta tell you,
[00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:51.120]   this is where it stops.
[00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:54.160]   Whatever that is, you guys can be honest with one another.
[00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:56.040]   As you love each other, you're brothers and sisters
[00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:58.000]   in Christ, you can be honest with each other.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.680]   What that means is no games, okay?
[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:02.520]   We drop games in the sixth grade, Romans 12, nine says,
[00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:03.960]   love must be sincere.
[00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:05.500]   What do I mean by games?
[00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:07.360]   Games are where you say or do something,
[00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:10.260]   hoping to get something in particular in response.
[00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:11.800]   If someone's playing games with you,
[00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:13.400]   that's because they haven't outgrown that,
[00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:14.840]   and they're probably not gonna make a good wife
[00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:16.200]   or a husband, okay?
[00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:17.040]   What is a game?
[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:18.480]   A game is like when you hung up on somebody
[00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:20.000]   in the fifth grade, hoping they'd call you back,
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   that's a game, we don't play games.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.720]   Love must be sincere, we're honest,
[00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:25.640]   we're just, everything that comes out of here
[00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:28.520]   is evidence of here, and that's just absolute truth.
[00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:29.600]   That's what I teach my little girls,
[00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:31.360]   just speak with absolute truth.
[00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:34.120]   Whatever the truth is, the truth is always good enough.
[00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:35.680]   The only reason to lie is because you think
[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:36.680]   the truth isn't good enough,
[00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:38.560]   and the truth is always good enough.
[00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:40.040]   And so you can ask this question,
[00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:41.960]   how do they talk to you, do they build you up?
[00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:45.000]   Ephesians 4, 29 says, do not let any unwholesome talk
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.960]   come out of your mouth, but only what is helpful
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:49.000]   for building others up according to their needs,
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.720]   that it may benefit those who listen.
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:51.600]   Do they benefit you?
[00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:54.960]   This is, whenever we, as our porch volunteers,
[00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:56.840]   go somewhere, and so every now and then we'll do a retreat
[00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:59.080]   at a lake house or something, or we'll go somewhere,
[00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:00.760]   and what we always start with is, as I just said,
[00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:03.040]   hey, we wanna leave this place better than we found it.
[00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:04.960]   And so what that means is, we wanna leave it cleaner
[00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:06.680]   than we found it, everything in its place,
[00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:08.760]   and we want to leave it better than we found it.
[00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:10.240]   That's how you date, when you date someone,
[00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:12.840]   you want to leave them better than you found them, okay?
[00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:15.160]   Like if they go off to marry someone else,
[00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:17.320]   then that person who they marry is gonna be glad
[00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:20.720]   that they dated you, how novel of an idea is that?
[00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:22.840]   That's revolutionary, okay?
[00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:24.240]   Let me say it again, in case you missed it,
[00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:26.720]   you might have fell asleep, okay?
[00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:30.000]   If you date someone, leave them better than you found them.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.480]   Don't give them a bunch of baggage,
[00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:33.360]   because they were around you, like here, hold my baggage,
[00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:34.600]   you know, and okay, peace out.
[00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:37.040]   No, leave them better than you found them.
[00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:39.960]   Leave them more like Jesus than when you met them, okay?
[00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:41.780]   My friend said this this week, she just,
[00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:42.960]   she wrote this to me in an email,
[00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:44.200]   this is a girl I'm in community with,
[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:45.560]   she's married to my friend Marshall,
[00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:48.200]   and she just says this, "I always told myself
[00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:50.600]   "that if Marshall weren't to be my husband,
[00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:53.240]   "then I pray that I wanted to help him
[00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:56.360]   "become more like Christ, more ready for his bride
[00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:57.680]   "than before meeting me.
[00:26:57.680 --> 00:26:59.980]   "I didn't want to be on the list of the baggage
[00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:03.000]   "he would take with him into another relationship."
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.960]   I just read that, I'm like, how true is that?
[00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:07.340]   That you would date someone in the way
[00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:09.800]   that you would treat them, and build them up,
[00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:12.400]   and point them to Jesus, would leave them better
[00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:15.400]   than you found them, I know that's really counterintuitive
[00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:17.000]   in Dallas, but I promise.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.320]   That's right.
[00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:20.680]   Check out their focus, so number one,
[00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:22.820]   check out their speech, two, what are they focused on?
[00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:25.360]   What is their life looking at, okay?
[00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:26.960]   What are they feeding their hearts with?
[00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:29.160]   This is important, oh, that's a nice effect.
[00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:33.120]   I thought, it's the rapture for a minute.
[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:34.680]   (congregation laughing)
[00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:36.360]   What are they feeding their hearts?
[00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:37.920]   Okay, this goes back to the whole tabloid
[00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:39.800]   kind of gossip thing, all of that stuff,
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:41.840]   like I'll just tell you this, I told you I like Netflix.
[00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:44.040]   I was watching this show, somebody recommended it,
[00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:46.140]   and I started watching Breaking Bad, and,
[00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:50.760]   hold the applause. (congregation laughing)
[00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:52.200]   I knew that was gonna happen.
[00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:54.920]   So I started watching Breaking Bad,
[00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:56.600]   and I realized, after a couple episodes,
[00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:58.960]   I realized it wasn't good for me.
[00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:01.760]   Oh. (congregation laughing)
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:04.400]   It just did something, it did something to me,
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:06.600]   and maybe not you, maybe you're more spiritually mature
[00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:09.320]   than I am, or something, but where I was at,
[00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:10.680]   it just wasn't good for me.
[00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:13.600]   I kinda started walking around, like, feeling prideful,
[00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:14.840]   and I started thinking about words
[00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:17.160]   I don't usually think about in my vocabulary,
[00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:19.240]   you know, and I just kinda started feeling
[00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:20.920]   just a little puffed out, and at the same time,
[00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:22.800]   a little dark, like, there's just kind of a dark cloud,
[00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:24.600]   it's a dark show, there's kind of a dark cloud
[00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:26.880]   over my heart, and I just realized it wasn't good for me.
[00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:30.160]   I was taking in some stuff that was making my heart dirty.
[00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:34.040]   And so you need to look at, hey, what are they focusing on?
[00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:36.200]   What are they looking at, you know?
[00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:39.520]   This is gonna cover things like pornography, certainly.
[00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:42.520]   Like, if they're ingesting pornography,
[00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:44.320]   like, if that's you, like, I know that's a lot of you, man,
[00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:46.600]   you guys know, like, a lot of you are here
[00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:49.120]   for the first time, like, that's a huge part of my story.
[00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:51.200]   I was a major porn addict.
[00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:54.400]   I mean, it took years, frankly, of recovery,
[00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:56.200]   which every day I hoped it would be,
[00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:58.680]   today would be the day I'd never look at it again, you know?
[00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:01.000]   And like a dog to his vomit.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.680]   And so here's what I want you to know, man,
[00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:05.840]   if you're here, and you looked at porn this month,
[00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:07.240]   like, that's a part of your life,
[00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:09.200]   and I know, ladies, it's one in three of you,
[00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:10.160]   I know that.
[00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:13.280]   If that's a part of your life, get help.
[00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:17.000]   Like, raise your hand, not now, but later, raise your hand,
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.440]   and say, hey, I need help, and we're here to help you.
[00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:20.840]   We want to, okay?
[00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:23.720]   We got this incredible thing called regeneration,
[00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:25.440]   incredible things called community groups,
[00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:27.920]   great pastors who would love to help you
[00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:30.440]   through that struggle, but you need to get help.
[00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:33.080]   Okay, but before you pull someone into that struggle,
[00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:35.800]   you need to heal from that struggle.
[00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:38.920]   What are they looking at, right?
[00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:40.920]   What are they looking at?
[00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:43.280]   Pinterest, I said earlier, you know?
[00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:44.760]   It's funny, the scripture says,
[00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:46.840]   gaze directly before you.
[00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:48.360]   See, I think some of us, like, our problem is,
[00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:50.760]   we're idolizing 10 years ahead,
[00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:52.280]   the white picket fence, and the husband
[00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:53.680]   who just got home from his firm,
[00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:56.440]   and you know, the cars, and the dog,
[00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:58.120]   and some of you are just like, man,
[00:29:58.120 --> 00:29:59.320]   I just want him breathing, that's all.
[00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:02.400]   If he'd just be breathing, that'd be fine, you know?
[00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:06.000]   And I'm just telling you, like, stop.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:07.600]   Look right ahead of you, where am I at?
[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:08.440]   Where do I want to be?
[00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:10.360]   What's the next step?
[00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:12.960]   That's the question, what's the next step I can take?
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:14.880]   I know ladies, I know some of you feel really helpless.
[00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:16.160]   I want to help you.
[00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:18.560]   We, our staff, our team, our volunteers,
[00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:19.880]   we want to help you.
[00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:22.480]   Hopefully you're gonna leave with something tonight.
[00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:26.760]   Meaning wisdom, not necessarily a person.
[00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:30.160]   (congregation laughing)
[00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:33.800]   You know, what's their focus on, intimacy?
[00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:36.680]   I know that's, like, some of us, that's the destination.
[00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:38.040]   Like, the desired destination.
[00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:39.760]   I mean, some of us here tonight.
[00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:41.480]   The desired destination is not
[00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:42.880]   a healthy, God-honoring marriage.
[00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:46.240]   Like, the desired destination is intimacy tonight.
[00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:48.880]   And you're really gonna hurt somebody.
[00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:50.720]   Like, one day, you're gonna look in that rearview mirror,
[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:53.000]   and you're just gonna see cars piled up on the road,
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.840]   and you're gonna realize that it's been your bad driving
[00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:57.240]   that's responsible for all that damage.
[00:30:57.240 --> 00:31:00.120]   And before you do that, like, as someone who,
[00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:01.560]   that's a part of my story, I just want to say,
[00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:03.080]   hey, get help now.
[00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:05.400]   Just say, hey, man, I really, like, I don't know,
[00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:07.360]   I think I love God, but at the same time,
[00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:11.120]   I really love doing this stuff over here, and I need help.
[00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:14.360]   Okay, I need help.
[00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:15.680]   And so, come up and talk to me.
[00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:17.920]   You don't have to email, just come up tonight,
[00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:19.920]   or tomorrow, or next Tuesday, or whatever.
[00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:21.800]   Just come up and talk to us.
[00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:25.200]   And say, hey, we need help in that way, okay?
[00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:26.720]   And so, some of you, you're here tonight,
[00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:29.320]   and you feel like there's no hope for you
[00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:31.000]   because you know that that's a part of your story.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:32.920]   You're like, man, pornography, check.
[00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:34.760]   Sex and intimacy, check.
[00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:35.680]   What's my hope?
[00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:37.920]   You know when you go on your GPS,
[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:39.920]   and you start inputting an address,
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:41.360]   and it tells you everywhere you've been,
[00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:43.600]   like, it has the whole history there?
[00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:44.920]   You know, your heart's kind of the same way.
[00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:46.440]   Like, it shows you all these, like, you know,
[00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:48.600]   it reminds you, you reflect back.
[00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:50.720]   Maybe you're trying to, a quiet time,
[00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:52.400]   or be with God, or something, and you just start
[00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:55.040]   thinking about all of this stupid stuff you've done.
[00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:55.880]   But let me tell you something.
[00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:57.080]   You know how GPS, how it works?
[00:31:57.080 --> 00:31:59.720]   When you start entering new addresses,
[00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:01.360]   you know, you start saying, hey, this is where I'm going,
[00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:02.360]   this is where I'm going, and all of a sudden,
[00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:05.440]   those old addresses, they go out of the system.
[00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:07.280]   Your heart works similarly.
[00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:09.360]   When you start going to new, healthy places,
[00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:11.400]   you start putting new truth in.
[00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:13.360]   Some of that old junk, right, goes away.
[00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:14.840]   I'm not saying you never did those things.
[00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:16.400]   You don't have to act like you didn't.
[00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:18.520]   Okay, but you say, hey, I'm a new creation.
[00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:20.600]   Jesus gave me a new heart.
[00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:21.440]   God gave me a new heart.
[00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:22.800]   That's not who I am.
[00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:23.640]   That's who I was.
[00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:25.160]   That's not who I am.
[00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:27.200]   Hey, guys, look, it's not who I am.
[00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:28.440]   It's who I was.
[00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:29.440]   It's not who I am.
[00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:31.840]   Okay, you can say that.
[00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:36.080]   You start going to those new destinations,
[00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:37.960]   and so that's the third thing you watch, okay?
[00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:38.940]   Number one, their speech.
[00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:40.660]   Number two, their focus.
[00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:41.860]   And number three, where they go,
[00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:43.260]   straight from the scripture.
[00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:45.920]   Where do they go?
[00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:47.440]   Literally, like, where do they hang out with?
[00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:49.160]   Who do they hang out with?
[00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:50.640]   Okay, where do they spend money?
[00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:52.960]   That's gonna show you what they're interested in.
[00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:54.280]   Let me just say it, like, plain as day,
[00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:55.620]   like, just pure logic.
[00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:57.680]   If they party like the world,
[00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:00.040]   it's 'cause they're worldly, you know?
[00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:01.940]   If they go to worldly places,
[00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:04.700]   it's probably 'cause they're worldly, not godly.
[00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:06.200]   So just be aware, like, hey,
[00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:08.880]   where are the places that they go?
[00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:10.240]   You know, who are they hanging out with?
[00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:13.040]   If they're hanging out with a bunch of sinners,
[00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:15.480]   and they're not Jesus, right?
[00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:16.500]   You know, maybe, right?
[00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:17.480]   Maybe that's their ministry,
[00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:18.960]   and so don't email me on that.
[00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:21.520]   If that's their ministry, great, I trust you.
[00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:23.740]   But be wise.
[00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:26.240]   Who are they hanging out with?
[00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:29.000]   I realize we're all hanging out with sinners,
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:30.720]   'cause we're all sinners.
[00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:31.560]   I know that.
[00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:36.620]   And so, here's the deal, we're all headed the same way.
[00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:38.000]   If you're here, let me say it like this,
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:39.820]   if you're here, and you've trusted in Christ
[00:33:39.820 --> 00:33:41.500]   for the forgiveness of sins,
[00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:42.700]   you're going the same direction.
[00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:45.300]   We're all headed to be with God forever and ever and ever.
[00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:47.020]   And I know these, like, few years you're not married,
[00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:48.360]   or these few years you want something,
[00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:52.200]   or these few years you're really struggling through purity,
[00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:54.800]   and it's a battle every night, it's a battle.
[00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:55.740]   Like, one day you're gonna be with God
[00:33:55.740 --> 00:33:57.900]   forever and ever and ever.
[00:33:57.900 --> 00:34:00.080]   Like, forever and ever and ever, man.
[00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:02.100]   Forever and ever, to the power of infinity,
[00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:03.180]   it's gonna be incredible.
[00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:05.980]   Like, God's gonna be there, and Father, Son, and Spirit's
[00:34:05.980 --> 00:34:09.100]   gonna be there, and your great-grandma's gonna be there,
[00:34:09.100 --> 00:34:12.520]   and that neighbor who loved Jesus is gonna be there,
[00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:13.740]   and some of your community group,
[00:34:13.740 --> 00:34:16.660]   and you're all gonna be there forever and ever and ever,
[00:34:16.660 --> 00:34:20.840]   and these light and momentary afflictions, they're right.
[00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:24.780]   Right, it's gonna fade away, so focus on that,
[00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:27.140]   knowing the destination where you're going.
[00:34:27.140 --> 00:34:30.480]   So let me just say, the last point tonight is just
[00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:34.140]   stay moving towards your destination.
[00:34:34.140 --> 00:34:38.380]   Stay moving towards your destination, continue.
[00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:41.220]   Right, it's where am I, where do I wanna be,
[00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:43.760]   what's the next step, okay?
[00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:46.520]   What's the next step, what's the sure footing
[00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:47.680]   the scripture says?
[00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:48.840]   And so here's what I want you to know,
[00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:51.240]   a lot of rules to dating, there's not a lot of rules
[00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:54.800]   to dating, love God with all your heart, soul,
[00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:59.380]   mind, and strength, and then date however you want.
[00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:00.380]   You hear me?
[00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:03.760]   If God is ultimate in your life, like if he is
[00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:06.480]   the ultimate destination, and you know if he's not,
[00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:08.200]   I don't know, but you know if he's not.
[00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:09.600]   If you woke up this morning, you're like,
[00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:12.120]   Jesus, I just wanna be with you, I can't wait
[00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:14.560]   to open your word and just walk with you,
[00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:16.960]   and I want intimacy with you, and you are ultimate.
[00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:19.720]   Hey, keep me away from the temptations of this world,
[00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:21.520]   but I wanna walk with you, and it's not,
[00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:23.360]   it was like today and yesterday, and I'm not talking
[00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:26.280]   about like these momentary slumps we feel in,
[00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:30.160]   you know, I'm talking about I love God with my whole life.
[00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:33.280]   I don't wanna do that, I wanna love God.
[00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:35.080]   That's where you're at.
[00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:37.840]   Then stay there and date however you want.
[00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:40.720]   People ask questions like, well what about
[00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:43.280]   online dating, or can a girl pursue a guy,
[00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:45.120]   and this, I don't know, man.
[00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:48.440]   Doesn't say a lot about that.
[00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:50.720]   Like honestly, in here, there's just not a lot
[00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:51.800]   about dating.
[00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:53.440]   Like there's a little bit about marriage,
[00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:57.080]   but it's not about dating, it's about another relationship
[00:35:57.080 --> 00:36:00.080]   that's ultimate, you're gonna be with him forever
[00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:02.920]   and ever and ever.
[00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:06.160]   That's what's ultimate, and so if you make that ultimate,
[00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:08.560]   then date however you please.
[00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:09.680]   I got no fear.
[00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:12.400]   But if it's not ultimate,
[00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:16.920]   then maybe even before you date,
[00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:20.640]   before you consider dating, you think about,
[00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:21.800]   hey, how do I make that ultimate?
[00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:23.440]   Like I wanna change my life, JP.
[00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:26.840]   God, I wanna change my life.
[00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:29.560]   I'm tired of this reckless driving,
[00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:31.960]   I'm tired of beating my head against guardrails.
[00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:36.560]   I'm tired of getting these dents in my ride.
[00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:41.960]   I wanna drive straight, I want to go to him.
[00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:45.600]   I'm tired of dating these fools, these guys that hurt me.
[00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:49.260]   I hate that that girl who's no good for me has my heart.
[00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:54.860]   God, I wanna be right with you, okay?
[00:36:54.860 --> 00:36:57.740]   It's not a bunch of rules.
[00:36:57.740 --> 00:37:02.940]   You don't follow your heart, you inform your heart,
[00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:04.860]   and you tell it where it needs to go.
[00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:11.020]   Is there some principles that you should listen to?
[00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:12.940]   Yeah, but to be really honest with you,
[00:37:12.940 --> 00:37:15.180]   it's like when you're going to driver's ed,
[00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:16.780]   and you're there with the teacher,
[00:37:16.780 --> 00:37:19.180]   and they got that steering wheel on their side too
[00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:20.540]   'cause they don't trust you in those brakes,
[00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:21.500]   'cause they don't trust you,
[00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:23.620]   and you're sitting there and you're thinking through,
[00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:25.420]   and there's some rules, like there's some,
[00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:28.780]   go 35, like some laws, right, go 35 miles an hour here.
[00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:29.980]   Why, because there's some idiots
[00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:31.340]   that would drive 100 miles an hour
[00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:32.660]   through a school zone with kids, right?
[00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:35.360]   And so there has to be laws to protect some folks, right?
[00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:37.060]   But the reality of it, she's never sitting there,
[00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:38.220]   and as she's going through the things
[00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:39.740]   that you need to attend into, you know,
[00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:41.100]   and look ahead of you, she's never saying,
[00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:42.700]   hey, and by the way, there's some trees
[00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:45.620]   on the side of the road, don't hit those, okay?
[00:37:45.620 --> 00:37:47.380]   Right, because everybody's like, yeah, of course,
[00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:49.620]   she's like, whenever you're driving straight,
[00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:52.380]   whatever you do, don't jerk the wheel into an oak tree.
[00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:54.660]   You're like, yeah, why would I do that?
[00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:57.260]   That's kind of the same things to dating.
[00:37:57.260 --> 00:37:58.860]   Like there's like these big principles
[00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:01.280]   that are a little obvious.
[00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:03.140]   Hey, don't do that.
[00:38:03.140 --> 00:38:05.080]   If you don't do that, you're gonna be fine.
[00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:07.100]   I'll give 'em to you real quick, I know we're over,
[00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:09.020]   I'll give 'em to you real fast, okay?
[00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:11.900]   And so one, be honest and intentional, I said that.
[00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:14.380]   Be honest with yourself, like where are you at, right?
[00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:16.100]   Like what's going on?
[00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:18.620]   You know, if you want a 23-year-old supermodel
[00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:20.780]   who reads Greek and serves the poor and loves football,
[00:38:20.780 --> 00:38:23.820]   you know, make sure that you're looking in the mirror
[00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:25.220]   and you know where you're at.
[00:38:25.220 --> 00:38:27.900]   (congregation laughing)
[00:38:27.900 --> 00:38:29.820]   Be honest, be honest with yourself.
[00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:34.740]   Don't look at anyone not actively pursuing Christ, okay?
[00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:36.140]   That's the wrong way!
[00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:42.940]   Don't look at anyone not actively running hard after Jesus.
[00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:44.980]   It's 2 Corinthians 6, 14.
[00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:47.860]   Do not be unequally yoked with nonbelievers.
[00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:50.080]   What do light and darkness have in common?
[00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:53.300]   That's a loving God trying to save you some grief, man.
[00:38:53.300 --> 00:38:54.300]   He is trying to help you.
[00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:56.300]   For what do righteousness and wickedness have in common,
[00:38:56.300 --> 00:38:59.620]   or what fellowship can light have with darkness?
[00:38:59.620 --> 00:39:01.020]   Pursue absolute purity.
[00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:02.200]   Don't hit that tree!
[00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:05.800]   Of course, pursue, I'm not married, of course.
[00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:08.420]   Pursue purity, of course.
[00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:10.540]   You know, what can I, no!
[00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:12.260]   Get married!
[00:39:12.260 --> 00:39:13.100]   Okay, what about this?
[00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:14.340]   Is this, how far is too far?
[00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:19.020]   Don't, put a ring on the finger, that's not too far, okay?
[00:39:19.020 --> 00:39:20.540]   Do that!
[00:39:20.540 --> 00:39:23.340]   Find someone who loves Jesus and marry them.
[00:39:23.340 --> 00:39:25.220]   That's what's frustrating about this talk,
[00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:26.180]   is there's people that are like,
[00:39:26.180 --> 00:39:27.700]   hey, what are the tips and tricks, you know?
[00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:29.500]   I wanna know how to date, and really,
[00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:30.340]   what you need to hear is like,
[00:39:30.340 --> 00:39:32.140]   man, you're just not in a place where you should.
[00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:33.420]   And then there's folks that are like,
[00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:36.300]   man, I've heard the tips and tricks and the talks,
[00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:37.420]   and I've listened to so many dating talks,
[00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:39.540]   and what you need to hear is get married!
[00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:43.980]   It's time, if that's what you want, go!
[00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:45.500]   Find someone who loves Jesus, and you're like,
[00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:48.380]   JP, but I'm a girl and I'm waiting for some guy,
[00:39:48.380 --> 00:39:50.100]   you know, and I get that.
[00:39:50.100 --> 00:39:51.900]   Guys, stop being idiots.
[00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:54.420]   I love you, but man, it's game time.
[00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:57.420]   Okay, I mean that in the most affectionate way, okay?
[00:39:57.420 --> 00:39:59.460]   I mean that, 'cause I love you.
[00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:00.900]   But I'm serious.
[00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:03.180]   If you're a guy here and you love God
[00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:04.860]   with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength,
[00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:05.820]   and you're running after Him,
[00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:07.540]   look and find someone in this room
[00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:09.360]   who loves God of the opposite sex
[00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:10.740]   with all their heart, soul, mind, and strength,
[00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:12.140]   and put a ring on it.
[00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:15.180]   That's good advice, I promise.
[00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:19.340]   You're like, no, that's bad advice.
[00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:21.780]   It's not bad advice, okay?
[00:40:21.780 --> 00:40:32.660]   It just says in 27, do not swerve to the right or the left,
[00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:34.940]   but keep your foot from evil.
[00:40:34.940 --> 00:40:36.860]   I mean, here's the deal, like I wrote that blog,
[00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:38.580]   you know, 10 Things to Look For in a Guy,
[00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:40.420]   10 Things to Look For in a Woman.
[00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:42.500]   You can check that out on our website.
[00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:45.020]   But I just said it, you know, number 10,
[00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:46.060]   it's like, hey, if you get this,
[00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:47.500]   then one through nine's taken care of.
[00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:48.980]   And that's how I feel about dating.
[00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:51.140]   Like, if they have that, if they have number 10,
[00:40:51.140 --> 00:40:52.900]   like if they're pursuing Christ with their whole hearts
[00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:55.080]   and their whole lives, like all that other stuff,
[00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:55.920]   it's gonna be okay.
[00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:58.660]   There is no compatibility among sinners.
[00:40:58.660 --> 00:41:00.180]   That's us, you and me.
[00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:02.980]   There's no such thing as compatibility among us.
[00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:03.860]   There just isn't.
[00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:05.500]   We're not compatible.
[00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:07.540]   We're two selfish people coming together,
[00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:09.740]   determined to be unselfish towards each other.
[00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:12.780]   That's the reality, okay?
[00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:15.180]   And so inform your heart with truth.
[00:41:15.180 --> 00:41:17.540]   Consider who you are interested in
[00:41:17.540 --> 00:41:20.540]   and keep moving towards your destination, right?
[00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:24.580]   GPS, consider your GPS, right?
[00:41:24.580 --> 00:41:26.540]   Tell it where to go.
[00:41:26.540 --> 00:41:27.540]   The other day I was,
[00:41:27.540 --> 00:41:33.260]   I was driving back from being at my parents over Christmas.
[00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:35.520]   My parents live like six hours south of here.
[00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:41.460]   And so six, like compute this for me.
[00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:45.580]   Six hours in the car, three kids and my wife.
[00:41:45.580 --> 00:41:49.100]   My wife, that's the good part, but three kids, you know.
[00:41:49.100 --> 00:41:52.980]   One of those kids is a brand new one, a baby, infant.
[00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:56.780]   He's there, and so six hours in the car with him.
[00:41:56.780 --> 00:41:58.620]   And he's getting restless.
[00:41:58.620 --> 00:42:00.300]   And really, at about this time,
[00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:01.780]   so I'm pulling into Dallas,
[00:42:01.780 --> 00:42:03.880]   and it was like the best thing ever
[00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:05.900]   because everyone had fallen asleep.
[00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:09.620]   And I got, for Christmas, I got these Beats, earphones.
[00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:12.660]   And so I'm listening to Shane and Shane, actually,
[00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:15.180]   and to an album I just downloaded,
[00:42:15.180 --> 00:42:16.580]   and I'm just in there and I'm just worshiping.
[00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:18.500]   Like, everybody's sleeping, and I'm just,
[00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:20.820]   yeah, you know, I wanna yearn for you.
[00:42:20.820 --> 00:42:22.140]   And I'm just worshiping.
[00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:25.240]   And I'm pulling into Dallas after six hours.
[00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:27.420]   Like, it's this beautiful glow of the Dallas skyline.
[00:42:27.420 --> 00:42:29.300]   I see the ball, the Reunion Tower,
[00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:32.540]   and I see the Bank of America building and the green neons.
[00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:35.260]   I'm driving by that giant giraffe at the Dallas Zoo,
[00:42:35.260 --> 00:42:36.100]   and I'm heading over.
[00:42:36.100 --> 00:42:38.060]   And this is a drive, I've made this drive
[00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:39.160]   hundreds of times, literally.
[00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:41.460]   When I moved to Dallas, I dated Monica in Waco,
[00:42:41.460 --> 00:42:45.020]   and so I made this drive so many times, hundreds of times.
[00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:49.940]   And so here I am, I'm almost home, and I'm worshiping.
[00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:51.860]   I got my earphones in, everybody's sleeping.
[00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:54.940]   Like, it's the greatest thing ever.
[00:42:54.940 --> 00:42:56.720]   And we haven't been home for a week now.
[00:42:56.720 --> 00:42:57.940]   We had been gone.
[00:42:57.940 --> 00:42:59.140]   And so I'm just like, yes.
[00:42:59.140 --> 00:43:02.380]   And so I'm driving, and I'm worshiping,
[00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:04.260]   and I'm driving, and I'm worshiping.
[00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:08.180]   And I'm driving, and I'm driving, and I'm driving.
[00:43:08.180 --> 00:43:09.980]   And I look up.
[00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:10.980]   I'm like, Cabela's?
[00:43:10.980 --> 00:43:14.380]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:16.980]   What?
[00:43:16.980 --> 00:43:18.780]   I've never even seen that Cabela's before.
[00:43:18.780 --> 00:43:21.020]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:43:21.020 --> 00:43:22.220]   You know?
[00:43:22.220 --> 00:43:24.420]   And I'm like, what just happened?
[00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:25.060]   And I leave.
[00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:26.580]   It says, you are now leaving Keller.
[00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:27.300]   I'm like, Keller?
[00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:28.060]   Where is Keller?
[00:43:28.060 --> 00:43:30.340]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:43:30.340 --> 00:43:32.420]   Is that in Texas?
[00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:33.740]   You know?
[00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:36.260]   And Monica wakes up, and she's like, what are you doing?
[00:43:36.260 --> 00:43:37.660]   I'm like, go back to sleep, babe.
[00:43:37.660 --> 00:43:39.740]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:43:39.740 --> 00:43:42.740]   I'm like, did you know they put a Cabela's over here?
[00:43:42.740 --> 00:43:44.300]   I just wanted to see if it was open.
[00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:46.180]   It's closed.
[00:43:46.180 --> 00:43:47.900]   But yeah.
[00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:49.180]   And she's like, where are we?
[00:43:49.180 --> 00:43:50.220]   I'm like, I don't know.
[00:43:50.220 --> 00:43:53.100]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:43:53.100 --> 00:43:55.940]   And I said, OK, I'm going to need your help.
[00:43:55.940 --> 00:44:01.380]   She gets out her iPhone, put in her address, 7619.
[00:44:01.380 --> 00:44:05.340]   And it's like, OK, an hour and 23 minutes from my house.
[00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:06.700]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:08.420]   I know, I didn't tell the story up front.
[00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:10.300]   I would have lost all credibility.
[00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:13.060]   An hour and 23 minutes out of the way, I took us.
[00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:15.660]   An hour and 23 minutes.
[00:44:15.660 --> 00:44:17.260]   And I'm like, OK, but here's the deal.
[00:44:17.260 --> 00:44:18.100]   OK, I'm done.
[00:44:18.100 --> 00:44:19.740]   I'm done trying to feel this thing out.
[00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:20.780]   Like, take me home.
[00:44:20.780 --> 00:44:22.180]   I'm like, babe, you got it?
[00:44:22.180 --> 00:44:22.900]   You got it?
[00:44:22.900 --> 00:44:23.740]   We're ready?
[00:44:23.740 --> 00:44:24.580]   Let's go.
[00:44:24.580 --> 00:44:25.860]   And we're in that car together.
[00:44:25.860 --> 00:44:26.540]   She's navigating.
[00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:27.780]   She's listening to the GPS.
[00:44:27.780 --> 00:44:28.980]   She's telling us where to go.
[00:44:28.980 --> 00:44:31.580]   We're going to the same direction, the same destination.
[00:44:31.580 --> 00:44:35.380]   We're driving the same pace, her and I. And we're going.
[00:44:35.380 --> 00:44:38.420]   And we're both running towards home.
[00:44:38.420 --> 00:44:40.100]   And that's you, right?
[00:44:40.100 --> 00:44:41.020]   That's what you're doing, right?
[00:44:41.020 --> 00:44:42.540]   You've got these stops along the way.
[00:44:42.540 --> 00:44:44.940]   But if you're here, you've trusted in Christ.
[00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:47.460]   You're running home.
[00:44:47.460 --> 00:44:49.220]   You're going home.
[00:44:49.220 --> 00:44:51.300]   Find someone going home with you.
[00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:52.100]   Not tonight.
[00:44:52.100 --> 00:44:57.540]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:44:57.540 --> 00:45:02.380]   Find someone headed to that same destination,
[00:45:02.380 --> 00:45:04.140]   like with all of them.
[00:45:04.140 --> 00:45:09.420]   Not some of their life, not half their heart, but all of them.
[00:45:09.420 --> 00:45:11.780]   Say, hey, man, let's navigate these waters together.
[00:45:11.780 --> 00:45:13.220]   Let's go.
[00:45:13.220 --> 00:45:15.660]   Let's rock.
[00:45:15.660 --> 00:45:16.180]   Let me pray.
[00:45:16.180 --> 00:45:33.460]   Father, the things I said that were not of you, erase them.
[00:45:33.460 --> 00:45:35.980]   Please, God.
[00:45:35.980 --> 00:45:38.180]   And Father, the things that I said that were consistent with
[00:45:38.180 --> 00:45:42.500]   your spirit and your character and who you are, the exegesis
[00:45:42.500 --> 00:45:46.140]   of your word and the truth from your scriptures made alive to
[00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:47.540]   us by the power of your spirit.
[00:45:47.540 --> 00:45:50.220]   Lord, I pray they would stir in our hearts and our minds,
[00:45:50.220 --> 00:45:53.140]   Father, that we would know what they are, that we would
[00:45:53.140 --> 00:45:53.780]   yield to them.
[00:45:53.780 --> 00:45:55.860]   I know there's folks frustrated right now.
[00:45:55.860 --> 00:45:56.740]   But he didn't address.
[00:45:56.740 --> 00:45:57.820]   I know.
[00:45:57.820 --> 00:46:04.260]   God, would you remind them of the truth they need to hear?
[00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:08.180]   Would you, in your sovereignty, move in and fill
[00:46:08.180 --> 00:46:14.620]   the voids that my teaching leaves?
[00:46:14.620 --> 00:46:16.660]   Father, would you stir our hearts and our minds around the
[00:46:16.660 --> 00:46:17.900]   truths we need to hear?
[00:46:17.900 --> 00:46:22.020]   And God, would you make us new?
[00:46:22.020 --> 00:46:24.580]   There's some folks tonight that just need to be made new.
[00:46:24.580 --> 00:46:27.420]   Lord, thank you for the way you made me new and others in my
[00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:27.940]   life new.
[00:46:27.940 --> 00:46:29.740]   And I just pray you'd make them new, that your spirit would
[00:46:29.740 --> 00:46:31.980]   make them new.
[00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:35.460]   You remind them how much you love them through Christ.
[00:46:35.460 --> 00:46:36.700]   We sing to you now.
[00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:44.860]   Hope that I have for you is like, I don't care how far off
[00:46:44.860 --> 00:46:46.700]   the path you are.
[00:46:46.700 --> 00:46:49.660]   You can return to it right now.
[00:46:49.660 --> 00:46:56.460]   Just go and say, God, conform this wretched device in me to
[00:46:56.460 --> 00:46:57.340]   that of your son.
[00:46:57.340 --> 00:47:01.620]   Give me a new one to pursue the things that you desire for me.
[00:47:01.620 --> 00:47:05.940]   Because God, you're a holy and a good and amazing God.
[00:47:05.940 --> 00:47:08.420]   And you desire good things for your children.
[00:47:08.420 --> 00:47:12.340]   And so I pray that this thing in all of us would pursue the
[00:47:12.340 --> 00:47:15.460]   things of you.
[00:47:15.460 --> 00:47:22.580]   Help us, God, to reprogram our broken GPS devices.
[00:47:22.580 --> 00:47:25.900]   Father, give us new ones that work.
[00:47:25.900 --> 00:47:29.580]   Lord, help us to set the destination on you.
[00:47:29.580 --> 00:47:31.300]   Amen.
[00:47:31.300 --> 00:47:31.820]   I do.
[00:47:31.820 --> 00:47:34.100]   I want you to leave it with that hope.
[00:47:34.100 --> 00:47:35.860]   Wherever you're at, whatever you look behind you, there's
[00:47:35.860 --> 00:47:38.620]   broken cars, and maybe you're just the person here that
[00:47:38.620 --> 00:47:41.580]   knows that you want something that's not
[00:47:41.580 --> 00:47:44.140]   available to you so bad.
[00:47:44.140 --> 00:47:45.380]   Just go to that heart.
[00:47:45.380 --> 00:47:47.340]   Say, God, would you reprogram it?
[00:47:47.340 --> 00:47:48.860]   Father, would you give me a new one?
[00:47:48.860 --> 00:47:54.780]   Would you set it on you and return to the path and walk one
[00:47:54.780 --> 00:47:58.580]   foot in front of the other towards him?
[00:47:58.580 --> 00:48:00.260]   OK.
[00:48:00.260 --> 00:48:02.940]   If we can help you do that, we want to.
[00:48:02.940 --> 00:48:05.420]   We have this deal tonight called Open Community Group.
[00:48:05.420 --> 00:48:07.140]   And so if you're here and you're just like, man, I just
[00:48:07.140 --> 00:48:10.740]   need some friends who are believers, OK?
[00:48:10.740 --> 00:48:13.020]   And particularly--
[00:48:13.020 --> 00:48:14.580]   yeah, I'll start there.
[00:48:14.580 --> 00:48:18.180]   If you are looking for some friends who are believers,
[00:48:18.180 --> 00:48:21.100]   it's a community, you're committed to that idea, or you
[00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:23.420]   want to hear a vision on it, you want to hear what it is,
[00:48:23.420 --> 00:48:26.740]   then guys, you can go to this room right here, right through
[00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:27.060]   this door.
[00:48:27.060 --> 00:48:30.340]   You can walk forward and then go through that room as soon
[00:48:30.340 --> 00:48:31.180]   as we're done here.
[00:48:31.180 --> 00:48:33.220]   And girls, you can go through that door right there, and
[00:48:33.220 --> 00:48:34.580]   there's a glass room right there.
[00:48:34.580 --> 00:48:37.420]   And this will be full of other girls who are saying, hey, I'm
[00:48:37.420 --> 00:48:40.100]   looking for some friends, looking for community.
[00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:42.580]   Some full of some guys over here, they're saying, hey, I'm
[00:48:42.580 --> 00:48:45.740]   looking for some friends who are looking for community.
[00:48:45.740 --> 00:48:48.540]   And our community team's going to be in there to talk with
[00:48:48.540 --> 00:48:49.900]   you through that.
[00:48:49.900 --> 00:48:52.060]   Also, if you have these questions, you're like, man,
[00:48:52.060 --> 00:48:53.380]   he didn't cover my question.
[00:48:53.380 --> 00:48:54.460]   One, we've got two weeks left.
[00:48:54.460 --> 00:48:57.020]   Two, we have the Google+ Hangout tomorrow.
[00:48:57.020 --> 00:48:59.180]   We're going to broadcast that on the internet.
[00:48:59.180 --> 00:49:01.540]   And so I think it's at 9--
[00:49:01.540 --> 00:49:02.700]   what time is it?
[00:49:02.700 --> 00:49:03.740]   1130.
[00:49:03.740 --> 00:49:05.380]   But then also, we're going to record it.
[00:49:05.380 --> 00:49:06.540]   And so it will be online.
[00:49:06.540 --> 00:49:08.980]   And so you can tweet your questions into us or put them
[00:49:08.980 --> 00:49:12.140]   on Facebook, and we will do our best to cover those
[00:49:12.140 --> 00:49:15.180]   questions in that interview tomorrow.
[00:49:15.180 --> 00:49:17.140]   I love you guys.
[00:49:17.140 --> 00:49:18.580]   I hope you know and understand that.
[00:49:18.580 --> 00:49:20.060]   I hope more than that.
[00:49:20.060 --> 00:49:21.860]   If you don't know that I love you, know that God does.
[00:49:21.860 --> 00:49:25.900]   He's crazy about you, and he desires good things for you.
[00:49:25.900 --> 00:49:27.660]   So go in peace to love and serve the Lord.
[00:49:27.980 --> 00:49:34.060]   [END VIDEO PLAYBACK]
