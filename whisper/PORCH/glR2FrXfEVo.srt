 move yourself to a position of cover.

 We saw about 1,200 little kids in Vanuatu Bay

00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,920
 were in fact trafficked, and they were in fact slaves.

 These little kids were on this boat.

00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:37,420
 They are not fed.

13
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:39,420
 They are abused beyond imagination.

 Whenever something like this comes,

17
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:55,420
 I imagine in my mind that girl is found.

 rescuing people from slavery.

00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,420

 Yeah, yeah, I'm going to pay.

 Criminals prey on the easiest target, the world's poor,

 Nice to be with you.

 JP, such a thrill to get to be here

44
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:18,920
 with this family of weirdos, I guess Shane said.

45
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,420
 That's all right.

46
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:25,420
 You know, I obviously don't know where all of you

47
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:28,920
 individually might be in your own journey of trying

48
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,420
 to follow Christ, get to know Him,

49
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,920
 get to know the God who made you.

50
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,420
 But I feel like I've been trying to follow Jesus

51
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:39,420
 for a long time.

52
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:43,420
 But I still find myself very much challenged

53
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:46,420
 by a really simple question.

54
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,420
 And that's simply this.

55
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:54,420
 Are Jesus and I really interested in the same things?

56
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,420
 I mean, I know what I'm interested in,

57
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,420
 and you know what you're interested in.

58
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:00,420
 We could probably make lists of all those things.

59
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,420
 But what if tonight, just for a moment,

60
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:06,420
 we just set all of those lists aside?

61
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,420
 And what if we asked from first principles,

62
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:12,920
 but what is God passionate about?

63
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:17,920
 What makes His heart just beat fast?

64
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,420
 And in fact, could people know what God is interested in

65
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:25,920
 by what it is that we're interested in?

66
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,420
 Tonight, I would just like to spend a few minutes

67
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:33,920
 sharing about two of the more unfamiliar passions of God.

68
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,920
 And that's first, His passion for the world.

69
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,420
 Then secondly, His passion for justice.

70
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:44,420
 First, God's passion for the world.

71
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,920
 Anybody who went to Sunday school,

72
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,920
 you would have learned John 3:16, right?

73
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,420
 That says, "For God so loved the world

74
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,920
 "that He gave His only begotten Son,

75
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,920
 "that whosoever would believe in Him would not perish,

76
00:03:58,920 --> 00:03:59,920
 "but have eternal life."

77
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,420
 What that says is that the incarnation,

78
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,420
 the coming of Jesus into the world,

79
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:09,420
 was motivated by God's love for the world.

80
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:10,420
 And by the world, of course,

81
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:12,920
 He doesn't mean the big, beautiful dirt cloth

82
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,420
 that's the earth.

83
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,420
 It's the love for all the people,

84
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,420
 all these bazillions of people

85
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:22,420
 that are stretched across all these confusing continents

86
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:24,420
 and cultures.

87
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:28,420
 This is actually what God loves.

88
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:33,420
 He loves this great big huge world.

89
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:35,420
 Now by contrast, what do I love?

90
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:38,420
 What am I interested in?

91
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:39,920
 Well, to tell you the truth,

92
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:47,420
 I am completely interested and passionate about me.

93
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:50,420
 I love me.

94
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:53,420
 I'm fascinated by me, like every day.

95
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,420
 I don't have to wake up in the morning like,

96
00:04:55,420 --> 00:05:00,420
 "Oh, whoa, Gary, don't forget to think about yourself today."

97
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:04,420
 Now my pastor does tell me this is more narrow than I should be,

98
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:07,420
 so I'm trying to broaden my heart out a little bit, right?

99
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:11,420
 And on a really good day, I will actually find myself

100
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:14,420
 extending love and compassion

101
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:20,420
 to everybody in the world who's in my family.

102
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:23,420
 This is a pretty good day in my household, actually,

103
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:26,420
 where I'll extend more love and compassion to my wife

104
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:30,420
 and my four kids than I do to myself.

105
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:33,420
 And they usually circle that day on the calendar.

106
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:38,420
 And they pray it might happen again next year sometime, right?

107
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,420
 And then I might have some, I don't know,

108
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:42,420
 larger spiritual experience,

109
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:45,420
 and I will find my heart beginning to grow,

110
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:48,420
 and I will find myself extending love and compassion

111
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:53,420
 to everybody in the world that I like

112
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:58,420
 and who likes me and who is like me.

113
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:02,420
 And this then becomes my world of, like, passion and energy and focus, right?

114
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:09,420
 But it's this little shriveled world of me and mine.

115
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:12,420
 Now, I think Jesus probably finds this totally understandable.

116
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:15,420
 This is totally natural.

117
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:18,420
 But I don't think everything that's natural and understandable

118
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:22,420
 is necessarily godly.

119
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:26,420
 So maybe at least we here together tonight,

120
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:30,420
 and all those, I guess, who are joining us online and so forth,

121
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,420
 maybe at least we together who are tuned in right now,

122
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:36,420
 we can agree at least upon what the goal is.

123
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:38,420
 And our hearts may not be there yet,

124
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,420
 but isn't the goal to have a heart

125
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:44,420
 that's becoming more like the heart of God,

126
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:50,420
 that maybe shares something of his love and passion for the world?

127
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:57,420
 Now, this came home to me in an incredibly personal way

128
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:01,420
 when I was not much older than most of you.

129
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:07,420
 In 1994, I was 31 years old,

130
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:10,420
 and I was a fairly new federal prosecutor

131
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:14,420
 working for the U.S. Department of Justice.

132
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:20,420
 But in 1994, this horrific genocide broke out in our world.

133
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:25,420
 Some of you might have heard about the Rwandan genocide of 1994.

134
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:29,420
 You've seen the movie "Hotel Rwanda" or something.

135
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:32,420
 In this little country that most of us had never heard about,

136
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:34,420
 this horrific genocide broke out,

137
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:41,420
 and about 800,000 people were murdered in about eight weeks' time.

138
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:44,420
 And when it was over with, the international community

139
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:48,420
 wanted to try to bring the leaders of the genocide to justice,

140
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:51,420
 and so I was sent over to be the director

141
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:56,420
 of the UN's genocide investigation in 1994.

142
00:07:56,420 --> 00:08:01,420
 And I was given a list of about 100 different mass graves

143
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:04,420
 and massacre sites.

144
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:07,420
 And it's interesting because all murder investigations

145
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:10,420
 just begin with where the bodies are.

146
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:13,420
 And most of the bodies were actually in churches

147
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:17,420
 because the Tutsi minority had run to the churches for sanctuary,

148
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:20,420
 but then their Hutu neighbors just waded into them

149
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:24,420
 and just hacked them all to death.

150
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:27,420
 And so I would spend my days just sorting through

151
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:33,420
 thousands and thousands of butchered people.

152
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:36,420
 The worst part of it, though, for me, honestly,

153
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:38,420
 was having to interview the survivors,

154
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:41,420
 and especially these little kids

155
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:44,420
 who had survived some of these massacres.

156
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:47,420
 And I'll never forget, I had to interview a little 8-year-old girl

157
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:52,420
 who had survived a massacre that had taken place in this church,

158
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:57,420
 and she had actually lay amongst the dead for about three days.

159
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:02,420
 And she made her way out, and she hid in the forest for a long time.

160
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:05,420
 And so I'm sitting down with her at this little table,

161
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,420
 and she's just across the table from me,

162
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:13,420
 and I'm trying to get her story out of her.

163
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:16,420
 And the first thing that I noticed about her was really

164
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,420
 the first thing you would have noticed,

165
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:22,420
 was just how beautiful she was.

166
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:26,420
 She had these eyes that still somehow had this sparkle to them,

167
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:30,420
 and then she'd say something funny to make herself laugh,

168
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:34,420
 and then these white teeth would just burst across her face.

169
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:38,420
 And she was just gorgeous.

170
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,420
 And I remember looking across the table

171
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:43,420
 at this little 8-year-old Rwandan girl

172
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:47,420
 when it occurred to me in a way that I had never honestly thought of before,

173
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:51,420
 that the maker of the entire universe

174
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:58,420
 at some point decided that this little girl should exist.

175
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:03,420
 And while he's making galaxies and all kinds of stars and suns all across--

176
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,420
 he's going, "Wait, wait, wait.

177
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:10,420
 "No way, I want to make this little girl.

178
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,420
 "And not only do I want her to exist,

179
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:18,420
 "I want her to exist to be with me forever.

180
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:21,420
 "And I want this little Rwandan girl to be with me forever

181
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:25,420
 "so desperately that I'm willing to give up my own son

182
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:28,420
 "to have him tortured and murdered

183
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:37,420
 "so that this little Rwandan girl will be with me forever."

184
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:41,420
 And suddenly I was just blown away by the cosmic significance

185
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:45,420
 of this one little 8-year-old Rwandan girl.

186
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:48,420
 But I knew from the pink machete scars

187
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:52,420
 across the back of her head and her neck

188
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:55,420
 that she was just about a millimeter of machete blow

189
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:58,420
 from being part of just that huge pile of corpses

190
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:03,420
 we'd been sorting through outside the church.

191
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:08,420
 And then it occurred to me that 800,000 other Rwandans

192
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:12,420
 who were just as precious to God as that little girl,

193
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,420
 they could just drop off the face of the earth

194
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:17,420
 one summer in 1994.

195
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:20,420
 And for me as an American Christian, honestly,

196
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:26,420
 it wouldn't impact my day at all.

197
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:29,420
 So as this 31-year-old, I just started to sense

198
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:31,420
 that there was a significant difference

199
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:34,420
 between the way Jesus was regarding the world

200
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:39,420
 and the way I was regarding the world.

201
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,420
 And I just didn't want to miss out

202
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:44,420
 on what mattered so much to my Heavenly Father.

203
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:46,420
 And so it's been this journey now for me

204
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:49,420
 to try to open up the borders of my heart, right,

205
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:52,420
 beyond this shriveled world of just me and mine,

206
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,420
 and try to share something of His love and passion

207
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,420
 for the world.

208
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,420
 But you know, it's been interesting

209
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:00,420
 because as you go into this world

210
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:05,420
 and you try to share the love of God with this world,

211
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:08,420
 what do you think is probably the most difficult thing

212
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:11,420
 for people in our world to believe

213
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:15,420
 about the Christian faith?

214
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:20,420
 I think it's simply the idea that God is good

215
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:23,420
 'cause they're in so much pain.

216
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:27,420
 You know, there's 10,000 kids who died in our world today.

217
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:32,420
 Why? Because their parents couldn't get them enough food.

218
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,420
 And so while those parents are watching their kids

219
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,420
 pass away from hunger, how somehow are they supposed

220
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:41,420
 to believe that God is so good?

221
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:44,420
 Or what about the 1.5 billion people on our globe

222
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:47,420
 who have no access to medical care?

223
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:49,420
 Right, they're not arguing about whether or not

224
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,420
 their medical plan will allow them

225
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:52,420
 to choose their doctor or not, right?

226
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:54,420
 They'll never see a doctor.

227
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,420
 And so when their kids are hurting,

228
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,420
 they know there's medicine in the world,

229
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:00,420
 but for some reason they don't ever get it.

230
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,420
 Like how are they supposed to somehow believe

231
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:05,420
 that there's a God that is so loving?

232
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,420
 Or there's hundreds of thousands of kids

233
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,420
 who woke up this morning on the streets

234
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:13,420
 of the big urban centers just abandoned and alone.

235
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:16,420
 How today are they supposed to find it believable

236
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,420
 that God is good?

237
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:19,420
 You ever think about this?

238
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:22,420
 And in fact, what is God's plan

239
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:25,420
 for making it believable that he is good

240
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:30,420
 for those who are hurting so much in our world?

241
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,420
 Well, it turns out the answer in the Bible

242
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:34,420
 is a little bit surprising 'cause it turns out

243
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:38,420
 that we're the plan

244
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:43,420
 and that he doesn't have another plan.

245
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,420
 Jesus said one of the most extraordinary things

246
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:48,420
 in Matthew chapter five when he's speaking to us,

247
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,420
 his disciples, he says,

248
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:55,420
 "You are the light of the world.

249
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:58,420
 Let your light so shine among men

250
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:01,420
 that they will see your good works,

251
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,420
 and then they'll give glory to your Father

252
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:06,420
 who is in heaven."

253
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:09,420
 I love this because you'll notice he doesn't say,

254
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:13,420
 "You might be the light of the world.

255
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:16,420
 You could be the light of the world.

256
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:20,420
 I hope you turn out to be the light of the world."

257
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:26,420
 Jesus says to us, "You're it."

258
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:28,420
 The apostle Paul says something very similar

259
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:30,420
 that is so staggering.

260
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:33,420
 In 2 Corinthians 5:20 he says,

261
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,420
 "We are therefore Christ's ambassadors

262
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:41,420
 as though God were making his appeal through us."

263
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:47,420
 God is making his appeal to the world through us.

264
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:50,420
 So anybody who woke up this morning, honestly,

265
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:53,420
 wondering about the significance of your existence,

266
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:57,420
 God Almighty has decided to put his reputation

267
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:03,420
 on the line through your life.

268
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:05,420
 And so for 2,000 years,

269
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,420
 Christians have been trying to make it believable

270
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,420
 that God is good.

271
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:10,420
 How do they do it?

272
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:13,420
 By going to people who are suffering and hurting

273
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:16,420
 and showing them the goodness of God.

274
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:18,420
 So if people are hurting because they've never heard

275
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:21,420
 that God loves them and that Christ died for them,

276
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,420
 we're the ones who actually get to go

277
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:25,420
 and share the good news with them.

278
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:27,420
 And if others are suffering because they don't have food,

279
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:30,420
 well, for heaven's sakes, we can go share ours with them.

280
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,420
 And if others are suffering because they don't have

281
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:33,420
 medical care, we can help them with that.

282
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:36,420
 And when we do these things,

283
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:39,420
 they see the body of Christ,

284
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,420
 which is what we're called,

285
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:45,420
 they see the body of Christ actually show up.

286
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:50,420
 And it becomes believable to them that God is good.

287
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,420
 But it's interesting because there's actually

288
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:55,420
 another kind of suffering in our world.

289
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:58,420
 And it's interesting to me because they're not suffering

290
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:00,420
 because they don't have access to food

291
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:03,420
 or doctors or medicine or shelter.

292
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,420
 These are the people who are suffering in our world

293
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:09,420
 because of the intentional abuse

294
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:13,420
 and oppression of other people.

295
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:17,420
 These are what we call the victims of injustice in our world.

296
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:19,420
 Of course, I don't know about you,

297
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:20,420
 but I sort of feel like the world,

298
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:23,420
 I mean, the word injustice has become pretty useless, right?

299
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:26,420
 Because it means everything and nothing at all.

300
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,420
 And as an American, I pretty much feel like

301
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:32,420
 I'm a victim of injustice like every day, all day, practically.

302
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:34,420
 Like I'm at the grocery store the other day

303
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:38,420
 and I'm always in the express lane, right?

304
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:41,420
 And I'm a very busy guy, so I'm in the express line,

305
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:42,420
 optimizing everything here.

306
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,420
 But there's rules about the express lane,

307
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,420
 and I don't know what it is in your grocery store,

308
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:48,420
 but in my grocery store, big fat sign,

309
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:51,420
 it says 10 items only.

310
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,420
 So I'm there the other day, I got my grocery cart,

311
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:57,420
 and I got my 10 items.

312
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:03,420
 Guy in front of me, 13 items?

313
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:06,420
 He's totally jamming up the express lane.

314
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:08,420
 He's totally breaking the law, too.

315
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:10,420
 And I'm getting so mad, I want to sue the guy, right?

316
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:12,420
 And I'm a lawyer and I could do this,

317
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:17,420
 like, let's do justice now.

318
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:18,420
 Well, just so you know,

319
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:22,420
 when the Bible talks about injustice,

320
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:26,420
 this is not what it's talking about.

321
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:32,420
 Injustice in the Bible is actually a particular kind of sin.

322
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:36,420
 Injustice is about the abuse of power.

323
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:40,420
 The abuse of power to take from someone else

324
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,420
 what God intended for them.

325
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:47,420
 Their life, their liberty, their dignity,

326
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:50,420
 the fruit of their love and their labor.

327
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:52,420
 And when someone is stronger,

328
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:55,420
 abuses that power to take those things away,

329
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:56,420
 just 'cause they can,

330
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:59,420
 God calls this the sin of injustice.

331
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,420
 This is the sin that King David committed.

332
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:04,420
 You might remember this Bible story,

333
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:07,420
 when this king abused his power as king

334
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:10,420
 to steal another man's wife.

335
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:15,420
 And then he used his power to steal that man's life.

336
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:17,420
 And the prophet Nathan had to confront him

337
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:21,420
 for his abuse of power.

338
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:26,420
 But what does injustice look like in our world today?

339
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:28,420
 Well, we will all have some idea of that

340
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:31,420
 in our own community and in our own country,

341
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,420
 in our own state.

342
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:35,420
 But what does that look like in the world?

343
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:39,420
 Well, in 1997, three years after that experience in Rwanda,

344
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:42,420
 I and some friends helped form together

345
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:45,420
 this ministry called International Justice Mission.

346
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:48,420
 And we're a collection of criminal investigators

347
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,420
 and lawyers and social workers.

348
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:53,420
 And we take on individual cases

349
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:55,420
 of violent abuse and oppression

350
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:58,420
 in the poorest communities in the developing world.

351
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:02,420
 And there's now a thousand of these workers

352
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:05,420
 in the poorest parts of the world.

353
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:09,420
 There are local Kenyans and Peruvians

354
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:10,420
 and Bolivians and Cambodians,

355
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,420
 and they are followers of Jesus

356
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:14,420
 and they are fighting for justice

357
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,420
 in their own communities.

358
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,420
 And now after 20 years,

359
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,420
 I have a pretty clear idea

360
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:21,420
 of what injustice looks like in our world.

361
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:24,420
 And I'll never forget meeting this young boy

362
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:27,420
 in India named Kumar.

363
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:31,420
 Now Kumar lived in a poor rural area

364
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:34,420
 and at the age of five, his parents passed away.

365
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:36,420
 So he's left orphanage.

366
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:38,420
 And then by the age of eight,

367
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:43,420
 he finds himself sold into a brick factory as a slave.

368
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:45,420
 Not a metaphorical slave, actual slave.

369
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,420
 This is the way Kumar lives his life.

370
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:51,420
 He works seven days a week, 12 to 14 hours a day,

371
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:54,420
 making and carrying bricks.

372
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:56,420
 There's about 70 other slaves

373
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:58,420
 that are held in this compound

374
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:01,420
 and they are forced to work by the sheer force of terror.

375
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:04,420
 Even on days where Kumar was too sick to work,

376
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:06,420
 the owner would just kick him in the head

377
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:08,420
 and force him back to work.

378
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:11,420
 When people run away from the facility,

379
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,420
 they are chased down by the thugs

380
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,420
 that the slave owner controls

381
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,420
 and they are brought back

382
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:19,420
 and beaten in front of the others.

383
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:22,420
 So Kumar is clear about where he's gonna spend

384
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:24,420
 the rest of his life.

385
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:28,420
 Do you know that there are about 14 million

386
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:32,420
 held in slavery in India alone in our world?

387
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:35,420
 Globally, there's about 40 million people

388
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:37,420
 held illegally in slavery,

389
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:40,420
 more than in any other time in human history.

390
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,420
 And so here's my question to you.

391
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,420
 How today is Kumar

392
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:48,420
 and 40 million people in slavery in 2018

393
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:52,420
 how are they somehow supposed to find it believable

394
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:55,420
 that there's a good God in our world?

395
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:58,420
 How's that supposed to seem plausible?

396
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,420
 Or what about Alina?

397
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:01,420
 Alina, I met in the Philippines

398
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,420
 when she was just 11 years old.

399
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:05,420
 She was also living in a poor community

400
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:06,420
 in a rural town

401
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:10,420
 when she was horrifically sexually assaulted.

402
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:13,420
 And the thing that made it so painful

403
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:16,420
 and brutal was that the man who committed the rape

404
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:20,420
 was actually the chief of police in her town.

405
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:23,420
 We work in communities in the developing world

406
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:25,420
 where there's just an epidemic of sexual violence

407
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:27,420
 against women and girls.

408
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:30,420
 Where up to 40% of girls will be victims of rape

409
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:34,420
 or attempted rape before the age of 14.

410
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:36,420
 And so how, again, is Alina,

411
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,420
 how are all of these other girls

412
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:42,420
 who just find themselves completely unprotected

413
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:43,420
 from such violent abuse,

414
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:45,420
 how are they supposed to find it believable

415
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:48,420
 that there's a God who loves them?

416
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:49,420
 Or what about Jyoti?

417
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:53,420
 I met Jyoti likewise in India.

418
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:58,420
 She lived in a rural village with her family.

419
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:00,420
 She's an earnest 16-year-old teenager

420
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:01,420
 trying to help as she can

421
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:04,420
 for the family to survive economically.

422
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:06,420
 And one day some women came to her and said,

423
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:08,420
 "Hey, Jyoti, why don't you come with us

424
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:10,420
 "to the big city of Mumbai?

425
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:12,420
 "We can get you a job and a restaurant there

426
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:14,420
 "and you can send some of that money home."

427
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:16,420
 And so without telling her parents,

428
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:19,420
 Jyoti goes with these women.

429
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:20,420
 But on the journey there,

430
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:23,420
 they give her some tea that's been drugged.

431
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:26,420
 She falls unconscious.

432
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:29,420
 She's not taken to a nice job in Mumbai.

433
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:30,420
 She's taken to the red light district

434
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:35,420
 and sold into a brothel for about 250 bucks.

435
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,420
 And she's stuffed into this underground room

436
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:38,420
 underneath the brothel

437
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,420
 and she's just beaten for three days

438
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:42,420
 with plastic pipes and electrical cords

439
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:44,420
 and a lot of rods

440
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:45,420
 until she's forced to provide services

441
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:48,420
 to the customers there.

442
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:52,420
 Jyoti, this teenager, services about 30 men a day,

443
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:53,420
 seven days a week,

444
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:56,420
 never let outside of this problem.

445
00:22:56,420 --> 00:23:00,420
 UNICEF tells us that there are about 2 million children

446
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:03,420
 held in forced prostitution in our world.

447
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:06,420
 So the question that would always just hit me is,

448
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:08,420
 how are they supposed to find it believable

449
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,420
 that God is good?

450
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:15,420
 How does God, this God that we worship here together,

451
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:20,420
 how does he regard all of this suffering and abuse?

452
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:22,420
 Well, fortunately, the Bible is not shy

453
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:24,420
 about talking about this.

454
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,420
 I love my Bible because it is real.

455
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:30,420
 And I remember being in Rwanda,

456
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:32,420
 being knee deep in these mass graves

457
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:36,420
 when I discovered Psalm 10,

458
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:39,420
 which I'm sure I would have read in church at some point,

459
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:41,420
 but it started with this question

460
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,420
 that I found just so powerful.

461
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,420
 Psalm 10 starts out,

462
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:47,420
 "Why, O Lord, do you stand far off?

463
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:49,420
 "Why do you hide yourself in times of trouble?

464
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:53,420
 "In arrogance the wicked man hunts down the weak

465
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:56,420
 "who is caught in the schemes he devises."

466
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:58,420
 And then it goes on to describe so vividly

467
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:01,420
 what I was seeing in Rwanda.

468
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:03,420
 "He lies in wait near the villages.

469
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:05,420
 "From ambush he murders the innocent,

470
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:08,420
 "his eyes watch in secret for his victim.

471
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:10,420
 "Like a lion in cover, he lies in wait.

472
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:12,420
 "He lies in wait to catch the helpless.

473
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:14,420
 "He catches the helpless, and the helpless,

474
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:17,420
 "and drags them off in his net.

475
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:19,420
 "The victims are crushed, they collapse,

476
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,420
 "they fall under his strength.

477
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:23,420
 "He says to himself, 'God will never notice.'

478
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:28,420
 "He covers his face and never sees."

479
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:34,420
 The Bible is really clear about the state of our world,

480
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:36,420
 but it's also clear about the nature of our God.

481
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:38,420
 And here's how the psalmist sums it up.

482
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:44,420
 He says, "You, Lord, the Lord is king forever and ever.

483
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:46,420
 "The nations will perish from his land.

484
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:50,420
 "You, Lord, hear the desire of the afflicted.

485
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:53,420
 "You encourage them and you listen to their cry,

486
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:55,420
 "defending the fatherless and the oppressed

487
00:24:55,420 --> 00:25:01,420
 "so that man who is of the earth may strike terror no more."

488
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:03,420
 We could go to scripture after scripture where it's clear

489
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:08,420
 God hates this kind of abuse, and he wants it to stop.

490
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:11,420
 Psalm 35 says, "Oh, God, who is like you?

491
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:17,420
 "You rescue the weak from those who are too strong for them."

492
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:19,420
 Over and over and over again, the heart of God is clear.

493
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:25,420
 He wants the abuse and the violence to stop.

494
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:27,420
 But that's just always raised another question in my mind,

495
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:29,420
 which is, "Well, that's good news, but God,

496
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:36,420
 "what's your plan for actually doing so?"

497
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:39,420
 And then again, the answer from the Bible that comes back to me

498
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:47,420
 is totally surprising because it turns out that we're the plan.

499
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:52,420
 And that God Almighty doesn't have another plan.

500
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:57,420
 Micah 6, verse 8, it says, "He has told you, O man, O woman,

501
00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:01,420
 "what is good and what does the Lord require of you?

502
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:04,420
 "But to do justice, to love mercy,

503
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:06,420
 "and walk humbly with your God."

504
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:10,420
 Isaiah 117 says, "Seek justice, rescue the oppressed,

505
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:13,420
 "defend the orphan, plead for the widow."

506
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:15,420
 For those of us who take the Bible seriously, honestly,

507
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:20,420
 there can be no doubt that God has given to us, his people,

508
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:24,420
 the work of justice in the world.

509
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:27,420
 But notice our response, my response, when I find out that,

510
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:32,420
 like, we're the plan for doing justice and rescuing the victims

511
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:34,420
 of violence and abuse in our world, it's like,

512
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:37,420
 "Okay, God, we're just brainstorming here,

513
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:42,420
 "and, like, no ideas are bad, but that's a bad plan."

514
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:44,420
 So, like, if we're pretty good at, like, the evangelism

515
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:47,420
 and the food stuff, but, like, the violent part, like,

516
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:50,420
 if we're not really into that, like,

517
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:56,420
 what's plan B on that one?

518
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:59,420
 There's no plan B.

519
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:02,420
 We're it.

520
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:04,420
 But we feel so powerless, don't we?

521
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:06,420
 We hear these stories and these statistics,

522
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:10,420
 and we can feel just bolted to our chair with despair

523
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:13,420
 because we feel so powerless.

524
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:16,420
 And in those moments, I would just hope we could remember

525
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:19,420
 these stories from the Gospels when the disciples

526
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:21,420
 felt exactly the same way.

527
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:25,420
 And my favorite is the story of the feeding of the 5,000.

528
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:27,420
 You may have heard this story before, but it has a great

529
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:30,420
 beginning to it, I think, because Jesus has been talking

530
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,420
 for a long time.

531
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:33,420
 He's been teaching and teaching and teaching.

532
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:35,420
 And people are starting to get hungry and restless,

533
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:38,420
 and so the disciples go to Jesus, and they say,

534
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:42,420
 "Hey, Jesus, why don't you send everybody home

535
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:45,420
 "so they can get themselves fed?"

536
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:47,420
 Well, Jesus doesn't want to miss out on the fun

537
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:49,420
 of this particular situation, so he says to the disciples

538
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:55,420
 very clearly, "No, no, guys, you feed them."

539
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:57,420
 Now, the part I love about the disciples is that they're

540
00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:01,420
 always so patient to explain to Jesus what he clearly

541
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:04,420
 doesn't understand about the situation.

542
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:12,420
 And they say, "Oh, Jesus, see, there's 5,000 hungry people here,

543
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:16,420
 "and it would take a half year's wages to be able to feed them."

544
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:18,420
 They get out the whiteboard, and they're drawing,

545
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:23,420
 and they say, "Half year's wages, can't feed them.

546
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:29,420
 "Back to you, Super Jesus."

547
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:31,420
 What does Jesus say?

548
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,420
 Pretty interesting.

549
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:41,420
 He says, "Well, what do you have?"

550
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,420
 Well, they don't have nothing, so they have to bring

551
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:45,420
 what they do have, which, according to the story,

552
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:48,420
 this little boy who's got his sack lunch that his mom

553
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:52,420
 had packed for him to go hear Jesus, and this little kid

554
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:56,420
 has this sack lunch that has five loaves and two fish in it.

555
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:59,420
 And this is presented as the corporate resources

556
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:02,420
 to be able to meet this massive need.

557
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:06,420
 And this is when the apostle Andrew enters the conversation.

558
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:10,420
 He's got a graduate degree from SMU or something,

559
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:14,420
 not a very good athlete, but he's really smart.

560
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:20,420
 And so he looks at the five loaves and two fish,

561
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:27,420
 and he says, "What are these among so many?"

562
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:31,420
 You see, honestly, this would have been me in the story,

563
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:36,420
 because I went to college, and I took a math course.

564
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:39,420
 And you've got 5,000 hungry people and five loaves

565
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:41,420
 and two fish.

566
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:45,420
 And honestly, if you were as sophisticated as I am,

567
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:49,420
 and if you took the sociology course that I took,

568
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:51,420
 you'd really know that there's nothing for us to do

569
00:29:51,420 --> 00:30:01,420
 but to sit in the paralysis of despair.

570
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:04,420
 But what does Jesus say?

571
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:08,420
 He says, "Give it to me."

572
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:12,420
 And in that moment, Jesus takes responsibility

573
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:17,420
 for the miracle, and he proceeds to feed 5,000 people

574
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:20,420
 to overflowing.

575
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:25,420
 Do you notice he didn't ask the disciples if they had enough?

576
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:29,420
 He didn't ask the disciples to do the miracle.

577
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:32,420
 He just asked them, "What do you have,

578
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:38,420
 and will you give it to me so that I can do the miracle?"

579
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:42,420
 And can I just tell you this as your little bit older brother,

580
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:46,420
 that this is what I have seen Almighty God do

581
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:53,420
 tens of thousands of times over the last 20 years,

582
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:59,420
 that as we have presented to him our shaky little offering,

583
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:04,420
 Kumar's in slavery, Alina's in a place where she's being hurt,

584
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:07,420
 Joy T's being serially raped inside that brothel,

585
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:11,420
 and Jesus, we're going in.

586
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:19,420
 I have seen Jesus do the miracle tens of thousands of times.

587
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:22,420
 Because you know, Kumar is no longer held in that brick factory

588
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:24,420
 as a slave anymore.

589
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:29,420
 Our local Indian team of investigators were able to infiltrate that place.

590
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:32,420
 They were able to work with the local authorities, conduct a raid,

591
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:36,420
 rescue Kumar out, and all 70 of those people were held as slaves

592
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:37,420
 in that facility.

593
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:41,420
 And not only that, but get them enrolled in our aftercare program.

594
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:44,420
 So they now stand on their own two feet, providing for their own families

595
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:51,420
 as free men and women. Amen.

596
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:55,420
 Kumar, it turns out, Kumar's brilliant.

597
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:57,420
 He actually went to school and came back to work as an intern

598
00:31:57,420 --> 00:32:00,420
 for International Justice Mission, and he has helped us rescue

599
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:02,420
 hundreds of people from slavery.

600
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:06,420
 And what I can tell you is this,

601
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:10,420
 Kumar isn't wondering whether or not there is a good God.

602
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:12,420
 He knows there's a good God.

603
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:18,420
 And now he is bringing that testimony and that witness in word and deed

604
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:20,420
 to those in his community who are hurting.

605
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:23,420
 Likewise with Alina, she no longer just has to be trembling in fear

606
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:28,420
 somewhere that the bullies can just hurt her anytime, anywhere.

607
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:33,420
 IJM's local Filipino team took on her case and had that police chief

608
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:37,420
 not only removed from office, but he's now serving a life sentence

609
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:44,420
 for all the abuse that he was committing in that community.

610
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:48,420
 And now Alina has gone to college and gotten a communications degree,

611
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:52,420
 and she's been one of the leading advocates fighting trafficking

612
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:54,420
 in her community.

613
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:58,420
 She mentors scores of young women as they walk through the difficult process

614
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:01,420
 of recovery from abuse.

615
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:03,420
 Because what does Alina believe?

616
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:06,420
 That there's a good God, because she's seen it in the goodness

617
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:09,420
 of God's people.

618
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:15,420
 And likewise with Jyoti, she's no longer being horrifically abused

619
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:17,420
 inside that brothel.

620
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:21,420
 Her local team in India was able to infiltrate that dark place,

621
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:26,420
 get her out, get her to a place of long-term Christian aftercare.

622
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:29,420
 And then eventually she said to us, "But you know, I know where other children

623
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:31,420
 are being held."

624
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:36,420
 And Jyoti led us back, back into that dark part of her city,

625
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:39,420
 so we could rescue another seven kids out.

626
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:42,420
 One of them was a girl named Kalindi.

627
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:45,420
 And Kalindi said, "Well, you know, I know where even more girls

628
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:47,420
 are being held."

629
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:51,420
 And she led us on a third police raid and led us to this underground dungeon

630
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:54,420
 underneath one of the brothels.

631
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:58,420
 And on this particular day, we were able to bring out of that dark place

632
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:05,420
 24 of these girls who were in a place of just unspeakable abuse and ugliness.

633
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:08,420
 But on this day, they were brought out of that darkness.

634
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:10,420
 And why was that possible?

635
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:14,420
 It was because the body of Christ showed up for Jyoti,

636
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:18,420
 and then Jyoti showed up for Kalindi, and then Kalindi showed up

637
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:20,420
 for these girls.

638
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:25,420
 And so now they have an opportunity to actually know the goodness of God.

639
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:30,420
 This is the gospel showing up in the darkest places in our world

640
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:34,420
 where once there was a thought, "God does not hear you here."

641
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:37,420
 But now they step into the light of knowing that there's a God

642
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:40,420
 who loves them.

643
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:58,420
 You know, if you and I think back about that story,

644
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:03,420
 you think about that story of the feeding of the 5,000,

645
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:09,420
 you think about, like, why did Jesus do that the way that he did?

646
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:14,420
 I mean, if he's God and he's teaching and everybody's getting hungry,

647
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:18,420
 I don't know, why didn't he just dump manna on everybody, right?

648
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:22,420
 Like, "Poof, manna, eat up, and let's get back to the teaching," right?

649
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:25,420
 Like, why did he do it the way that he did?

650
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:30,420
 I think he did it the way that he did for just one reason.

651
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:38,420
 I think he wanted to give one little boy a very cool day.

652
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:41,420
 Because if you think about it, did he actually have to have

653
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:45,420
 the little boy's lunch in order to do the miracle?

654
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:48,420
 And yet the boy goes home to his mom at the end of the day, right?

655
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:54,420
 He says, "Mom, guess what Jesus did with my lunch today?"

656
00:35:54,420 --> 00:36:00,420
 Fed 5,000 people, pretty much, yeah.

657
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:07,420
 And yet what I also think is true is that boy could have eaten his own lunch.

658
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:12,420
 He would have had a very full stomach, but a very small day.

659
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:16,420
 And was that little boy the only person in the crowd of 5,000

660
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:19,420
 who had a lunch?

661
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:25,420
 Or was he just the one who was willing to offer it to Jesus?

662
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:28,420
 What does this suggest for you and me?

663
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:34,420
 Perhaps a new season of rediscovering God's love for the world.

664
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:40,420
 Perhaps a new season of rediscovering God's passion for justice.

665
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:44,420
 And can I tell you, one of the most extraordinary ways that you could do that,

666
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:49,420
 I believe, is something that is coming at the end of September.

667
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:53,420
 IJM, as I said, now has 1,000 full-time staff around the world,

668
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:57,420
 those who brought rescue in all these stories we've heard.

669
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:03,420
 And they are all gathering together after 20 years to thank God

670
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:07,420
 for what he's done, to pray to him for what's coming,

671
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:09,420
 and to seek encouragement.

672
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:13,420
 And where in the world, after 20 years, are 1,000 of the world's

673
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:18,420
 most amazing Christian justice advocates?

674
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:20,420
 Where are they coming?

675
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:23,420
 To Dallas, Texas.

676
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:27,420
 On September 28th and 29th, we're gathering them together

677
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:29,420
 in something we're calling Liberate.

678
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:33,420
 All 1,000 of these amazing people, and we're just inviting all of our friends

679
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:37,420
 to come and pray with them and encourage them.

680
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:40,420
 There are teams like our team in Kenya who lost three of their number

681
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:44,420
 about a year and a half ago when they were defending a taxi driver

682
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:47,420
 who was being abused by the police, and they were trying to seek justice

683
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:50,420
 against them, those police officers.

684
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:52,420
 They were putting them on trial.

685
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:56,420
 And then three of those of our staff found themselves abducted

686
00:37:56,420 --> 00:38:01,420
 by those police and murdered, left floating in the river.

687
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:06,420
 And that team is taking on the fight about what it means to actually protect

688
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:08,420
 the common poor from that kind of violence.

689
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:10,420
 They're coming to Dallas.

690
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:13,420
 They're coming with those from all of these various countries that are engaged

691
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:15,420
 in this fight against violence and slavery.

692
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:19,420
 And you know what I would just so deeply love is if the portrait just showed up

693
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:23,420
 to love on them, to pray with them, to be with them.

694
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:26,420
 [applause]

695
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:29,420
 People from all over the country are going to come, but I think there's just

696
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:31,420
 some reason why they're coming here.

697
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:36,420
 So we're going to be in the Dr. Pepper Arena in Frisco,

698
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:40,420
 and I would love to invite you all to come to liberate, be with us.

699
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:46,420
 We actually even have a promo code for the porch for you guys to be able--

700
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:48,420
 because as Shane says, you have no money.

701
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:51,420
 I get this, and so promo code.

702
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:53,420
 Come.

703
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:59,420
 You will just have your little socks blessed off by these people,

704
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:03,420
 and you will bless them, pray with them, encourage them,

705
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:07,420
 worship Almighty God with them, see if it does not shake up your life.

706
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:10,420
 Because if you think about it, why in a world of so much suffering and hurt

707
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:13,420
 and need, why have you and I been given so much?

708
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:16,420
 Do you ever think about this?

709
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:20,420
 By way of an answer, I would just close with this confession that when I was

710
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:23,420
 growing up as a young person, what I really wanted most in life was to be

711
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:25,420
 a professional football player.

712
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:28,420
 But I turned out to be a bad football player.

713
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:31,420
 But fortunately, I had two older brothers who would sit me down,

714
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:35,420
 and they would tell me why I was a bad football player.

715
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:38,420
 This was helpful in a weird way, I guess.

716
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:47,420
 So they'd say, "Well, Gary, you see, you're small, but you're slow."

717
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:50,420
 So what I would do, of course, is I would go to the weight room to work out,

718
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:53,420
 to try to get big just so I wouldn't get crushed so badly on a football field.

719
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:56,420
 I'd work out in the weight room, and nothing would ever happen to my body,

720
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:58,420
 but I'd work out and work out.

721
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:04,420
 I'd always look over in the section of my gym, and there were always the bodybuilders.

722
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:07,420
 "Do you have any of these guys in your gym?"

723
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:11,420
 I mean, they're just--they're huge, right?

724
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:13,420
 I mean, oh, my gosh.

725
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:19,420
 It's like chest and neck and, like, legs and, like, arms.

726
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:20,420
 Like, oh, my gosh.

727
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:25,420
 And I used to just look at all that muscle mass and all that strength

728
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:27,420
 and all that power.

729
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:34,420
 And I used to just ask, "But what's it all for?"

730
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:38,420
 It's for posing.

731
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:40,420
 And the only time all that strength and power is ever really brought to bear

732
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:42,420
 is there's the crisis in the kitchen, right?

733
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:44,420
 And the jam jar is stuck in there.

734
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:48,420
 And they pop open the jam jar.

735
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:56,420
 Ooh.

736
00:40:56,420 --> 00:41:01,420
 In a world of so much suffering and hurt and need,

737
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:10,420
 may God not leave us opening jam jars,

738
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:15,420
 but may he rescue us from all things that are just too small,

739
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:19,420
 rescue us from all things of fear,

740
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:25,420
 and lead us with courage into a world that's yearning to see the goodness of God

741
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:28,420
 through the porch.

742
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:29,420
 Let's pray.

743
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:33,420
 Let's pray.

744
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:39,420
 Almighty God, kind Father,

745
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:45,420
 thank you for the gentleness and the patience with which you allow us to know

746
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:51,420
 you more deeply and to know how much you love us

747
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:57,420
 and how you yearn to testify to your goodness into this world through us.

748
00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:03,420
 So, Father, we ask that you would take some word of truth that is from you

749
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:06,420
 tonight and allow it to actually take root in our heart.

750
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:08,420
 We don't want to leave this place.

751
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:12,420
 Just exactly the same people who came in.

752
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:16,420
 And yet there will be so much of an onslaught of distraction and things out

753
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:17,420
 beyond these walls.

754
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:20,420
 So we just ask for each other, for ourselves,

755
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:24,420
 that you would help us to just take this one good step,

756
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:26,420
 whatever faithfulness it is,

757
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:32,420
 to just follow you in your love for the world and your love for justice.

758
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:38,420
 And may it all go, Jesus, to your glory and to your fame

759
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:42,420
 and to your salvation in the world.

760
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:43,420
 Amen.

761
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:46,000
 (upbeat music)
