1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:15,080
 - All right, let's go.

3
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,120
 Man, welcome friends in the room.

4
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,480
 Gosh, I feel like we could go home, that worship set.

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,920
 Man, and I'm sure it was the same in Fort Worth

6
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,120
 with Jared and in Houston and just everywhere.

7
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:26,940
 But welcome friends,

8
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:29,680
 we are kicking off a new series tonight, The Remnant.

9
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,540
 What is The Remnant?

10
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:35,960
 It is not the movie with Leonardo DiCaprio and the bear.

11
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,220
 It is a word that means the people of God

12
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:41,640
 or the people that God has set apart, the faithful ones.

13
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,880
 So I'm gonna start with a little bit of a story

14
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:43,920
 that recently took place,

15
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,760
 that'll give us some tracks before we're going.

16
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,480
 About a week and a half ago, I got on a plane with JP,

17
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,080
 who also is one of the primary communicators

18
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,960
 and leader of this Dallas campus

19
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:54,980
 and really Watermarket General.

20
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:58,400
 We went to London for a gathering for young leaders,

21
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,000
 young pastors that are kind of under 40.

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,680
 Essentially, he got invited to come to this thing

23
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,360
 and he was like, "Hey, you wanna go free trip to London?

24
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,200
 "I'm in."

25
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,120
 And so we went over there and we were together

26
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:10,560
 with about 70 other leaders from churches

27
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,880
 that were in Canada and in Australia and in Europe

28
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,720
 and in Germany and Sweden.

29
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,120
 And so it was gonna be kind of a time to collaborate

30
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,560
 and get to know and exchange ideas

31
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,520
 and just hear what their ministry context are looking like.

32
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,400
 And I don't know what you know about Europe,

33
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,680
 but if you hear any of the news

34
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,000
 and any of the news clippings that are out there,

35
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,920
 it's essentially that the church,

36
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,680
 you don't always hear a bright picture painted.

37
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,480
 That it's almost like, hey, whatever is going on there,

38
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,140
 it's not church inside of Europe.

39
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,480
 That it's either losing

40
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,560
 or it honestly already lost that battle long ago.

41
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,440
 And so the vibrant ministries really are nothing

42
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,080
 like you're gonna see inside of America.

43
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,960
 So I was going over there thinking,

44
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,720
 man, I don't know what this is gonna look like

45
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,340
 and I'm sure we're gonna meet with pastors

46
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,320
 who live in a very different context

47
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,440
 than Dallas and the Bible Belt.

48
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:00,880
 And so maybe it'll just be a chance we encourage them.

49
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,600
 I was almost like, it may even be kind of awkward

50
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,440
 to talk about what God is doing here in the midst of it,

51
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,760
 'cause if it's in Sweden

52
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:12,720
 and just the high atheist agnostic population all over Europe

53
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,680
 it's gonna be maybe our chance to just encourage them

54
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,460
 and be like, man, here's why you matter.

55
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,900
 Keep going, keep getting after it.

56
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,800
 'Cause if I'm them or I'm already thinking in my mind,

57
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,880
 man, if I'm leading in Germany or in Sweden

58
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,680
 or Australia or Canada, I might be thinking,

59
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,520
 like I haven't seen people come to trust in Jesus

60
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,320
 or come to trust Christ in a long time.

61
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:37,720
 My ministry is just a few people versus a few thousand.

62
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,320
 And so all this is kind of going through my mind.

63
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,780
 It'll just, I guess, be a chance for us

64
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,320
 to kind of encourage and keep going

65
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,080
 and let us remind you why you matter.

66
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,520
 I'm gonna pick up that story

67
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,580
 and a little bit of what took place.

68
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,180
 But I start there because

69
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,380
 what we're gonna kick off this series with

70
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,720
 is looking at Jesus's words,

71
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,840
 what he would say to those pastors and those leaders

72
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,560
 and really to anyone who is a follower of Christ,

73
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,960
 anyone who is a part of the remnant,

74
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,960
 anyone who's a Christian,

75
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,000
 not that they claim to be a Christian,

76
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,720
 but anyone who is actually following Jesus

77
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,860
 or a follower of Jesus,

78
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,560
 what Jesus is gonna say to you,

79
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,960
 if that fits your description, why you matter.

80
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,360
 Just like I assumed we're gonna go over there

81
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,360
 and have a chance to remind them,

82
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,720
 hey, as you, as the presence of God in Sweden,

83
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,400
 here's why you matter, here's what God is doing.

84
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,000
 Tonight, we're gonna look at a passage of scripture

85
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,560
 where Jesus, if he could speak to the body of Christ,

86
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,840
 he essentially does at that time,

87
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,040
 he says, as my followers,

88
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,280
 here's why you matter to the world around us.

89
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,240
 And I don't know if you've ever thought

90
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,160
 of that question before.

91
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,880
 Maybe to you, you're like, yeah, duh, it matters,

92
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,600
 it gives me something to do on a Tuesday night.

93
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,760
 But if you really were honest and you begin to think,

94
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,520
 like, does Christianity really matter?

95
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,040
 Like, if you removed all of the Christians

96
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,520
 off the entire face of the planet

97
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,380
 and they all of a sudden just disappeared,

98
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,880
 would it really make that big of a difference?

99
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,200
 Like, would things look a ton different?

100
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,520
 Would it turn into Lord of the Flies

101
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,020
 and everyone's got Piggy's head on a stick

102
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,180
 and things are just going crazy?

103
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,040
 If you guys would have read that book in eighth grade,

104
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,480
 that would have been funny, okay?

105
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,880
 (congregation laughing)

106
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,760
 Cliff notes.

107
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,400
 And so, would it turn into that?

108
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,720
 What would happen?

109
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,280
 If you actually removed the people of God,

110
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,680
 I mean, think about it, and maybe you have an answer.

111
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,000
 Maybe you're not really in the whole church thing

112
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,600
 and somebody just invited you and you're like,

113
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,820
 yeah, finally, get off my case,

114
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,440
 I'll come with you to this porch thing.

115
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,560
 And you think, man, if you got rid of all the Christians,

116
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,800
 I'm not even sure the world would look any better.

117
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,400
 Or I mean, any worse, it may look even better.

118
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,200
 Be less judgment, less hypocrisy.

119
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,440
 Maybe that's what you think.

120
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,080
 But regardless of where you are on the spectrum,

121
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:31,920
 I mean, think about it.

122
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:36,920
 If you removed all of the Christian presence in this age,

123
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:41,780
 maybe throughout history, how would it change our world?

124
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,800
 How would it look different?

125
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,760
 And the answer is found really in tied to what Jesus says

126
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:50,200
 the role of his followers has plays, will always play

127
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,520
 in every culture, in every society, on every continent,

128
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,520
 in every place, and every age.

129
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,960
 But he's gonna tell us why the body of Christ,

130
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,960
 Christ followers, are so crucial to our world.

131
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,880
 And if you were to remove them,

132
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:07,120
 or when their presence is removed from a place,

133
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,000
 what will happen?

134
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,400
 So we're gonna be in Matthew chapter five.

135
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,400
 If you have a Bible, you can flip over

136
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,440
 to Matthew chapter five.

137
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,280
 We're gonna look at a passage

138
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,560
 that you may have heard before.

139
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,800
 You may have heard, even talked on before,

140
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,520
 but we're gonna see Jesus's words to his followers

141
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,840
 about why they matter.

142
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:24,200
 Tonight we're gonna kick off about why God

143
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,620
 always preserves a remnant.

144
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:30,600
 That he's always preserved a people, set aside a people,

145
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,120
 faithful and devoted to him in every age,

146
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,320
 and really in every place all over the world.

147
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,040
 And we're gonna see that starting in verse 13.

148
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,960
 This is Jesus's first message

149
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,600
 to really anyone that we know of.

150
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,680
 And it's called often the Sermon of the Mount.

151
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,800
 If you may have heard that term before,

152
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,680
 Sermon of the Mount, Matthew chapter five through seven.

153
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,720
 He basically gathers on the side of a mountain or a mount,

154
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,040
 and he looks out into his followers,

155
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:57,040
 and he begins to say, here's why you matter to the world.

156
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,400
 And we're gonna see three things that God is doing,

157
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,720
 always is doing through the remnant, was then and is now.

158
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,380
 And if you're a part of the remnant,

159
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:09,160
 this is what he's doing and wants to do through your life

160
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:09,980
 and through my life.

161
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:10,920
 Starting in verse 13.

162
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:17,120
 Jesus says, "You are the salt of the earth.

163
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,160
 "But if salt loses its saltiness,

164
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,640
 "how can it be made salty again?

165
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,620
 "It's no longer good for anything

166
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:28,760
 "except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot."

167
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,040
 Jesus, what are you saying?

168
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,920
 We're a condiment?

169
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,960
 Why are your followers salt?

170
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,080
 And what does that even mean?

171
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,520
 And what do you mean by trampling underfoot?

172
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,560
 That doesn't sound great, whatever you mean by it.

173
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,960
 Here's what the context around salt in Jesus's age.

174
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,920
 Very different time period.

175
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,480
 We'd have to, if we go back on a time machine,

176
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,800
 here's one thing that we would notice about first century,

177
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,040
 that they didn't have something called refrigeration.

178
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,680
 And so inside of that context,

179
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,760
 because there was no electricity,

180
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,360
 there's no ability to freeze food.

181
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,560
 You didn't have like ice makers and ice machines.

182
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,280
 I know, I went to seminary.

183
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,680
 This is graduate level stuff.

184
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,600
 And so inside of that context,

185
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,280
 in order to keep food from going bad,

186
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:06,160
 in order to stop it from decaying, they would use salt.

187
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,320
 That salt was this preservative.

188
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,220
 So in other words, hey, you killed the calf.

189
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,160
 We got two options.

190
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,140
 We're either gonna go big time barbecue right now

191
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:12,980
 and fill ourselves up,

192
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:16,360
 or we can keep the meat from rotting as quickly

193
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,400
 by putting salt on top of it.

194
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,400
 Salt was primarily a preservative.

195
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,160
 It was extremely valuable.

196
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,960
 In fact, even if you look at the tracing of the word salary,

197
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,600
 it comes from salt, sal,

198
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,360
 because they would pay people in salt

199
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,140
 because of the enormous value that it had,

200
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,400
 that it was this preservative

201
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,880
 and the ability to preserve food.

202
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,160
 And Jesus looks into his audience and says,

203
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,420
 you are like the preservative of a world

204
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:41,800
 that is rotting and decaying.

205
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:46,800
 The world is gonna decay slower with your presence there.

206
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,160
 Your city, your state, the places you live, your job,

207
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:55,620
 the apartment complex you live in is gonna decay slower

208
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,800
 if there's Christian Christ-following people

209
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,160
 that are present there.

210
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,980
 The first idea from the text is that the remnant

211
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,840
 is the preservative of the world,

212
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,860
 or the remnant always preserves our world.

213
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,240
 What does Jesus mean by the fact that,

214
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,200
 well, hey, if it loses its saltiness,

215
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,840
 it's not good for anything but to be trampled.

216
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,480
 Can salt even lose its saltiness?

217
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,640
 How does that happen?

218
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,520
 What is he saying?

219
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,840
 Here's what the process for getting salt

220
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,920
 in the first century, and this maybe will make sense to you

221
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,160
 if you've read this first and wondered

222
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,200
 what does that mean before.

223
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,200
 Oftentimes, the way salt was accumulated

224
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,400
 or the way that they got salt

225
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,360
 was because they lived right next to the ocean.

226
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,040
 They would go and they would pick up seaweed

227
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,040
 and they'd pick up all kinds of different minerals

228
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,880
 and salt things that would accumulate on the shores,

229
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,080
 and they would bring them in and there would be salt

230
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,900
 in the mix of seaweed and the mix of sticks

231
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:39,920
 and different things that were there,

232
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,360
 and they would take that salt that had accumulated

233
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,440
 from the ocean, salt water, and they would rub it on meat

234
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,680
 and they would rub it on the foods

235
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,880
 that they were trying to preserve.

236
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,280
 Then, when all the salt is off of there,

237
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,240
 they would take it and they would throw it

238
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,560
 on the top of their thatched roof homes

239
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,200
 where people would walk.

240
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,880
 And so, I mean, if you read it with that in mind,

241
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,440
 it makes perfect sense what Jesus is saying.

242
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,440
 Hey, if salt is no longer something

243
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,800
 that is providing and preserving anymore,

244
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,520
 it's something that you're gonna just throw out

245
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,640
 is essentially his point.

246
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,120
 And he's saying you, as the people of God,

247
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,440
 have been put where you are to be a preservative

248
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,480
 to the world around you, to stop it from decaying.

249
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,920
 Now, what does that even mean, Jesus?

250
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,480
 How are we stopping the world from decaying?

251
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,480
 It's not like you leave these doors

252
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,800
 and all of a sudden it smells terrible

253
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,200
 because it's like rotten food everywhere.

254
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,280
 What are you saying?

255
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:33,480
 The picture Jesus in the Bible presents

256
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:38,060
 is that our world is fractured and broken

257
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:39,460
 in every way imaginable.

258
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,480
 Human nature is fractioned and broken.

259
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,340
 That the world around us is broken

260
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:49,660
 and that God has put Christians and Christ followers

261
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:52,300
 on the planet to slow down through the way

262
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,540
 that they live their life,

263
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:55,840
 through the values that they hold to,

264
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,100
 through the perspectives that they have on things

265
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:01,820
 to slow down the decay of culture and of our world.

266
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,380
 Here's what I mean.

267
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:05,820
 It is the Christian message

268
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,420
 that is not just one of eternal life.

269
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,220
 The Christian message, and this is so huge,

270
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,260
 even if you're not a believer,

271
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,940
 this will finally bring some sense.

272
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:16,020
 And you may not even be able to fully grab

273
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:19,100
 onto what I'm saying because you've been so indoctrinated

274
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:22,220
 by a Christian worldview and you don't even realize it.

275
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:24,660
 It is the Christian message that gives not just the message

276
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:28,220
 of eternal life, but of a better life in this world.

277
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:30,180
 And if you take away the message of the body of Christ

278
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,260
 and the message of Christianity,

279
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,140
 if you would remove it from history,

280
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,980
 you're gonna remove things that have uniquely

281
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,500
 been introduced through the church.

282
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,500
 Here's one example.

283
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,300
 The idea of the sanctity of life,

284
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:43,900
 that every person matters, every life matters,

285
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:47,220
 every person, whether they're white, black, Asian,

286
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,420
 or anything across the board, whatever the color of your skin,

287
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:52,480
 whatever your sex, male or female, that you matter,

288
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,740
 you are someone who matters to God

289
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:54,720
 and you should matter to me.

290
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,980
 That is a uniquely Christian message.

291
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,340
 And you may be going, well, I know atheists

292
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:00,800
 that hold onto that message because they have grown up

293
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,660
 in an environment where that Christian moral foundation

294
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,040
 was introduced to them.

295
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,260
 How do I know that's true?

296
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:08,620
 If you look around, if you've traveled it all

297
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:12,260
 outside of the West, it becomes very apparent

298
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:14,480
 that not everyone thinks like us.

299
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,100
 Have you noticed that?

300
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,420
 Like, there's a reason why even the idea of,

301
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:21,980
 hey, men and women are equal, even me saying that

302
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:23,180
 is kind of making some of you being like,

303
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,580
 yeah, why do you even have to say that?

304
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,980
 Duh, men and women are, we're out of here right now.

305
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,920
 Even me introducing that makes you kind of be like,

306
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:32,620
 of course, that's not something universally accepted.

307
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:35,980
 There's a reason Saudi Arabia, just in the past few months,

308
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,900
 gave women the right to drive cars.

309
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:40,740
 And if you look all over the world,

310
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,380
 especially in places where there hasn't been

311
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:45,100
 a Christian moral foundation, and the value of life

312
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,860
 is not a universally accepted thing,

313
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:50,860
 there's a reason why there's 100 million more men

314
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,020
 in Asia than women.

315
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:52,860
 You know why?

316
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:55,540
 Selective birth abortion.

317
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,100
 If we find out it's a girl, we kill it

318
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,780
 because not all lives are equal.

319
00:11:58,780 --> 00:11:59,900
 And you're like, man, they are equal.

320
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:02,520
 That's because you have been so saturated

321
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,460
 in a Christian moral foundation.

322
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:07,060
 And we hold that it's true and it's right

323
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,620
 and it's the only way to think.

324
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:12,420
 But it is not a universally, it's not natural.

325
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:15,500
 It's not the way that people naturally and normally think.

326
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,560
 The idea that, man, abortion in general

327
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,620
 is not a solution to problems.

328
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:24,140
 The idea that, hey, men should cherish their wives

329
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:28,640
 and care for them is not a universally accepted truth

330
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,300
 that, hey, men, you should die to yourself

331
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,740
 and put the needs of your wife before her.

332
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:35,460
 And any time you fail to do that,

333
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:36,940
 you should ask for forgiveness

334
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:39,080
 and you should own it and confess that that was not right.

335
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,640
 That's not something that universally

336
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,620
 people agree to and believe.

337
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:46,100
 These are Christian things that the message of Christianity

338
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,380
 has introduced, not just how you can have eternal life,

339
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:51,060
 but a better life inside of our world,

340
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,780
 and it is not natural.

341
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:57,020
 The Christian message introduced the idea that,

342
00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:00,900
 hey, men, you should forgive because you've been forgiven.

343
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:04,340
 What's natural is an eye for an eye.

344
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,940
 If you stole from me, I get to steal from you.

345
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,080
 I mean, that's what the natural is,

346
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,280
 but the Christian message has all throughout time,

347
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,380
 and even today, introduces something different.

348
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:14,020
 That's why it's the preservative of a world

349
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:18,740
 that apart from it having the message of Jesus

350
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,140
 in the body of Christ is decaying

351
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:22,980
 and will decay faster and faster.

352
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:26,260
 But these things, I mean, think about this.

353
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:29,400
 Think if you removed all of the Christian presence

354
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,340
 throughout history, just like imagine with me.

355
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:35,220
 Imagine like, hey, you could wave a magic wand

356
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,460
 and poof, it all disappeared.

357
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,620
 There was never any Christianity, no Christ.

358
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:41,060
 Think how different our world would be.

359
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,860
 What would have happened to slavery?

360
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:46,340
 And maybe going, wait a second, but Christians,

361
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:50,020
 in the name of Christianity, defended slavery.

362
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,940
 There's always been phony Christians

363
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:54,220
 and people who missed the mark,

364
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:57,020
 people who didn't understand, but at the same time,

365
00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:00,580
 even in that age, there were the remnant who stood up,

366
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,980
 who gave their life saying slavery is wrong.

367
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:05,580
 You could trace it hundreds and hundreds of years back

368
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:09,080
 where the body of Christ is saying this is abhorrent.

369
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,960
 And the greatest evil inside of our land

370
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:14,660
 was fought by Christians, William Wilberforce,

371
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:18,900
 John Wesley, people who said, this is not okay,

372
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:22,100
 that every person is created equal in God's eyes.

373
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:25,740
 And in the name of the message of Christianity, they fought.

374
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,100
 Because here's what's crazy, I don't very often disagree

375
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,240
 with the founding fathers of the United States,

376
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,020
 'cause I'm an American, these colors don't run.

377
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,740
 But here's where they had it off.

378
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:38,860
 We hold these truths to be self-evident.

379
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:43,300
 They were wrong, they're not self-evident truths.

380
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:47,180
 You can turn on any TV, slavery is alive and well

381
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:50,040
 outside of nations or in lots of places

382
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:53,140
 that have no Christian moral foundation that's a part of it.

383
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:56,100
 In fact, in 2003, it was reinstated by someone

384
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:59,500
 who's had significant leadership in the Islamic world

385
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,180
 that hey, we're gonna open back the policy for slavery,

386
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:04,740
 it'll always be a part of Islam.

387
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:05,980
 And that didn't universally accept

388
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,940
 and that has nothing to do with inside of our context,

389
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,980
 but point being, that perspective

390
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:14,940
 that everyone is created equal is not a self-evident truth.

391
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:17,820
 How do Christians slow the decay of our world

392
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:20,360
 by introducing not just the message of eternal life,

393
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,560
 but of a better life?

394
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,980
 You look at the civil rights movement,

395
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:25,420
 Martin Luther King Jr., you know what his job was

396
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:28,060
 before he became a man who turned the world

397
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,740
 upside down for the good?

398
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:33,460
 A pastor who was turning up his congregation

399
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:37,540
 upside down for the good and through the message of Christ.

400
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,540
 That in every era, if you were to remove

401
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:42,540
 the Christian presence, how would our world look different?

402
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:43,980
 How would things be different?

403
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,740
 In other words, you can even look around

404
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:49,580
 and see it in the examples of hospitals.

405
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:50,940
 And there's a reason why you don't see,

406
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:53,740
 hey, first atheist medical center over there,

407
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:55,560
 but you see Presbyterian, you see Baylor,

408
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,860
 you see, I mean, it's true.

409
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,820
 (congregation laughing)

410
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:01,820
 Because the people of God, the remnant,

411
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:04,940
 has always said we're gonna provide health

412
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:07,540
 and healing and medicine for people,

413
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,360
 even if they can't afford it.

414
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,860
 You don't hear about the, you hear about Salvation Army,

415
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:13,100
 you don't hear about the agnostic army

416
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,540
 that's going out there ringing bells.

417
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,660
 That just doesn't happen because the people of God

418
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,220
 have introduced into this world,

419
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,700
 we think every person matters.

420
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:22,660
 We see it as our responsibility to fight poverty,

421
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:25,980
 not some government's, the body of Christ.

422
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:28,280
 We see it as our responsibility to fight injustice

423
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,340
 and to use our democratic voice

424
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:32,700
 to fight for justice anytime that we can.

425
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,300
 But that's the remnant, that's the people of God.

426
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:37,260
 If you remove that, you remove God's greatest gift

427
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:41,260
 to the world that I'm gonna slow the decay through you.

428
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:43,540
 Does the body of Christ matter?

429
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:46,980
 You matter more than you could possibly even understand.

430
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:49,180
 You've mattered to history, you've mattered to this country,

431
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,680
 you've mattered to our world.

432
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,980
 As every person in the body of Christ does everywhere.

433
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:56,020
 Billy Graham, who fought alongside

434
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,320
 of Martin Luther King Jr.

435
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,500
 to increase the civil rights presence,

436
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,240
 who said at My Tent Revivals,

437
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,100
 when it was illegal because of Jim Crow,

438
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,240
 I will not allow segregation.

439
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,920
 And he personally would go up and down the aisle

440
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,940
 saying we're gonna sit everyone together

441
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,300
 if you're gonna be here.

442
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,640
 It is the body of Christ.

443
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,300
 Have they gotten it perfect at all times?

444
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,880
 No.

445
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,840
 And the best thing we can do is own the places

446
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,980
 where we've missed it in every century.

447
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:23,860
 But it is the people of God who have been devoted

448
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:26,440
 to the values that scripture gives,

449
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,220
 that there's a God who loves every person

450
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,820
 and it is our responsibility to love

451
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,380
 and care for every person.

452
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:35,780
 Jesus looks at his followers and says,

453
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:39,560
 man, you slow the decay of our world.

454
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:44,140
 You, Christian, are the salt of the village apartments.

455
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:47,980
 You're the salt of whatever place that you live,

456
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,940
 off of Oak Lawn or off of McKinney Avenue

457
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,860
 or wherever you live, whatever home that you're in,

458
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:52,960
 you are the salt of that neighborhood.

459
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,380
 You're the salt of your work.

460
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,480
 You're the preservative of that workplace.

461
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,540
 That God looks and he says, yeah, placing you there.

462
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:03,380
 There was a writer for the London Times

463
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:06,360
 who actually wrote, and London Times

464
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,020
 is kind of like the New York Times, only in London.

465
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:11,600
 And he wrote about just how his observations,

466
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,500
 he said, I'm an atheist, but man,

467
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,820
 I'm a field reporter in Africa.

468
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,260
 He was stationed in Africa and he would write

469
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,580
 and he said, man, I can't get over the ways

470
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,140
 that Christianity is at work here.

471
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,420
 And honestly, I'm an atheist,

472
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:24,520
 but we need more missionaries to come to Africa

473
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,420
 because they are the ones who are bringing healing.

474
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:29,560
 Here's what he wrote inside of the London Times in 2010.

475
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:34,260
 As an atheist, this is Matthew Paris from the London Times,

476
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,940
 I truly believe that Africa needs God.

477
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:40,260
 This confounds, I love this,

478
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:42,700
 this confounds my ideological beliefs,

479
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:45,580
 as in like, I don't know what to do with this,

480
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:48,460
 stubbornly refuses to fit my worldview,

481
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:52,540
 and has embarrassed my growing belief that there's no God.

482
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:55,700
 Though an atheist, I've become convinced

483
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:59,300
 of the enormous contribution that Christian evangelism

484
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:03,060
 makes in Africa, sharply distinct

485
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:05,340
 from the work of secular NGOs,

486
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,420
 government projects, and international aid efforts.

487
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:09,920
 In other words, like hey, when government involvement

488
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,380
 just tries to provide the aid,

489
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:14,220
 it doesn't work the same as Christian evangelism does.

490
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:17,580
 These alone will not do.

491
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:21,200
 Education and training alone will not do.

492
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,040
 In Africa, Christianity changes people's hearts.

493
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:30,180
 And the change is good, preach.

494
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:33,560
 Christians, black and white, working in Africa

495
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:36,280
 do heal the sick, do teach people to read and write,

496
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:39,740
 and only the severest kind of secularist or atheist

497
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:42,700
 could see a mission hospital and school and say,

498
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:45,300
 the world would be better without it.

499
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,980
 Missionaries, not aid money,

500
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:51,460
 are the solution to Africa's biggest problem.

501
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:54,900
 What Matthew identifies is really the truth

502
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,460
 that didn't have to exclusively do with Africa.

503
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:00,740
 They're the solution to America's biggest problem.

504
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,900
 Followers of Jesus who walk and follow him,

505
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,380
 not just people who claim to be a Christian.

506
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,600
 There's a lot of people in this room

507
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,580
 who claim to be a Christian,

508
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,620
 and they're not followers of Christ.

509
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:10,220
 By that, they just mean like, I'm not Buddhist,

510
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:12,220
 and I'm not Islam, and I'm an American.

511
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,440
 Colors don't run again.

512
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,000
 That's what a Christian is, right?

513
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,020
 But they're not followers of Jesus,

514
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:20,700
 who are following him with their life,

515
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,940
 who have accepted him and his death and resurrection

516
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:24,960
 as the payment for their sin.

517
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,480
 That's a follower of Christ.

518
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,940
 And what Africa needs more of, what our world needs more of,

519
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:32,860
 and what Jesus says his body provides

520
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:38,060
 is the preservative to a world that is dying without it.

521
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:42,500
 They introduce the world to the message of eternal life

522
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,900
 and also a better life.

523
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,140
 And Jesus continues, and he says,

524
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:47,660
 "Not only are you salt," he goes into another word picture,

525
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:52,660
 and he says this, "You are the light of the world.

526
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:57,780
 "A town that's built on a hill cannot be hidden.

527
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:01,620
 "Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl.

528
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,100
 "Instead, they put it on its stand,

529
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:06,120
 "and it gives light to everyone in the house,

530
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,160
 "that people would put houses on the side of the hill

531
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,140
 "so that travelers, when it was dark outside,"

532
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,420
 'cause again, no electricity,

533
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:15,700
 "they would see off in the distance the city lit up."

534
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,420
 And then he goes into another illustration of like,

535
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,420
 in the same way that people don't just light a lamp

536
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,780
 and they don't put it in kind of random places,

537
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,880
 they put it very intentionally in a place,

538
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,140
 that's what God has done with his lights.

539
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:28,400
 And if you're a follower of Christ, that's who you are.

540
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,860
 Here's what's relevant to the context.

541
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:31,260
 Instead of the first century,

542
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,700
 they didn't have lots of lights.

543
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,400
 Like, lights were a very valuable thing.

544
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,600
 So you had a candle, and it was expensive, and oil.

545
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,380
 And so you'd have really one-room houses.

546
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,220
 And so people would live in one room,

547
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:44,580
 which had to be great with like, mom and dad being right there

548
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,060
 and so they would be in that room

549
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:48,900
 and they would have one lamp, usually speaking.

550
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:49,980
 And they wouldn't put that lamp,

551
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,860
 and so Jesus' audience is listening going like,

552
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:54,420
 "Of course you wouldn't put it underneath the bowl.

553
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:56,740
 "Lamps are really expensive."

554
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:58,380
 You would put it very intentionally

555
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,660
 in the middle of the room to give as much light

556
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:02,820
 to the room around it as possible.

557
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,980
 You're very purposeful with where you put your lights

558
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:09,580
 and Jesus says, "That's how God is with his lights."

559
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,940
 That when he looked at the world around us,

560
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:15,580
 he saw the followers of Jesus and he placed them

561
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:18,060
 into the different workplaces.

562
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:19,340
 If you're a follower of Jesus,

563
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:21,420
 it's not a random accident that you work

564
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:23,100
 at the place that you work at.

565
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,700
 It's not a random accident that you live

566
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:25,980
 with the roommates you live at,

567
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,740
 that you live with the neighbors around you

568
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:28,580
 that you live at.

569
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:32,060
 But Jesus says, "God doesn't put lights without purpose.

570
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:36,260
 "He puts them purposefully into the places that he's at."

571
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,260
 And here's why this is hard,

572
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:38,580
 'cause I think most of us look at it and we're like,

573
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:41,580
 "Dude, it's just random why I work

574
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:42,420
 "at the place that I work at.

575
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:43,820
 "I don't even wanna work at the place that I work at.

576
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,320
 "I'm kinda waiting to get out of this job

577
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,820
 "and it's just kinda an in-between Starbucks kinda role

578
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:50,240
 "or I ended up getting hired here 'cause my aunt was like,

579
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,900
 "Hey, you should really consider working here.

580
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:54,100
 "It'll be good for the resume and I don't wanna be here

581
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,300
 "and it just seems random to us."

582
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,100
 Or I had a connection through a family friend

583
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:01,740
 and Jesus would say, "It may seem random to you,

584
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:04,900
 "my God doesn't put lights in random places."

585
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:09,420
 And he's placed you very purposefully

586
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:12,700
 that you would be the light of your office,

587
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:15,140
 that you would be the light of RISD,

588
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:17,300
 that school room that you get to go in,

589
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:19,900
 that you would be the light of every place you go.

590
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,580
 And oftentimes people will come down front

591
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:25,380
 and along the conversation of job,

592
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:29,300
 people will say something over and over and they'll go,

593
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,460
 "Man, I just need advice.

594
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:31,860
 "I'm thinking about leaving my job.

595
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:33,600
 "I mean, it's really dark."

596
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,620
 And by dark, they just mean

597
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:35,820
 there's not a lot of other Christians there.

598
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:38,100
 "It's really dark and I just don't know what to do

599
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,860
 "and my boss, just like the language

600
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:41,440
 "and the way that he talks about women,

601
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,780
 "it just makes me uncomfortable

602
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:45,200
 "and they ask me to do things.

603
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,660
 "I'm just thinking about leaving.

604
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:47,740
 "Maybe I'll go into ministry.

605
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:49,800
 "I'm thinking this may not be right for me.

606
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,940
 "It's just too dark of a place."

607
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:54,180
 God has a light there.

608
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:56,980
 I mean, that's why you're there.

609
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:59,900
 In other words, our temptation is look at it

610
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,780
 and be like, "Man, it's just too dark out here."

611
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:04,860
 God has his people there, that's why you're in that job.

612
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,740
 What the body of Christ candidly needs

613
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:10,540
 is not everyone to come into full-time ministry.

614
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:12,780
 It needs more people to go into the darkest places

615
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:14,900
 that are out there, more people to go into,

616
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,800
 to work for AT&T, to become doctors,

617
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,740
 to go into the legal field,

618
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:20,460
 to go and to be lights all over those different places.

619
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:24,160
 And if you work and you find yourself in a dark environment,

620
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,660
 you're probably exactly where God wants you to be.

621
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:29,580
 And he's put his light there.

622
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:32,440
 Into the midst of darkness, he's put you.

623
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,740
 You will step into offices tomorrow,

624
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,500
 you'll step into places tomorrow

625
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:41,060
 that candidly I can't get into.

626
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:44,460
 I mean, God has uniquely given you opportunities

627
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:46,000
 to shine and to be a light inside of this.

628
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,780
 I mean, think of it, there's places where I've been to,

629
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:49,720
 I don't know if you've traveled internationally.

630
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,700
 I've been to Africa, I spent a summer in Africa.

631
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,100
 I've been to Brazil, I've been to Haiti,

632
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:56,220
 I've been to Mexico, I've been to Europe.

633
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,820
 All of those places I could get into

634
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:00,060
 with just enough cash and just a plane ticket.

635
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:02,160
 I could not get into the school board room

636
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,420
 that you work at without them being like,

637
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,140
 all right, someone call security.

638
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,460
 There's someone here.

639
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:09,240
 I couldn't get into the office that you work at.

640
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,420
 I can't get into the meetings

641
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:12,240
 that you're gonna be in tomorrow.

642
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,660
 And God, whether you even believe me or not,

643
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:16,260
 which I think it's gonna be really hard for you to,

644
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:19,780
 is saying, I've put lights there into that darkness

645
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:22,740
 that I hope will shine because I'm a God,

646
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:26,100
 our second point, who places people on purpose.

647
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:29,520
 The remnant is always placed purposefully.

648
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:33,100
 The remnant, the people of God are always placed purposefully.

649
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:38,220
 I think about, there's a girl that volunteers with us

650
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,260
 and has served with us for a while,

651
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,820
 and I called yesterday to make sure

652
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:42,660
 the details of this story were correct.

653
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:44,300
 And really, there's tons of these stories

654
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,740
 that are like this, but her name is Liz,

655
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:48,880
 and Liz was working downtown.

656
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,880
 She had a job, and she had, all of a sudden,

657
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:54,800
 a new girl at her job show up named Sierra.

658
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,540
 And Liz was a follower of Jesus.

659
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:57,780
 She was serving at the port.

660
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,780
 She had recently experienced,

661
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:01,340
 like, just Christ came into her life

662
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:04,460
 and was changing her life.

663
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:06,100
 So she's at work, and she's talking about her faith,

664
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,940
 and one day, she strikes up a conversation

665
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,720
 with the new girl, Sierra.

666
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,940
 She says, hey, you know, can I tell you

667
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,380
 a little bit of my story?

668
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:15,260
 And goes through her story and invites her

669
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:17,020
 to come to the porch, and she says, really?

670
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:19,100
 Sierra just kinda gave me, like, the cold shoulder.

671
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:22,080
 She wasn't interested, didn't wanna have any of it.

672
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,180
 That's not for me.

673
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:25,720
 And so Liz kinda went about her business,

674
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:28,940
 continued to care and initiate and just invite

675
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:32,660
 and take an interest to be a light towards Sierra,

676
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,660
 and really, nothing was happening,

677
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,500
 or she wouldn't have any of it.

678
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,080
 And Sierra, at that time, was living with her boyfriend,

679
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,980
 and finally, they kinda go through a broke up,

680
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:41,420
 and she just found herself, Sierra,

681
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:44,980
 hitting a rock bottom of sorts, if you will,

682
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,720
 and found herself going, man,

683
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,580
 everything that I thought was going one direction

684
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:52,240
 ended up falling apart.

685
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,220
 And she ended up having a one-night stand,

686
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,780
 and something about that one-night stand

687
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,500
 with some dude, just like, God grabbed her heart

688
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,540
 and was like, I don't know what I'm doing.

689
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:02,140
 And it softened her enough to be like,

690
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:04,420
 fine, I'll come with you, Liz, to church.

691
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,980
 You know, I was raised Catholic.

692
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:07,900
 I'll go back and see if anything's changed.

693
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,980
 And so she went, and she finally came.

694
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:11,860
 She came, she sat in the back here,

695
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,340
 and she would tell her story, and she'd be like,

696
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,420
 and I listened to the sermons, and I was like,

697
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:17,120
 oh my gosh, this is just terrible.

698
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,980
 They don't even know what they're talking about up here,

699
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:22,260
 because she had no, she'd never heard the gospel before.

700
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:24,220
 It almost sounded too good to be true.

701
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:29,620
 And Liz kept initiating and taking an interest in Sierra,

702
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:32,380
 and after a few more occasions,

703
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:35,260
 Sierra came to a place where she's like, I believe that.

704
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,180
 And she trusted in Christ.

705
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,700
 She came to the place where she said,

706
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:40,660
 I am trusting that Jesus on the cross died for my sin.

707
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,380
 He paid for everything in my past,

708
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:45,780
 everything in my present, everything broken with me.

709
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:48,460
 And he died in my place, and he rose again.

710
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:50,740
 And she came to a place where she trusted in that,

711
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:53,740
 and all of a sudden, her life began to change.

712
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:56,100
 Kind of moment by moment, day by day, it began to change.

713
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:58,340
 And not long after that, here's what happened.

714
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,860
 Liz, gosh, I love this story.

715
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:02,300
 Liz was interviewing for a job,

716
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:06,660
 another position at another place, and she got accepted.

717
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:08,060
 And so she goes to Sierra and just says,

718
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:11,340
 man, hey, I got this new job that I'm moving into.

719
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:14,540
 And the way that she would retell the story would be,

720
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:16,300
 man, as I was saying kind of goodbye,

721
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,700
 we were in the parking lot, and Sierra looked at me,

722
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,580
 and we both had tears in our eyes,

723
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:23,900
 and she just said, man, God had you here for me.

724
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:27,020
 There's only a handful of months of overlap

725
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:28,980
 where you were trying to get out of here and leave this job,

726
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,460
 and I had just come in,

727
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:33,040
 but God had you long enough here on purpose

728
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,500
 so that I would get to spend eternity with him

729
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,820
 and get to experience the abundant life with him

730
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:39,940
 in this life, that you were here for me.

731
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:43,300
 Sierra has no idea how true that was,

732
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:47,780
 because my God places people on purpose,

733
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:50,460
 and the God who's there has placed you on purpose

734
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:53,980
 so that you would get to be a light for him.

735
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:57,060
 And the people around you, if they could use the words,

736
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:58,880
 they don't even know it 'cause they're not believers,

737
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,820
 but if the spirit of God ever gets ahold of them,

738
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:03,380
 they may have the same reaction of like,

739
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:04,820
 you were here for me.

740
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:08,580
 You're here for me, your boss, the people underneath you,

741
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,980
 the people that work alongside of you,

742
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:13,700
 because God has placed you there purposefully.

743
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:20,080
 What is convicting just about this idea of a light is,

744
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:25,020
 man, there's a lot of people who could teach

745
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:26,940
 or preach a message on stage right now.

746
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:29,020
 There's not a lot of people who have the same neighbors

747
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:30,980
 that live on either side of them as me.

748
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:33,060
 Like, at the end of the day,

749
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,280
 what it looks like for me to be a light

750
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,340
 is not to preach a sermon.

751
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:37,040
 Honestly, preaching sermons are way easier

752
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,980
 than striking up a conversation with somebody about Jesus

753
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:43,460
 and trying to do it in a way that is caring and sensitive

754
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:45,060
 and just gets to know them

755
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:46,540
 or takes advantage of the opportunity,

756
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:48,260
 but that's what it looks like for me to be faithful,

757
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,860
 just like it looks like for you.

758
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:52,420
 Not to preach some message,

759
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:55,820
 but to be a light in the places that God has placed me,

760
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:57,120
 just like he's placed you.

761
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,180
 And Jesus continues, and he really points out

762
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:04,300
 the third idea of what the remnant always is doing

763
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,860
 and God is doing through them, and he says this.

764
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:13,060
 "In the same way, let your light shine before others,

765
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:15,020
 "that they may see your good deeds

766
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:17,280
 "and glorify or bring honor,

767
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:20,540
 "attribute honor to your Father who's in heaven."

768
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:23,100
 That he doesn't say, "Hey, in the same way,

769
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,260
 "let your light shine so that people

770
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:27,380
 "would see your church attendance and be like,

771
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:29,540
 "Man, that's awesome, great, good job."

772
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:34,060
 So that people would see your actions as a Christ follower

773
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:37,060
 and it would lead them to see how your faith

774
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:38,460
 is impacting your life.

775
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,340
 That Jesus gives us our third idea from the text,

776
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:42,860
 that the remnant always points people to God,

777
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,220
 not through their church attendance

778
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:45,380
 or through the number of Bible verses

779
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:48,220
 that they have memorized, but through the way that they act,

780
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:51,140
 through their actions, that's what good deeds is.

781
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,700
 That God has placed you and I in the places that we are

782
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:56,260
 and he says the way that people are gonna connect

783
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:57,940
 with their heavenly Father

784
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:02,060
 is not by the church going around into the world

785
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,700
 and culture and being like, "You need to stop,"

786
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,900
 and trying to correct their behavior.

787
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,280
 That the role of the church is not for us

788
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,300
 to go around and correct, it is to go around

789
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,780
 and try to connect with people

790
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:16,480
 and allow our actions to be ones that help them connect

791
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,900
 with their heavenly Father who is there.

792
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:21,820
 The remnant always points people to God.

793
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:25,860
 This is the way that Jesus built his church,

794
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:28,380
 through people who live lives that contrast

795
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,580
 to the world around them.

796
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,720
 You know this?

797
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,180
 Like this is the way he's always built the church.

798
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,460
 This is the way the future of the church,

799
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:37,220
 the church in 10 years that doesn't even exist right now,

800
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:38,940
 they're not on the porch on a Tuesday night,

801
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,440
 they're in a bar somewhere right now.

802
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,080
 The church has always been built

803
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,820
 through the body of Christ living out their faith,

804
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,060
 through their actions.

805
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:49,100
 And those actions end up causing curiosity

806
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,020
 in the world around us.

807
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:52,140
 They contrast like light and darkness.

808
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:53,960
 They contrast the darkness of the world

809
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,400
 with the light of their actions.

810
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:58,000
 And it does something like it draws people to God.

811
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,860
 This is the way that God's always built the church.

812
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:03,300
 In other words, the way that people typically trust

813
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:06,180
 in Christ is by first trusting a Christian.

814
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:09,200
 If we were to get everyone up here inside of the room,

815
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,360
 like think about it.

816
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,620
 Like generally speaking, if you were to tell your story,

817
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:14,580
 if you're a believer, if you're a follower of Christ,

818
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:16,700
 if you ever heard someone tell about kind of their story,

819
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:20,560
 it usually involves, hey, and then I met him.

820
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,700
 And he asked me, he was just a friend

821
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,960
 that was on my sports team.

822
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,380
 He was a friend that I worked with.

823
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:28,000
 And he just asked if I had a faith

824
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,860
 or he took me to his church one day

825
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:32,500
 or he invited me to come to this Bible study.

826
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:37,140
 People, generally speaking, talk about trusting a Christian

827
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:38,880
 before they ever trust in Christ.

828
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,020
 Having someone inside of their life

829
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,340
 that they're willing to go, oh yeah,

830
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:43,580
 hey, I'll come with you to that because they trust them.

831
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:46,580
 The way that God builds his church is through his church.

832
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:48,700
 The way that God has historically,

833
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,540
 the way that your life, if you're a follower of Jesus,

834
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:52,500
 has been changed was that at some point

835
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,820
 there was a follower of Jesus

836
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:56,060
 that you intersected paths with.

837
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:57,140
 And if you were to tell your story,

838
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:59,380
 you would say, and then I met her.

839
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:02,740
 That typically speaking, the way people trust in Christ

840
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:05,060
 is by first trusting in a Christian

841
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:08,940
 whose actions point people to God,

842
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:11,260
 whose actions are a part of inviting them to the God

843
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:13,100
 who's extended the invitation to the world around us.

844
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,900
 And this is why I think the actions,

845
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:23,340
 this is why it is, it's a really dangerous thing

846
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:27,100
 for people who are not following Jesus

847
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:29,180
 to claim to be a Christian.

848
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:32,180
 Like there's some of you inside of the room

849
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:35,220
 that your actions are not pointing people to Jesus.

850
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,220
 They're pointing people to the bar,

851
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:37,060
 they're pointing people to the club,

852
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:37,900
 I don't know what they're pointing to,

853
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:39,020
 but they're not pointing to, man,

854
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:41,060
 I have this new life inside of Christ.

855
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,780
 You've got one foot in the world, we would say,

856
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:43,980
 and one foot in the church,

857
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:47,100
 and it's making you so you can't enjoy either of them,

858
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,980
 and you're not good at either of them.

859
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:52,540
 You've got just enough Jesus to wanna go to heaven,

860
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:54,620
 but enough of him to kinda spoil your fun

861
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:57,180
 inside of the world, and you, by your actions,

862
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:58,660
 are confusing people.

863
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:00,780
 If you're someone inside of the room who's like,

864
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:01,620
 yeah, I'm a Christian,

865
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:02,940
 but it doesn't affect how you date,

866
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,480
 it doesn't affect how you use your time,

867
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,660
 doesn't affect how you use your money,

868
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:07,120
 it doesn't affect the way that you talk,

869
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:07,960
 the way that you work,

870
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,340
 it doesn't affect the way that you see the world,

871
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:10,780
 I wanna make an ask of you.

872
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:13,180
 Will you stop telling people you're a Christian?

873
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:16,500
 Will you stop telling people you're a follower of Christ

874
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,080
 if you're not following Jesus?

875
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,660
 I don't know why that feels scandalous,

876
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:21,180
 and I can feel the air go out of the room.

877
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:23,660
 Did you just say, if I'm not following Jesus,

878
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:26,060
 stop telling people I'm not following Jesus?

879
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:28,720
 Yes, you're confusing people.

880
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:32,980
 And you may be going, well, holier than thou art you,

881
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:34,620
 so I live with my boyfriend,

882
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:37,100
 is it that big of a deal that I'm not following Jesus?

883
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:39,960
 Great, say, I'm not following Jesus in this area.

884
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,140
 Maybe just do that.

885
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:44,720
 That I like to follow him to church on Sunday,

886
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,360
 especially Easter,

887
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:51,360
 and I, yeah, and so maybe just start there,

888
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:55,240
 because you are confusing people.

889
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,360
 And the message of Christianity

890
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,160
 is not clean yourself up or be perfect,

891
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,640
 no, it's be open and honest about,

892
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,120
 like, man, we all have imperfections

893
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:05,060
 that God is working through us in our lives.

894
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:05,900
 But if you're gonna say,

895
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:08,200
 I blatantly don't care what God says,

896
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:12,080
 stop saying you care what God says.

897
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,680
 You're confusing people,

898
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,240
 and you are hurting the name of Jesus,

899
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,000
 and we can golf clap all day long for that,

900
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:17,920
 and we don't need to,

901
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,820
 but my point is this, you are hurting the name of Jesus.

902
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:24,780
 Hey, you're hurting the message of Christianity.

903
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:26,180
 You're confusing people.

904
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:28,040
 You're not being a preservative to our world.

905
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,340
 You're not shining light into the darkness.

906
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:33,240
 And it would be better for you to just say,

907
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,800
 man, am I gonna be honest and open about,

908
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,580
 like, am I serious about this Jesus thing or not,

909
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:38,260
 and quit playing the games.

910
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:40,240
 Church is a weird game to play.

911
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:43,700
 You should go to the lake on Sunday or something,

912
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:46,900
 or sleep in and go get mimosas.

913
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,420
 I think they got specials somewhere.

914
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,780
 Like, that's a better use of your Sunday

915
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:52,060
 if you're not actually gonna follow Jesus.

916
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:55,140
 And you're confusing people.

917
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:59,620
 Tragically, and maybe you're in the room,

918
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:04,380
 and you have experienced being confused by Christians.

919
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:05,840
 And maybe it wasn't even Christians

920
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,120
 who were kind of, like, giving you this weird,

921
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:10,220
 like, yeah, dude, you're buzzed right now at the bar,

922
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:11,660
 and you really wanna talk about God,

923
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:13,700
 which is a go-to specialty for someone

924
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:16,820
 who is one foot in the world and one foot out.

925
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:18,260
 Maybe it wasn't that person that confused you.

926
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:19,860
 Maybe it was you grew up in a church

927
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:22,700
 that was just full of what so many churches,

928
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:26,540
 tragically, are, just hypocrisy, judgmentalism, gossip,

929
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:30,060
 and you were given a really poor vision

930
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:32,320
 of what the church is, is intended to be.

931
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:37,360
 I was talking to a girl last week while we were in London,

932
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:42,100
 and she was behind us in this kind of ferry ride.

933
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,900
 We were waiting in line to get on this ferry,

934
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:47,500
 and she began speaking, and she was speaking like an American

935
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,180
 and, in other words, she wasn't like,

936
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:51,220
 hello, all right, how is it you today?

937
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:54,420
 She was speaking, that's my British accent, thank you.

938
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:58,940
 I could keep going right now, I'm sorry.

939
00:36:58,940 --> 00:36:59,940
 She wasn't speaking like that,

940
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:00,980
 she was speaking like an American,

941
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:04,180
 and so you're like, oh man, hey, same team.

942
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:07,960
 And we beat the Redcoats, am I right?

943
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:13,500
 Where am I going?

944
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:17,080
 We started talking to her, and she was there with her mom,

945
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,120
 and she was like mid-20s,

946
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:21,880
 and just kind of a sweet, bubbly personality,

947
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:24,080
 and immediately I'm like, dude, she's a follower of Jesus.

948
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,280
 Just kind of like got that sense, I bet she is,

949
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,000
 and so begin to ask her about her faith.

950
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,500
 She was living in Sweden with her husband at the time,

951
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:31,340
 going to school.

952
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:32,960
 I'm like, for sure, follower of Jesus.

953
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,720
 She's married in her 20s, yeah.

954
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:40,560
 Not a real popular thing to do these days.

955
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,000
 So get married, men, okay?

956
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,880
 And see, ask her, hey, do you have a faith?

957
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:50,360
 And she said, no, I'm really kind of agnostic.

958
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,400
 And we began to talk about why that was,

959
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,600
 and she said, I grew up in a church in Nebraska,

960
00:37:55,600 --> 00:38:00,600
 this small town, and everyone was hypocrites.

961
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,520
 It was like the church was so gossipy.

962
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,360
 It was kind of small town.

963
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,880
 Everyone knew, and they would talk about you

964
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,880
 behind your back, and just kind of like,

965
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:10,640
 it wasn't a place, honestly, that I ever want to be a part of

966
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,300
 and had no interest in being a part of.

967
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:14,120
 So when I got out of that town, I was like,

968
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,840
 man, I don't know what God they worship,

969
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:18,140
 but that one is not the one that I'm going to,

970
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:22,220
 because the actions, tragically, did the opposite.

971
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:24,800
 So we got to share with her a minute,

972
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,520
 and ask her forgiveness that on behalf

973
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:29,020
 of the body of Christ, she was given a bad vision,

974
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,920
 that the body of Christ was not to be a place

975
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,680
 that allows gossip, it's not to be a place

976
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,520
 that is full of hypocrites in the sense that they say,

977
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,180
 you should stop doing that, and then I'm gonna go do it,

978
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:41,600
 and claim that it's fine.

979
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:44,480
 It is the place that's full of broken people

980
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,020
 who come to the end of themselves and said,

981
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:49,080
 man, I don't need, I need a savior.

982
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:52,400
 I know that the world can tell me I'm a good person,

983
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,880
 I try to be good, and I pay my taxes,

984
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,880
 but there's something off in me.

985
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:01,600
 And I find myself in need of something supernatural

986
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,520
 to help me, to save me from myself.

987
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,680
 That it's not good people in heaven,

988
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,440
 and bad people in hell, it's forgiven people in heaven.

989
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,760
 And the only way to get forgiveness

990
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,480
 is through Jesus Christ, and we just shared that with her,

991
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,300
 and try to do whatever we can to point her back

992
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:17,520
 to that truth, but tragically, it is the church,

993
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,800
 or people in the name of Christianity,

994
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,780
 who have done the opposite of what the remnant does,

995
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:23,280
 which is point people to God,

996
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,220
 and they've pointed him away from him.

997
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,600
 But the good news is this, and I'll invite the band

998
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,740
 to come back up and land the plan here in a second.

999
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:36,840
 God has always preserved a remnant,

1000
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:39,560
 who know him, who walk with him,

1001
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,000
 and who point others to walk with him,

1002
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,600
 in every age, and every time, every place.

1003
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,360
 That story I said about going over to London

1004
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,120
 and meeting these different pastors,

1005
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,960
 and how I expected to go in and be like,

1006
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,880
 oh man, you got three people, that's great,

1007
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,880
 keep it up, keep going, this is amazing.

1008
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:58,360
 Dude, God had some surprises for me,

1009
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,520
 and some reminders of how small I can think

1010
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:04,160
 of his work in our world being.

1011
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,120
 Reminders specifically that the God who's there,

1012
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:09,840
 he's not exclusively at work in America,

1013
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,480
 he's not exclusively at work in Dallas,

1014
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,440
 he's not exclusively at work, I knew he's at work,

1015
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,360
 I know he's at work in Africa, and in Asia,

1016
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,680
 where Christianity's exploding.

1017
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,160
 There either is, or shortly will be,

1018
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:21,880
 more Christians in Asia than there are in America,

1019
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:24,440
 despite the fact that it's outlawed intensely.

1020
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,240
 That God is all over, I knew those places,

1021
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,640
 he is, you're seeing explosive growth happening,

1022
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,120
 but inside of the West, I went in thinking,

1023
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,400
 man, there's nothing going on here.

1024
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:34,920
 And as I got to hear from different pastors,

1025
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,680
 there was one from Sweden, think about that,

1026
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,520
 there's one from Sweden, they recently planted a church

1027
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,340
 in the last few years, already in a culture

1028
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:42,880
 with like 90% agnostic beliefs.

1029
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,840
 They've got over 1,000 people coming regularly.

1030
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,400
 There was another place inside of East Germany,

1031
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,040
 East Germany is one of the most atheistic places

1032
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,320
 on the planet.

1033
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,640
 You may be familiar with the history

1034
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,040
 of kind of the Berlin Wall, remember that,

1035
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,440
 and communist East Germany.

1036
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,600
 You know what's happening right now,

1037
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,340
 in the most atheist, like truly,

1038
00:40:58,340 --> 00:40:59,800
 I'm not just speaking in superlatives,

1039
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,240
 other than North Korea, which we don't have the stats on,

1040
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:05,520
 because they're North Korea,

1041
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:09,880
 the most atheist place on the planet is East Germany.

1042
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:12,280
 Do you know what happens every single year in East Germany?

1043
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:16,280
 A conference of 12,000 young adults come together.

1044
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,440
 Why do they come together?

1045
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,560
 For a prayer conference.

1046
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,840
 And they show the video at this thing,

1047
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,680
 and honestly, we do this thing called launch retreat,

1048
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:25,680
 which is the bomb, and it made launch look like,

1049
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,680
 oh man, we have got to up our game.

1050
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:31,800
 It was unreal, 12,000, 12 times what we see.

1051
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,840
 And then they showed us just the church

1052
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,120
 that was hosting kind of this whole event,

1053
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,600
 and it was inside of London itself,

1054
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,960
 where 6,000 people every single week come,

1055
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,440
 and they gather on these four different locations.

1056
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,920
 They've planted 75 churches, and you know what they said?

1057
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:48,320
 Our vision, we're gonna see London fall to Jesus again.

1058
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,600
 And then they began to talk about,

1059
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,520
 all over just different countries,

1060
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,200
 inside of Europe, and Australia, and Canada.

1061
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,560
 There was a Catholic priest who got up,

1062
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,600
 and he talked about God at work inside of Canada,

1063
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,720
 and how thousands and thousands of people

1064
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:00,760
 are turning to Jesus.

1065
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,700
 Honestly, it was like, pfft.

1066
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:03,960
 People like you exist?

1067
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:07,000
 I'm mind blown, because God is at work,

1068
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,920
 and the church remains.

1069
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,520
 And whatever vision that you may have of like,

1070
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:12,320
 man, he's just exclusively at work in Dallas,

1071
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:13,960
 or he's just exclusively in these places,

1072
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,760
 the church remains, and the people of God

1073
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,160
 are all over these places.

1074
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,280
 And one of the things that this guy from Germany said

1075
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:23,520
 is we will see the church rise again in Europe.

1076
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,280
 And that's our mission, that's what we're committed to,

1077
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,440
 and they're seeing it happen.

1078
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:28,320
 You may not even be hearing of it.

1079
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,920
 You may, like me, think, oh wow, that's actually happening.

1080
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,080
 It's happening in Australia,

1081
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,400
 it's happening all over our world,

1082
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,240
 because the gates of hell will not stand

1083
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:36,720
 against the body of Christ.

1084
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:40,720
 And Jesus is alive and at work, and he is on the move.

1085
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:44,200
 And the remnant, the remnant remains.

1086
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:48,840
 What I wanna close with here is just a reminder,

1087
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,600
 if you're inside of the room and you wonder,

1088
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,720
 do I really matter, like am I making a difference?

1089
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,120
 Does it even matter the fact that I work

1090
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,080
 in the job that I'm at?

1091
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,160
 Does it matter the fact that I live

1092
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,080
 in this apartment complex?

1093
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,640
 Does me, when I follow Christ,

1094
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:01,720
 is it really actually making any significant difference?

1095
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:06,560
 Light always pushes back darkness.

1096
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:10,520
 It always makes a difference in darkness.

1097
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:11,600
 And Billy, what I'm gonna have you do is,

1098
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:12,720
 if you will shut the lights down,

1099
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,280
 this is just gonna be a visual representation

1100
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:15,560
 that'll lead us into worship,

1101
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:16,880
 where I wanna ask you to just do something,

1102
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:17,880
 if you'll join me, if you believe,

1103
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:18,960
 just shut lights down.

1104
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:23,760
 I wanna just talk briefly about what the Bible says,

1105
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,280
 the picture the world created,

1106
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,120
 or the picture of our world is that it is a world

1107
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:28,480
 that is full of darkness.

1108
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:32,760
 And into that darkness, Jesus said,

1109
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:36,080
 I am preserving a people to preserve the world.

1110
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,400
 And the remnant will remain,

1111
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:40,200
 and they will be different colors on their skin.

1112
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:43,760
 There'll be different languages that they speak,

1113
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,840
 but they will all unite around the Messiah,

1114
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:47,800
 the Savior.

1115
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:50,120
 And the visual image, really,

1116
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:50,960
 if you have a phone right now,

1117
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:51,800
 I'm gonna invite you to take it,

1118
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:54,120
 and you can pull it out and just turn on your light.

1119
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:56,880
 From heaven's perspective,

1120
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,600
 this is what the message of Christianity,

1121
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,960
 this is what, if you ever wonder in your life,

1122
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:04,400
 do I really matter?

1123
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,920
 Do you know what God sees when he looks down,

1124
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,320
 and you look around, you can just see,

1125
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:09,160
 and this is what heaven's perspective is.

1126
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:10,000
 I want you to think about that.

1127
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,360
 That's what Jesus, at the end of the day, says,

1128
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:14,320
 this is what the body of Christ is

1129
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:15,840
 in a world full of darkness.

1130
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,120
 I've got lights,

1131
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:20,040
 and the gates of hell won't stand against it,

1132
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:22,240
 and I'm gonna place them purposefully wherever they are,

1133
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,640
 and here's what you gotta know.

1134
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:28,440
 Every time light enters darkness, it wins.

1135
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:29,280
 Every time.

1136
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:32,720
 And the Savior of the world has said,

1137
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:37,200
 I am placing my people purposefully from my kingdom,

1138
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,460
 where they are, where they live, and where they work,

1139
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:42,660
 to shine so that others would not see their light,

1140
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:45,440
 but they would see the God who put them there.

1141
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:46,440
 Let me pray.

1142
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:49,160
 Father, thank you for the reminder

1143
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:54,960
 that you are at work.

1144
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:55,800
 Forgive me.

1145
00:44:55,800 --> 00:45:00,900
 Just the ways that, in my own mind,

1146
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:05,900
 I can assume that something like seeing Europe

1147
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:08,880
 taken for the name of Jesus is too great of a task.

1148
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,760
 Father, would you grow our vision for the church?

1149
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:12,520
 Would you strengthen the church and our land?

1150
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:16,040
 Father, we pray for hundreds more churches in Dallas, Texas

1151
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:17,600
 to be formed, to take place,

1152
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:20,520
 that hundreds of thousands of the five million people

1153
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:23,320
 that live in DFW would end up stepping into a church,

1154
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,280
 and they would step more so into a relationship

1155
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:26,120
 with the God who loves them.

1156
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:27,320
 We pray for Houston.

1157
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:28,320
 We pray for Fort Worth.

1158
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:29,280
 We pray for El Paso.

1159
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,880
 We pray for Cedar Rapids and Spring and the Woodlands

1160
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:34,140
 and every place, Tulsa,

1161
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:36,360
 where the body of Christ is gathered.

1162
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:38,080
 I pray for friends in the room who right now

1163
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:40,920
 are filled with just a, man,

1164
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:42,400
 they're not convinced that they're either

1165
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,100
 making a difference.

1166
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:45,660
 They're not full of hearts that wanna go

1167
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:48,440
 and to see you take more ground in our land,

1168
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:49,840
 more ground in the places we work,

1169
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:50,760
 more ground in our heart.

1170
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:51,760
 Father, would you strengthen,

1171
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,500
 would you fill them with courageous faith?

1172
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,120
 Would you fill my heart with courageous faith?

1173
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:57,320
 Would you do something amazing in our midst?

1174
00:45:57,320 --> 00:46:01,480
 You're the King who makes the darkness tremble,

1175
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:03,480
 and we worship you now in song, amen.
