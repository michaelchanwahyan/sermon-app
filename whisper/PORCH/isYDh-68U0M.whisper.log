[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760]   (dramatic music)
[00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:20.920]   - Porsche, how we doing?
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:21.840]   (congregation cheering)
[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.520]   Come on, come on.
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.440]   Hey, if we don't know each other, my name is JP,
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:26.480]   Jonathan, Percluta.
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.080]   It's a privilege to be with you tonight as we continue.
[00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.480]   Jonah, if you're tuning in from somewhere else,
[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.600]   listening in your car, watching online,
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.440]   I wanna welcome you.
[00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.680]   And we know there's campuses all over the country
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:37.920]   that are tuning in as well.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.920]   And so we're so excited that you guys are listening
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:41.760]   in Fort Worth.
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:42.580]   We love you.
[00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:43.420]   We know that you're close.
[00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:44.560]   Houston, we love you too.
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.840]   And so just excited to be where we are at this evening.
[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.520]   And I gotta start with a little bit
[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.100]   of a disclaimer for you, okay?
[00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.640]   So I have not always been walking with Jesus,
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:55.480]   neither have you,
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.960]   but especially in college, I was not walking with the Lord
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.600]   and didn't know Christ.
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.400]   I was not a Christian.
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.400]   And so as I tell you this story,
[00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.720]   the story I'll open with, it's a little bit crazy,
[00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.720]   but there's a reason that I start here.
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.800]   And so my buddy and I,
[00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.080]   just as indicative of not being a Christian,
[00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.000]   we were going to South Padre for spring break.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.080]   And so that's where we wanted to go,
[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.400]   Padre for spring break.
[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.960]   And we wanted to do all the things that you do in Padre
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:25.800]   on spring break.
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.040]   And so we go down there, it's me and him.
[00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.000]   And I don't know if you remember this,
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.400]   I don't know where you're at in your faith journey.
[00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.040]   If you can remember,
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.760]   if you were even not a Christian as an adult,
[00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.800]   but you can remember just kind of being with your boys
[00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:38.680]   or being with your girls,
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.360]   you got your crew and you're ready
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.560]   for whatever comes your way.
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.460]   'Cause you guys just, that's how you roll.
[00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:44.760]   That was me and him.
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.840]   He was a big dude, like worked out a lot.
[00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.700]   And was like on steroids and stuff.
[00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.320]   And so they called us the number 10
[00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.360]   'cause I was like the one skinny guy
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.760]   and he was the big zero.
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.400]   And so we go to Padre, we stay at Motel 6 there
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.480]   and we go clubbing one night.
[00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.000]   All right, and so we're in the club,
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.240]   Louie's backyard and we're partying up at Louie's
[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.820]   till late in the night and we're leaving the club
[00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.240]   and somebody comes up to him and they say,
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.960]   "Hey, yo, what's up man?
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.920]   "You know where we can score some eggs."
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.280]   And so he just kind of snaps into character
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.320]   because this is what we did.
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.640]   We were always looking for an adventure all the time.
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.000]   He snaps into character, he's like,
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.160]   "What, you're just gonna ask me this in public,
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.000]   "in front of everybody?
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.740]   "Hey, come over here, JP, you're not gonna believe this guy
[00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.600]   "what he just asked me, come over here."
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.280]   And he takes him across the street
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.800]   and he's like, "So what are you looking for?"
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.360]   And the guy's like, "Man, I'm looking for like 10 tabs
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.160]   "of molly, 10 tabs of eggs.
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.360]   "You know, you guys got some?"
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.260]   He's like, "Man, we can get you,
[00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.980]   "but don't just be coming up to me in public, you know?"
[00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.760]   And I'm like, "We can, we can get, what?"
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:49.760]   (congregation laughing)
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.040]   Didn't know that, but he's just messing with the guy, right?
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.880]   And he's like, "Yeah, no."
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.480]   "So you're looking for 10 tabs, okay, yeah,
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.780]   "we'll get you, why don't you meet us
[00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.960]   "in that Kroger parking lot in two hours?"
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.320]   Which was like, you know, four in the morning or something.
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.380]   And so he's like, "Meet us in that Kroger parking lot
[00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:05.440]   "in two hours."
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.240]   And so we, and we walk away, and then we're like,
[00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.400]   "Okay, now we gotta figure out what X looks like."
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.400]   And so we remember we met this guy at the Motel 6 earlier,
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.720]   and he looked like somebody
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.080]   that might know what it looks like.
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.980]   And so we went, his name was Craig, we said,
[00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.840]   "Hey, Craig, man, let me ask you a question.
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:23.680]   "You know what X looks like?"
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.200]   He's like, "Dude, I know what X looks like."
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.240]   He's like, "Call me Craig Dog," that's what he said.
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.040]   And, and so he's like, "It looks like,
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.720]   "it looks like Sudafed."
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.200]   And I'm like, "Bingo."
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.340]   So we go to the, we go to the gas station,
[00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:38.680]   and we buy some Sudafed.
[00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.640]   I know, don't do this at home, okay?
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:41.920]   Like I've lost half of you.
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.120]   You're like, "I thought I was in church."
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.160]   Listen, so don't do this, but we go,
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.520]   we go get 10 tablets of Sudafed,
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.660]   and we go and we meet this guy.
[00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.780]   He's there in his Jeep Wrangler,
[00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.540]   and I pull up and he's like happy to see us.
[00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.500]   And I said, "Hey, you know, I gotta check you
[00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:00.740]   "and make sure you don't have a wire."
[00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.260]   'Cause that's what I've seen on TV, you know?
[00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.220]   And so dude's like up against the car,
[00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:05.540]   I'm like searching him,
[00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.300]   and I'm like, "Yo, Matt, he's good," you know?
[00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.980]   And so my buddy comes up and we give him, you know,
[00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:13.660]   the 10 tablets of Sudafed.
[00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:14.980]   I told you it was a crazy story.
[00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.340]   10 tablets of Sudafed, he hands us a bunch of money,
[00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.840]   and then we leave, and we're like, we're laughing,
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.640]   you know, the whole way back to the hotel.
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.080]   We're like, "Man, this is crazy,
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.640]   "'cause you know, he thinks he's rolling on X,
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.660]   "and really he's just got clear sinuses and stuff."
[00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.720]   And so, and so we're like, you know, we did this.
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:33.920]   And don't do that at home.
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.540]   I'm telling you, this is not a good story,
[00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.000]   not something to replicate.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.500]   And so the next day we wake up and our tires are flat.
[00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.760]   And I'm like, "Matt, he's coming for us, man.
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.800]   "He's got friends, dude, we gotta figure this out."
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.600]   So we literally flee to Mexico.
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.200]   I'm not kidding, like we run to Mexico.
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.640]   I'm not, like, we're like, "Hey, we gotta get away.
[00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.920]   "We gotta let things calm down here in America.
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.600]   "Let's go to Mexico."
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.240]   And so we get in the car, we get the tires fixed.
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.520]   We spend the morning doing that and hiding.
[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.400]   And then we get in the car, we drive to Mexico,
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.000]   and all day we're just thinking,
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.080]   and we're running, you know, and we're scared.
[00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.280]   And we're like, "Man, what are these guys gonna do?"
[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.720]   If they, see, that was, it was funny when we were drunk,
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.560]   but now it's like, what are we gonna do?
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.000]   These guys, what are they gonna do to us if they find us?
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.180]   And we're running, right?
[00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.640]   And we're running, and this season of my life I was running,
[00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.880]   but it wasn't from some drug dealers.
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.960]   It wasn't from some drug users.
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.720]   I was running from my calling.
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.620]   I was running from my purpose.
[00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:39.160]   I was running from everything that God had for me.
[00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.360]   I was running from the goodness of God.
[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.160]   I was afraid that I would get caught,
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:44.820]   not just by some drug users,
[00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.240]   but by the Lord God Almighty.
[00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.760]   I was paying Him lip service,
[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.420]   even going to church sometimes, even singing sometimes,
[00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:53.600]   maybe raising a hand in worship.
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.720]   Meanwhile, running from Him to South Padre,
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:01.040]   to bars, to clubs, to relationships, to dead ends.
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.920]   I had the heart of a runaway.
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.880]   We're in Jonah.
[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.480]   And Jonah, if there's a runaway in scripture,
[00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:09.840]   we covered it in chapter one.
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.080]   DeMar and Garrett have done a great job
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.760]   taking you as tour guides through this book of Jonah.
[00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:17.480]   Showing you that this guy is running
[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.180]   from God's best for him.
[00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:23.520]   And so if you're just here with us
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:24.600]   for the first time tonight,
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.480]   we're gonna be in chapter four,
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.700]   but I'll give you a quick recap.
[00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:31.280]   Chapter one, God comes to Jonah and says,
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.680]   "Hey, I want you to go to Nineveh
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.380]   "and tell them that they have sinned against me.
[00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:38.280]   "Call them to repentance."
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.260]   And Jonah says, "No, thank you.
[00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.300]   "I hate the Ninevites.
[00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:44.080]   "They're Assyrians.
[00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:47.280]   "They are the great, great, great, great, great,
[00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:50.500]   "great, great cousins of ISIS, the Taliban."
[00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:54.120]   Right there by Mosul, Iraq.
[00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.480]   He's like, "I'm not going there."
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:58.880]   So he gets on a boat and he flees to Spain.
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:00.600]   He's like, "I'll go on a vacation in Spain."
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:01.820]   He's running from Spain.
[00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:03.760]   God sends a storm.
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:06.300]   Sovereign over the weather, storm comes.
[00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:08.760]   Jonah is found sleeping in the bottom of the boat.
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.600]   How can you sleep at a time like this?
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.000]   "Hey, why is this storm here?"
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.140]   He's like, "I think it's me."
[00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:14.880]   They're like, "Throw him overboard."
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:17.120]   All right, a big fish comes and swallows him.
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.360]   Don't get caught up on the fish.
[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:19.920]   It's just like God called him an Uber
[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.320]   to get him where he needs to go.
[00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:24.280]   And so the fish shows up, swallows Jonah.
[00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:26.320]   Jonah's in the fish for three days.
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:29.100]   Fish throws him up on the shore three days later.
[00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:30.400]   And the people of Nineveh,
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:32.680]   Jonah walks through with five words in the Hebrew.
[00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:33.880]   It's five words.
[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:36.800]   God is going to bring judgment in 40 days.
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:39.600]   That's his message.
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:42.600]   God's going to judge you in 40 days.
[00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:45.780]   And the people of Nineveh listened to him and repented.
[00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:48.420]   They sat in sackcloth and ashes.
[00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:50.260]   Their heart grieved before the Lord.
[00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.300]   They turned from their ways.
[00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:57.860]   And so you see now Jonah, now in contrast with chapter one,
[00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:00.280]   Jonah's doing all the right things, but with the wrong heart.
[00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:03.020]   He still has the heart of a runaway.
[00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:06.240]   He doesn't love these people.
[00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:07.460]   He doesn't love God.
[00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:09.360]   He doesn't want God's best for anybody.
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.500]   Jonah cares about him.
[00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:12.600]   That's it.
[00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:17.160]   And so as we move through this chapter,
[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:21.360]   we're going to see how the rebellious heart
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:23.800]   of a runaway seeks to control,
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:26.020]   how the rebellious heart of a runaway seeks comfort,
[00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:28.300]   and how the rebellious heart of a runaway
[00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:30.800]   has misguided concerns.
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:36.440]   If you're here and you're like, man, I'm a good person.
[00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:38.960]   You know, I've never been to the bar or the club
[00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:40.800]   or drunk or doing X or selling X
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:43.640]   or selling Sudafed like it was X or sleeping around.
[00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:45.540]   I never done any of those things.
[00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:48.200]   But your heart is still hard
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:50.580]   and you still have the heart of a runaway.
[00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:51.760]   And you need to hear this message.
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:53.080]   And maybe you're here and you're like, dude,
[00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:55.520]   I did Molly this past weekend, man.
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:56.420]   You don't know me.
[00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:59.600]   I came in here, I'm hiding in the back.
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:04.520]   And I'm glad you're here.
[00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:07.400]   I'm glad you're here.
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:10.960]   You're running and God's faster.
[00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:15.240]   And he's going to catch you in the most beautiful way.
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:18.760]   His grace is going to catch up with you
[00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:20.040]   in the most beautiful way.
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:22.320]   In chapter three, it ends,
[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:26.360]   when God saw what the Ninevites did in their repentance
[00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:27.840]   and how they turned from their evil ways,
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:30.180]   he relented and did not bring on them
[00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:32.160]   the destruction he had threatened.
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:34.360]   This is the most successful missionary
[00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:37.080]   that maybe had ever lived up until now.
[00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:40.240]   He walks in with five words and the entire city,
[00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:45.120]   600,000 people repent, but to Jonah, chapter four,
[00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:47.720]   but to Jonah, this seemed very wrong.
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:48.560]   Why?
[00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:51.480]   Because he's a racist.
[00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:54.320]   He hates the Ninevites.
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:55.280]   He hates them.
[00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:59.680]   He knows that they have been called to,
[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:01.800]   or he's heard the prophecy that they're going to come
[00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:03.080]   and conquer Israel.
[00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:04.960]   And he hates them.
[00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:09.000]   He knows, he's heard how they skin people alive,
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.440]   how they're wicked people, and he hates them.
[00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:14.840]   But to Jonah, this seemed very wrong and he became angry.
[00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:17.640]   He prayed to the Lord, isn't this what I said, Lord,
[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:18.960]   when I was still at home?
[00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:21.200]   That is why I tried to forestall,
[00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:23.340]   that means tried to keep from happening,
[00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:25.040]   by fleeing to Tarshish.
[00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:29.280]   I knew you are a gracious and compassionate God,
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:31.240]   slow to anger and abounding in love,
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:33.600]   a God who relents from sending calamity.
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.080]   Now, Lord, take away my life,
[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:38.480]   for it is better for me to die than to live.
[00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:44.040]   He's complaining that God is gracious and abounding in love
[00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:45.180]   and slow to anger.
[00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:50.000]   He's actually quoting what God says about himself
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.380]   in Exodus 34, after he's led the Israelites from slavery.
[00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:56.520]   He's freed them.
[00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:58.660]   And God says this about himself,
[00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:00.520]   that he's a gracious and compassionate God,
[00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:02.120]   slow to anger, abounding in love,
[00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:04.160]   one who relents from sending calamity.
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.360]   But he also says this in Numbers 14,
[00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:10.480]   also in Nehemiah 9, in Psalm 86, in Psalm 103,
[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:14.960]   in Joel chapter two, the same description, God is gracious,
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:18.320]   slow to anger, abounding in love, compassionate.
[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:20.600]   This is the God you serve.
[00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:22.860]   This is the God who loves you.
[00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:25.320]   The God of the Old Testament, God of the New Testament,
[00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:26.400]   same God.
[00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:34.760]   And the Lord replied, is it right for you to be angry?
[00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:38.500]   See, and if you just read in chapter one,
[00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:40.520]   you'd think the reason Jonah doesn't wanna go to Nineveh
[00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:42.880]   is because the Assyrians there, they're gonna kill him
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:44.860]   and they're wicked savages.
[00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:46.680]   But the reason he doesn't wanna go to Nineveh
[00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:48.280]   is 'cause he knows that if he goes,
[00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:49.800]   that God is gonna show them mercy,
[00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:52.600]   and he doesn't want them to have mercy.
[00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:54.720]   He wants to control the situation.
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:57.040]   That's why it says he went to Tarshish.
[00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:00.540]   And he's disappointed in God because God did
[00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:02.220]   what God says he's going to do,
[00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:04.600]   and he's angry that he didn't get revenge,
[00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:06.680]   that he didn't get to control the situation.
[00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:08.680]   He's angry he's not in control.
[00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:12.680]   And he did what many do when they realize
[00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:13.520]   they're not in control.
[00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:14.640]   He wants to die.
[00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:17.680]   That's the last thing that he can control is his own life.
[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:23.180]   And so the rebellious heart of a runaway seeks to control.
[00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:24.920]   That's my first point today.
[00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:27.000]   The rebellious heart of a runaway seeks to control.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.080]   Here's what you need to know, friends.
[00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:29.360]   You're not in control.
[00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:32.320]   God is in control, and you don't want to resent
[00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:34.160]   the one who is in control,
[00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:37.000]   because when you begin to resent the one who is in control,
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.800]   you stop seeing his goodness.
[00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:41.080]   You stop seeing him as good.
[00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:42.360]   This is the craziest verse,
[00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:44.320]   potentially in the entire Scripture.
[00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:47.400]   I knew that you were a gracious and compassionate God,
[00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:49.360]   slow to anger, and a bounty in love.
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:50.200]   Wah!
[00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:54.440]   He's whining about how good God is.
[00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:55.840]   It's so weird.
[00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:59.080]   Have you ever been disappointed with God?
[00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:03.120]   And maybe now you even see purpose in it.
[00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:05.040]   I don't know if you lost a friend,
[00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:09.320]   and now you see, oh man, they weren't any good for you,
[00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:12.880]   or you start to see God's purpose,
[00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:13.720]   but when you're hurt,
[00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:15.840]   you can't see God's purpose through your hurt.
[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:18.160]   You can't see God's purpose through your pain.
[00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:23.480]   I've heard this, like, maybe a relationship,
[00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:25.000]   maybe that's an idol for you,
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.040]   is a relationship.
[00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:29.880]   I've talked to people, you know, multiple stories,
[00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:31.840]   not any one of you, over and over.
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:32.840]   You know, somebody comes up,
[00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:34.960]   "TP, I can't believe I'm so mad at God."
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:36.000]   Why are you mad at God?
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.040]   "Because I got in this relationship with this guy,
[00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:39.880]   "and I thought he was good, and he had a Bible,
[00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:40.960]   "and he knew some verses,
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:42.880]   "and then he just took advantage of me,
[00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:44.400]   "and like, why didn't God show me?
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:45.680]   "Why didn't God tell me?
[00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:49.880]   "And I just don't understand why God let this happen."
[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:51.200]   Let me ask you a question.
[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:54.160]   Did you guys sleep together?
[00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:55.520]   Did you guys sleep together?
[00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:57.640]   Was it physical?
[00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:59.160]   Yeah, yes.
[00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:02.200]   Are you in community?
[00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:03.360]   Did your community group say,
[00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:05.560]   "Oh yeah, man, he's the one for you."
[00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:07.640]   No, I mean, you know, when the relationship
[00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:10.520]   came into my life, it just became kind of consuming,
[00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:12.200]   and so I didn't have time for community,
[00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:15.080]   and church, and I just was so focused on the relationship.
[00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:16.920]   Hey, my hunch is, my hunch,
[00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:18.360]   I'm just gonna go out on a limb here,
[00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:20.960]   that God is in heaven, jumping up and down,
[00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:21.800]   waving his arms, saying,
[00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:23.080]   "Hey, he's no good for you.
[00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:24.720]   "He's no good for you, don't do that."
[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:26.040]   But you just didn't listen.
[00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:29.040]   And now, as you walked into obedience
[00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:31.240]   to a place of pain, you're mad at God?
[00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:36.200]   That's what's going on here?
[00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:38.780]   It's God's fault that you didn't listen?
[00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:43.440]   This problem is God's fault?
[00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:45.400]   Hey, and can I tell you something great and amazing?
[00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:48.320]   God is abounding in love.
[00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:51.480]   And so if I saw one of my daughters
[00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:54.960]   in a relationship that was not good for her,
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:58.160]   I would wanna do everything in my power to take it away.
[00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:01.280]   And this is gonna be one of the best things
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:02.400]   that ever happened to you.
[00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:04.800]   You just can't see it right now, past your hurt,
[00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:06.580]   past your pain.
[00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:08.280]   God has a purpose in it.
[00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:10.940]   So often, our hardships,
[00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:12.360]   they're the biggest blessings, right?
[00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:13.240]   But not always, right?
[00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:14.680]   Sometimes, they're only hurt.
[00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:16.920]   As I talk to people, they say,
[00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:18.680]   "Man, I'm so mad at God.
[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:19.980]   "He took my mom.
[00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:22.480]   "I'm so mad at God.
[00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:24.240]   "I don't want anything to do with Him.
[00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:25.080]   "He took my dad.
[00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:26.680]   "He took my brother, my cousin."
[00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:29.760]   And I hate that, man.
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:34.920]   Part of the human experience is the pain of loss.
[00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:40.720]   And I wouldn't say this in that moment, right?
[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:42.820]   I can say things to the many of us
[00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:44.520]   that I wouldn't say in a pastoral moment
[00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:46.240]   where I just would wanna sit with someone in their hurt
[00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:48.480]   and grieve with them and cry with them and weep with them.
[00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:49.680]   But to you, I'd say,
[00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:51.180]   it's a little bit of a weird concept
[00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:52.340]   if you think about it for a minute, right?
[00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:54.280]   Because everyone who's been born dies.
[00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:58.660]   I mean, God just did what He does for everyone.
[00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:00.540]   Like, everyone dies.
[00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:03.100]   And really, you're not mad that God took your mom.
[00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:06.780]   You're mad that God took her before He took you.
[00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:08.860]   You're mad that He took her
[00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:10.900]   before you agreed with His timing,
[00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:13.220]   before you approved His timing.
[00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:15.380]   That's really what you're mad about, right?
[00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:20.680]   And I hate the grief
[00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:24.600]   that comes with the pain of loss.
[00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:28.260]   But can I tell you something?
[00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:29.920]   As lovingly as I can, I wanna tell you something.
[00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:32.320]   I want you to hear me lean in and think about this.
[00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:33.420]   God's never hurt you.
[00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:36.280]   God's never offended you.
[00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:38.040]   You don't need to forgive God.
[00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:39.960]   He's never done anything against you.
[00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:45.360]   Everything that He does to you is out of love.
[00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:48.080]   It is what is best for you.
[00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:50.880]   And maybe the greatest thing
[00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:54.020]   that you could believe and learn right now is that,
[00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:58.980]   that a good, holy, righteous, perfect Father
[00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:03.920]   only gives good gifts to His children.
[00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:07.940]   And so if what you have is not good,
[00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:08.960]   He's not done.
[00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:12.800]   Hold out and trust Him.
[00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:15.320]   He's got a purpose in it.
[00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:18.440]   See, when you seek to control, you miss out on God's calling.
[00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:21.600]   When you start to ask the question,
[00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:24.280]   God, what do you want to do with me in this situation?
[00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:25.380]   That's what you can ask.
[00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:26.380]   It may hurt, but you're like,
[00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:28.220]   okay, God, what are you teaching me here?
[00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:29.520]   What do you want me to see here?
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:30.740]   What do you want me to do here?
[00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:31.940]   What is my purpose in this?
[00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:35.500]   And when you start focusing on your control,
[00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:37.820]   you miss out on God's calling.
[00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:40.780]   And if you've ever been in a place where you're like,
[00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:42.520]   God, I don't like where this is going,
[00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:44.960]   that's you seeking to control.
[00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:47.060]   I don't like where this career is going.
[00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:48.460]   Calm down, God has a purpose in it.
[00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:49.800]   I don't like where this is going.
[00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:51.980]   I don't like where I'm, how long am I gonna be single?
[00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:52.820]   Hold on.
[00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:56.080]   Hold on, God's hand's not off the wheel.
[00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:59.100]   He's still sovereign.
[00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:00.820]   He's still in control.
[00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:05.580]   See, in Sal Padre, I was running from God's calling.
[00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:06.820]   And I thought it was awesome,
[00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:08.740]   but let's all that craziness aside,
[00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:09.780]   what's cool about that?
[00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:10.820]   That's lame, man.
[00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:15.520]   Sold some guys some Sudafed, stole from them.
[00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:18.780]   That's not living.
[00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:22.160]   Nothing amazing about that.
[00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:23.800]   Like you go with my old boys,
[00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:25.460]   like that's the story they're gonna tell you.
[00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:26.520]   That's like the trophies.
[00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:28.840]   They're like, man, you remember the time in Padre?
[00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:30.200]   That was crazy.
[00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:31.140]   No, it was stupid.
[00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:35.040]   That's the truth, it was stupid.
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:38.180]   No, I remember that time in Haiti
[00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:39.200]   when we hiked that mountain,
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:40.240]   we sat under that waterfall
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:41.280]   and there was that voodoo temple
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:42.120]   and we got to share the gospel
[00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:43.640]   with that dude who was sacrificing that snake.
[00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:44.600]   That was crazy.
[00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:48.240]   Remember that time when we went into Africa
[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:50.680]   and then we drove six hours into the bush
[00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:52.440]   and we got there and we talked to that person
[00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:54.800]   who trusted Christ because of a dream they had?
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:56.080]   That was crazy.
[00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:57.880]   That time in Padre, that was stupid.
[00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:00.120]   Wasn't life.
[00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:04.920]   I was in my control, not his control, right?
[00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:06.580]   Wasn't surrendered to God.
[00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:11.200]   Jonah hates these people.
[00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:14.720]   He doesn't think they deserve God's grace.
[00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:17.040]   Who do you think God doesn't,
[00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:18.680]   how can we empathize with Jonah?
[00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:20.680]   I don't know who it is for you.
[00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:21.640]   I don't know who you hate.
[00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:25.720]   Maybe it's Aggies or maybe it's Republicans
[00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:30.720]   or Democrats or Trump or the KKK, right?
[00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:33.120]   We don't like those people, right?
[00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:34.160]   Racist.
[00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:38.360]   And you might think, well, they don't deserve heaven, right?
[00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:41.720]   Whoever it is for you, like ISIS, okay?
[00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:45.500]   Like cutting off, sawing off the heads of Christians.
[00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:47.000]   Don't give them grace.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.440]   Like that, they would be ISIS.
[00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:52.000]   That would be the equivalent.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.320]   So we would be like, God, no, no, no.
[00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:57.580]   Don't give them abundant riches forever in your kingdom.
[00:19:57.580 --> 00:19:59.680]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, not that.
[00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:05.180]   You guys know who Jeffrey Dahmer is?
[00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:10.560]   Maybe the most notorious serial killer in America's history.
[00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:17.080]   17 victims that he raped, that he butchered,
[00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:24.200]   that he ate, that he did things
[00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:27.160]   that honestly I can't even say up here.
[00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:31.040]   That horrific, that grotesque.
[00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:34.480]   He was evil in every sense of the word.
[00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:36.640]   A wicked, wicked man.
[00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:39.340]   And you know where he's at right now?
[00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:47.000]   As best I can tell, with Jesus,
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:52.720]   in his kingdom forever, enjoying your inheritance.
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:54.080]   How do you feel about that?
[00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:57.600]   Any part of you like, no, no, no, no.
[00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:59.120]   He doesn't deserve that.
[00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:00.180]   Neither do you.
[00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:02.960]   You see that?
[00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:03.880]   You deserve that.
[00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:07.320]   It's uncomfortable, isn't it?
[00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:09.920]   Neither do you.
[00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:13.240]   It's grace, the essence of grace,
[00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:17.600]   getting something great when we deserve something harsh.
[00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:23.400]   Jesus, Jesus gave up his control.
[00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:25.960]   He didn't seek to control the situation.
[00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:28.120]   He said, not my will, but thy will be done.
[00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:32.200]   Verse five, Jonah had gone out and sat down
[00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:33.760]   at a place east of the city.
[00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:37.000]   There he made himself a shelter and sat in its shade
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.040]   and waited to see what would happen to the city.
[00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:43.280]   He's still hopeful that God's gonna destroy the city.
[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:45.840]   He's like, okay, like he sets up shop and he's watching,
[00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:47.040]   he's gonna be entertained.
[00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:49.320]   He's like, please God, bring your wrath, bring your wrath.
[00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:52.680]   Then the Lord God provided a leafy plant
[00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:56.640]   and made it grow up over Jonah to give shade for his head
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:58.720]   to ease his discomfort.
[00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:01.880]   And Jonah was very happy about the plant.
[00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:05.240]   But at dawn, the next day, God provided a worm
[00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:07.860]   which chewed the plant so that it withered.
[00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:11.080]   When the sun rose, God provided a scorching east wind
[00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:14.520]   and the sun blazed on Jonah's head so that he grew faint.
[00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:16.680]   He wanted to die and said,
[00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:19.120]   it would be better for me to die than to live.
[00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:20.280]   But God said to Jonah,
[00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:22.880]   is it right for you to be angry about the plant?
[00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:25.760]   It is, he said, and I am so angry.
[00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:29.840]   I wish I were dead again, wanting to die again,
[00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:32.200]   like an adolescent or complaining,
[00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:33.840]   whining like a five-year-old.
[00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:38.120]   God sends a plant to protect him.
[00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:39.920]   God sends a worm to kill the plant.
[00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:40.980]   Here's what's going on.
[00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:43.440]   The Ninevites repent and God has mercy on them.
[00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:45.220]   Jonah's angry and wants to die.
[00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:47.320]   God covers his shelter with a leafy plant.
[00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:49.040]   Jonah is happy and wants to live.
[00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:50.720]   The plant dies, Jonah is hot.
[00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:52.360]   Jonah wants to die again.
[00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:54.920]   He's dramatic, right, back and forth.
[00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:58.920]   His happiness is determined by his comfort.
[00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:00.220]   You know anyone like that?
[00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:03.240]   Like if he's happy or not,
[00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:05.300]   depends on what's going on around him.
[00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:12.040]   He doesn't want to be uncomfortable.
[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:13.840]   He's weak in his spirit.
[00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:15.720]   He has no fight, only whine.
[00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:18.680]   Whine, whine, whine, whine, whine.
[00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:21.760]   You know, today it's Holy Week.
[00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:24.600]   Moving toward Easter this weekend,
[00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:27.640]   and on this day, what we reflect on
[00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:29.680]   is it's the day that Jesus stood
[00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:31.120]   outside the city of Jerusalem
[00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:34.940]   and wept over the people who had not repented.
[00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:40.020]   That's where we're at in Holy Week today.
[00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:42.480]   But contrast that with Jonah.
[00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:43.960]   We see him set up outside the city.
[00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:45.080]   He's got his feet propped up.
[00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:47.040]   He's looking to be comfortable
[00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:49.200]   and he's ready to be entertained.
[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:50.040]   And I would just tell you,
[00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:52.200]   the rebellious heart of a runaway seeks comfort.
[00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:53.360]   That's my second point.
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:57.440]   The rebellious heart of a runaway seeks comfort.
[00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:00.080]   Not to be on mission for God, but to be comfortable.
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:04.040]   To spend your 76 years
[00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:08.120]   as comfortable as you can with a security system
[00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:13.120]   and a 401K and a good career
[00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:15.080]   and some kids maybe.
[00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:16.880]   You know, maybe a boy and a girl,
[00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:18.080]   or maybe two girls and a boy.
[00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:19.120]   I don't know where you're at with that.
[00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:20.520]   You know, and maybe a German Shepherd
[00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:22.040]   or a Golden Doodle or something.
[00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:24.840]   And you know, out in the suburbs, right?
[00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:26.280]   'Cause that's when you're gonna cross, you know,
[00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:29.880]   the 635 or wherever you're at, Fort Worth and Houston.
[00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:33.120]   And so it's just like, it's like, I wanna be comfortable.
[00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:35.760]   Guys, let me tell you something.
[00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:36.600]   Let me tell you a story.
[00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:37.440]   People ask all the time,
[00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:40.800]   "Hey, how did you know you wanted to go into ministry?
[00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:43.040]   How did you, JP, how did you know
[00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:43.880]   you wanted to go into ministry?
[00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:44.760]   Can I tell you something?
[00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:48.320]   I never wanted to go in ministry.
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:52.040]   Never, never even crossed my mind.
[00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:54.400]   Never even thought about it for one second,
[00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:56.680]   not one time, never once.
[00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:59.960]   When I graduated from college, I moved to Dallas.
[00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:00.840]   I was in corporate America.
[00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:01.960]   I was climbing the corporate ladder.
[00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:05.500]   I was in business development for a Fortune 15 company.
[00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:06.960]   I saw my career path.
[00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:09.280]   I wanted my boss's job and then his boss's job.
[00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:12.620]   It was very clear to me what I wanted in life.
[00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:15.900]   And I experienced some success there, but I also met Jesus.
[00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:18.720]   I walked into a church, hung over, sat in the back row,
[00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:21.080]   and God came into my life, invaded my heart,
[00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:22.440]   and began to turn it upside down.
[00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:25.500]   He began to have me fall in love with him.
[00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:28.340]   I began to fall in love with Jesus.
[00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:30.100]   And I remember sitting at my desk.
[00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:32.940]   I was there at my desk, and I was on my computer,
[00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:35.120]   and I was reading the scriptures.
[00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:36.880]   And I heard, and I can't explain this, okay,
[00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:38.940]   I'm just gonna tell you what I experienced.
[00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:40.960]   I heard the voice of God say,
[00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:43.220]   "You're going to come and work for me now."
[00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:45.440]   I had never heard that.
[00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:48.560]   You know, it wasn't something super familiar to me.
[00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:50.440]   It doesn't happen all the time,
[00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:52.280]   and very rarely, I would say,
[00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:54.680]   but this particular day, what it seemed like
[00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:57.280]   is that I heard God say, "You're going to come work for me."
[00:25:57.280 --> 00:26:01.660]   I shut my laptop, and I walked out at 1.30 in the afternoon,
[00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:03.360]   and I got in my car, and I drove home,
[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:04.540]   and I called a friend, and I said,
[00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:06.500]   "Dude, you're not gonna believe what just happened.
[00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:07.580]   "You gotta meet me at my house."
[00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:08.420]   He's like, "I'm at work."
[00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:09.240]   I said, "No, you gotta leave.
[00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:10.280]   "You gotta come to my house.
[00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:11.120]   "Meet me at my house."
[00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:12.800]   He did at two o'clock in the afternoon.
[00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:14.000]   We're sitting there, and I'm like,
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.840]   "Man, the Lord spoke to me, bro.
[00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:17.340]   "He said I'm gonna come work for him now.
[00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:19.640]   "I guess this means I gotta go into ministry."
[00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:21.200]   I don't know what that looks like.
[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:23.120]   Never thought about working for the church.
[00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:24.960]   True story, never thought about it.
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:26.320]   I said, "I guess I'll hire an attorney,
[00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:28.140]   "start a not-for-profit organization,
[00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:29.200]   "raise money, and give it away.
[00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:30.640]   "I'll be like the Christian United Way.
[00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:32.120]   "That's what I'll do."
[00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:34.440]   And he said, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
[00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:36.120]   Was a good member of my community group.
[00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:38.180]   Said, "Hey, hold on, man.
[00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:39.660]   "If this was God,
[00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:44.680]   "then you should ask him what he wants you to do.
[00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:46.700]   "Like, if he's gonna tell you
[00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:47.700]   "you're gonna come work for me,
[00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:50.060]   "you should say, 'Well, God, what is my job?'"
[00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:52.080]   And I thought, "Well, that makes sense.
[00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:52.920]   "That makes sense."
[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:54.160]   So I started praying.
[00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:56.080]   Say, "God, would you put me where you want me
[00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:57.860]   "and help me find contentment there?"
[00:26:57.860 --> 00:27:01.100]   Still have not considered the church.
[00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:02.300]   God, put me where you want me
[00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:04.420]   and help me find contentment there.
[00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:06.220]   Put me where you want me and help me find contentment.
[00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:08.580]   On the fifth day, the church called.
[00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:13.380]   The church, Watermark Community Church called me.
[00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:15.340]   Guy's on the other end of the phone,
[00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:17.840]   "Hey, I've got a job I think you should consider."
[00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:20.820]   What, who, who, who is this?
[00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:23.900]   Yeah, I'm at Watermark,
[00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:26.320]   and I'm looking over this job description,
[00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:28.300]   and I was praying about who should do it,
[00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:30.760]   and your name came to mind.
[00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:33.180]   I said, "What?
[00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:35.400]   "The church?
[00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:36.740]   "I can't, I don't go to seminary.
[00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:37.780]   "I can't work at the church.
[00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:39.740]   "What are you talking about?
[00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:41.060]   "This is crazy."
[00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:44.620]   I said, "Oh, you talked to my friend."
[00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:46.380]   "No, I didn't talk to anybody."
[00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:50.460]   I said, "I was praying about who would do this,
[00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:53.780]   "and I feel like the Lord's leading me to you."
[00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:57.100]   I'm like, "What?"
[00:27:57.100 --> 00:27:58.380]   So I went to an interview.
[00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:00.580]   They said, "Why should we hire you?"
[00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:02.260]   I was like, "You'd be crazy to hire me.
[00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:03.820]   "Don't do that.
[00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:06.100]   "That's not gonna be good for anybody.
[00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:07.000]   "I'm gonna be broke,
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.560]   "and you guys are gonna have a pastor
[00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:10.400]   "that's not any good.
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:11.620]   "You know, don't do that."
[00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:16.420]   And they were like, "Yeah, you might be right.
[00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:18.100]   "Let us think about it."
[00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:19.740]   They took a week to think about it.
[00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:20.700]   You know what happened?
[00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:22.660]   A company in St. Louis called, said,
[00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:23.500]   "Hey, come up here.
[00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:24.660]   "We wanna interview you."
[00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:26.060]   I went up there to interview, and they said,
[00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:27.640]   "Hey, we want you to build a sales organization
[00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:28.480]   "for us in Dallas.
[00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:30.000]   "You can work out of your house.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.300]   "You're gonna be making twice as much
[00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:32.320]   "as what you're making right now.
[00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:33.980]   "It's gonna be amazing.
[00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:37.220]   "By the way, we wanna offer you the job right now."
[00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:38.660]   It was like my dream job.
[00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:41.260]   I got on a Southwest flight back from St. Louis to Dallas,
[00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:42.520]   and you know what I did?
[00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:46.740]   Watermark called, said, "Hey, we want to offer you the job.
[00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:48.020]   "We got two jobs."
[00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:49.020]   You know what I did?
[00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:55.580]   I said, "Man, I think I gotta go do this other thing,
[00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:58.860]   "the sales job."
[00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:01.500]   Turned it down.
[00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:04.500]   After I had said I'd been called to ministry,
[00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:05.900]   God was so big, right?
[00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:06.740]   You know what I mean?
[00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:08.300]   Five days later, it was a miracle.
[00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:09.360]   It was a miracle.
[00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:12.900]   The Lord provided, He did everything, He was so faithful.
[00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:15.100]   I said, "I think I gotta go make money, man.
[00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:17.900]   "I'll make some money, I'll save some money,
[00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:19.140]   "and then I'll do that ministry thing.
[00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:20.020]   "That's how this will work.
[00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:21.220]   "It'll be beautiful."
[00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:22.900]   I did that job for six months.
[00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:24.140]   Every single day I woke up,
[00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:26.140]   and I knew I was being disobedient.
[00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:28.700]   Every single day I woke up, I knew I was running
[00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:32.320]   from my calling, what God had clearly ordained.
[00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:36.380]   And on the day of my six-month anniversary,
[00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:38.160]   I went and told them, "Hey, I've gotta go do
[00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:39.260]   "this ministry thing."
[00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:41.860]   "I've gotta go do that."
[00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:44.180]   And you would think that'd be the end
[00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:46.380]   of this beautiful story, but every single day,
[00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:48.020]   my heart wants comfort.
[00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:51.860]   Every day, my heart wants control.
[00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:55.620]   Even in the midst of seeing God do miracles
[00:29:55.620 --> 00:29:57.740]   and change the lives of young adults,
[00:29:57.740 --> 00:30:00.540]   and to see a revival right before my eyes,
[00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:03.580]   a great awakening through 20 and 30-somethings,
[00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:08.580]   and every day, I'm tempted by the world to run from God.
[00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:11.460]   And you hear, "Well, how does that relate to me?
[00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:13.560]   "Because God, He's not calling you to ministry.
[00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:14.420]   "Can I tell you something?"
[00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:16.380]   God is calling you to ministry.
[00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:19.980]   He's calling you to ministry.
[00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:22.740]   You look and audit the last eight hours of your life,
[00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:23.740]   and can I tell you something?
[00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:26.460]   If you didn't do ministry, you missed your calling.
[00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:31.820]   If you didn't do ministry, today, as you look backwards,
[00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:33.780]   you missed out on your purpose.
[00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:36.580]   What, you thought God put you here just to make money?
[00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:38.580]   Just to be comfortable?
[00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:40.700]   That's why you think God left you here?
[00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:42.980]   So that you could be as comfortable as possible
[00:30:42.980 --> 00:30:43.820]   and then die?
[00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:46.780]   That's why you think He left you here?
[00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:50.180]   No, He called you to Himself to be a part
[00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:52.700]   of the greatest mission that has ever existed.
[00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:54.540]   What are you gonna do with your life?
[00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:57.780]   You're gonna live the American dream
[00:30:57.780 --> 00:31:00.380]   and then die the American dream?
[00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:08.020]   And have no eternal significance whatsoever?
[00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:12.200]   That's it?
[00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:15.920]   You've been called to ministry.
[00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:19.640]   In the same way that I was called to ministry
[00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:22.220]   long before working for a church.
[00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:25.160]   Could you imagine if we have a good job,
[00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:26.780]   a nice house, success, great friends,
[00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:28.640]   minimal pain, and nothing in heaven?
[00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:32.220]   It's like Francis Chan said,
[00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:34.460]   "Our greatest fear should not be a failure,
[00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:37.800]   "but of succeeding at things in life
[00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:39.100]   "that don't really matter."
[00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:40.860]   Let me say it again.
[00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:43.640]   "Our greatest fear should not be a failure,
[00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:46.380]   "but of succeeding at things in life
[00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:47.780]   "that don't really matter."
[00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:53.660]   So,
[00:31:53.660 --> 00:32:00.500]   if the temptation for you is to be more comfortable,
[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:03.580]   wouldn't the most loving thing God could do
[00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:05.880]   is start to remove some of that protection?
[00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:14.460]   So that you don't make protection your God,
[00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:16.320]   so that you don't make comfort your God.
[00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:18.420]   See, sometimes God removes our protection
[00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:19.620]   for our own protection.
[00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:24.200]   Sometimes God kills the leafy plant covering our head
[00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:26.260]   from the hot sun for our own protection.
[00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:28.220]   Sometimes God removes our protection
[00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:29.260]   for our own protection.
[00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:30.980]   Can I tell you something really interesting here?
[00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:32.560]   Is the word God provides,
[00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:34.660]   it's the word manna with the H at the end of it.
[00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:36.320]   It's where we get the word manna,
[00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:39.340]   where in Exodus 16, God provides food out of heaven,
[00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:40.600]   like food from nowhere.
[00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:42.300]   Manna is what that's called.
[00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:44.220]   God provides manna.
[00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:45.680]   And so this word God provides,
[00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:48.420]   it shows up in this book over and over and over.
[00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:50.840]   God provided a whale or a big fish.
[00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:52.160]   God provided a plant.
[00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:53.600]   Then he provided a worm.
[00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:56.260]   And then he provided a scorching east wind.
[00:32:58.420 --> 00:33:00.660]   Sometimes God removes our protection
[00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:02.720]   for our own protection.
[00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:07.740]   So we don't make a God out of comfort.
[00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:10.800]   We're Christ followers, right?
[00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:11.780]   Jesus followers.
[00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:13.860]   We're to emulate Christ, to be like Christ.
[00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:14.700]   Can I tell you something?
[00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:17.280]   Did Christ pursue comfort when he was here?
[00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:19.540]   You remember in Matthew 16, where he's talking to his boys,
[00:33:19.540 --> 00:33:20.380]   he's got them huddled up.
[00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:21.940]   He said, "Man, you guys know what's gonna happen to me
[00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:23.160]   "is I'm gonna go to Jerusalem,
[00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:25.360]   "and they're gonna spit on me and curse me
[00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:28.560]   "and torture me and then publicly kill me."
[00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:29.820]   And Peter's there and he's like,
[00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:32.080]   "No, no, no, no, no, Jesus.
[00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:33.900]   "That's not going to happen."
[00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:35.420]   And he turns to Peter and he says,
[00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:36.960]   "Get behind me, Satan.
[00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:39.060]   "You are a stumbling block to me.
[00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:41.840]   "You do not have in mind the concerns of God,"
[00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:45.480]   underline concerns, "but merely human concerns.
[00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:48.140]   "You're just thinking about your own comfort, Peter.
[00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:50.640]   "I didn't put you here to be comfortable, Peter."
[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:52.280]   Then Jesus said to his disciples,
[00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:55.040]   "Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves
[00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:56.780]   "and take up their cross and follow me,
[00:33:56.780 --> 00:33:58.960]   "for whoever wants to save their life will lose it,
[00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:01.880]   "but whoever loses their life for me will find it."
[00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:04.540]   What good will it be for you,
[00:34:04.540 --> 00:34:07.620]   porch goers,
[00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:10.760]   to gain the whole world and yet forfeit your soul?
[00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:14.520]   And what can anyone give in exchange for their soul?
[00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:20.240]   The Christian life is not one of comfort, but of commission.
[00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:22.200]   The Christian life is not one of comfort,
[00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:25.200]   but of commission, that's you being on mission with God,
[00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:27.460]   living out your purpose, living out your calling.
[00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:29.160]   You're not too cool for that, man.
[00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:33.800]   Okay, you've got to get past yourself
[00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:37.280]   and your fears and your insecurities,
[00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:39.160]   and you've got to start surrendering.
[00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:40.640]   Lord, I can't, but you can.
[00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:44.760]   I know I'm so afraid to even mention the word Jesus,
[00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:47.320]   but God, would you embolden me and give me courage,
[00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:50.300]   'cause I know you didn't give me a spirit of timidity.
[00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:53.540]   What a power of love and self-discipline.
[00:34:53.540 --> 00:35:01.340]   If God calls you to something uncomfortable,
[00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:03.680]   are you willing to go?
[00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:08.240]   Jesus gave up his comfort for you and I,
[00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:11.360]   so that we would live for him.
[00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:14.660]   Verse 10, "But the Lord said,
[00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:18.380]   "you have been concerned about this plant,
[00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:21.760]   "though you did not tend to it or make it grow.
[00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:24.800]   "It sprang up overnight and died overnight.
[00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:28.360]   "And should I not have concern for the great city of Nineveh
[00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:31.880]   "in which there are more than 120,000 people
[00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:34.360]   "who cannot tell their right hand from their left,
[00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:36.280]   "and so many animals?"
[00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:39.100]   Question mark, end of book.
[00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:43.320]   Walk off the stage, done.
[00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:44.240]   Are you serious?
[00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:47.480]   Is that not the craziest chapter in all of the Bible?
[00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:51.040]   Like that's how that book just ended.
[00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:54.300]   Let me break it down for you.
[00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:59.300]   He says, he says, "You're so afraid of it,
[00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:02.660]   "I mean, you're so concerned about this plant,
[00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:04.460]   "but you didn't even make the plant.
[00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:06.360]   "You didn't even tend to the plant.
[00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:07.720]   "You didn't even care for the plant.
[00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:10.480]   "You don't even have a green thumb.
[00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:14.940]   "But the Ninevites I made, all 600,000 of them,
[00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:17.420]   "and 120,000 children,
[00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:19.460]   "those who don't know their right from their left,
[00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:24.220]   "120,000 children, and even the animals there I made.
[00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:26.140]   "Since you don't care about the Ninevites,
[00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:28.440]   "do you care about their kids, Jonah?
[00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:29.900]   "Do you care about their kids, Jonah?
[00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:31.440]   "How about their animals, Jonah?
[00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:33.260]   "If you don't care about them, do you care about their kids?
[00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:36.500]   "Do you care about their golden doodles, Jonah?"
[00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:39.220]   God's punking him, man, like in a righteous, holy way.
[00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:42.120]   Somehow he's like, "What about the animals, Jonah?
[00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:44.560]   "Do you even care about them?
[00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:47.220]   "You didn't make that plant.
[00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:52.080]   "You care about your succulent more than your neighbor.
[00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:58.380]   "You care about your ficus tree more than your coworker,
[00:36:58.380 --> 00:37:05.180]   "and they're both dying."
[00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:08.580]   And they're both dying.
[00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:16.640]   Some of us, we care about our bicycle, or our vehicle,
[00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:20.640]   or our watch, or a purse, or a bag, or a retirement plan
[00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:22.000]   more than our neighbors.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.120]   We check our bank accounts more often
[00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:25.360]   than we share the gospel.
[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:27.000]   What's wrong with us?
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:31.760]   The rebellious heart of a runaway has misguided concerns.
[00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:32.580]   That's my third point.
[00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:36.280]   The rebellious heart of a runaway has misguided concerns.
[00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:39.460]   "Jonah, if you're concerned about the plant,
[00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:41.840]   "should I not be concerned about these people
[00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:43.520]   "whom I've created?"
[00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:45.280]   See, you have misguided concerns
[00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:48.440]   because your concerns are driven by your desire to control
[00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:50.160]   and your desire for comfort.
[00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:51.920]   Your desire for control and comfort
[00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:54.600]   has misguided your concerns.
[00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:56.300]   And it's not just of non-believers.
[00:37:56.300 --> 00:37:58.560]   Even Christians can drift to this place.
[00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:00.940]   Even younger brothers become older brothers.
[00:38:00.940 --> 00:38:03.080]   All of a sudden, you fall in love with Jesus.
[00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:04.880]   You wanna share the gospel with everyone.
[00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:07.920]   You start reading your Bible, and by the world,
[00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:10.840]   you're beat down to lukewarm Christianity,
[00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:12.660]   which may not even be Christianity.
[00:38:12.660 --> 00:38:16.200]   So tired.
[00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:18.040]   That's because you're doing stuff by your strength,
[00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:19.000]   not God's strength.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:23.840]   God uses the weak to shame the strong.
[00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:27.040]   You're tired because you're so wrapped up
[00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:28.160]   in the current of the world,
[00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:30.260]   you weren't meant to swim in that current.
[00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:34.740]   You start standing against that current
[00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:36.420]   by the power of the Lord,
[00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:40.520]   with the power of His Holy Spirit.
[00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:44.160]   And I don't think you're gonna be so tired.
[00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:48.000]   Even a Christian can drift to this place.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.360]   I would say it's natural for a Christian
[00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:52.760]   to drift to this place, not surrendered, but to God,
[00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:54.240]   not surrendered to His Spirit.
[00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:56.040]   And be careful, because what's gonna happen
[00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:57.400]   is you're gonna gain the whole world,
[00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:58.720]   and yet forfeit your soul.
[00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:04.240]   So here's a question for you.
[00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:06.360]   Do you care that people are going to hell?
[00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:11.160]   I mean, do you really believe that people are going to hell?
[00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:13.360]   And if you really believe that people are going to hell,
[00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:16.400]   where would you go and not share the gospel?
[00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:21.760]   On the day of my anniversary, my marriage to Monica,
[00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:24.000]   which is the 25th of every month,
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.620]   I buy her some hydrangeas.
[00:39:26.620 --> 00:39:27.800]   She likes hydrangeas.
[00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:31.700]   And so worked it out with a local florist
[00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:33.240]   that on the 25th of every month,
[00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:34.680]   she gets some fresh hydrangeas.
[00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:37.380]   Do you know why I have to buy them for her every month?
[00:39:37.380 --> 00:39:39.720]   Because they die.
[00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:44.320]   They last about two weeks, and then they die.
[00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:46.720]   And they're tossed out.
[00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:49.280]   And this is a metaphor that the Scriptures give us.
[00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:55.240]   Wheat and the tares, the grass thrown out, threshing floor,
[00:39:55.240 --> 00:40:00.640]   that we are all dying, that we're going to face judgment,
[00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:02.960]   that every person you bump into,
[00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:07.560]   every person you talk to is a soul on this earth
[00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:10.800]   dying, headed towards judgment.
[00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:16.760]   So like Jonah's plant died, so will the Ninevites,
[00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:19.080]   so will your neighbors, so will your coworkers.
[00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:24.020]   And so if God is cared, you know who God loves?
[00:40:24.020 --> 00:40:27.440]   Every person God created.
[00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:30.920]   I just think about how much I love my kids
[00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:34.040]   and the really small role I played in their creation,
[00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:35.040]   really tiny role.
[00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:41.800]   And God, He ordained your days ahead of creation
[00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:44.240]   so that you might walk in Him,
[00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:46.800]   in the works that He desires to do through you.
[00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:48.560]   He's crazy about you.
[00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:52.200]   He's not mad at you.
[00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:56.200]   He loves you, and He really wants you to surrender to Him
[00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:59.160]   so that you might live out your purpose for the first time.
[00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:02.480]   He has such incredible plans for you,
[00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:05.480]   but you're so distracted by your sin,
[00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:07.360]   and you're so distracted by the world,
[00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:10.280]   and you're so distracted by your own agenda
[00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:13.600]   that you can't see God's agenda.
[00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:23.000]   And there's freedom in life
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.360]   when you care for what God cares about.
[00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:28.520]   It's really the essence of having the heart of God.
[00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:30.360]   So why did this crazy book happen?
[00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:31.720]   Why is it in the Scripture?
[00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:34.640]   Why did God preserve these four chapters
[00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:36.440]   that we would teach in here tonight?
[00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:38.480]   To teach us about Jesus.
[00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:42.440]   He did this to teach us about Jesus.
[00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:44.340]   See, Jesus trusted the Father.
[00:41:44.340 --> 00:41:45.640]   This weekend, it's Easter.
[00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:48.280]   It's a layup opportunity for you to invite someone to church
[00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:49.760]   and to talk about the gospel.
[00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:51.200]   People are really willing to listen
[00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:52.320]   to the gospel this time
[00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:54.160]   because it explains the holiday
[00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:55.320]   that we're about to celebrate.
[00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:56.160]   You can test me.
[00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:57.280]   If somebody gets angry at you
[00:41:57.280 --> 00:41:58.680]   for talking about the gospel, come find me.
[00:41:58.680 --> 00:41:59.640]   I'd love to hear about it,
[00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:01.920]   but I'm telling you, you can take a risk tomorrow.
[00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:04.320]   You should every day, but specifically this week,
[00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:07.360]   you can talk to someone about Easter, and you should.
[00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:08.400]   And some of you are like,
[00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:10.400]   you know, I wouldn't have the rebellious heart of a runaway
[00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:12.200]   if I just had a sign from God.
[00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:14.240]   You're like talking about JP, like, God talked to you.
[00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:16.400]   Like, if God would just do that to me, I'd follow him.
[00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:17.240]   I'd give him my heart.
[00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:18.700]   If he just gave me a sign, he did.
[00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:19.960]   It was an empty tomb.
[00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:23.200]   Find me the bones of Jesus.
[00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:24.320]   He gave you a sign.
[00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:28.400]   This man from a town you wouldn't know about
[00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:29.920]   except he was born there, Bethlehem,
[00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:31.080]   lived in a town, Nazareth.
[00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:32.560]   You wouldn't even know where it is on a map
[00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:33.440]   except he lived there,
[00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:37.700]   became the single most polarizing character in history
[00:42:37.700 --> 00:42:40.160]   that on his birthdate, every atheist friend you have
[00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:44.000]   signs the date of his birthdate on their checks,
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:45.320]   or they count from it anyways.
[00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:47.800]   2018 years from the day he was born,
[00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:49.400]   he reset time, this guy.
[00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:53.080]   And the empty tomb is the sign that you need.
[00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:54.520]   'Cause you're like, if he was real,
[00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:55.480]   if he'd give me a sign,
[00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:56.680]   I wouldn't have the heart of a runaway.
[00:42:56.680 --> 00:42:59.160]   He has, it's Matthew chapter 12, verse 38.
[00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:02.060]   "Then some Pharisees and teachers of the law said to Jesus,
[00:43:02.060 --> 00:43:04.500]   "'Teacher, we want to see a sign from you.'
[00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:07.780]   "He answered, 'A wicked and adulterous generation
[00:43:07.780 --> 00:43:10.140]   "'asks for a sign, but none will be given
[00:43:10.140 --> 00:43:13.500]   "'except the sign of the prophet Jonah.
[00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:16.620]   "'For as Jonah was three days and three nights
[00:43:16.620 --> 00:43:18.860]   "'in the belly of a huge fish,
[00:43:18.860 --> 00:43:22.200]   "'so the Son of Man will be three days and three nights
[00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:23.540]   "'in the heart of the earth.
[00:43:23.540 --> 00:43:26.520]   "'The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment
[00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:28.920]   "'with this generation and condemn it,
[00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:31.960]   "'for they repented at the preaching of Jonah,
[00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:36.440]   "'and now something greater than Jonah is here.'"
[00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:41.440]   The Ninevites, those wicked people,
[00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:45.440]   will stand as we face judgment.
[00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:47.800]   And those of us who have not trusted in Christ
[00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:52.600]   will be way, way, way infinitely worse off than they are.
[00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:54.600]   Guys, can I tell you why this story's in there?
[00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:57.160]   Think about this, if you know the Bible at all,
[00:43:57.160 --> 00:43:59.320]   I don't know if you know in Mark chapter four,
[00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:02.320]   when the storm comes and Jesus is there with his disciples
[00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:04.280]   and Jesus is sleeping and they come to him,
[00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:06.320]   they say, "How could you be sleeping at a time like this?"
[00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:08.360]   And they're like, "Hey, you gotta stop this storm."
[00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:11.180]   Well, I don't know if you remember in Jonah chapter one,
[00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:13.880]   there's a boat and a storm and Jonah's sleeping.
[00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:15.760]   And you know what they said is the same phrase.
[00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:18.440]   How could you be sleeping at a time like this?
[00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:19.960]   We gotta stop the storm.
[00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:23.840]   The way that Jesus stopped it is he said, "Stop."
[00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:28.500]   The way that Jonah stopped it, he's like,
[00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:31.080]   "Man, you gotta sacrifice me to the sea."
[00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:34.380]   See, Jonah was a sinner who ran from God.
[00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:36.920]   Listen, Jonah was a sinner who ran from God.
[00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:39.580]   Jesus is the God who runs towards sinners.
[00:44:39.580 --> 00:44:44.640]   Jonah was thrown overboard as a sacrifice for his sin.
[00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:46.820]   Jesus was sacrificed for our sin.
[00:44:46.820 --> 00:44:51.840]   Jonah was resurrected from the depth after three days.
[00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:55.880]   Jesus was resurrected from the grave after three days.
[00:44:55.880 --> 00:44:58.380]   Jonah brought a message of condemnation.
[00:44:58.380 --> 00:45:00.640]   Jesus brought a message of reconciliation.
[00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:01.880]   It's John chapter three.
[00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:03.920]   "For God did not send his Son into the world
[00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:06.840]   "to condemn the world, but to save the world through him."
[00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:10.000]   Jonah didn't wanna see one nation bow their knee to God.
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:14.240]   Jesus is the God to whom every nation and knee will bow.
[00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:17.960]   Jonah spent 40 days hoping for destruction on a city.
[00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:20.920]   Jesus spent 40 days after his resurrection
[00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:25.920]   ministering so that we would not be destroyed.
[00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:28.680]   Jonah waited for his enemies to be punished.
[00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:31.200]   Jesus was punished for his enemies.
[00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:32.920]   Jonah had a heart of anger.
[00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:34.640]   Jesus has a heart of love.
[00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:36.280]   Jonah needed a savior.
[00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:39.760]   Jesus is Jonah's savior.
[00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:41.840]   Jesus is the greater Jonah.
[00:45:42.920 --> 00:45:47.120]   Jesus is the greater Jonah.
[00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:49.240]   Jesus has everything under control.
[00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:51.800]   He's got the whole world in his hands.
[00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:55.080]   He's got the whole world in his hands.
[00:45:55.080 --> 00:45:57.860]   Jesus sacrificed his comfort to give us eternity.
[00:45:57.860 --> 00:46:01.700]   And Jesus' greatest concern is saving you
[00:46:01.700 --> 00:46:06.140]   and helping you live out your real calling.
[00:46:06.140 --> 00:46:08.080]   What Jesus did that Jonah didn't
[00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:10.760]   is Jesus trusted the Father.
[00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:15.200]   Jesus did the will of the Father.
[00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:17.400]   Friends, can I tell you, there is not any life
[00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:19.800]   that you will live as magnificent and wonderful
[00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:22.920]   and fantastic and incredible as you every day
[00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:25.160]   waking up and trusting the Father.
[00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:28.980]   That is the adventure, man.
[00:46:28.980 --> 00:46:30.200]   That is your purpose.
[00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:31.500]   That is your calling.
[00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:37.400]   Last week was my daughter's spring break,
[00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:39.160]   and so we went to a friend's lake house,
[00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:42.040]   and God gave us this beautiful day out there.
[00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:46.000]   It was perfect weather, bright, sunny sky, clear skies.
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.400]   And we sat out on the deck,
[00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:49.880]   and I was fishing with two of my kids,
[00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:52.800]   and my daughter, Presley, wanted to go on a paddleboard.
[00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:54.240]   And so she gets on the paddleboard,
[00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:55.840]   and she's paddling out there,
[00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:58.160]   and I'm like, yeah, have fun, have fun.
[00:46:58.160 --> 00:46:59.800]   It's a beautiful day, have fun.
[00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:01.360]   And I'm fishing with the other two,
[00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:03.520]   and I'm watching her because when one of my kids
[00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:06.080]   is not right there with me and in potential danger,
[00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:08.120]   I'm watching, every move, I'm fishing,
[00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:10.840]   but I'm watching her, I'm watching, I see you, Presley.
[00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:13.840]   And she goes out a little further and a little further,
[00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:15.760]   and she's almost to the middle of the lake now,
[00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:18.200]   like just a speck on the horizon.
[00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:20.160]   But I'm watching her, and I can see, you know,
[00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:22.800]   boats are going by and whatnot, and I'm watching her.
[00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:26.560]   And she keeps, I'm thinking she's gonna come back
[00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:27.520]   right about now, but then I notice
[00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:30.000]   there's a strong crosswind on the lake.
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:35.240]   And she keeps drifting further and further and further.
[00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:37.120]   And right about now, a loving father,
[00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:38.760]   I'm like, okay, I don't have a boat, you know?
[00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:41.800]   And so I'm like, somebody, I gotta find a boat,
[00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:43.480]   you know, anybody got a boat?
[00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:47.240]   And so I finally flagged down someone with a boat,
[00:47:47.240 --> 00:47:49.720]   and I'm like, hey, can you take me to get my daughter
[00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:50.660]   on the other side of the lake?
[00:47:50.660 --> 00:47:53.660]   Now she has reached the other shore.
[00:47:53.660 --> 00:47:55.500]   I'm serious, all the way across the lake,
[00:47:55.500 --> 00:47:56.960]   she's climbed out on the other shore.
[00:47:56.960 --> 00:48:00.880]   Can you take me to get her, to bring her back?
[00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:03.960]   He says, sure, the whole family gets in his boat,
[00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:06.360]   and this nice stranger, you know,
[00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:10.680]   takes us across the lake there,
[00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:13.320]   it's a really large cove, takes us across the lake,
[00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:17.880]   and we get there, and the kids, you know,
[00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:19.800]   her sister and brother are like,
[00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:21.320]   were you scared, were you scared?
[00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:23.000]   She's like, no, I wasn't scared,
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:24.440]   I knew Daddy was watching me.
[00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:26.440]   I wasn't scared.
[00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:29.360]   I wasn't scared.
[00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:32.480]   And they said, what were you thinking?
[00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:34.880]   Like, when you were out there in the middle,
[00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:36.720]   were you concerned?
[00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:39.040]   She said, no, I wasn't concerned,
[00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:41.120]   I was watching Daddy to see if he was concerned,
[00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:43.200]   'cause if he's not concerned, then I'm not concerned,
[00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:44.880]   I know he's watching me.
[00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:46.880]   I was like, oh, you must not have seen my concern,
[00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:49.320]   you know? (laughing)
[00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:52.440]   Were you scared?
[00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:54.760]   No, I knew Daddy would come get me.
[00:48:54.760 --> 00:48:58.000]   I knew he'd come for me.
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:48:58.920]   I wasn't scared.
[00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:03.320]   And what a beautiful picture of faith,
[00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:06.400]   which she didn't know, 'cause her daddy can hardly swim,
[00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:08.520]   you know, he's not even very,
[00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:10.200]   you know, I'm like, I need a boat.
[00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:15.120]   But God, man, he's watching.
[00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:20.120]   You've never been anywhere, he's not watching you, man.
[00:49:20.120 --> 00:49:22.880]   Some of you, that's your biggest fear, right?
[00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:23.720]   He's watching.
[00:49:23.720 --> 00:49:25.720]   He sees you.
[00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:29.800]   I want you to take a deep breath.
[00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:32.520]   Breathe in, exhale, do it again now, okay, ready?
[00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:33.440]   Take a deep breath.
[00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:37.400]   Exhale.
[00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:39.120]   He's watching.
[00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:41.240]   He's got you.
[00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:44.720]   He's got a plan for your life, it's beautiful.
[00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:49.080]   You're never gonna regret risking anything for him.
[00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:50.280]   You can't even use the word risk,
[00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:52.960]   it's not a risk when it's for God.
[00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:56.960]   That you live out his purpose.
[00:49:56.960 --> 00:49:58.400]   You don't have to be concerned,
[00:49:58.400 --> 00:50:00.040]   you don't have to be afraid.
[00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:01.240]   You know what you can do?
[00:50:01.240 --> 00:50:02.560]   It's just like Presley said,
[00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:05.760]   you can live the adventure that he has you on.
[00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:08.280]   Not the stupid one in South Padre,
[00:50:08.280 --> 00:50:12.680]   but the one in your place of business,
[00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:14.120]   the one in your communities,
[00:50:14.120 --> 00:50:17.040]   the one overseas maybe.
[00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:18.680]   Some of you, you might move overseas,
[00:50:18.680 --> 00:50:21.560]   I don't know what he has, but it's gonna be amazing.
[00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:24.440]   And you can trust him, friends.
[00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:28.760]   He loves you, he is a gracious God,
[00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:31.720]   compassionate, slow to anger.
[00:50:31.720 --> 00:50:33.920]   Isn't that good news?
[00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:36.000]   He's slow to anger, he's slow to anger.
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:38.360]   And abounding in love.
[00:50:38.360 --> 00:50:41.120]   He's got enough for you.
[00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:46.640]   So this story here, it's to teach us about him.
[00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:49.840]   See, when I was in Padre, we ran to Mexico,
[00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:51.200]   I was afraid to get caught.
[00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:54.320]   What I've learned since then,
[00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:56.960]   what I've learned since then,
[00:50:58.080 --> 00:51:00.000]   is the most amazing thing that ever happened to me
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:01.600]   is I got caught.
[00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:03.080]   God caught me with his grace.
[00:51:03.080 --> 00:51:05.360]   Changed my life forever.
[00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:09.960]   Gave me purpose, a mission, a calling, direction.
[00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:12.440]   A new reason to live.
[00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:13.720]   Jonah kept wanting to die,
[00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:15.620]   I have a new reason to live in Christ.
[00:51:15.620 --> 00:51:19.400]   That's my prayer for you.
[00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:22.320]   That's my prayer for you, I'm gonna pray right now.
[00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:24.920]   Father, would you give my friends a new reason to live?
[00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:30.920]   Would you show them their purpose in Christ?
[00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:34.760]   Father, I pray for friends listening
[00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:36.280]   wherever they're at right now.
[00:51:36.280 --> 00:51:43.200]   You are the God of the storm.
[00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:49.400]   The fish obeyed you.
[00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:55.880]   The Ninevites obeyed you.
[00:51:56.880 --> 00:51:58.880]   The plant obeyed you.
[00:51:58.880 --> 00:52:01.880]   The worm obeyed you.
[00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:03.920]   The sun obeyed you.
[00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:05.960]   The wind obeyed you.
[00:52:05.960 --> 00:52:10.960]   And God, Jonah obeyed you eventually with the wrong heart.
[00:52:10.960 --> 00:52:14.760]   And we don't wanna walk in obedience with the wrong heart.
[00:52:14.760 --> 00:52:16.600]   God, would you protect us from that?
[00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:20.360]   And Lord, we know that sometimes you remove our protection
[00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:21.560]   for our own protection,
[00:52:21.560 --> 00:52:23.640]   so that we might turn to you for protection.
[00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:25.720]   God, would you help us to do that right now?
[00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:26.920]   Would you increase our faith?
[00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:29.480]   As we sing this song, would you align our hearts
[00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:31.200]   as we move towards Easter,
[00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:35.560]   and not just a dead God on a cross, but an empty tomb?
[00:52:35.560 --> 00:52:39.280]   A payment for our sins,
[00:52:39.280 --> 00:52:41.800]   so that we don't have to pay for our sins.
[00:52:41.800 --> 00:52:48.760]   Father, would you stir our hearts for you?
[00:52:48.760 --> 00:52:51.640]   That every young adult listening right now
[00:52:52.680 --> 00:52:57.680]   would leave here or leave their place loving you more.
[00:52:57.680 --> 00:53:00.240]   Would you do that even now?
[00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:01.600]   In Christ's name, amen.
[00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:11.600]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
