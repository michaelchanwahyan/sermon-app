[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   [Music]
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   Hey again. Porch, it's good to see you. How are we doing tonight? Yeah? Awesome. So good to have you here.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   So grateful you would trust us with your evening. Not only those of you here in the room, which it's great to see you.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   Also all of you that are tuning in online, it's great to have you with us.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   Special shout out to our Porch Live locations. Can we give them a round of applause please? Yes.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   We love that God's doing work here, but he's doing work out there too.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   Special shout out to Des Moines, Dayton, and Fresno. We love that you guys are a part of the evening.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   Porch, I am so excited. Let me tell you why. Because tonight you get to hear from, and I'm not just saying this,
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   this is an empty lip service, one of my favorite communicators of the Bible.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   And before I introduce him to you, what I wanted to tell you tonight is something that we're committed to here at the Porch
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   is introducing to you new voices. Voices that maybe you haven't heard before, but you need to hear.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   And you will be glad you have heard from. People that don't just stand on a platform of trend, but stand on a platform of truth.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   And that's the guy that's coming tonight. The individual that's going to be teaching you tonight, he is a good friend of mine.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   We knew each other in Houston, Texas. And he is genuinely someone that I look at the example of and say,
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   "Man, I want to love Jesus like that. I want to walk with Jesus and believe in Jesus and have the kind of intensity and fervor that that guy has."
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   And you're going to see exactly what I mean in just a minute.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   Porch, will you all do a great job of helping me welcome my friend, Tyler Moffitt.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   [Applause]
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   Love you. Thank you, God.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   Porch, how we doing tonight? Come on.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Man, it's surreal for me to be up here because I did the math.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   It was 10 years ago almost to the day that, so I grew up in Houston, but I spent a number of years in Dallas.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   And I was living with a host family up in Allen, Texas.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   Anybody from Allen? Come on. Go Eagles, right?
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   And anyway, I come down 75 all alone about 10 years ago.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   And I'm like, I'm going to go to the porch by myself.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   And I show up and I sit right up there.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   So I understand what you guys are feeling.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   And I walk in. I had no idea what to expect.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   And I was just blown away by what you just experienced worshipping of thousands of young adults across Dallas that are just giving praise and honor to Jesus.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   And we're like, man, there's so many of us. This is amazing.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   And then Shane and Shane was leading worship.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   I'm like, Shane and Shane. I just, I was, you know, a fan.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   So they finish and they pray. Everyone bows their head.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   The lights get dark and I'm like, my roommates got to know I saw Shane and Shane.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   So I take out my camera from my iPhone 5 and I'm like, I got to get a picture.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   So I take a picture and it goes flash, flash, flash, flash, flash, flash, flash, flash.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   And everyone mid-prayer turns around like, what the heck, moron.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   And I'm standing there alone like, oh, Lord, I just, the rapture could come right now.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   That'd be awesome.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   And, but you know what?
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   I came back and came back and just got poured into through this place.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   And I love Kylan. Kylan and I got to know each other in Houston.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   And man, he is the real deal.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   He's on his knees just praying, begging for revival in this city and in your heart.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   And so to be here is just amazing.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   Hey, real quick about me, and then we're going to jump, we're going to dive into the text.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   I think we have a picture of my family.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   This is my wife, Jen, and our three little kiddos, ages four, three, and one, just turned one.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   And they wanted to come, but my wife was like, I need them in bed.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   You know, I'm like, I get it.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   And so they're not here, but we live down in Houston.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   But my wife and I actually met here in Dallas.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   In fact, I was working at a different church, but my wife was going to Watermark.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   True story.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   Some of you are going, that's all I need.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   I can find marriage at this place.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   Let's go, right?
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   And, but seriously, she was here and I would slip over Saturday nights or Tuesday night to the porch or to Watermark to come and hear from the word.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   And as I look back in Dallas, my time in Dallas, there's some really sweet years.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   But also, and I even felt it as I was driving up 45 today, my time in Dallas was some of my most insecure years of my life.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   I mean, I failed at my job in relationships with my family more during my time in Dallas than any other season.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   And, and some of that began to wash back over me, even as I was driving in.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   And I thought, maybe some of you here tonight, some of you are killing it.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   You're just, you drove in on your Tesla, just loving life, right?
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   But others of you, man, you're in that insecure place.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   And I just go, I get it.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   I feel that.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   And I think God wants to speak to us tonight, wherever you are on that spectrum, but he wants to speak to you.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   And so we're going to dig into his word.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   So if you have your Bible or they're on your phone, go to the book of Isaiah.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   And we're going to be in Isaiah chapter 49.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   Isaiah 49, the book of Isaiah is kind of wild because a lot of coffee cup verses, right?
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   A lot of cute, your grandma's got it in her house, but you read the book of Isaiah and it's judgment, wrath, fire, exile.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   And you go, this is not that nice.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   And yet in chapter 49, there's a bit of a shift.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   And that's what we're going to see today.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   Hey, wherever you're at in this place, I believe God wants to speak to you tonight.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   And so let's pray and ask him to come and commune with us in a mighty way.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   And then let's dig in.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   Let's pray.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   Father, we believe that you reign above it all.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   Everything we just sang is not just some cute word.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   It is true.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   And so come Holy Spirit, invade this place.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   May there not be one inch of our lives that you leave untouched after an encounter with the living God.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   Oh, we expect big things, big things tonight.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   So come speak through your word.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   Your servants are listening in Jesus name.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   Amen.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   All right.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   I remember when my wife and I first got married, we decided we were going to do Whole30.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   Any of you know what Whole30 is?
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   Okay.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   Wow, some Whole30 enthusiasts.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   Whole30 is where for 30 days you don't eat any gluten, any sugar, or any dairy.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   Some of you are like, you just described my diet, right?
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   And that was me.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   For 30 days, no gluten, sugar, dairy.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   And my wife and I were excited.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   We had been eating a lot, you know, in our wedding and after.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   And we're like, let's just go for it.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   So we did it.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   And we made it three-fourths of one day through Whole30.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   Breakfast, we killed it.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   Lunch, killed it.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   Dinner, we get invited to BJ's for a friend's birthday party.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   And we had the talk on the way there.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   We're like, salad, no croutons, no cheese, oil and vinegar on the side.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   We got this, you know.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   And so we sit down at our table.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   And sure enough, the waitress starts with us.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   What do you guys want?
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   Salad, oil and vinegar on the side, no croutons, no cheese, fist pump, right?
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   You know, and she's like, okay.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   And then before she goes to the next person, she goes, oh, by the way, pizza's half off tonight.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   We're like, ooh.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   And then we hear every one of our friends, pizza, pizza, pizza, meat lovers, pepperoni, pizza.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   And then we get to the end.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   She's like, anything else?
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   And right before she leaves, we're like, yeah, change ours to pizza.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   We want pizza.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   Because here's the thing.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   The ideal of Whole30, the idea of getting in shape and eating healthy sounded so good until we were confronted with sugar and dairy and gluten in a BJ's pizza.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   Now, here's why I say that.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   So often, everything we sing about, the gospel we declare is an ideal that many of us, if it was on a test, we would go, that's what I want.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   That's what I want in my life.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   I intellectually believe it.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   I've done the whole thing.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   I've gotten baptized.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   But deep down, when you start living the reality of life, it's a little more messy; right?
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   And so sometimes we would go, yes, I believe it's true.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   You reign.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   And yet deep down we're just staring at these ceiling tiles going, God, I want to believe it's true.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   But reality of my life right now feels a lot different.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   See, Isaiah, the reason why we're in Isaiah is because in the book of Isaiah, it's written by a prophet named Isaiah, written to people in exile, Babylonian exile, going back over Israel's history.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   And what he's telling them is, look, there's a reason why you're in the place that you're in.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   And so much of the book is judgment, judgment, judgment, but then it changes and it shifts to a moment of salvation.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   Look at Isaiah 49 and look at verse 13.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   Isaiah 49 is all, here's God saying, this is the salvation I'm bringing.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   It's soon.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   It's eventual.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   It's ultimate.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   And then verse 13 is the climax.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   God says, "Sing for joy, O heavens, and exult, O earth.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   Break forth, O mountains, into singing."
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   Why?
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   "For the Lord has comforted His people, and He will have compassion on His afflicted."
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   He says, despite all that you're experiencing right now and all the judgment and all the things that came because of your sin, salvation's coming, so you better start singing.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   Comfort is coming.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   Compassion is coming.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   And we're going to watch in the next three verses how Israel, how the people of God respond to this amazing word of salvation.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   And the first thing we see from the people is an honest feeling, an honest complaint to this salvation that's coming.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   Look at Isaiah 49, verse 14.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   It says, "But Zion said, but the people of God said, 'The Lord has forsaken me.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   My Lord has forgotten me.'"
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   Okay, so pause there.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   They just heard salvation is coming and sing for joy, comfort, and compassion, and their response, they interrupt God and they say, "That's great, but you know what we feel?
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   We feel forsaken by you.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   We feel forgotten by you.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   That's what we feel."
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   It doesn't say they don't believe in God or believe in His promises.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   What it says is despite what they intellectually believe, they feel forsaken.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   They would maybe even say, "God, I believe in your promises, but it's not what I feel right now.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   I don't feel loved by you."
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   And this happens in relationships all the time.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   Some of you know.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   You're trying to have an intellectual conversation about truth.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   Do you love me?
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   Right?
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   Or something like that.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   I'm not saying it can happen either way, but sometimes the guy says, "I love you."
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   And what does the girl say?
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   "Yeah, but I don't feel loved by you."
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   Some of you, this is close to home.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   "I don't feel it.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   I'm hearing the words that you're saying, but I don't feel it."
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   And here's the thing.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   When you don't feel loved by God, you have to get that love from somewhere.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   Some of you have that void.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   Again, you would say, "I believe in God," but you don't feel loved by God.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   And when you don't feel loved by God, you have to get it from someone.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   Some of you are in relationships right now where everyone in your life is saying,
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   "This is a toxic relationship.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   Get away from this guy.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   Get away from this girl.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   What are you doing?"
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   And yet you keep going back like a gravitational pull.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   And people are going, "What are you doing?"
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   And you go, "I don't feel loved by God, so I have to."
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   Maybe you wouldn't say this, but "I have to get this love from them."
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   Some of you, your career, you have to get acceptance from your boss
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   or from your coworkers.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   People are going, "Why are you burning yourself out?
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   You're going to run off a cliff."
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   And you go, "I have to be accepted by them.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   I won't be able to go to sleep at night if my boss doesn't feel like
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   I've done a good job."
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   Some of you, it's your parents or relationships or friends.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   You're actually up at night having panic attacks, anxious,
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   because you're managing everyone's opinion of you.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   That's just how you spend your life.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   "Oh, she's maybe mad.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   Oh, he said that one thing.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   Oh, they used a period at the end of their text, so they're ticked at me."
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   And you're just constantly juggling people's opinions of you.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   And you're going, "What is wrong with me?"
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   And I just want to say maybe it's that you don't feel secure
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   in the fact that God loves you.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   Because if you did, if you felt secure,
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   you walked around with the confidence that God loved you,
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   it's like a superpower.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   No one on this earth can say something that will lead to anxiety at night
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   because you're secure in God's love.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   And the first thing that we see with the people of God is they own it.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   We feel forsaken. We feel forgotten.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   So what does God do? How does God respond?
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   We see what God does is he responds with comforting words.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   Look at verse 15.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   So they say, "The Lord's forsaken me. He's forgotten me."
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   Look at what God says.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   God says, verse 15, "Can a woman forget her nursing child
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   that she should have no compassion on the son of her womb?"
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   And God says, "Even these may forget, yet I will not forget you."
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   So notice what God doesn't do at the beginning.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   They say, "We feel forsaken by you."
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   God doesn't say, "Well, suck it up! A big whoop!
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   I'm creator, you're creation, figure it out!"
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   But he also doesn't pander to them.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   "Oh, I'm so sorry. What can I do to make it feel better?"
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   What God does is he actually uses an analogy, a simile,
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   and he says, "I want you to think."
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   He says, "I want you to think of a nursing mother with her baby."
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   Which is a little weird, but this is what God says.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   God says, "Think of a nursing mom with her little baby."
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   This sits very close to home for me.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   We've got a one-year-old. He nurses with my wife.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   And God says, "My love for you, think about it,
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   is like a mom with her little baby, nursing her baby."
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   And really, when you actually look into the science
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   behind a nursing mom, the love, the connection that goes on,
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   there's actually three layers to this love
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   of a nursing mom to her baby.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   A nursing mother is giving physical love,
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   physical comfort to her baby.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   So literally providing for the baby's physical needs.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   That's the first thing.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   Then the nursing mom is providing emotionally.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   There's actually something in the brain called oxytocin
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   that is released when a mom is feeding her baby
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   that bonds her to her baby.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   And then the third thing about this kind of love,
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   it's unconditional.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   It's all give and no take.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   It's all give from the mom and all take from the baby, right?
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   She doesn't get to the end and go,
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   "That's going to be $27.32 for that, no tax."
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   You know, that's not how that works.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   It's all give.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   And God says, "My love for you is physical.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   My love for you is emotional.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   My love for you is unconditional."
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   But it's even more.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   God says, "Even these may forget you,
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   but I will not forget you."
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   The truth is, as great as moms are,
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   some of our moms are not good moms.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   Some of you, a lot of you probably have great moms.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   Some of you would go, "Man, my mom didn't love me."
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   And God goes, "I know."
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   And even for those of us who had good moms,
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   eventually our moms will pass away and die.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   But God says, "My love for you will never die.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   My love will never be destroyed."
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   This is the truth, the amazing truth of what we sing,
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   the amazing truth of what we declare.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   And it's amazing.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   It's great, but it's all talk.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   It's still all talk.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   And here's the problem with talk.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   When all you have in a relationship is talk,
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   I love you, I love you, I love you,
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   and no action, you can conclude there's no love.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   Some of you, that's what you needed tonight.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   That's what you needed.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   If all you hear is talk, I love you, baby,
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   I love you, I love you, but you don't see any action,
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   it's all talk.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   And there's a sense in here where we hear these words
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   from God, right?
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   God loves you, God loves you, God loves you,
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   and we go, "That's great."
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   But that doesn't feel like,
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   it doesn't feel like that in my life right now.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   It just doesn't.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   Talk, talk, talk, but I don't feel it.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   And so that's why God takes it one another level
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   in verse 16, where he has a powerful display of his love.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   Look at verse 16.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   He says, "Behold," which is the Greek word for look at me,
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   "I have engraved you on the palms of my hands,
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   "and your walls are continually before me."
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   So he says in verse 15 that,
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   just like a nursing mother,
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   that's my love for you even more so,
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   but then he says, "Behold, look at me,
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   "I've engraved you on the palms of my hands."
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   This is a weird, interesting text to read
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   in the original language in Hebrew,
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   because even in their context,
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   it would be somewhat normal for a master,
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   for a master's name to be tattooed
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   onto a servant's arm or on their hand.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   That would be somewhat normal,
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   but it would never be the other way around.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   It would never be the name of the servant
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   tattooed on the master's hand.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   But the thing is, it doesn't say tattoo.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   The word is engraved.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   And engraved in the Hebrew is actually the word for pierced,
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   with a chisel or a spike.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   Now why in the world would someone, out of love,
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   trying to display their love for someone else,
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   allow their palms to be pierced with a chisel or a spike?
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   What a horrible image.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   And yet, years later, there would be a man named Thomas.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   You know Thomas, Doubting Thomas?
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   And Thomas is going to hear all kinds of great talk
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   about what's just happened with Jesus.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   He's alive, he's risen, he's the Messiah.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   And what does Thomas say?
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   Do you remember?
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   Thomas goes, "Nah, I'm not going to believe it
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   "until I see it with my own eyes."
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   And what does Jesus say to him?
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   Jesus comes and appears before Thomas,
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   and he goes, "Thomas, come here.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   "Look at the palms of my hands.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   "See my love that I have for you."
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   This is not just talk.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   This is action on a bloody cross for you.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   See, 2,000 years ago, the man Jesus
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   that we love to sing about and talk about
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   and raise our hands to in this place
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   that every knee will bow to,
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   he not only was in heaven, but he took on human flesh
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   and he came to this earth.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   And he lived a perfect life
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   and he said a lot of words.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   In fact, people called him a good teacher,
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   but he was so much more than that.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   What Jesus came to do is not just show us
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   the way to God or the way to life.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   He came to be the Isaiah 49, 16
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   fulfillment display of the love of God in your life.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   When he stretched out his hands on that cross
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   and allowed those Roman soldiers to pierce his hands
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   on that cross and he suffocated to death,
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   he sang in that moment,
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   "I see you in the midst of your pain,
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   "your broken relationship, your failure at work,
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   "the insecurity that you have driving down 635 every day,
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   "hating traffic, hating life."
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   He goes, "I see you.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   "And I don't just tell you that I love you.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   "I'm displaying it right now."
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   No other religion on the planet has that.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   No other religion.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   Our King didn't just say,
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   "I wanna come and have you dwell with me.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   "I'm gonna display.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   "I'm gonna come down and display my love for you."
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   And for us, when we come to Jesus,
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   he says, "I will accept you."
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   It's interesting.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   Romans chapter five, verse eight says that,
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   "But God demonstrates or shows,
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   "he demonstrates his love for us
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   "in that while we were sinners, Christ died for us."
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   And then if we come to him,
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   Jesus says in Matthew chapter 11,
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   he says, "Come to me all who labor and are heavy laden
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   "and I will give you rest."
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   This is what I've been praying for you.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   Some of you are here tonight
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   because it's time to release that burden
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   that you've been holding onto.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   Release it, surrender it fully to Jesus.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   And that's scary and that's unknown
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   and it's not gonna fix all your problems overnight,
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   but that kind of surrender
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   is what Jesus is calling us into.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   I mentioned my family
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   and how I have three kids,
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   older daughter and then two sons.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   And my son, Ty, I think we have a picture of him.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   This is Ty, he's three years old and he is my buddy, man.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   He's my junior, you know, we named him after me,
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   not just 'cause I'm vain, maybe,
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   but because man, we just, we wanted, we just believed,
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   man, we wanna name him Ty.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   And everything about his birth was great.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   Everything about the delivery was great.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   This was three years ago back in 2021
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   and he was born happy, healthy, everything was awesome.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   And the night after he was born, my wife's holding him
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   and she's looking at him and she goes,
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   "Man, he looks a little blue,
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   "like his lips are a little blue.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   "You think that's weird?"
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   And typical husband, I'm like,
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   "Ah, babies turn weird colors, I'm sure he's fine."
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   Okay, and then he got better and so the nurse came in
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   and we said, "Hey, his lips were a little blue,
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   "but other than that, he's fine."
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   And she kinda real serious was like,
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   "Hey, if that happens again, you let me know."
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   We're like, "Okay, okay."
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   So sure enough, a couple hours later, I'm holding him,
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   his lips turn blue again, his whole body starts to turn blue.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   So we call the nurse, she comes running in,
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   picks him up from me, shakes him, shakes him again,
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   and then runs out of the room without saying a word.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   We're like, "What?"
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   You know, about five minutes later,
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   she comes back in with the doctor and they sit us down.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   They're like, "Hey, you need to know,
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   "what just happened with your son is called,
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   "he had an apnea spell, which means he stopped breathing
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   "for at least 20 seconds and began to turn blue.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   "We had to use some measures to bring him back."
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   They said, "This shouldn't be happening with a term baby,
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   "and so we need to monitor him in the neonatal ICU unit,
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   "the NICU, for the next five days."
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   And we're like, "Ah, we're supposed to go home that next day,
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   "we were so excited, we had like a little party ready,
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   "and we're just like, 'What is going on?'"
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   And they said, "Oh, by the way, because it's COVID,
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   "you have to go home at night and he has to stay here."
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   And my wife's just like, "What? Are you kidding me?"
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   And so we're like, "Oh, Lord,"
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   and I'm kind of trying to fight it, you know, like,
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   "Are you sure? I didn't sign anything."
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   And we just do this whole thing, they're like,
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   "No, we have to monitor him, this could be really serious."
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   We're like, "Whatever."
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   So we begin the process of being in the NICU.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   Some of you know this world from siblings or friends, whatever.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   And we're going back and forth, day one, day two, day three.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   The end of day three, on a Tuesday afternoon,
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   my wife would just be going up there back and forth all day.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   I remember telling her, I'm like,
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   "Hey, let's go home for like an hour, you need to shower, okay?
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   "And I'm going to cut the grass, and then we'll come right back."
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   We'll come right back. She's like, "All right."
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   So we go home.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   We're not home for 15 minutes before we get a call
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   from the nurse practitioner.
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   And she says, "You need to get up here right now."
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   We're like, "What?"
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   So we get in the car, we head to the hospital,
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   and he's hooked up to even more machines.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   I think we have a picture.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   And they said, "Here's what happened."
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   They said, "Your son had another apnea spell,
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   "and this time we had to use artificial breath
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   "to bring him back.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   "He was dying, and we had to bring him back."
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   They said, "We don't know what's going on.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   "We need to give him a head ultrasound.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   "We need to give him a spinal tap,
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   "and we may need to transfer you to another hospital."
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   And I'm ticked.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   I'm like, "What? What is going on?
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   "Like, no, we're getting out of here."
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   And they look, I remember the nurse practitioner
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   looking me in the eyes and going, "Mr. Moffitt, listen to me."
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   She said, "Your son could be very sick,
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   "and you need to hear this, your son could die."
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   And then they sent us out of the room to give the spinal tap.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   I remember my wife and I just in shock
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   going down to the hospital lobby,
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   and sitting down, and then just began to weep.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   Some of you have had this moment.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   And in our tears of just frustration and confusion
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   and anger and sadness,
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   just some words that I had memorized years earlier,
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   Psalm 73 came over me.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   It said, "Home of I in heaven, but you, God,
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   "there's nothing we desire besides you.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   "Ty's heart and his flesh may fail,
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   "but God be the strength of his heart and portion forever."
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   And then the end says, "As for me, it's good to be near God."
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   And I don't even know if I believed those words,
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   I just said them.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   And that night we went home,
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   and we were just incredibly sad and frustrated, went to sleep.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   Next morning, my wife goes straight to the hospital,
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   and I was like, "I just need a minute."
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   And I remember getting in my room, shutting the door,
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   and getting down on my face before God.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   And having that moment that some of you have had
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   where I just cried out to God,
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   "God, what is going on?
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   "I'm supposed to be Ty's dad.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   "I'm supposed to be his protector, his provider.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   "I'd rather take trade places.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   "What is going on?
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   "Are you in control or not?
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   "Are you God or not?"
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   And just weeping like, "God, what's going on?"
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   And just in God's timing, I'm listening to a soundtrack
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   in the back in my room, and the song comes on.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   And the name of the song was called
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   "Sovereign Over Us" by Jeff Johnson.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   And the words just went like this.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   It says, "There is strength within the sorrow.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   "There is beauty in our tears.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   "And you meet us in our mourning
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   "with a love that casts out fear.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   "You are working in our waiting, sanctifying us,
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   "when beyond our understanding,
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   "you are teaching us to trust."
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   The chorus says this, "Your plans are still to prosper.
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   "You have not forgotten us.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   "You are with us in the fire and in the flood.
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   "You are faithful forever, perfect in love.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   "You are sovereign over us."
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   And the bridge just says this,
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   "Even what the enemy meant for evil,
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   "you turn it for our good and for your glory.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   "Even in the valley, you are faithful,
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   "and you're working for our good and for your glory."
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   And it's hard to describe it, Porch,
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   but in that moment, that song going on,
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   all my face before God, I met God.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   I had been in ministry, I'd done baptism,
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   I'd said the prayer, but that was the moment for me
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   where all that I was holding onto,
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   all the control that I had in my life,
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   that so much of my insecurity leading up
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   was built around that, just melted away,
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   and I just said, "God."
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   All right, you're either God or you're not God,
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   and I trust right now in the midst of the valley, you're God.
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   And so, Father, if Ty never gets better, I will trust you.
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   And then I remember saying this,
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   "And God, if you take away my son's life,
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   "you're still good and you're still God,
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   "and I will worship you."
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   I remember getting up, getting in my car,
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   and driving to the hospital,
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   and I hated that drive to the hospital, I hated it.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   And all of a sudden, that very drive
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   became a moment of worship.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   And I realized for maybe the first time in my life,
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   my worship cost me something.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   Sometimes we just sing the songs, "Yeah, yeah, yeah."
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   It was the first time I'm going, "You are good.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   "You are good. Right now, you're good.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   "You're on the throne. You reign.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   "You are king. You're sovereign and in control."
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   I believe that right now. I believe it.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   I remember parking my car, getting in the elevator.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   I used to hate that elevator ride up to the fourth floor.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   And all of a sudden, I just began to go,
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   "Okay, God, this is a moment of ministry.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   "It's a moment of communion with God.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   "So I love you. I love you. I trust you."
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   I would walk into that NICU room, hated that NICU room,
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   became a moment of seeing other people that were in that room
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   with worse issues than us.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   And all of a sudden, we began to ask them, "What's going on?"
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   And God infused His presence into the midst of my brokenness
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   and our valley in a way that's hard to describe.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   And the end of the story is five days passed,
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   and he never had another apnea spell.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   So they said, "Hey, look, we can't promise
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   "that this thing isn't going to happen again,
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   "but you're free to go home."
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   And we're like, "Okay," you know?
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   And we drove home, kind of fear and trembling,
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   but trusting God, and three years later,
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   he hasn't had another one. Praise God.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   Yes.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   [cheers and applause]
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   But there's a deeper healing that went on.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   You know, I praise God.
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   Every time we look at Ty, I would just,
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   "Thank you, God. Thank you."
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   And yet, the deeper thing that went on
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   was communion with God in the midst of the valley,
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   trusting that He was good, even when I didn't feel it,
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   knowing that beyond words, a display, a Savior's--
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   Jesus had it, my name and yours,
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   engraved on His hands at the cross.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   So I know some of you have walked through similar things,
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   and some of you have gone through harder.
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   Some of you, the outcome didn't turn out like this.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   God never promised us.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   He never promised us peaches and roses.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   I got lots of stories where the ending
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   didn't turn out like this,
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   and yet it's the moment of surrender
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   that God goes, "That's what I'm after in your life."
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   Some of you, that's where you're at tonight.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   I mean, come on. You're in the routine.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   You're coming to the porch. You're singing the songs.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   But you don't believe it. You don't.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   You intellectually can get there,
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   but your mind, your heart is broken.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   Your mind is wandering.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   You look at that same screen night after night,
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   pleasing yourself, going, "Why won't it stop?"
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   And I'm telling you, you need to meet with God.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   You gotta have a moment of surrender going, "I'm done."
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   God, even if nothing changes, I see it.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   You, your name, my name is engraved on your hands.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   Your love has been displayed on that bloody cross,
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   and I trust, no matter outcome, I trust you.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   I wanna end with this quote. Ray Ortlund says this,
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   "Satan doesn't fear our brilliance.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   He's more brilliant."
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   He doesn't even fear our good behavior
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   because he can twist morality into hypocrisy.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   But what Satan fears is someone shattered,
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   stripped of their dreams,
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   so devastated that all they have left is Jesus,
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   and to Jesus they turn.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   [applause]
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   And I would just say, "Orch, is that you?"
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   Some of you have had your dreams shattered,
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   and yet in the midst of the broken pieces, you go,
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   "It's him! It's all about him!
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   It's all about him! It's all about him right now."
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   You know, this side of heaven is the only time
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   in the midst of brokenness we can say,
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   "God, right now, I wanna worship you.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   I wanna worship you."
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   So we're gonna sing another song,
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   and come on, come on, some of us,
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   that declaration of surrender needs to happen right now.
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   God, I declare it. I declare it. You are good.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   Some of you need to come.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   We're gonna have a team up here
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   that some of you need to get up out of your seat
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   and go, "I gotta talk to somebody.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   I gotta tell somebody."
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   And it's bold.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   You got all of a thousand people watching you.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   Who cares? We're talking about Jesus.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   Come up here and talk to somebody,
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   and then worship.
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   Give him your worship
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   because he is worthy of it.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   So Father, we love you.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   We love you. We love you.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   Despite what we feel,
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   we know this to be true.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   You are good.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   So have your way in our lives.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   You are God.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   You reign above it all.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   You are king.
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   You are sovereign over us,
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   and we love you.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   Come, Holy Spirit.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   We long to encounter a living God
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   who displayed his love on the cross.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   In Jesus' name, amen.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   Come on. Come and pray. Let's go.
