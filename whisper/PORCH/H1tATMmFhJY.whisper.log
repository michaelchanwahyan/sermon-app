[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:24.560]   - Hi guys, my name is Harrison Ross.
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.400]   I'm the junior high director here
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.160]   at Watermark Community Church.
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.160]   Been hanging around here for about six years.
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.040]   So welcome Fort Worth, welcome Plano,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.520]   welcome friends all across the country.
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.600]   Excited to jump in.
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.480]   Something I wanna tell you about me is I'm a new dad.
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.880]   I've got, yes, yeah.
[00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.540]   So here's my family.
[00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.320]   I've got a beautiful wife named Hunter
[00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.600]   and I've got two sweet little boys, Abel's two.
[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.800]   Hugh is six months.
[00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.200]   They're amazing.
[00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.080]   But there's something crazy that's going on in my life
[00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.760]   that I need to come and confess before you.
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:00.960]   It's not church discipline,
[00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.480]   it's just something I need to get off my chest
[00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.940]   and share with you.
[00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.580]   As a new dad, I'm now experiencing some things in life
[00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.000]   that for most of my life,
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.400]   I made fun of every other parent for doing.
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.840]   So I've looked at friends I've had,
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.800]   at family who had babies,
[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.200]   and I looked at them like they were crazy
[00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.680]   for some of the things that they took too seriously.
[00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.320]   But now, having kids, my wife and I,
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.480]   she's a new mama, I'm a new dad,
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:31.480]   and we are taking crazy things way too seriously.
[00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.840]   Something we're taking seriously is bedtime.
[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.080]   It's like a religion.
[00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.620]   And when I say we're taking it too seriously,
[00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.800]   I mean she's taking it too seriously.
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.000]   And so, guys, little advice for you gentlemen out there
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.080]   who wanna get married and maybe have kids,
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.000]   listen to mama.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.160]   If mama ain't happy, ain't nobody happy.
[00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.180]   And so listen to her.
[00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.400]   My wife is an unbelievable mom.
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.980]   She does an amazing job with these two kids.
[00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.480]   But we take bedtime seriously.
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.560]   I cannot believe I'm that guy.
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.720]   I'm the guy that we have to call ahead
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:03.840]   to our family or friends,
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.000]   oh guys, yeah, we're so excited about hanging out,
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.760]   but we're gonna have to kinda leave early.
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.920]   We're gonna have to kinda jet out, you know, the kids.
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.280]   Oh man, seriously, like, you're gonna have to leave at eight?
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.100]   That's so early.
[00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.240]   Oh no, no, no, I gotta leave at like 6.30 or seven
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.080]   to get 'em down at 7.30.
[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.560]   And they're just like, you're kidding me?
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.640]   I'm that guy!
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.760]   I can't believe I'm that guy!
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.240]   No region testimony starts with,
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.600]   hi, my name's Harrison,
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.720]   and my parents just didn't take my sleep schedule
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:30.640]   serious enough.
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.500]   (audience laughing)
[00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.880]   When I was 18 months old, I missed a nap,
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.440]   and it was downhill from there.
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.280]   (audience laughing)
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.660]   It doesn't happen that way!
[00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.280]   But yet it's what my wife and I are consumed by,
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.680]   and it's not gonna change their life,
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.240]   it's changing our life when we're sleeping.
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.720]   But that's the season we're in,
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.240]   and we're taking crazy things too seriously.
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.440]   They're gonna grow up,
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.120]   and we're gonna take their magazine drive too seriously.
[00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.940]   We're gonna take the PTSA, whatever it is, too seriously.
[00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.480]   We all have things in our lives
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.600]   that in different seasons we take too seriously.
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.940]   Sports teams, football's coming up.
[00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.240]   Who's excited for football?
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.080]   (audience cheering)
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.180]   You bet you are.
[00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.120]   Maybe some of you guys are already putting together
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.760]   your fantasy football league,
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.360]   you're trying to get the draft.
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.960]   I got two friends in community who live in Dallas,
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.780]   are flying to Georgia to pick their fantasy football team.
[00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.660]   You're taking it too seriously, guys.
[00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.000]   You're leaving your family for nothing.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.440]   Fantasy football is huge in our culture.
[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.800]   Maybe it's your dating life.
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.920]   Maybe it's your hypothetical dating life.
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.400]   (audience laughing)
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.400]   Your Instagram likes, the perfect caption, CrossFit.
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.960]   Oh, I gotta make sure I post my WOD,
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.720]   and how awesome I did with the best time, blah!
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:45.880]   (audience laughing)
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.800]   You're taking it too seriously, nobody cares,
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.760]   and we all have these things
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.300]   that we take way too seriously,
[00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.980]   and we take way too seriously most of the times
[00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.940]   the things that don't matter,
[00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.620]   but there are things in life that we should take seriously.
[00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.620]   One that I wanna talk about specifically tonight.
[00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.580]   We don't take it serious enough.
[00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:14.060]   We kinda get consumed by all these other things,
[00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.100]   but the one thing that we should take seriously are faith.
[00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.760]   We believe some lies and bad advice,
[00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.460]   and don't take it serious.
[00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:25.960]   We're in this series called Bad Advice,
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.320]   and the bad advice that we're gonna tackle tonight is,
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.360]   man, don't take your faith too seriously.
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:36.220]   I mean, come on, you don't wanna be that crazy Christian.
[00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.080]   You don't wanna be that weirdo at the office,
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.560]   the guy who's always just kinda yapping about Jesus,
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.800]   and got that Greek tattoo on the bicep
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.400]   that kinda peeks out under your shirt.
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.100]   Man, don't take your faith too seriously.
[00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.500]   Lighten up, live a little.
[00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.580]   We're in our 20s and 30s, we're young adults, let's go.
[00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:00.700]   Tonight we're gonna look at a passage in Revelation
[00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.020]   where Jesus speaks directly to the church,
[00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:05.740]   and he's gonna tackle this bad advice
[00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.120]   of don't take your faith too seriously.
[00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.120]   He's gonna call us to take our faith too seriously.
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.460]   What we're gonna look at is Jesus casts out those
[00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.700]   who don't take their faith too seriously.
[00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:22.300]   Jesus calls us to seriously value
[00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.260]   where true treasure is found,
[00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.600]   and then Jesus seriously loves you.
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.260]   If you got your Bible, let's open up to Revelation 3.
[00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.400]   We're gonna be in a passage here
[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.820]   that Jesus has been speaking to different churches.
[00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.540]   There are a series of seven churches
[00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:40.240]   that he is giving a message to.
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.700]   This is the last of these seven churches.
[00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:44.860]   It's a church in Laodicea,
[00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:48.420]   and Jesus is talking through this whole passage.
[00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:50.720]   So starting in verse 14, here's what we say.
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:55.380]   And the angel of the church in Laodicea
[00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:59.380]   write the words of the amen, the faithful and true witness,
[00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.660]   the beginning of God's creation.
[00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:03.380]   I know your works.
[00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:05.260]   You're neither cold nor hot,
[00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.200]   whither you either cold or hot.
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.660]   So because you are lukewarm and neither hot nor cold,
[00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:14.700]   I will spit you out of my mouth.
[00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:15.900]   Here's the first point.
[00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:19.900]   Jesus casts out those
[00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:21.900]   who don't take their faith too seriously.
[00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:25.700]   Did you see what we just read?
[00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:27.380]   Did you just really say that?
[00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:28.740]   He's talking about hot and cold,
[00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:31.460]   and okay, maybe there's different parts of our faith
[00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:32.580]   or our life that are that way,
[00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:34.660]   but then he amps it up a little bit,
[00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:37.060]   and he says, "If you are lukewarm,
[00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:39.420]   "I'm gonna spit you out of my mouth."
[00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:42.560]   And what he's talking about here is cultural Christianity,
[00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:45.460]   and we're all guilty of it at some point.
[00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:51.300]   Cultural Christianity, he calls it lukewarm Christianity.
[00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:55.380]   A lukewarm Christian is somebody who lives their life
[00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:57.940]   in compartments, in boxes.
[00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:01.260]   This is maybe what a lukewarm Christian looks like,
[00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:05.220]   somebody who's got all of these things segmented out.
[00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:06.540]   It sounds like a good way to live,
[00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:08.820]   to think wisely about all these areas
[00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:11.220]   and make sure that you've got your ducks in a row,
[00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:15.180]   you've got your career, your friends, you wanna have fun,
[00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:18.340]   you've got your dating life, your resume, your family,
[00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:19.500]   your healthy lifestyle.
[00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:21.580]   I mean, Jesus is in there.
[00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:23.020]   He's in the top.
[00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:25.840]   He's on that top row, so he's important,
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.820]   but I don't wanna take my faith too seriously
[00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:32.260]   and let Jesus kinda get in some of my other areas of life.
[00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.900]   I mean, I don't want Jesus to mess up my fun.
[00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:36.500]   It's a little too much.
[00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:37.340]   I wanna have fun.
[00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:38.540]   [laughs]
[00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:39.900]   How do you feel with Jesus?
[00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:42.980]   And so we section it out and we make sure
[00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:46.580]   that things are perfect and then we start making excuses.
[00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:48.840]   Okay, well, career, my career, my job,
[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:50.480]   it's just taking a lot right now.
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:53.500]   We had somebody who quit at work
[00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:55.660]   and so I'm having to take on a heavier workload.
[00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:59.260]   I gotta, I'll push Jesus off a little bit.
[00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:03.060]   Maybe when I get a family, once I'm married,
[00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:05.540]   maybe once I hit my 30s, my 40s,
[00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:08.780]   someday I'll take my faith seriously
[00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:12.780]   and we live with Jesus compartmentalized
[00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:14.180]   as a part of our life.
[00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:21.320]   Jesus is calling out lukewarm cultural Christianity
[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:26.700]   and he says, hey, what you should be as a believer,
[00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:29.580]   as a Christ follower, somebody who is submitted
[00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:32.700]   and surrendered to Jesus, somebody who doesn't just have
[00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:36.340]   Jesus as a part of their life, but Jesus is your life.
[00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:38.260]   Jesus is the compartment.
[00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:42.820]   Jesus is the lens through which you look through everything.
[00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:45.700]   It's not several boxes, it's one box
[00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:48.660]   where you are identified by Jesus Christ
[00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:52.060]   and every aspect of your life is surrendered
[00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:54.620]   and submitted to that and fits inside that.
[00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:56.700]   That's what being a believer is.
[00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:02.500]   How you work, how you date, how you have fun,
[00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:05.460]   what career that you will do, your family,
[00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:08.520]   how you will steward your body, all of that.
[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:11.640]   Has been given over to Jesus because he gave himself
[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:12.480]   for you.
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:16.680]   Anything outside of that is just an excuse
[00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:17.960]   and it's lukewarm.
[00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:23.520]   We all do it, I do it.
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:29.560]   Jesus says, if you are lukewarm,
[00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:31.320]   I'm gonna spit you out of my mouth.
[00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:35.760]   He continues, he goes on.
[00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:39.160]   We see in verse 17, Jesus says,
[00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:42.940]   for you say I'm rich, I've prospered, I need nothing.
[00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:45.080]   Not realizing that you're wretched, pitiable,
[00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:48.880]   poor, blind, and naked, I counsel you to buy from me gold
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:51.120]   refined by fire so that you may be rich,
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:53.240]   white garments so that you may clothe yourself
[00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:56.120]   and the shame of your nakedness may not be seen
[00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:59.360]   and salve to anoint your eyes that you may see.
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.880]   Those whom I love I reprove and discipline
[00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:04.480]   so be zealous and repent.
[00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:07.320]   The second thing we see is that Jesus calls us
[00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:09.620]   to take seriously the treasure.
[00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:13.600]   This church in Laodicea, they're a wealthy city.
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:16.640]   Historically, we know that they have a lot of money.
[00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:19.200]   So right at the beginning, that verse 17,
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:24.000]   we see him basically just go, man guys, you are wealthy.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.520]   You got cars, you got anything you could ever ask for
[00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:28.980]   and you are poor.
[00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:32.240]   You're poor.
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.920]   Can you imagine going to a wealthy neighborhood?
[00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:38.080]   I mean, we're talking super wealthy neighborhood.
[00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:39.800]   Like mansions, you ever driven through
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:40.620]   one of these neighborhoods?
[00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:43.440]   Can you imagine if I go into one of those mansions
[00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:45.680]   and I just, I'm gawking and I'm looking around
[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:48.760]   and it's all marble and there's butlers everywhere
[00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:50.880]   and I just, I shake the hand of the guy who owns it
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:54.280]   and I said, man, I feel so sorry for you.
[00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:55.900]   You're dirt poor.
[00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:58.620]   Can you imagine the look on his face?
[00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:00.160]   This is what Jesus is saying.
[00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:07.200]   All these things you find life in, all this stuff,
[00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:09.680]   all this stuff that you try to find identity in
[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:12.680]   and value from, the things that you treasure,
[00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:13.960]   it's worthless.
[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:16.480]   It is nothing.
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:19.080]   It is of no value spiritually.
[00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:21.100]   You're poor if you're trying to find life
[00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:22.880]   and identity in that.
[00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:24.440]   So I'm a junior high pastor.
[00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:26.240]   I hang with junior high kids a lot.
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:27.480]   And hanging with junior high kids,
[00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:31.360]   you see very quickly that they are trying to find identity.
[00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:33.840]   They're quickly clinging on to whatever's new
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:35.560]   and whatever's next.
[00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:38.240]   And so you see that they're really into the shoe game.
[00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:39.340]   I mean, that's the thing right now.
[00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:42.560]   They're like, oh man, my kicks are sweeter than your kicks.
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:44.020]   Yeah, that's what's up.
[00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:46.000]   No, I got these, you can't have these.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   You're gonna grow out of them in four months.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:48.900]   Get over it.
[00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:51.800]   You might buy 'em from 'em if they're a big kid
[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:52.780]   and they hit puberty earlier.
[00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:55.640]   So the shoe game is big.
[00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:58.380]   And then it's what people think of me, what I wear,
[00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:01.600]   my athletic success, my academic success.
[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:03.900]   And it's easy to see in junior high
[00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:06.540]   and you just go, hey guys, hey, that's not gonna last.
[00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:07.700]   Doesn't matter.
[00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:11.780]   But I see that I do it in my own life.
[00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:13.860]   There are things that I thought were so valuable
[00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:16.880]   that I was so into that I was consumed by.
[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:19.220]   Pogs, anybody know pogs?
[00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:21.760]   If you don't know pogs, look it up.
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:23.100]   They're cheap right now.
[00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:25.380]   Pogs are these little paper circles.
[00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:27.620]   You'd stack 'em up and you'd get this sweet slammer
[00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:29.580]   that had like finger imprints so that you could get
[00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:33.180]   extra like leverage and boom, and you flip 'em over.
[00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:34.360]   It doesn't matter.
[00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:36.220]   I was obsessed with 'em.
[00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:37.740]   They're awesome.
[00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:39.780]   I'd go to the store, I'd save my money and be like,
[00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:42.340]   ah, special edition.
[00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:43.380]   Nerd.
[00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:45.100]   Like who cares?
[00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:48.060]   I went to a tournament for pogs.
[00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:49.780]   I brought my whole collection.
[00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:51.460]   And I was like, all right, I'll battle you.
[00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:52.660]   (imitates punching)
[00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:54.100]   You took mine, ah.
[00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:55.940]   It doesn't matter.
[00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:58.820]   Then I was really into, in junior high, a dino bike.
[00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:00.620]   Anybody have a dino bike?
[00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:01.740]   BMX bike?
[00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:02.620]   Just me.
[00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:03.900]   I thought it was awesome.
[00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:06.660]   (audience laughing)
[00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:09.680]   Ah, I used to like pray for this bike.
[00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:12.500]   Seriously, I'd go, Lord, if you love me, give me this bike.
[00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:14.500]   I'd open the door, no bike.
[00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:16.820]   Really badly affected my theology.
[00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:18.580]   I loved this dino bike.
[00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:23.380]   As I grew into high school, then I became really consumed
[00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:24.980]   about what people thought of me.
[00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:28.180]   I knew what I thought about myself.
[00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:32.380]   And so I would be the guy that would be funny
[00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:35.020]   or I would try to make them think that I didn't care
[00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:38.060]   because I didn't want them to know who I was.
[00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:40.420]   I knew everybody, but I was friends with no one.
[00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:43.620]   College, I was really into my hair.
[00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:45.420]   I just was.
[00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:47.500]   I had to flip like the, ah.
[00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:48.740]   (audience laughing)
[00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:51.140]   I had somebody recognize me in New York City
[00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:54.140]   from like an intersection over and go, that's Harrison.
[00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:55.180]   Are you serious?
[00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:56.380]   Because of the flip.
[00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:57.620]   I was into my hair.
[00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:00.420]   I was really into converting my basement
[00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:02.660]   into a recording studio.
[00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:03.620]   Why?
[00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:04.980]   It was this nasty basement.
[00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:06.980]   I spent two all-nighters trying to do it
[00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:09.100]   and it all peeled off the wall.
[00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:14.100]   I became a young adult and I got so consumed with my job
[00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:16.340]   and how I could establish myself in my career
[00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:19.460]   and how I could be a leader and I was consumed by that.
[00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:21.300]   And today, what I'm wrestling with
[00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:23.700]   is just the approval of man.
[00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:27.300]   What people think of me, where I think that I'm valued,
[00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:29.480]   where I am worth something.
[00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:31.900]   And guys, we all do it.
[00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:35.020]   It's easy to look back in junior high,
[00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:38.420]   that stupid, silly stuff, but we all have it in our life now
[00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:43.380]   that we see as the ultimate, that we want to be ultimate,
[00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:46.640]   that Shane talked about, the shiny thing that we're chasing,
[00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:51.640]   that job, that husband, that wife, that thing, that feeling,
[00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:55.220]   and we think it's gonna satisfy and it's not gonna satisfy.
[00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:58.380]   Jesus says, "I'm the treasure."
[00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:02.400]   Jesus says, "Those things are worthless.
[00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:06.700]   "If you spend your life chasing them, you will be poor."
[00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:09.140]   You're chasing gold, it's fool's gold.
[00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:11.500]   It looks like the same thing.
[00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:12.960]   It is worth nothing.
[00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:16.460]   Everything that we're trying to find identity in
[00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:20.740]   and value in, it is worthless compared to Jesus.
[00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:21.940]   He's the true treasure.
[00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:25.280]   (congregation laughing)
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:27.720]   What's really cool is we're about to see
[00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:29.920]   what Jesus thinks of us.
[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:32.940]   Not just that he is amazing and awesome,
[00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:35.180]   but what he thinks of us, and it might be different
[00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:37.480]   than what you think he thinks of you.
[00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:40.260]   The letter continues, and Jesus says,
[00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:43.140]   "Behold, I stand at the door and knock.
[00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:45.540]   "If anyone hears my voice and opens the door,
[00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:49.320]   "I will come into him and eat with him and he with me.
[00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:50.880]   "The one who conquers, I will grant him
[00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:52.220]   "to sit with me on the throne.
[00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:54.640]   "And as I also conquered and sat down
[00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:56.580]   "with my Father on his throne,
[00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:58.860]   "he who has an ear, let him hear
[00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:02.900]   "what the Spirit says to the churches."
[00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:04.700]   The final point we're gonna look at tonight
[00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:07.580]   is that Jesus seriously loves you.
[00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:10.180]   Do you believe that?
[00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:13.440]   Do I believe that?
[00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:19.340]   Sitting here tonight, that Jesus loves me?
[00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:21.260]   I could sing it as a kid.
[00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:22.560]   Jesus loves me, this I know,
[00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:24.820]   for the Bible tells me so, do I believe that?
[00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:29.960]   Jesus loves you, and he wants relationship with you.
[00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:31.740]   Not because he needs you.
[00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:35.680]   Not because he needs to be satisfied by relationship
[00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:37.100]   with as many people as he can have.
[00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:39.460]   He is the treasure, and he wants to share
[00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:41.420]   his abundance of wealth with you.
[00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:43.020]   He wants to give you the kingdom.
[00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:46.300]   He wants to give you it all because he loves you.
[00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:51.260]   He wants to be in relationship with you.
[00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:52.940]   In relationship, it takes time.
[00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:56.300]   It takes investment, and he's taking the initiative.
[00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:58.780]   He already has, and he continues to.
[00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:02.700]   That's a relationship worth investing in.
[00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:06.240]   You think of other relationships that are super important.
[00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:09.060]   Maybe a marriage, my wife would say that's important.
[00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:10.620]   Can you imagine if someone said to you,
[00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:11.960]   my community group, if they're like,
[00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:13.740]   "Hey, Harrison, yeah, man, thanks for sharing.
[00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:16.620]   "Hey, don't take your marriage too seriously.
[00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:17.640]   "Excuse me?
[00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:18.860]   "Don't take your marriage too seriously.
[00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:19.980]   "My wife's gonna come poppin' out.
[00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:23.300]   "Oh, man, you better take your marriage seriously."
[00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:24.540]   She's very loving, I promise.
[00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:28.340]   And so, that's bad advice.
[00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:31.060]   I had a friend who got engaged this last Saturday.
[00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:33.180]   Oh my goodness, such a beautiful ring.
[00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:35.220]   Oh, that finally happened.
[00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:39.100]   Some advice, don't take this engagement thing too seriously.
[00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:42.860]   I mean, you got a ring, but make sure you date around.
[00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:44.260]   Make sure it's right.
[00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:46.100]   That's bad advice.
[00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:51.340]   Relationships that really matter, we should take seriously.
[00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:52.460]   But our culture believes,
[00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:54.500]   man, don't take your faith too seriously.
[00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:57.420]   Maybe do the Jesus thing when it's convenient,
[00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:00.660]   but then don't be sold out.
[00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:01.500]   That's crazy.
[00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:05.540]   What we see in the text is Jesus is knockin'.
[00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:07.780]   He's standin' at the door.
[00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:11.660]   And he knocks because he loves you.
[00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:14.500]   We've all been there.
[00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:17.500]   You're in your apartment, in your house,
[00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:18.540]   you're hangin' with your roommates,
[00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:21.060]   you're just playin' FIFA for like eight hours.
[00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:23.300]   Or maybe you're Netflixing,
[00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:26.420]   you're playin' this game that you've made up
[00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:28.700]   and only you and your roommates know the rules.
[00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:30.460]   And you're just like throwin' things off the wall
[00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:31.860]   and you hear this knock on the door.
[00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:33.060]   (knocking)
[00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:34.300]   They have to knock a couple times.
[00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:36.100]   Someone finally gets up, you go over,
[00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:37.740]   you look at the door, you see who's there.
[00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:41.420]   Shh, hey, hey, hey, hey, pretend we're not here.
[00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:42.260]   What, what?
[00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:44.660]   Turn it off, turn it off, pretend we're not here.
[00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:45.660]   Who is it?
[00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:46.900]   I don't know.
[00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:49.100]   But they got a clipboard, it can't be good.
[00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:52.620]   So maybe it's the Time Warner guy.
[00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:57.020]   Maybe it's your landlord or the apartment manager.
[00:18:57.020 --> 00:18:59.540]   Maybe it's some kid tryin' to sell
[00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:01.620]   wrapping paper or magazines.
[00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:02.780]   The kids are the worst.
[00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:04.460]   You always get suckered.
[00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:06.660]   I'm sendin' my kids to you, all of you.
[00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:09.580]   And so whoever it is, it's Girl Scout Cookies,
[00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:11.220]   you're just like hey, pretend we're not here
[00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:13.060]   because we don't wanna mess with it.
[00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:16.500]   Guys, Jesus is knockin'.
[00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:20.340]   He just sits at the door and he's knockin'.
[00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:24.860]   Maybe if he had Girl Scout Cookies, we'd let him in.
[00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:25.860]   (congregation laughing)
[00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:27.180]   But he's just sittin' there.
[00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:29.180]   Behold, I stand at the door and I knock.
[00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:32.420]   It's Jesus.
[00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:36.540]   He's knocking because he loves you.
[00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:38.780]   He's not your landlord.
[00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:40.380]   He's not just tryin' to come and tell you
[00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:43.020]   where you've missed your rent for three months
[00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:44.820]   or all these noise complaints from neighbors
[00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:46.900]   or these things that you should be evicted for.
[00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:48.740]   He is not this guy that's just gonna come in
[00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:50.020]   and wanna punch you in the face.
[00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:54.260]   He's knocking continually because he loves you.
[00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:56.140]   He wants relationship with you.
[00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:58.380]   He cares for you and values you.
[00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:00.020]   He treasures you.
[00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:01.580]   He seriously loves you.
[00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:05.700]   Why wouldn't we take that seriously?
[00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:09.020]   (congregation laughing)
[00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:13.900]   And so, in summary, what we've seen from this passage
[00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:15.660]   is that Jesus casts out those
[00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:17.960]   who don't take their faith seriously.
[00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:24.260]   Jesus calls us to take seriously the true treasure.
[00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:26.660]   The true treasure, it's him, it's Jesus.
[00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:30.180]   And then the craziest truth,
[00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:32.780]   that Jesus seriously loves you
[00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:36.060]   and sees you as the treasure.
[00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:39.660]   Guys, he's knocking.
[00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:41.900]   (knocking)
[00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:45.980]   And maybe you're like me,
[00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:50.080]   who just kinda wrestles with stuff
[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:52.440]   and you hear that knock and you know it's Jesus
[00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:53.840]   and you just start to kinda look around
[00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:56.180]   and you're like, oh my goodness, now?
[00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:57.980]   I mean, but I got stuff everywhere.
[00:20:57.980 --> 00:20:59.340]   It's scattered, it's messy.
[00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:02.860]   Like, is he gonna come in and see all the junk in my life?
[00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:05.220]   I don't want him to come in now.
[00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:06.940]   He's gonna think I'm not a good Christian,
[00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:07.780]   I don't have it together.
[00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:08.660]   Let me clean this up.
[00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:09.940]   Hold on, let me clean this up.
[00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:10.860]   Let me get it together.
[00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:11.680]   Hold on, Jesus!
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:12.520]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:13.360]   He's just knocking.
[00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:15.500]   (knocking)
[00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:17.220]   Maybe you do think he's like a landlord.
[00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:19.500]   You think he's gonna come barging in.
[00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:20.940]   He's gonna be like, hey, hey!
[00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:26.160]   Jesus is not just gonna push his way through the door.
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:30.420]   Maybe you hear that knock and you're overcome with shame.
[00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:33.860]   Overcome with guilt.
[00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:35.380]   Overcome because you think, man,
[00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:38.820]   I'm not worthy enough for that guy to come in my life.
[00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:39.740]   That was me.
[00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:44.420]   So maybe you're out here and you're like, me?
[00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:45.660]   I became a believer.
[00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:48.620]   I trusted my life in Christ when I was eight years old.
[00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:53.060]   But I was addicted to porn for 12 years.
[00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:58.060]   And on the outside, I was this good Christian kid.
[00:21:58.060 --> 00:21:59.300]   I was the kid who knew everybody.
[00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:01.860]   I was the kid who loved life and had a ton of fun
[00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:03.580]   and I was dying inside.
[00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:06.100]   I didn't want anybody to know.
[00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:08.860]   I didn't think anybody would love me.
[00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:11.140]   I didn't love myself.
[00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:12.600]   How could Jesus love me?
[00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:20.180]   And so I just gave in to what I thought the world treasured,
[00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:23.720]   where I thought I had value and how the world saw me.
[00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:29.360]   And Jesus didn't run away.
[00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:32.060]   Jesus is still there.
[00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:33.740]   He's knocking.
[00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:38.900]   Because he loves you.
[00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:44.780]   Because he's gonna relentlessly pursue you.
[00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:46.540]   Because he's crazy about you.
[00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:47.940]   He adores you.
[00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:49.380]   He treasures you.
[00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:50.860]   He values you.
[00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:54.580]   And he wants to give away everything that he's got to you,
[00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:55.820]   his child.
[00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:01.700]   We believe the lie.
[00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:03.300]   Don't take your faith too seriously.
[00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:04.500]   I hope that you do.
[00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:10.000]   And get out of trying to just go through the motions
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.180]   of cultural Christianity,
[00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:14.680]   but as a Christian, go out and change the culture.
[00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:17.640]   'Cause it's with Jesus.
[00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:21.580]   He's knocking and he wants to come in,
[00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:23.380]   not to just tidy everything up
[00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:25.620]   so that he's not embarrassed by you,
[00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:27.340]   not to make sure that we fix your life
[00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:29.240]   so that it's Christian perfect,
[00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:32.460]   but he wants to come in and eat with you,
[00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:35.220]   fellowship with you, laugh with you,
[00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:37.700]   be with you, live life with you,
[00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:40.700]   allow your life to be consumed with him
[00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:42.380]   so that it's full of joy,
[00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:43.820]   so that it is fulfilled,
[00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:46.180]   so that others find life from you
[00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:47.900]   because his life is in you.
[00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:50.840]   That Jesus loves you.
[00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:56.740]   I pray that we will live in a way
[00:23:56.740 --> 00:23:59.820]   showing that we love him.
[00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:00.660]   Let me pray.
[00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:05.260]   Heavenly Father, thank you that you love us.
[00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:06.940]   Thank you that you've loved us so much
[00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:10.260]   that you sent your son, Jesus,
[00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:11.860]   to dwell with us,
[00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:13.780]   to come and live with us
[00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:16.620]   and set us free from sin and death
[00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:18.860]   by dying on the cross,
[00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:20.440]   raising to new life
[00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:23.980]   so that we could be reconciled to a living God,
[00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:26.020]   that we could be renewed with you,
[00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:27.400]   that we could have life in you
[00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:30.460]   instead of trying to seek the fleeting pleasures
[00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:32.740]   of this world, the stuff that is worthless,
[00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:35.260]   the stuff that we think is gonna identify us
[00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:37.540]   and find life but is worthless.
[00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:39.460]   Lord, will you give us the courage
[00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:41.820]   and boldness to trust you?
[00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:45.100]   I pray for people who are here tonight.
[00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:49.140]   They hear you knocking for the first time
[00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:51.980]   after around several times,
[00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:53.980]   and Lord, I just pray they'd open the door
[00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:55.660]   and allow you in.
[00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:58.060]   They'd open up to a friend around them
[00:24:58.060 --> 00:25:00.620]   and allow what is happening in their heart,
[00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:02.380]   the hurt, the pain,
[00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:04.180]   allow others into their life
[00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:05.840]   so that we can walk in freedom.
[00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:08.500]   Lord, help us not believe the lie,
[00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:12.060]   that we're gonna be crazy if we do it.
[00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:14.780]   Help us be crazy passionate for you
[00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:16.580]   so that our lives will be changed
[00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:20.380]   and that this world will be transformed.
[00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:21.220]   We love you.
[00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:23.020]   Thank you that you first loved us.
[00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:25.080]   It's in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:28.360]   Come in and eat with you,
[00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:29.760]   fellowship with you,
[00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:31.120]   laugh with you,
[00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:32.160]   be with you,
[00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:33.600]   live life with you.
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:36.560]   Allow your life to be consumed with him
[00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:38.240]   so that it's full of joy,
[00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:39.680]   so that it is fulfilled,
[00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:42.040]   so that others find life from you
[00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:43.800]   because his life is in you.
[00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:46.720]   That Jesus loves you.
[00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:52.640]   I pray that we will live in a way
[00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:54.840]   showing that we love him.
[00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:56.600]   Let me pray.
[00:25:56.600 --> 00:26:01.160]   Heavenly Father, thank you that you love us.
[00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:02.840]   Thank you that you've loved us so much
[00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:06.180]   that you sent your son, Jesus,
[00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:07.800]   to dwell with us,
[00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:09.720]   to come and live with us
[00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:12.520]   and set us free from sin and death
[00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:14.760]   by dying on the cross,
[00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:16.360]   raising to new life
[00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:19.900]   so that we could be reconciled to a living God,
[00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:21.960]   that we could be renewed with you,
[00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:23.320]   that we could have life in you
[00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:24.960]   instead of trying to seek
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:27.020]   the fleeting pleasures of this world,
[00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:28.640]   the stuff that is worthless,
[00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:31.160]   the stuff that we think is gonna identify us
[00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:33.440]   and find life but is worthless.
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:35.380]   Lord, will you give us the courage
[00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:37.740]   and boldness to trust you.
[00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:41.880]   I pray for people who are here tonight.
[00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:45.080]   They hear you knocking for the first time
[00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:47.920]   after around us several times.
[00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:49.880]   And Lord, I just pray they'd open the door
[00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:51.580]   and allow you in.
[00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:53.960]   They'd open up to a friend around them
[00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:56.520]   and allow what is happening in their heart,
[00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:58.320]   the hurt, the pain,
[00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:00.100]   allow others into their life
[00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:01.740]   so that we can walk in freedom.
[00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:04.400]   Lord, help us not believe the lie,
[00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:07.960]   that we're gonna be crazy if we do it.
[00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:10.700]   Help us be crazy passionate for you
[00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:12.480]   so that our lives will be changed
[00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:16.280]   and that this world will be transformed.
[00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:17.120]   We love you.
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:18.920]   Thank you that you first loved us.
[00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:20.980]   It's in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
