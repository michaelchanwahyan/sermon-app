00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,480
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:31,460
 [APPLAUSE]

3
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:36,780
 Man, that was all an illustration.

4
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,300
 Videos without audio can be a little awkward.

5
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,340
 Similar to dating can be a little awkward.

6
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:47,380
 And no, hey, gosh, you guys look so good, man.

7
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:51,060
 It has been way too long, and we are so pumped and so excited

8
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,820
 for everybody to be back.

9
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:56,180
 And if people were not thirsty before COVID,

10
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:57,980
 it is only increased from there.

11
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:59,820
 So we are covering a very appropriate--

12
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,140
 this was already on the calendar,

13
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,740
 and then we knew when we were going to come back.

14
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:05,660
 But hey, just to welcome again everybody in the room

15
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:06,540
 right here.

16
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,260
 The loft is also full.

17
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:09,900
 Everyone up in the loft, welcome.

18
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,820
 Stage two is also full, and we are now

19
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,540
 gathering out in the auditorium.

20
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:16,140
 And now, welcome, of course, everybody

21
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,500
 online in the 13 locations from around the country--

22
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,500
 Tulsa, El Paso, Houston, Northwest Arkansas,

23
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,900
 everybody that is getting back.

24
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,820
 But we are so pumped to be starting, really kicking off

25
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,780
 this series as we look at Matchmaker.

26
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:31,380
 Let me bring you guys into a little bit of my dating world,

27
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:32,940
 which is a long time ago.

28
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:34,860
 This is the first car that I ever drove

29
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:38,340
 and the first car that I ever took a girl on a date in.

30
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,500
 This is a 19--

31
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,940
 thank you very much.

32
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:45,380
 Don't want to brag, that's a 1993 Pontiac Sunbird

33
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:46,100
 convertible.

34
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:49,460
 Yes, typically only ladies and cheerleaders drive that car,

35
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:51,980
 but I got it from my sister and inherited that car.

36
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,860
 You may be thinking, that's a cool car.

37
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:57,940
 Nope, you're probably thinking of the Pontiac Firebird.

38
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:02,340
 This was their less cool, nerdy cousin, the Sunbird.

39
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,460
 I drove this car, and here's what the problem with that car

40
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:04,960
 was.

41
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,460
 The driver's side door did not open,

42
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,620
 which created significant problems when I would go ever

43
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:13,300
 on a date because it led to me going over to the passenger

44
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,500
 side and you would think being chivalrous and opening

45
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,500
 their door.

46
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,740
 But no, it was just me being like, actually, me first.

47
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:21,500
 And I'd hop over the console in order to get in the car.

48
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,500
 So it wasn't exactly like the chick mobile

49
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,500
 to be picking up ladies.

50
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,140
 But around that time that I started to drive

51
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,900
 was also when I was introduced to dating

52
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,740
 and what that even looked like.

53
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,420
 And the same is true for a lot of people.

54
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,300
 It's around that time in life where you begin to drive

55
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,260
 and for whatever reason, you just also

56
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,860
 were introduced to a lot of your friends

57
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,500
 and people just begin to form relationships.

58
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,620
 I know you do that in middle school, but everybody knows.

59
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:44,700
 It doesn't really count middle school.

60
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,820
 You just pass notes and you're like, we're talking.

61
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:49,540
 But in high school, you're beginning to date

62
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,260
 and you're also beginning to drive.

63
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,420
 What's interesting is there's a lot of similarities

64
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,580
 between dating and driving.

65
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:56,580
 Dating has been around about a hundred years,

66
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,740
 almost the exact amount of time that the automobile

67
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:00,580
 has been around.

68
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,700
 In other words, they were introduced really into culture

69
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,540
 around the same amount of time.

70
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:09,220
 And like dating, driving comes with significant risks.

71
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:14,100
 Every year, millions of people have life-altering damage

72
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,700
 done to their body from getting in car wrecks,

73
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:16,740
 millions in America.

74
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:21,240
 40,000 people a year die from getting in a car crash.

75
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,860
 And in a similar way, as it relates to dating,

76
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:26,020
 although the casualties are usually not life and death,

77
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:28,780
 they are significant when it comes to your heart,

78
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:32,060
 your future, your love life, and even your marriage.

79
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:36,460
 Some of the most painful things really

80
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,620
 that people are walking through in the room,

81
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,340
 maybe that you've ever walked through in your life

82
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:41,820
 was a relationship that took a turn for the worse

83
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,380
 that didn't end up working out.

84
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:46,740
 And unlike driving, where they don't have a similarity,

85
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:49,140
 is in order to drive, there's certain requirements

86
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:49,980
 that are a part of it.

87
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,220
 You have to be a certain number of years old.

88
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,300
 You have to be at least 16,

89
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,900
 or if you got that hardship license,

90
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,940
 you got a little bit early, there was requirements.

91
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:00,220
 In fact, usually you have to go through driver's ed.

92
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,300
 But there's no such thing with dating.

93
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,620
 There's no dater's ed, and there's no age requirements.

94
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,100
 And so people are just kind of left to plunge

95
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,780
 into the deep end on their own,

96
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,820
 and oftentimes in a way that leads

97
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,740
 to really dysfunctional relationships

98
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:14,060
 and a lot of pain and a lot of hurt.

99
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,020
 Hurt that doesn't go away.

100
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:18,540
 Hurt that they carry and end up carrying

101
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,900
 into future and future relationships.

102
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,140
 And God doesn't want you to experience that.

103
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,020
 So we're gonna cover this series,

104
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,620
 what it looks like to be single, to be engaged,

105
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,280
 to be dating, and just cover what God says

106
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,940
 as it relates to the topic of romance and love.

107
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,860
 The Bible doesn't specifically address dating.

108
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,040
 Maybe it surprised you,

109
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,700
 but just like it doesn't specifically address Instagram

110
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,620
 or avocado toast, because they weren't around

111
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,260
 2,000 years ago.

112
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:41,580
 But it has a lot to say about love,

113
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,880
 romance, marriage, and decision-making,

114
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,160
 which is essentially what dating is.

115
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,220
 And God's heart is that you would navigate this minefield,

116
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:53,380
 that you would learn how to drive the car of dating

117
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:57,020
 in a way that doesn't lead you into a love life wreck,

118
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:59,740
 but towards a marriage that that's His will for you,

119
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:02,940
 is the type of marriage that you wanna have.

120
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:05,300
 Next to who you're gonna worship as your God,

121
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,540
 there is no more important,

122
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,020
 listen to me very closely on this,

123
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,500
 there is no bigger decision that you're gonna make

124
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,120
 than who you're gonna marry.

125
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,420
 More than where you're gonna work,

126
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,480
 more than where you're gonna live,

127
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,620
 your life is gonna be altered by who you decide to marry.

128
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:18,980
 It is a huge deal.

129
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:21,260
 And we live in a country where 50% of people

130
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,540
 who end up standing in front of one another

131
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,260
 and pledging in a tux and in white dress,

132
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,280
 and they're like, "I love you forever,"

133
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,980
 ride or die, months or years later,

134
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,800
 end up signing papers where they say,

135
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,960
 "I never want you in my life," and divorce.

136
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,040
 God doesn't want that in your story,

137
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,620
 He doesn't want any more heartbreak in your story,

138
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,780
 and my guess is you don't either.

139
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:41,180
 So we're gonna launch into this conversation tonight

140
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,300
 for the next handful of weeks

141
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,820
 about what it looks like to navigate

142
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,900
 these waters really well.

143
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,220
 The other thing that has spiked in COVID,

144
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:51,580
 in addition to Purell and Clorox, is online dating.

145
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:54,900
 There's been a 600% increase in certain dating apps,

146
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:59,900
 whether that's Hinge or Bumble or OkCupid or Tinder,

147
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,820
 or Farmers Only, JD, you know what I'm talking about.

148
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:07,820
 And whatever it is, there's been a dramatic upgrace.

149
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,460
 And so part of the matchmaker thing,

150
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:12,340
 that bumper you couldn't actually hear the audio for,

151
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:13,500
 is playing off of that idea.

152
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,120
 We don't have a porch dating app,

153
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,460
 but this is our like, you know,

154
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,540
 playing off of that idea of matchmaker

155
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,740
 and how to make sure that you end up with a match

156
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:23,700
 that is in line with what your maker would say.

157
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,020
 And so throughout the series,

158
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,340
 we're gonna integrate some of the common language

159
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,340
 as it relates to even a dating app, if you will.

160
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:32,700
 Tonight, I wanna talk about your dating profile.

161
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,480
 And by that, I don't mean what's currently listed

162
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,500
 on your Bumble account,

163
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:39,060
 I mean by dating profile, your single life, who you are.

164
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,640
 Not the description you have on your Facebook,

165
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,120
 but a description of who you are in reality.

166
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,640
 Who God calls you to be in this season.

167
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,280
 And how to make sure that you use this season

168
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,800
 or you set up your dating profile

169
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,180
 to lead you in the best chance scenario

170
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,360
 of ending up with the type of person

171
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,200
 that you wanna end up with.

172
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,200
 So tonight, if you take notes,

173
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,760
 we're talking about your dating profile,

174
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,680
 we're learning scriptural principles to inform

175
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,280
 what it looks like to set up your dating profile.

176
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,240
 And by that, again, I mean your single life.

177
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,380
 So we're gonna launch in what your dating profile says

178
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:10,520
 or what it is, what is at stake,

179
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,760
 depending on what is in your dating profile.

180
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:16,400
 And for some of us, or many of us, maybe all of us,

181
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,000
 what you need to and how to change

182
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,820
 what's in your dating profile.

183
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,520
 So we're gonna just walk through,

184
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,640
 again, when I say dating profile,

185
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,800
 I mean focusing on you.

186
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,020
 This is huge.

187
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,680
 Like before you move on to any other step,

188
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,800
 even if you're dating someone right now,

189
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,120
 you need to be asking the question,

190
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,720
 what is in my dating profile?

191
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,560
 Like what is my life, what marks my life,

192
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,880
 what habits does no one know about?

193
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,320
 Maybe habits people do know about,

194
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,660
 but what type of character am I building?

195
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:40,240
 What is your dating profile?

196
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,800
 Before you move on to any other step,

197
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,840
 addressing what is in your profile,

198
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,120
 what marks your life, what is a part of it.

199
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,680
 Before you focus on who to date,

200
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,800
 focus on the you that will date them,

201
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,840
 which is really difficult.

202
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,800
 And let me just be honest, inside the room,

203
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,320
 this seems like the least fun thing.

204
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,920
 And I know that what comes most natural

205
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,400
 is not evaluating like what does mark my life

206
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,660
 and what are the habits that I really need

207
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:02,920
 to address right now?

208
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:06,920
 What comes a lot more natural is who is she?

209
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:10,760
 Some of you, since you walked in the room,

210
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,520
 since I began talking, you have not been listening

211
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,120
 to what I've been saying because you have been thinking,

212
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,320
 I wonder who that is.

213
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,640
 Is he friends with Kevin?

214
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,400
 Oh my gosh, I wonder if we should all like get together

215
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,140
 and how could I create a hypothetical situation

216
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:25,000
 or forced environment for us to have friends

217
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,840
 that go together like torches afterwards.

218
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,160
 And really, I don't really care about the friends,

219
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,640
 but I can't get around him, that would be awkward.

220
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,020
 So maybe, and you've been thinking about that person,

221
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,040
 you've been checking out their shoes,

222
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,400
 he seems like he's responsible,

223
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,300
 that has some fashion sense to him.

224
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:40,400
 Or she seems like, you know, she loves Jesus,

225
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,400
 her hands were raised during worship, that was cool.

226
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:47,520
 'Cause it's so natural and easy to drift towards, huh, them.

227
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:52,320
 Before you go there, tonight, I wanna focus

228
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,040
 and call you to focus on not on who to date,

229
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,700
 but on the you that will date

230
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,460
 and addressing your dating profile.

231
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:02,920
 So the first idea, what is in your dating profile?

232
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,720
 Not what do you want people to know,

233
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,980
 not what would you list on Bumble,

234
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:10,360
 but what, if somebody saw everything about your life,

235
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:13,720
 what would God list out inside of your dating profile?

236
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,020
 That dating profile, you're gonna bring into marriage.

237
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:20,320
 In other words, when you get married someday,

238
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,200
 what marks your life, the profile of your life,

239
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,560
 and the profile of her life or his life,

240
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,360
 are gonna be combined into one profile.

241
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,600
 What are you gonna be bringing in?

242
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,120
 Jesus said this idea of combining lives

243
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,440
 and combining profiles in Matthew chapter 19,

244
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,740
 verse five and six, he said this,

245
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:39,640
 this is what marriage is, this is Jesus's words.

246
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,360
 Marriage is when a man leaves his father and mother

247
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,080
 and is united to his wife, and the two become one flesh.

248
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,720
 You're gonna bring everything that's in your profile

249
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,880
 into your future marriage.

250
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,520
 What is in your dating profile?

251
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,920
 So we put together some of the profiles

252
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,480
 that typically kind of mark what people end up

253
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,820
 listing out there when they manicure and manage

254
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,200
 on a dating app profile, you know,

255
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,400
 the perception that they want someone

256
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,540
 to think of them about.

257
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:02,880
 And here was some of the ones that we put up.

258
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,880
 These are just fake people.

259
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,040
 Actually, Danny's in the room,

260
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,860
 he's on row four right here, not true.

261
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:09,560
 Danny, here's what he would have just hypothetically

262
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,320
 went to Tamu, whoop.

263
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,000
 Likes going out with the boys,

264
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,040
 saving private Ryan is the only movie,

265
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,960
 only thing that makes me cry.

266
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:21,040
 Let's go two-stepping sometime, got to.

267
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,880
 Favorites, of course, travel reading coffee,

268
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,800
 looking for someone who loves the office

269
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,060
 and is a Christian, and he once climbed Mount Kilimanjaro.

270
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:32,840
 There's one example of a dating profile, here's Allison.

271
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,880
 Allison works at the Richards Group,

272
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,520
 that's a company here in Dallas, loves to travel,

273
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,200
 see new things, just a small town girl

274
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,960
 living in a lonely world, got to.

275
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,680
 Ah, love that, got some wit, got to.

276
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:46,540
 My family means everything to me.

277
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,760
 Here for a good time.

278
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:53,000
 Her favorites, baking, SoulCycle, and Jesus.

279
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,720
 Exactly everything she thinks men are looking for.

280
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,440
 Looking for someone down-to-earth, funny, trustworthy,

281
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,080
 and fun fact about me, I have a dog,

282
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:03,680
 I'm a dog mom to my corgi named Lucy.

283
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,760
 All right, next one, Michael.

284
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,120
 Ah, look at that smile, it's a great pic.

285
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,220
 Played soccer in college, I love playing guitar,

286
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,360
 I have my own business, holla.

287
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,880
 I enjoy spending time with my family and friends.

288
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,640
 My favorites would be family, fitness, and faith,

289
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,320
 and I am looking for an Enneagram nine

290
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,620
 with an adventurous side.

291
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:27,540
 Very specific, Michael, you're really limiting your options.

292
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:30,160
 I once backpacked through Europe in the summer,

293
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,960
 and I think our final one, oh, Kate, of course.

294
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,160
 Man, we have a great photographer

295
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,340
 who took these people's picture.

296
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,920
 Love to laugh, and I'm always happy.

297
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,000
 I'm a professional at watching Netflix.

298
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,480
 I am the best me when I am outside.

299
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,920
 Communication, is that spelled right?

300
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,600
 Kate, that is not spelled right.

301
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,280
 Communication is key.

302
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:55,040
 (audience laughing)

303
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,880
 And she watched less Netflix,

304
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,040
 and worked a little harder on her profile.

305
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,320
 My favorite things are lattes, guac, and margs.

306
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,780
 My Bible, I'm looking for someone who's strong

307
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:07,620
 and dependable.

308
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:10,140
 Fun fact about me, I'm always down for a 5K

309
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,780
 with a good cause.

310
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:17,340
 Now, what would these profiles say

311
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:21,020
 if they were entirely honest?

312
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:22,100
 Like, in other words, what are the things that,

313
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,740
 you know, likely, just like in your profile,

314
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,460
 if you were making one, you're not gonna list online,

315
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:29,900
 but they are listed in your life.

316
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,780
 Here would be the first one.

317
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,100
 Danny.

318
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,780
 Uh, I didn't actually go to TAMU.

319
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:36,460
 (audience laughing)

320
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:37,380
 I went to Blinn.

321
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:41,060
 That's all right, Danny.

322
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:44,760
 I get blackout drunk every weekend.

323
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,500
 I am emotionally unavailable.

324
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:51,060
 I do things girls like just so they will hook up with me.

325
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,580
 My favorites, video games for three hours a day,

326
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:56,340
 and dressing girls around me in my mind.

327
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,700
 Looking for someone who's blonde

328
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,800
 and has big boobs to have sex with.

329
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,840
 Fun fact about me, I'm addicted to porn.

330
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,260
 Now, those are things that he would never mention

331
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,500
 or never bring out of the light,

332
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,420
 but he's bringing them into a relationship.

333
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:10,660
 Allison.

334
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:13,180
 I flirt with my boss to get ahead.

335
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,660
 I get guys to pay for my vacations.

336
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,940
 I haven't spoken to my parents in over a year.

337
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:20,700
 I laugh about getting arrested that one time.

338
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,180
 My favorites include letting jealousy

339
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,940
 control my relationships,

340
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,300
 looking for someone to project my past baggage

341
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,280
 from men onto,

342
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:30,820
 and fun fact about me, I have an eating disorder.

343
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,740
 And then Michael.

344
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:37,060
 I keep Xanax around in case of emergency situations.

345
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,800
 I use my musical talents to impress women.

346
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,620
 I've got 20K in credit card debt.

347
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,500
 I've punched multiple holes in my wall.

348
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:47,060
 My favorites include drunk Snapchatting with my ex.

349
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,460
 I'm looking for someone without a backbone

350
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,900
 whose life I can control.

351
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:53,900
 Fun fact about me, I have an anger problem,

352
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,440
 and I've cheated on my past two girlfriends.

353
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,820
 And then of course, Kate.

354
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:04,980
 If Kate was entirely honest,

355
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,660
 her profile would include,

356
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,600
 anxiety controls my relationship.

357
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,480
 I don't really have much ambition.

358
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:15,100
 I find myself feeling too depressed to get out of bed.

359
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:18,460
 If you try to leave me, I will find you.

360
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:22,500
 My favorites include drinking a bottle of wine every night

361
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,420
 because I don't like my life,

362
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:25,780
 and I'm looking for someone,

363
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:30,660
 if I was honest, to fill a hole my absent dad left,

364
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,420
 and make me feel good about myself.

365
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:35,860
 Fun fact about me, I'm emotionally unstable,

366
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:38,720
 and will make you feel crazy, 'cause I'm crazy.

367
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:43,060
 Now no one would ever include those,

368
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:50,100
 but those are the type of things that mark people,

369
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,580
 many of us all over the room.

370
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,340
 And the profile you list online

371
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,560
 may not come with you into the future,

372
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:00,820
 but the profile that is actually your life will.

373
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:06,300
 And right now, what you're carrying around,

374
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,620
 is not just gonna determine the person

375
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:09,460
 you're gonna end up with,

376
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,060
 as we'll talk about here in a second.

377
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:14,860
 It is shaping the future marriage that you're gonna have.

378
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:20,180
 And you get to decide, what is gonna mark my life?

379
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:22,580
 What is gonna be the profile that I carry into marriage?

380
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:24,740
 What's gonna be the things that I bring in,

381
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:25,900
 and bring forward?

382
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:30,140
 'Cause someday, if you end up married together,

383
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:32,700
 you're gonna combine your baggage, and her baggage,

384
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,700
 your profile, and her profile.

385
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:38,460
 And so many people are good at falling in love.

386
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:41,100
 It is very easy to fall in love with people around you.

387
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,560
 There are beautiful girls in here,

388
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,020
 there are handsome guys in here,

389
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:46,260
 you could fall in love tonight.

390
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:49,300
 Staying in love is much more difficult.

391
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:55,360
 And one of the reasons that people don't stay in love,

392
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,500
 is they never address their profile,

393
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,300
 long before they ever met Mr. Right, or Mrs. Right.

394
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:04,100
 When I got married to my wife,

395
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:04,940
 we went on a honeymoon,

396
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,660
 which is like our first real vacation together.

397
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,240
 Just two of us were so pumped.

398
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,980
 We're flying out of the country,

399
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:12,740
 and going to this Mexico all-inclusive resort,

400
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:13,580
 just so stoked.

401
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,540
 We go to the airport,

402
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:15,460
 and this is like the first time

403
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:17,340
 I'd ever traveled with her before.

404
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:18,500
 And I began to realize,

405
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,020
 women are very different in terms of packing.

406
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,460
 Like, when guys think of packing,

407
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:23,300
 it's like, all right,

408
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,120
 we're gonna do a backpack,

409
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:24,960
 and we're just gonna go right through,

410
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,900
 and no checking bags.

411
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,180
 When women, and particularly on the honeymoon,

412
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:29,020
 think of it, I mean,

413
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:31,840
 she's bringing like cargo I've never even seen before.

414
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,680
 She's got the blow dryer,

415
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,520
 she's got the hair curler,

416
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,340
 she's got hair things,

417
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,260
 I don't even know what they are.

418
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:37,580
 She's got all kinds of like a tackle box of makeup,

419
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,140
 and 17 different pairs of shoes,

420
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:42,540
 and it's just, what's gonna happen?

421
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,180
 And as we go up to check in our bags,

422
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:45,660
 and begin to go through the process

423
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:46,580
 of going through security,

424
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,720
 and getting to the airport,

425
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,940
 I realized that my bag and her bag

426
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:50,820
 were very, very different.

427
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,260
 And we put her bag on the scale,

428
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:55,140
 and it was 15 pounds over the weight limit for her bag.

429
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:55,980
 We put mine on,

430
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,140
 and it was like seven pounds.

431
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,340
 So of course, it was like,

432
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,180
 take that off,

433
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:00,020
 we're putting all of our,

434
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,780
 lots of your stuff into my bag,

435
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:04,380
 so that we can escape paying the extra fees on there.

436
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,980
 Really in marriage,

437
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,240
 that's what happens.

438
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,580
 Not just that you share luggage

439
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:12,300
 when you're going to a destination,

440
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,660
 you're gonna share the baggage

441
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:15,100
 of the person that you marry,

442
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,600
 and they're gonna share yours.

443
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,000
 What is that baggage?

444
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,520
 Maybe tonight, the only step you need to take

445
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,860
 is just being honest with yourself.

446
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:31,240
 Here's the stuff that I'm carrying in my profile.

447
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:35,000
 I can't go a week without turning to weed,

448
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,200
 'cause my anxiety's through the roof.

449
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,560
 I don't like myself,

450
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,800
 because I was a cheerleader,

451
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,240
 and I got injured in college,

452
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,920
 and I've defined myself by that moment ever since.

453
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,860
 I don't like the way that I look.

454
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:51,680
 I was sexually abused.

455
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:56,260
 What's in your profile?

456
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,460
 Because what is at stake

457
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:01,700
 is the most significant relationship

458
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,100
 other than the one with God you will ever have,

459
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,700
 and your ability to maintain it.

460
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,600
 What do I mean?

461
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,540
 What's at stake,

462
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,060
 or why your profile matters,

463
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:17,000
 is that whatever's in your profile,

464
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:17,840
 your life,

465
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,260
 it's not going away when you get married.

466
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,980
 Like, there's this weird fantasy idea that like,

467
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,180
 oh yeah, then when you get married,

468
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,140
 then you become an adult,

469
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,500
 and you stop doing that.

470
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,820
 That doesn't happen.

471
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,340
 And I've stood by too many people

472
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,300
 who ended up getting married,

473
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,460
 ended up years, or weeks, or months,

474
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:36,780
 getting divorced and walking away,

475
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:37,900
 and it was because they never dealt

476
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,220
 with the issues inside of their life,

477
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:42,620
 the problems they thought would just go away.

478
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:43,980
 They never went away, they got worse.

479
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,900
 In marriage, they don't disappear,

480
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,440
 they get exposed,

481
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,600
 or if anything, they get even worse.

482
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,580
 It doesn't fix your problems.

483
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:53,740
 Paul, in the Bible, says it adds to your problems.

484
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:58,200
 So waiting till marriage to deal with them

485
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,780
 is only gonna be a time when the problems get even worse.

486
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,980
 He says this in 1 Corinthians chapter seven,

487
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:05,800
 verse 31.

488
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:09,920
 "I want you to be free from anxieties."

489
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,080
 He's talking about singleness and marriage.

490
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,440
 He says, "The unmarried man is anxious

491
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,080
 "about the things of the Lord and how to please Him.

492
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:18,360
 "The married man is anxious about worldly things,

493
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,460
 "how to please his wife.

494
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,460
 "His interests are divided."

495
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:25,100
 In other words, particularly the guys,

496
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,020
 he's about to address the girls,

497
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:28,740
 but guys, when you get married, life changes radically.

498
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,660
 Today, if you wanted to, I bet you could go home,

499
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,900
 you could turn on the TV, you could watch sports,

500
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,900
 you could watch the Mavs, you could go on a jog,

501
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:35,740
 you could do whatever you want.

502
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:36,980
 Someday, you're gonna end up married,

503
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,820
 and you're gonna end up spending time and money

504
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,340
 on things you never would have anticipated

505
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,280
 spending time and money on.

506
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,560
 You're gonna get home from a long day of work,

507
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,780
 you're not turning on the TV,

508
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,480
 you're not just vegging out or going on a run,

509
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,640
 you're gonna sit there and you're gonna talk

510
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,480
 about how your day was.

511
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,920
 And you're gonna have to sit there and process

512
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,440
 and talk through and give details

513
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,500
 about everything that's going on,

514
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,720
 and she's gonna want to know

515
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,980
 all the different aspects of her life,

516
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:54,940
 and then she's gonna wanna flip it

517
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,260
 and want you to talk and speak

518
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,620
 into all the aspects of her life.

519
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,060
 She's gonna wanna know that you're listening

520
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,920
 and paying attention and you're verbally nodding along

521
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,740
 and that you're there not to try to fix her problems

522
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,900
 but just to hear and listen and empathize with.

523
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,260
 And your life's gonna change.

524
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:08,040
 And you're gonna spend money on things that, man,

525
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,020
 right now, you're like, "Dude, I can go spend money

526
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:12,180
 "on whatever I want, I may switch cars when I want,

527
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:16,500
 "I may move apartments, I got a lot of disposable income,

528
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,820
 "I do whatever I want with."

529
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,900
 Nope, not when you marry someday,

530
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,340
 you're gonna end up spending money on things

531
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:24,860
 that I have no idea why we have so many pillows in my house.

532
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:27,520
 (audience laughing)

533
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,460
 Duvets, duvets.

534
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:33,020
 I didn't even know what a duvet was before we got married.

535
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,660
 And now we have like three of them.

536
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,460
 You're gonna spend money and have to spend,

537
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:37,500
 if things are gonna break apart,

538
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,340
 you're gonna have a mortgage,

539
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,740
 it's just life begins to change.

540
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,820
 And Paul says, "Life doesn't get easier

541
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:45,600
 "and marriage is an amazing gift."

542
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,780
 And as someone married to one of the most low maintenance

543
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,500
 people I know of on the planet,

544
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,900
 I just have seen that marriage, it changes your life.

545
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,700
 So Paul, his point is not marriage is bad

546
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,780
 and singleness is good or singleness is bad and marriage,

547
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:59,780
 his point is, hey, marriage will not fix your problems.

548
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,140
 He says the same thing to the ladies.

549
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:03,180
 He says, "The unmarried woman is anxious

550
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:04,520
 "about things of the Lord,

551
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,720
 "but the married woman is anxious about worldly things,

552
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,500
 "how to please her husband."

553
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:15,680
 Ladies, you're gonna get married someday, likely.

554
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,740
 Statistically speaking, 90% of the people in the room

555
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,500
 will get married by age of 50 and you're gonna get married

556
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,580
 and here's what you're gonna understand

557
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,820
 or be exposed to about men.

558
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:23,960
 They're not very clean.

559
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:27,180
 Some of them are so not clean,

560
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:29,320
 it's like they're reaching the danger zone

561
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,660
 in terms of their lifestyle.

562
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:33,660
 And they're gonna end up wanting to do things

563
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:36,540
 or you're gonna find yourself going,

564
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:38,040
 man, I do not want to do that again.

565
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,320
 This is not a lingerie night.

566
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:42,100
 Again, it's me sitting on the couch wearing my comfy pants

567
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,520
 and I just want you to sit here and listen and talk with me.

568
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,200
 There's gonna be challenges and things that are brought

569
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,860
 about through marriage and Paul's point is marriage

570
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,640
 does not make your problems go away.

571
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:55,460
 If anything, it adds to the problems that are there.

572
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:59,300
 And then when you add kids into the mix,

573
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:03,580
 your discretionary time goes out the window.

574
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,240
 This is such a unique season and stage in your life

575
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,200
 and marriage is amazing.

576
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,600
 Kids are amazing.

577
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,920
 Wouldn't change it for anything in the world.

578
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,240
 My point is whatever is in your profile,

579
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,580
 it's not gonna go away, it's not gonna get better

580
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:18,700
 just because you get married.

581
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,240
 If anything, it's gonna get worse

582
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,800
 and it's gonna end up spilling out

583
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,320
 and end up impacting the relationships that you have.

584
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,720
 It's not just similar to this.

585
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,760
 This is a tuba chico.

586
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:30,740
 It's a beverage in case you're not familiar with it.

587
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:34,720
 Inside of this, like marriage,

588
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,460
 if you shake it up, which is what marriage does,

589
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:39,240
 it's really what stress does to our life.

590
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,720
 If you shake it up, there's a greater likelihood

591
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,520
 that eventually something's gonna spill out.

592
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,340
 And the problem isn't that, you know,

593
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:48,560
 what is shaking it up 'cause life is full of stress

594
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,880
 and anxiety and challenges and problems and hardship

595
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,160
 and all of it you're gonna face.

596
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:56,140
 But when that happens, what is inside is gonna come out.

597
00:22:56,140 --> 00:23:02,500
 That was a lot messier than I thought.

598
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,160
 And the problem in marriage, and I promise you,

599
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,660
 like it's just life.

600
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:11,200
 You're gonna walk through miscarriages.

601
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,160
 You're gonna have a parent that dies of cancer.

602
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,860
 One of you is gonna lose your job.

603
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:19,500
 And all of that shaking and all of that stress

604
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,700
 is gonna bring to the surface

605
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:25,120
 and what's inside is going to spill out.

606
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,480
 I just want you to be honest with yourself.

607
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,440
 What is inside?

608
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,100
 The idea of someday, and I know you don't believe me,

609
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,200
 that's the most frustrating thing.

610
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,920
 I haven't done this in the last 11 years.

611
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,240
 It's people like, no, once I get married, I will grow up.

612
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,080
 No, you won't.

613
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,320
 You will grow up when you decide to grow up.

614
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:46,060
 The only thing getting married will do

615
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:47,560
 is change your last name if you're a girl.

616
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,360
 If you're a guy, won't even do that.

617
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:53,440
 What are you bringing into marriage?

618
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,520
 Because what is at stake is the most important relationship

619
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,280
 other than the one with Christ that you will ever have.

620
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:04,180
 So now, how to change your dating profile, the third idea.

621
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,740
 So what's in there, what's at stake,

622
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,620
 and then how to change your dating profile

623
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:08,660
 or taking the best next step.

624
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:11,340
 As I said, 90% of you will get married by 50.

625
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:14,660
 Statistically, 75% of young adults will get married by 35.

626
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:15,700
 80% by 40.

627
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,620
 So this time in your life,

628
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:19,700
 you have got like a decade for a lot of you,

629
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,300
 or give or take a little bit around a decade,

630
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,740
 where likely you're gonna make the decision

631
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:26,140
 of the most important relationship you're gonna have

632
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:27,460
 in terms of an earthly one.

633
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,880
 Before you get there, addressing your profile.

634
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,600
 So how do you address your profile?

635
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,840
 Paul says in 1 Corinthians 7, that same chapter,

636
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,680
 that singleness, despite the fact that often

637
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,640
 we don't feel like it, is a gift.

638
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,620
 And here's why I think we don't feel like it is a gift.

639
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:43,240
 Because we don't see it as something

640
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,420
 that God gave us for a season.

641
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:48,680
 It's a unique time period for most people's lives.

642
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,760
 In other words, for 90% of people in the world,

643
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,960
 or for 90% of Americans who end up getting married,

644
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,920
 singleness is a season.

645
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:59,260
 It's not some perpetual trap that they're caught in.

646
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,100
 It's a season.

647
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:02,320
 And Paul says in 1 Corinthians 7,

648
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,240
 it's a season that is a gift for two reasons.

649
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,440
 He says it in verse 35.

650
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,540
 I say this for your own benefit,

651
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:11,240
 not to put a restraint on you,

652
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,220
 talking about what singleness is for.

653
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:18,100
 But singleness is to promote what is appropriate

654
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:21,680
 and secure, undistracted devotion to the Lord.

655
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,440
 Paul says, hey, here's what singleness is for.

656
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,160
 This is a season unique in your life

657
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,460
 that God gives every single person

658
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,160
 that you can take advantage of it.

659
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:31,020
 By using it to promote what is appropriate,

660
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,020
 he lists two things.

661
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:36,300
 And secure, undistracted devotion to the Lord.

662
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,540
 What is promote what is appropriate?

663
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:41,060
 That means deal with your character, with issues.

664
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,420
 Begin to live in community.

665
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:48,660
 And confess that a pornography addiction marks your life

666
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:51,300
 and begin to regularly bring that out into the light.

667
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:54,140
 Regularly call and confess that to other people around you.

668
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,300
 You live in a world, men,

669
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:58,060
 where there are borderline problems with your life.

670
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:58,960
 There are borderline naked women

671
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,400
 on every channel that you can flip through.

672
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,880
 And I'm talking about Victoria's Secret model commercials

673
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,720
 that come on there.

674
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,540
 It's not crazy.

675
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:05,440
 Most of us, like me,

676
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,360
 were introduced to pornography at such a young age.

677
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:12,120
 You think that it's any shock or surprise

678
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,360
 why that marks your life?

679
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:17,920
 But it doesn't have to.

680
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,080
 And you can make a decision today.

681
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,280
 I'm not gonna have this in my profile

682
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,160
 for the rest of the rest.

683
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,360
 I'm not gonna bring this into my marriage

684
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,200
 where all of a sudden,

685
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,560
 the type of sex that I wanna have in marriage someday

686
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,600
 and the sexual fantasies that I want my wife to live out

687
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,900
 are defined by the pornography

688
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,740
 that I've consumed and am consuming.

689
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:33,920
 'Cause I'm gonna choose to deal with that.

690
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,760
 You make the decision, man,

691
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:38,260
 I'm gonna choose to deal with that problem with Xanax.

692
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:41,260
 I'm gonna choose to deal with that eating disorder

693
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:43,180
 that I have because I hate myself.

694
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,020
 Everyone talks about, you know,

695
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,140
 you're so pretty and I like all this,

696
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,260
 but I hate myself.

697
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,420
 I hate myself.

698
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:50,660
 And I'm gonna address not just the eating disorder,

699
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:52,180
 I'm gonna address the roots that are underneath it

700
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:54,420
 and what's inside of it and what's behind it.

701
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:58,720
 In doing so, promoting what is good behavior.

702
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,800
 That's what Paul's words is.

703
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,880
 Hey, this is what you should be doing.

704
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,840
 This is what you should be doing with your singleness.

705
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,160
 Dealing with addictions, dealing with hurts.

706
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,440
 Some of you were really, really wounded by a father,

707
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,320
 by a family member.

708
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:12,280
 You're still really hurt from an ex you had in high school

709
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:15,120
 and you never forgave them.

710
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,280
 You never forgave somebody who did like horrible,

711
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,600
 painful things to you.

712
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:23,600
 Like was absent from your life for years and years and years

713
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,760
 and here's what I know.

714
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,960
 Holding onto that is not just gonna hurt you,

715
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,560
 it's gonna hurt your future marriage

716
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,160
 'cause you're gonna project those hurts.

717
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,200
 A person I've seen it so many times

718
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,360
 who is not able to forgive people from the past

719
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:41,360
 will not be able to forgive a spouse in their present

720
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,960
 and they're gonna hold onto bitterness

721
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:43,840
 and they're gonna claim it's like,

722
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,140
 no, I just have trust issues,

723
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:48,120
 but really it's because they've never forgiven people

724
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:48,960
 who've hurt them.

725
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,160
 And then they get married

726
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,080
 and they've trained their whole life

727
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:55,080
 to hold onto bitterness and hold onto hurts.

728
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,680
 Are you gonna make the decision?

729
00:27:56,680 --> 00:28:00,480
 I'm gonna work through that and recover from that.

730
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:05,320
 Somebody sexually abused or raped me

731
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:09,720
 and you have the decision,

732
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,840
 are you to carry that for the rest of your life?

733
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,320
 And that wasn't your fault and it was wrong

734
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:18,340
 and they're gonna give an account to God.

735
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:25,720
 But you have to be honest and give an account to yourself.

736
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:28,460
 How long are you gonna let that define your life?

737
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:33,440
 How long are you gonna carry that in your profile?

738
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,480
 Are you gonna work through the process

739
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,700
 of forgiving, of healing?

740
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:41,520
 This is why we hit on living in community

741
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,840
 to promote what is good behavior

742
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,440
 'cause all of us in isolation and on our own,

743
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,280
 we drift as Proverbs 18, one says

744
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,520
 and all throughout the Proverbs it says,

745
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,000
 we just drift towards self-destructive tendencies

746
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,500
 that I need people in my life

747
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:55,720
 who can call out blind spots that I have,

748
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,760
 who could hold me accountable

749
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,800
 and come around and pray for me.

750
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,600
 Do you have a small group of guys, a small group of girls?

751
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,160
 If you've been walking through COVID in isolation,

752
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:06,840
 I know you've got stuff you gotta heal from.

753
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,800
 And I know you're carrying things

754
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,840
 that you're not strong enough to carry

755
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,160
 like depression and anxiety

756
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,200
 and the things that we've been talking about

757
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,360
 for the last six weeks.

758
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,440
 It's been said idiosyncrasies grow

759
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,440
 in the garden of isolation.

760
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,920
 In other words, like if you've ever met somebody

761
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,760
 and you're like, man, you're just a little bit off,

762
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,440
 you're a little quirky.

763
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,460
 Typically it's because they don't have anyone in their life

764
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,160
 who will tell them the truth,

765
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:35,520
 who will say, here's what I see, here's what marks your life.

766
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:39,020
 Do you know that you're like this?

767
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:41,860
 Do you have community?

768
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:44,120
 If not, it will be really difficult.

769
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:47,320
 It will be impossible to promote and use this season

770
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,520
 to build the character that will allow you

771
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,280
 to build a marriage that will last.

772
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:54,840
 Second thing he says is secure,

773
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,960
 undistracted devotion to the Lord.

774
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,800
 Before you get a relationship with a guy or girl,

775
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,800
 you've got to get your relationship with God right.

776
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,040
 This is the time to go all in on your faith.

777
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:05,160
 So not use it to get it out of your system

778
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,660
 and kind of sow your wild oats.

779
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:07,720
 Getting it out of your system,

780
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:11,080
 through sleeping around, living for the weekend,

781
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:13,040
 that is how you get it in your system

782
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:17,460
 and in your profile.

783
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:20,780
 This is a time to go all in and grow in your faith,

784
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:23,540
 to not use the weekend to just play Call of Duty

785
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:26,340
 and your cod squad,

786
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:33,980
 but to invest, invest in knowing God's word,

787
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:36,740
 serving inside of a church, growing your character,

788
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:41,900
 and pursuing an undistracted devotion to the Lord.

789
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:44,100
 Paul says this in Galatians chapter six,

790
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,540
 right now you are sowing seeds in your single life.

791
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:47,500
 What are you sowing?

792
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,940
 He says, do not be misled.

793
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:52,740
 You cannot mock God.

794
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:55,960
 You will always harvest what you plant.

795
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,500
 Those who live only to satisfy their own sinful desires

796
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,860
 will harvest decay and death from sinful nature,

797
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:03,420
 but those who live to please the spirit

798
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:05,460
 will harvest everlasting life from the spirit.

799
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:07,460
 He basically says, hey, whatever you planted today,

800
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:09,340
 you're gonna reap those at a later time.

801
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:10,380
 However you're living your life,

802
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:12,840
 those are gonna resurface again at a later time.

803
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:13,800
 How did you use your weekend?

804
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:14,660
 How are you using your time?

805
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:17,260
 Are you investing it in what actually matters?

806
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:20,420
 God's kingdom, building your character,

807
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,500
 serving inside of a church.

808
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,700
 Are you connected to a church?

809
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,180
 Are you spending time growing in his word?

810
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:25,900
 You know how much Bible you could learn

811
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,140
 in like six weeks around here

812
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:29,340
 with the number of classes that are available?

813
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:32,040
 Are you gonna use this as a foundation

814
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,740
 to become the type of person

815
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:36,460
 who invests in the most important thing about you?

816
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:37,560
 Let me be abundantly clear.

817
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,880
 The most important thing about you

818
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,200
 and the person that you will marry

819
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,720
 is not something you can see.

820
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,440
 It is what is on the inside.

821
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:47,780
 And every single day, you have a decision to say,

822
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,320
 man, what am I investing in?

823
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,020
 How am I shaping my future marriage?

824
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:52,180
 How am I building into my character?

825
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:53,900
 How am I growing in my faith?

826
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:57,460
 And we spend so much time, and ladies,

827
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:00,140
 I'm not throwing shade at it,

828
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:01,900
 so much time looking a certain way,

829
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,740
 clipping up the eyebrows and getting everything

830
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:05,340
 all looking good on the outside,

831
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:08,940
 and neglect the most important thing,

832
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,300
 which you cannot see.

833
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,240
 Which is on the inside.

834
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:17,840
 And above any quality that you should look for,

835
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:22,360
 man, I've just, I remember being single,

836
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,480
 and I know what it's like to be like,

837
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,920
 nah, I don't believe that.

838
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:30,280
 I've done marriages of beautiful girls and handsome guys

839
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:33,360
 that claim to be walking with Jesus,

840
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,640
 and they were hiding sin.

841
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,880
 And those marriages are not together anymore.

842
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,780
 The most important thing about you,

843
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:42,900
 and about the person you're gonna end up with,

844
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:43,980
 is something you cannot see.

845
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:45,820
 It is what is on the inside.

846
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:47,340
 'Cause someday, it's like this,

847
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:50,820
 when I got married, my wife gave me this bracelet.

848
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:53,020
 It's not a tremendously,

849
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:57,060
 you know, crazy, fancy bracelet.

850
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:59,620
 It was just a bracelet of a bunch of fish hooks,

851
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:01,780
 and the fish hooks were basically

852
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:02,900
 accompanied with the letters.

853
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,420
 On our wedding day, showed up at our room,

854
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:06,220
 and we were like, oh, we're gonna get married.

855
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:07,780
 And she was like, oh, I'm so excited.

856
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:08,820
 Showed up at our room, she was like,

857
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,260
 hey, this is for the rest of our life,

858
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:12,300
 we're gonna spend it following Jesus

859
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:13,180
 and doing what he calls us to,

860
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:15,100
 fishing for men, Matthew chapter four.

861
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:18,540
 Also on that day of my wedding,

862
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:19,540
 there was another gift.

863
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:20,900
 There were lots of gifts that you ended up giving,

864
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:23,580
 but you are also, without even realizing it,

865
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:25,380
 you are giving to your spouse

866
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:29,680
 whatever is on the inside of your heart,

867
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:32,580
 of your life, of your soul, of your profile.

868
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:35,000
 What are you going to give?

869
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,140
 What is there?

870
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:37,340
 And are you gonna make the decision

871
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:39,660
 to be a Danny whose profile doesn't say,

872
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:41,300
 you know, I'm still addicted to pornography?

873
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,940
 Instead it says, I'm living authentically,

874
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:45,340
 I'm confessing, I'm living in the light.

875
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:46,660
 Instead of being a Kate who's saying,

876
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:48,420
 yeah, hey, I deal with alcohol

877
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:50,260
 in order to work through my oppression,

878
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:51,340
 and I'm emotionally unstable

879
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:52,660
 'cause I've never forgiven my dad,

880
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:55,600
 it says I have worked through and recovered from

881
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,040
 the hurt and the past.

882
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:03,700
 In my heart, what is your profile going to say?

883
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:05,580
 You get to decide, you have to decide.

884
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:10,820
 And that decision will define and shape

885
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:12,140
 the type of relationship you're gonna have in the future

886
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:14,660
 and the type of person you're gonna end up with in general.

887
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:19,060
 Dating also shares, I'm about to land the plane,

888
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:24,120
 another similarity when it comes to driving.

889
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,820
 Dating like driving,

890
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:27,740
 driving is something you do

891
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:29,440
 whenever you want to go someplace.

892
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,520
 You get in the car to move from one destination

893
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,780
 to another destination.

894
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:38,100
 Biblically, that is the point and purpose of dating.

895
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:41,100
 You get there in order to move in the destination,

896
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:44,560
 not of casual fun, but the destination of marriage.

897
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,460
 If you're not interested in going somewhere,

898
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:47,340
 don't get in a car.

899
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:49,260
 If you're not interested in moving towards marriage,

900
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:50,180
 don't start dating.

901
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:53,140
 And if you are not healthy, you should not be dating.

902
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:54,380
 If you've got stuff in your profile,

903
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:56,420
 you're like, man, this is just toxic,

904
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:58,200
 you should not be dating.

905
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,060
 If there's an addiction that you're hiding,

906
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:03,060
 you're not living in the light, you should not be dating.

907
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:05,500
 If you're not in community,

908
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,180
 I'm not sure you should be dating.

909
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:15,180
 Conclusion, what's in your profile really?

910
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:18,260
 What is at stake could not be bigger.

911
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:22,000
 And the way you change with it

912
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,200
 is by seeking to use your singleness

913
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,980
 to promote what is appropriate behavior

914
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:30,520
 and to go all in with Christ, living in community,

915
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:33,780
 confessing sin, working through past hurts.

916
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:36,520
 And if you do, there is no limit to the story

917
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,620
 that God is gonna write.

918
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:39,500
 There's no person whose profile in here

919
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,400
 is so damaged and scarred and messed up

920
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:44,600
 that God can't write an amazing, beautiful, incredible story.

921
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,860
 Every person in the loft right now,

922
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:48,140
 every person in stage two, every person in El Paso,

923
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:50,980
 every person in Houston, every person in Fort Worth,

924
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:53,800
 every single person, if you are willing to say,

925
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,020
 God, I'm gonna go all in with you.

926
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,220
 Like, I know the fear is that,

927
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,840
 hey, you've done so many things wrong,

928
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,460
 you're like, man, just I'm damaged goods,

929
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:02,180
 a godly guy will never be interested in me.

930
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:03,020
 That is a lie.

931
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:04,500
 Godly guys don't look for perfection,

932
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:07,060
 they look for someone who's pursuing Jesus

933
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:09,420
 with their heart, regardless of their past,

934
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:12,460
 who knows that there's a God who is there,

935
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:16,020
 named Jesus, who changed his profile for you and for me,

936
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:17,580
 the profile of the perfect son of God,

937
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:19,780
 forever, eternally in heaven, without sin,

938
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:21,580
 who became the sinful one on me.

939
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:23,700
 He took all of the sexual sin in my past,

940
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:24,820
 every look at pornography,

941
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:26,320
 every abortion represented in the room,

942
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,540
 every time that you've ever gotten wasted on the weekend,

943
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:30,060
 all of it and all the shame,

944
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:31,860
 everything was taken on Jesus,

945
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:33,500
 and his profile went from perfect

946
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,740
 to covered in your sin and my sin,

947
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:39,540
 so that your profile for all of eternity

948
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:42,580
 would not be defined by the actions that you have,

949
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:45,220
 your relationship status, but what he did on the cross.

950
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:46,980
 If you have trusted him, you are forgiven.

951
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:48,100
 You shouldn't walk in shame,

952
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,660
 you shouldn't walk like you're damaged goods,

953
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:50,860
 you can continue to walk saying,

954
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:55,220
 man, I'm gonna become a godly person.

955
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:57,220
 I'm gonna work on my character right now,

956
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:59,340
 'cause ultimately, I wanna marry a godly person,

957
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:01,680
 and godly people marry godly people,

958
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,900
 so I'm gonna put that number one,

959
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,940
 I'm gonna prioritize that, not just because of that,

960
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:06,680
 but because that is what life has found.

961
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:08,460
 You're not defined by your past.

962
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:13,460
 And until you know your maker,

963
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:16,660
 looking for a match will be foolish.

964
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:19,620
 So those of you who have never trusted in Jesus tonight

965
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:21,140
 is your night, 'cause you're not defined

966
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:22,300
 by what Jesus did on the cross.

967
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:24,980
 You aren't, when Jesus or God looks at you,

968
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:29,900
 someone who's blanket statement, forgiven, pure, my child.

969
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,040
 You're still covered by your sin.

970
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,560
 You've never accepted the free gift Jesus extended

971
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,460
 when he gave his life on the cross for you.

972
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:41,680
 That's what it means to be a Christian,

973
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,240
 is I accepted the free gift that God became a man.

974
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,400
 He died on my place, he paid for everything.

975
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,920
 I'm not defined by my shame,

976
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:52,280
 'cause I've trusted in the one who saves,

977
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:56,680
 Jesus, who died for me, and rose from the dead,

978
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:59,000
 and I will too, and now I'm invited

979
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,780
 to continue to work on my character,

980
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:03,960
 to grow and address my profile,

981
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:07,600
 before I move it into that next relationship,

982
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:10,200
 that second, to my first love,

983
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:13,080
 and my first relationship of importance with him.

984
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:15,260
 Let me pray.

985
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:19,360
 Father, I do pray for every person in the room

986
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:23,140
 who is covered in shame.

987
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:30,940
 They feel like there isn't hope for them.

988
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:34,520
 They've done things that they regret,

989
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,320
 and they're ashamed of, and they wouldn't talk about,

990
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,360
 and they don't want others to know about,

991
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:41,360
 but because of that shame, they feel like damaged goods,

992
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:46,360
 so they keep going after men and women who are not godly,

993
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:50,880
 who don't wanna have the type of marriage

994
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,420
 that you describe in Scripture,

995
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:55,740
 because they think it's the best they can do.

996
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:57,360
 I pray that you would pierce through that,

997
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:00,120
 that they would hear from the voice of you.

998
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:02,920
 You're my child, you're my child.

999
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,940
 You're forgiven.

1000
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:09,760
 That you would write an amazing story and profile

1001
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,600
 and something beautiful.

1002
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,640
 I pray for everyone who's never trusted in your son

1003
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,840
 for the payment for their sin,

1004
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:16,520
 and death and resurrection, tonight would be their night.

1005
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,880
 Father, thank you that you love us

1006
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:23,200
 despite everything messed up in my profile.

1007
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,500
 Everything in my past, everything in my present,

1008
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:30,160
 everything where I need you, God,

1009
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,680
 that I can rest and trust,

1010
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:36,600
 and accept and walk in your forgiveness.

1011
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,800
 I pray that this series,

1012
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,220
 you would launch amazing relationships.

1013
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:41,460
 Men and women would start dating,

1014
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:42,540
 they'd get married from it,

1015
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:45,060
 and I pray that you also stop, destroy,

1016
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:47,360
 and end relationships that they know right now

1017
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,200
 they need to end.

1018
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:51,220
 Thank you that we have a relationship with you

1019
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:54,780
 if we've by faith accepted it that never will end.

1020
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:56,860
 We worship you in song now, amen.
