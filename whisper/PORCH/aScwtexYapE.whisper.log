[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760]   (dramatic music)
[00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.340]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:21.160]   - Well, welcome to The Porch.
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.200]   My name is Josiah and I'm so glad
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.440]   to be with you guys tonight.
[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.580]   Welcome, Porch Live locations, wherever you're tuning in.
[00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.580]   Tulsa, Houston, El Paso, Phoenix, wherever you are,
[00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.560]   welcome, and especially if you are in this room,
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.900]   man, we are starting or continuing
[00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.800]   our series, Rated R for Romance,
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.240]   and we're gonna be starting tonight
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.360]   talking about this idea of sex, sex,
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.240]   and everyone just leaned in, right?
[00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.640]   I thought I would start out by sharing
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.120]   a story with you tonight.
[00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.200]   It was actually the year 1997,
[00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.040]   specifically 22 years ago,
[00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.720]   and I had just moved into my stepfamily's home.
[00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.920]   I was doing the blended family type of thing,
[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.100]   and I was rummaging in our garage at that time,
[00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.520]   and my stepbrother had just gone off to college,
[00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.820]   and I found one of his stashes,
[00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.800]   and I began to rummage through the stash,
[00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.860]   and lo and behold, there was a Playboy,
[00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.960]   and I began to open it page by page,
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.240]   only to find out that I wanted more and more
[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.320]   of what I saw.
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.880]   The first time that I ever experienced pornography,
[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.600]   and in that moment, I wish I could say
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.580]   that it was the last time that I looked at porn,
[00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.160]   but then that actually carried on
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.960]   for the next almost 10 years of my life, a decade,
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.520]   and that turned into one relationship
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.520]   after another relationship of just sexual acts with women,
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:04.880]   and I start there tonight, I start there tonight
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.480]   because I bet I'm not alone up here.
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.200]   We live in a sex-saturated culture
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.000]   where the world has taught us really the wrong way
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.120]   when it comes to our view of sex.
[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.640]   I grew up hearing culture talk about sex, MTV,
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.280]   magazines, movies.
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.760]   The internet came out, it opened up a whole new world
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.280]   of porn and sex.
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.280]   Then there was school, right?
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.040]   Remember sex ed class?
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.000]   That was just awkward, just bad.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.520]   Then there was the church.
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.120]   I don't know about you, but I grew up in a church
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.880]   that didn't really talk about sex.
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.640]   They just chose to suppress sex instead of address it,
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.920]   or that's just kind of what I thought in that moment.
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:02.380]   And so all these ideas of sex began to circulate
[00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.000]   in my mind and my heart,
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.520]   only to grow stronger and stronger and to intensify,
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.720]   and so tonight I wanna reset some of what we have learned
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.000]   in this room, and listen, one of the hardest things
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.920]   that I had to do was to unlearn what I learned.
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.360]   And so we're gonna dive into this book
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.760]   that we've been in over the last two weeks,
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.400]   Song of Solomon, chapter three and four,
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.280]   if you have your Bibles, which I hope you do,
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.600]   open up to Song of Solomon, chapter three.
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.480]   Tonight we're gonna explore God's design for sex,
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.820]   and we're gonna look at the only wedding night
[00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.280]   that is recorded in all of the Bible.
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.440]   We're gonna see this couple walk the aisle, get married,
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.320]   and then they're going to let us into their honeymoon night.
[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.680]   It's like the God of the universe preserved
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.920]   this part of Scripture so that in 2019,
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.260]   at the porch, Dallas, and all across the nation, world,
[00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.280]   he would show us an example of what it looks like
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.000]   to preserve or to pursue and to preserve this gift
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.460]   that we've been given.
[00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:12.920]   See, he's a good daddy who loves you
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.240]   and wants to give life to you in this area,
[00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.200]   but I believe that the world has hijacked this
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.360]   and it's made it something it's not.
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.960]   And disclaimer, the porch is a ministry for young adults,
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.440]   so if you're watching online at this point
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.120]   and you have kids in the room,
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.560]   I just encourage you to turn down the volume
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.720]   and then come check us out at a later date.
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:40.320]   Song of Solomon, chapter three.
[00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.220]   Tonight I wanna talk about God's design for sex,
[00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.220]   specifically God's design for sex is pleasurable
[00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.820]   in marriage, passionate in marriage,
[00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.240]   and before you leave tonight,
[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.340]   God's design in sex is to be powerful.
[00:04:54.340 --> 00:05:00.100]   Verse six of chapter three, here we go, buckle up.
[00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.140]   Who is this coming up from the wilderness
[00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:05.940]   like a column of smoke perfumed with myrrh and incense
[00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.660]   made from all the spices of the merchant?
[00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:10.680]   She's describing her soon-to-be husband.
[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.720]   This is the one whom her soul has longed for,
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.180]   marks luxury and royalty.
[00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.200]   Verse seven, look, it's Solomon's carriage
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.860]   escorted by 60 warriors, the noblest of Israel,
[00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.160]   all of them wearing the sword, all experienced in battle,
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.360]   each with his sword at his side,
[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:29.940]   prepared for the great terrors of night.
[00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.160]   You think your wedding party's gonna be big?
[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.720]   This dude had 60 groomsmen.
[00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:40.900]   Verse nine, King Solomon made himself a carriage.
[00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.860]   He made it of wood of Lebanon.
[00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.460]   Its post he made of silver, its base of gold,
[00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.580]   its seat was upholstered with purple,
[00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.860]   its interior inlaid with love.
[00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:51.400]   Think, this is like the getaway car,
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.100]   this is the limo, right?
[00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.180]   This is the 1950s Bentley.
[00:05:55.180 --> 00:06:00.460]   Goes on and says in verse 11, daughters of Jerusalem,
[00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:02.580]   come out and look, you daughters of Zion,
[00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.820]   look, I'm the King Solomon wearing a crown,
[00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:07.440]   the crown in which his mother crowned him
[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:11.080]   on the day of his wedding, the day his heart rejoiced.
[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.760]   This couple just said, I do.
[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:17.180]   And now they're gonna take a turn
[00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:20.420]   as they enter into the honeymoon night
[00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:23.260]   where he is about to describe her body
[00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:24.900]   in the most sensual way.
[00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:30.220]   Song of Solomon chapter four, verse one.
[00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:34.020]   How beautiful are you, my darling, how beautiful are you?
[00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:36.100]   Your eyes behind the veil are doves.
[00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:41.100]   Doves, he's about to describe her from head to toe.
[00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:46.480]   This idea of doves, David alluded to it the last two weeks,
[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.980]   doves are singular focus.
[00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:51.980]   He's saying, hey, you haven't had eyes for anyone else.
[00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:54.180]   Like you haven't had a wandering eye, woman.
[00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:58.140]   You have had eyes for me only.
[00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:01.000]   Your hair is like a flock of goats
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.400]   descending from the hills of Gilead.
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:03.240]   What?
[00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:05.040]   That's weird.
[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.900]   Like Solomon, you were doing so well
[00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:08.540]   and then you just digressed, bro.
[00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:14.880]   Note to self, men, that's probably not the best pickup line.
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:19.220]   Here's what he's saying.
[00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:21.980]   This is actually a very provocative statement
[00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:23.760]   because in Jewish times,
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:26.100]   a woman would never let her hair down.
[00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:31.900]   And at this point, he has now seen her hair down
[00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:33.200]   for the very first time.
[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.980]   (audience laughing)
[00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:41.060]   They're at the four seasons, if you will.
[00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:44.940]   First two, your teeth are like a flock of sheep just shorn
[00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:46.300]   coming up from the washing.
[00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:47.940]   Each one has its twin.
[00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:48.820]   None of them are alone.
[00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:50.560]   He says, your teeth are white.
[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:52.200]   This woman's breath is fresh.
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:55.320]   That's just free right there, just fresh.
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:58.140]   This woman has all of her teeth, bare twins, right?
[00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:01.440]   This was actually a commodity back in those days.
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:02.900]   I'm serious.
[00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:04.500]   Can't make this stuff up, man.
[00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:09.660]   Why, because they didn't have dental hygiene back then.
[00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:12.540]   And what do you do at your wedding night?
[00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:13.840]   You smile a lot, right?
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:19.340]   I can say that I'm married.
[00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:23.940]   Verse three, your lips are like scarlet ribbon.
[00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:25.360]   Your mouth is lovely.
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:28.540]   Your temples behind your veil are like halves of pomegranates
[00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:31.500]   speaks the redness and the sweetness of her cheeks.
[00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:34.260]   Verse four, your tower or your neck is like the tower
[00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260]   of David built with course of stone.
[00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.080]   On it hangs thousands of shields.
[00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:40.380]   All of them shields of warrior.
[00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:43.060]   This is a picture of her strength, of her nobility.
[00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:44.420]   This isn't just any woman, man.
[00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:46.540]   This is a confident woman.
[00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:47.920]   She knows who she is.
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:52.260]   He begins to describe that and affirm her in that.
[00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.540]   Verse five, your breasts are like two fawns,
[00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:59.020]   like twin fawns of a gazelle that browse among the lilies
[00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:02.200]   until the day breaks and the shadows flee.
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:04.380]   I will go to you to the mountain of Myrrh.
[00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:06.800]   Verse seven, you are altogether beautiful, my darling.
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:08.660]   There is no flaw in you.
[00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:10.360]   Come with me from Lebanon, my bride.
[00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:11.500]   Come with me from Lebanon.
[00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:14.820]   Descend from the crest of Amman, from the top of Sinai,
[00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:17.820]   the summit of Hermon, the lion's dens,
[00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:22.140]   and the mountains that haunts of leopards.
[00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:22.980]   You know what he's saying?
[00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:25.780]   He's saying, hey, you're safe with me, baby.
[00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:28.340]   This bed that you're in, it's safe.
[00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:30.180]   It's secure.
[00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:33.460]   Verse nine, you have stolen my heart, my sister, my bride.
[00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:36.100]   You have stolen my heart with one glance of your eyes,
[00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:38.700]   with a jewel of your necklace.
[00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:41.500]   Even the necklace turns this guy on.
[00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:42.340]   Crazy.
[00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:46.260]   He begins to see her and he looks upon her.
[00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:50.180]   How delightful is your love, my sister, my bride.
[00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:53.300]   How much more pleasing is your love than wine
[00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:56.180]   and fragrance of your perfume than any spice.
[00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:57.580]   He begins to smell her now.
[00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:00.500]   Verse 11, your lips drop sweetness
[00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:02.100]   as the honeycomb, my bride.
[00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:04.180]   Milk and honey are under your tongue.
[00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:05.900]   The fragrance of your garment
[00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:07.620]   is like the fragrance of Lebanon.
[00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:12.180]   He goes from seeing to smelling to touching
[00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:13.180]   to French kissing.
[00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:15.940]   Man, that tongue is in there for the very first time.
[00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:20.980]   This is a man that's activated all of his senses.
[00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:22.420]   Why?
[00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:24.660]   Because in sex, when your senses are heightened,
[00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:27.500]   that's when you begin to experience the most pleasure.
[00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:28.580]   Now, here's what I wanna point out
[00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:31.220]   throughout this whole chapter, but specifically here,
[00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:32.300]   if you're taking notes,
[00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:33.980]   first spiritual truth number one is this.
[00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:38.700]   God designed sex to be pleasurable in marriage.
[00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:41.540]   God designed sex to be pleasurable in marriage.
[00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:44.180]   In verse one through 11, we see that sex is pleasurable.
[00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:45.780]   In other words, God is pro-sex
[00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:47.300]   and he created it to be pleasurable.
[00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:48.460]   He made the parts.
[00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:52.500]   Like God is the one who patented pleasure.
[00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:55.260]   Like this is what we see in these verses,
[00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.860]   specifically right here in the first 11 verses
[00:10:57.860 --> 00:10:58.700]   of chapter four.
[00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:00.500]   It's his idea, man.
[00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:02.100]   He's the mastermind behind all the parts.
[00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:03.540]   Look at verse five and six.
[00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:05.940]   Let me go back just for a second.
[00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:07.580]   Your breasts are like two fawns,
[00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:09.460]   like twin fawns of the gazelle that braise,
[00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:11.060]   that graze them or that browse
[00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:12.660]   or graze among the lilies, right?
[00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:15.300]   Until the day breaks and the shadows flee, that's morning.
[00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:16.380]   I will go to the mountain of worry.
[00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:19.740]   He's saying, hey, I want you all night long
[00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:22.620]   and I wanna hang out on your body,
[00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:24.380]   specifically your breasts.
[00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:27.820]   God designed sex to be pleasurable.
[00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:30.420]   Notice he compares her breasts to two fawns.
[00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:32.580]   What happens when you run up to a fawn?
[00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:36.620]   Right, they just scatter, they just flee.
[00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:39.820]   Like you know what he's saying here?
[00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:44.500]   He's saying, hey, he's approaching this woman with care.
[00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:46.180]   He's gentle with her.
[00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:50.220]   He goes slow.
[00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:54.180]   He touches her in the most loving, caring way possible.
[00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:55.700]   He's got a little "Boys II Men"
[00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:57.980]   going on in the background right now.
[00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:00.820]   I'll make love to, oh, I'd rather not.
[00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:02.580]   Shane, you better come on out here, bro,
[00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:04.860]   'cause this brother cannot sing, right?
[00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:06.180]   But he's got a little "Boys II Men" right here.
[00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:08.620]   He's saying, I'll make love to you all night long.
[00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:11.500]   All night long.
[00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:12.780]   Tell me what you need.
[00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:15.900]   But this is what he's saying.
[00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:19.180]   He's making love to this woman.
[00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:22.100]   He's saying, all night long, I delight to be with you.
[00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:25.020]   This man is looking at the naked body of his wife,
[00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:26.420]   but he's not looking at his wife
[00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:28.300]   as an object of his passion,
[00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:31.700]   and now she has to do all of his wildest fantasies.
[00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:37.740]   No, this man is there to serve her on their wedding night.
[00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:39.860]   He removes the expectations.
[00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:41.740]   He puts them on the floor.
[00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:42.660]   You're like, that's crazy.
[00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:43.500]   Yeah, it is.
[00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:46.140]   But this man is a servant.
[00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:49.540]   He goes slow.
[00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:50.380]   He speaks.
[00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:52.700]   He uses his words to affirm her.
[00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:57.500]   And this woman in this moment
[00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:00.860]   is one of the most secure women,
[00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:06.660]   because this man speaks gently to her,
[00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:09.380]   and he begins to say, hey, you're perfect altogether.
[00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:11.940]   There's no blemish in you.
[00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:14.780]   He takes on the form of a servant.
[00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:17.060]   God designed sex not just for procreation
[00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:17.900]   as some might think.
[00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:19.020]   God designed it for pleasure.
[00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:21.500]   That was strategic in how he created our parts.
[00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:25.020]   Like, he put the nerve endings in very specific places
[00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:26.980]   so that they would feel good.
[00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:30.700]   God is pro pleasure.
[00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:34.020]   Like, it's not just for procreation.
[00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:37.500]   Some of the questions that were submitted
[00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:40.140]   leads me to believe that some of you
[00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:41.220]   kind of question this.
[00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:44.180]   We've given you an opportunity over the last few weeks
[00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:46.940]   to submit questions, and we did a Q&A last week.
[00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:52.460]   And some of your questions was this.
[00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:54.220]   Is it okay to lust after my husband?
[00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:56.620]   Is it okay to enjoy sex in marriage?
[00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:58.220]   I hope so.
[00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:01.660]   Is it okay to do other things besides sex and marriage?
[00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:04.140]   Look at Proverbs 5, 18 through 19 says,
[00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:06.140]   it says, "May your fountain be blessed,
[00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:09.260]   "and may you rejoice in the wife of your youth,
[00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.380]   "a loving doe, a graceful deer.
[00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:14.220]   "May her breast satisfy you always.
[00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:17.300]   "May you be intoxicated with her love."
[00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:19.700]   He's saying, hey, may you just be drunk
[00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:22.180]   with the love of this woman.
[00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:25.620]   Does this sound like you can't lust after your spouse,
[00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:26.460]   enjoy sex?
[00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:27.280]   No.
[00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:30.940]   God is affirming you in this.
[00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:33.660]   And he's saying, hey, I've created sex
[00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:35.740]   so that you'd experience pleasure in marriage.
[00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:36.580]   Why?
[00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:38.580]   I'm glad you asked.
[00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:40.700]   Listen, that's the caveat.
[00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:43.820]   In marriage.
[00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:44.660]   And I get that.
[00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:45.740]   Like some of us come into this place
[00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:46.800]   and that's just old school.
[00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:47.860]   It's like, you kidding me?
[00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:51.060]   Y'all are still preaching this in 2019?
[00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:54.040]   Why?
[00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:55.820]   Let's continue, verse 12.
[00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:58.880]   You are a garden locked up, my sister, my bride.
[00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:01.900]   You are a spring enclosed, a sealed fountain.
[00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:04.660]   In other words, when you see a garden,
[00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:06.580]   when you see a spring, this is her body.
[00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:08.840]   Her body has been off limits until now.
[00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:12.260]   Your plants are an orchard of pomegranates
[00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.180]   and choice fruits with henna and nard,
[00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:16.900]   nard and saffron, calamus and cinnamon
[00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:20.300]   with every kind of incense tree with myrrh and aloes
[00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:23.040]   and all the finest spices.
[00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:26.620]   But now her body and her sexuality is to be enjoyed.
[00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:29.380]   His body and his sexuality is to be enjoyed.
[00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:32.640]   You are a garden fountain, a well of flowing water
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:33.860]   streaming down from Lebanon.
[00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:35.500]   I'll just let you interpret that.
[00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:40.180]   Some of you gotta go back and read it.
[00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:41.780]   It's like, what did he just say?
[00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:43.380]   (chuckles)
[00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:46.620]   That this woman is turned on to the max
[00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:52.280]   because this man has made her feel secure, safe,
[00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:55.820]   and he has made her feel
[00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:59.200]   like she's the only object of his passion.
[00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:03.560]   Spiritual truth number two, if you're taking notes,
[00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:06.940]   God designed sex to be passionate in marriage.
[00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:08.980]   God designed sex to be passionate in marriage.
[00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:11.660]   Why did this woman protect her purity up until the wedding?
[00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:14.380]   Or in the honeymoon night, like verse 12 says,
[00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:16.100]   it's not because she was a prude.
[00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:17.400]   She has never had sex.
[00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:20.140]   And basically in verse 16, look at what it says.
[00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:22.060]   Come, let's enjoy foreplay.
[00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:24.340]   Taste my choice fruits.
[00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:26.860]   He, she is speaking about oral sex here.
[00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:30.540]   That's the only way you can interpret that.
[00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:36.500]   Like, listen, she is not a prude, but she is pure.
[00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:38.100]   Why?
[00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:40.420]   Because this woman knew what many of us don't know
[00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:41.980]   in this evening.
[00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:44.120]   Purity drives passion.
[00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:48.020]   The less purity, the less passion in your marriage.
[00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:48.940]   Let me explain.
[00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:50.900]   If you're having sex with your significant other
[00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:53.260]   and pornography is your advice for you,
[00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:56.980]   then you are punting on the season that God has given you
[00:16:56.980 --> 00:17:00.020]   to grow your patience and your self-control.
[00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:01.860]   Let me ask you, do you think you're gonna need patience
[00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:04.060]   and self, I was having lunch with a young adult
[00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:04.900]   a couple of weeks ago.
[00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:06.100]   I just said, "Hey, do you think you're gonna need patience
[00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:08.160]   "and self-control in your marriage?"
[00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:10.040]   He sat there for a second and he's like,
[00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:11.480]   "Yeah, I think so."
[00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:12.900]   I'm like, "Yeah, man, you're definitely gonna need
[00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:14.300]   "patience and self-control."
[00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:21.560]   God's given you a season called dating, called engagement,
[00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:29.020]   so that you would put your sexual urges in check.
[00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:29.860]   Why?
[00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:32.600]   So that you would be able to build patience
[00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:35.520]   and self-control now.
[00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:36.680]   Like, I think some of you just think
[00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:37.640]   you're just gonna get married
[00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:38.580]   and you're just gonna flip a switch
[00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:39.720]   and you're just gonna be patient.
[00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:41.440]   You're just gonna have self-control.
[00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:43.380]   I wish I could stand up here and say,
[00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:46.440]   "Hey, I've never had a sexual urge for another woman
[00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:48.460]   "ever after I got married."
[00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:49.600]   Like, that is not the case.
[00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:51.680]   That's the furthest thing from the truth.
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:53.680]   I'm just trying to keep it real tonight.
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:56.780]   And so why purity?
[00:17:56.780 --> 00:18:02.160]   Why does purity drive passion?
[00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:09.640]   Because when you discipline yourself
[00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:11.200]   in dating and engagement,
[00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:12.880]   then it gives you an opportunity,
[00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:15.980]   when you have those same urges for someone else
[00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:18.780]   that's not your spouse in marriage,
[00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:21.320]   you have the purity, you have the patience,
[00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:22.900]   you have the self-control,
[00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:25.920]   because you disciplined yourself
[00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:30.420]   during the season that God said, "Wait."
[00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:34.520]   So if you think you can't be pure outside of marriage,
[00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:36.080]   listen, listen, why do you think
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:38.080]   you're gonna be pure inside of marriage?
[00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:42.440]   See, I liken our sex drive to like a spoiled child.
[00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:44.160]   I have a three-year-old.
[00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:45.000]   Man, I love her.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.720]   She's named, her name's Camille, Camille Elizabeth.
[00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:51.540]   And so every so often, I shouldn't say every so often,
[00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:54.020]   almost every day at this point,
[00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:58.520]   she begins to throw temper tantrums,
[00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:01.300]   like almost to a point where she'll just get on the floor
[00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:02.600]   and just make a scene.
[00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:03.860]   Like, it's so embarrassing.
[00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:06.420]   We're in public, and when she doesn't get what she wants,
[00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:08.900]   like, she'll just scream at the top of her lungs,
[00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:11.540]   and then she'll just be flailing on the floor.
[00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:13.220]   I'm just like, "Oh my goodness.
[00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:14.620]   "Hey, I'm sorry."
[00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:21.700]   And so in that moment, she doesn't need indulgence.
[00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:24.160]   Like, she doesn't need mommy and daddy
[00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:26.220]   to give her what she wants in that moment.
[00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:27.380]   You know what she needs in that moment?
[00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:29.260]   She needs discipline.
[00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:30.940]   And the God of the universe,
[00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:33.120]   in the same way the God of the universe,
[00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:36.320]   says, "Hey, when your sex drive,
[00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:38.060]   "like, it doesn't need indulgence
[00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:39.460]   "and dating and engagement.
[00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:41.760]   "Like, it needs discipline.
[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:45.360]   "It needs discipline, Porch."
[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:52.280]   Because God is trying to set you up for passionate sex
[00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:58.780]   that would be between you and your spouse forever and ever.
[00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:02.800]   So I would argue purity drives passion.
[00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:04.800]   The less purity, the less passion in marriage.
[00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:07.560]   And God designed sex to be passion in marriage.
[00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:10.240]   And the way you keep passionate,
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:12.000]   or the way, and the way you keep it passionate
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.880]   is by pursuing purity outside and inside of marriage.
[00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:16.720]   And you might say tonight,
[00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:19.760]   "Well, Josiah, I'm experiencing a lot of passion.
[00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:21.640]   "I experience passion when I have one night stands.
[00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:24.400]   "I experience passion when I have premarital sex."
[00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:26.000]   And I would say, "You're right."
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.460]   That's confusing.
[00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:30.500]   I did too.
[00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:33.380]   Before I came to Christ,
[00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:36.400]   I experienced a lot of passion before
[00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:41.280]   I came to Christ, from one woman to the next.
[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:42.840]   But here's what I know.
[00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:44.640]   This passion is fleeting.
[00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:46.480]   This passion does not last.
[00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:48.000]   This passion is empty.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.580]   It's hollow.
[00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:52.540]   Like, you might experience passion
[00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:54.760]   when you engage in sexual activity
[00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:56.400]   with multiple women or multiple men.
[00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:58.200]   But you and I know this to be true.
[00:20:58.200 --> 00:20:59.960]   That kind of passion is fleeting.
[00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:00.800]   It's temporal.
[00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:03.640]   It comes and goes because it's not built on commitment.
[00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:06.360]   It's built on, hey, you can leave at any point.
[00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:11.360]   If you want passionate sex that will last,
[00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:14.960]   it's only gonna be built on this idea
[00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:18.240]   that, hey, I'm gonna commit to you no matter what.
[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:22.360]   No matter what, no matter where you've been
[00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:23.440]   in thought, word, and action,
[00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:26.660]   no matter what your sexual history is,
[00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:28.040]   no matter what you've done to me,
[00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:29.240]   I'm not going anywhere.
[00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:34.240]   And it brings this incredible security into a marriage.
[00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:38.960]   I'm yours and you're mine.
[00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:41.760]   This is the kind of passion this couple is experiencing
[00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:42.880]   in the Song of Solomon.
[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:45.080]   This is the kind of passion that the God
[00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:49.320]   of the galaxies wants for every single one of us.
[00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:53.400]   I had a roommate in college and best man at my wedding.
[00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:54.860]   He came up to me.
[00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:56.620]   I was dating my bride, Kathy.
[00:21:57.580 --> 00:21:59.860]   And he said, hey, to the degree that you'll protect
[00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:02.900]   Kathy's purity now while you're dating her
[00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:06.900]   will be to the degree that she trusts you later.
[00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:09.260]   I said, what do you mean by that?
[00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:12.980]   And he said, hey, if you don't ever give her a reason
[00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:17.540]   to believe that you can put your sexual urges in check now,
[00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:21.100]   then what makes you think that when she lays down at night
[00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:23.460]   in the marriage bed, when you guys get married
[00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:25.540]   and you're out traveling or you're out with the boys
[00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:27.700]   or maybe you're in the marriage bed, right?
[00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:30.660]   And she's out with the girls hanging out.
[00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:33.740]   What makes you think that you guys
[00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:36.180]   are gonna trust each other if you can never look back
[00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:40.540]   on a season where you disciplined yourself sexually?
[00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:43.580]   Listen, I meet with young adults every single week
[00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:45.180]   and this is what I find out.
[00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:51.180]   When they are engaging in sexual activity before marriage,
[00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:54.580]   they have all kinds of insecurities.
[00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:56.460]   Like I was meeting with a young adult the other day
[00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:59.340]   and literally they are tracking each other.
[00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:01.900]   They literally share location with each other
[00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:03.660]   because they don't trust each other
[00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:05.420]   when they're not around each other.
[00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:07.860]   It's crazy, man.
[00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:11.580]   And listen, I've been in both sides.
[00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:13.420]   While I was pursuing purity and man,
[00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:16.340]   I was just giving in to whatever desire I wanted.
[00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:18.180]   And when I was just giving in to whatever desire I wanted,
[00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:20.180]   man, I had all kinds of insecurities.
[00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:23.060]   I was the same person wondering,
[00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:25.540]   I wonder what she's doing when I'm not around.
[00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:31.660]   When this type of trust is forged in marriage,
[00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:33.480]   then passion always follows.
[00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:35.780]   God designed sex to be passionate in marriage
[00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:38.960]   and you build passion by pursuing purity.
[00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:42.980]   Song of Solomon chapter five, verse one.
[00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:45.700]   This is the very first time
[00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:55.120]   that this couple goes all the way.
[00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:59.540]   Verse one, I've come into my garden, my sister, my bride.
[00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:01.980]   I've gathered my myrrh with spice.
[00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:04.280]   I've eaten my honeycomb and my honey.
[00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:06.900]   I've drunk my wine and my milk.
[00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:08.780]   And then God speaks.
[00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:12.140]   He doesn't speak anywhere else in this whole book.
[00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:14.940]   And he speaks, he says, eat friends and drink.
[00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:16.640]   Drink your fill of love.
[00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:18.700]   They need not to restrict their love anymore.
[00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:21.140]   They can enjoy sex with each other.
[00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:23.460]   They can delight in, it's like they both rolled over
[00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:26.580]   after they had sex with no shame, no guilt,
[00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:28.860]   no condemnation.
[00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:33.860]   And God in this moment affirms them and says, that's good.
[00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:37.960]   That's the way it was meant to be.
[00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:43.380]   Spiritual truth number three, if you're taking notes,
[00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:47.280]   God designed sex to be powerful in marriage.
[00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:53.280]   God designed sex to be powerful in marriage.
[00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:54.960]   Why is sex powerful?
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:57.440]   Because it produces a oneness.
[00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:01.720]   The man speaks and says, my nine times in this chapter,
[00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:04.800]   in verse one of chapter five, he reiterates the oneness
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:07.760]   that him and his bride are having in marriage.
[00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:10.960]   See, sex is powerful because when he says that,
[00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:14.880]   in that same verse, he says, hey, drink your fill of love.
[00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:18.440]   This word love here, in the Hebrew, it's the word dod,
[00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:20.600]   which literally means the mingling of souls.
[00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:22.480]   You ever heard of soul ties?
[00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:25.800]   It means you mingle your souls together.
[00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:27.680]   This is the reason why I'm telling you this
[00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:31.740]   is because listen, there is no such thing as just sex.
[00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:35.320]   Like the God of the universe is combating these phrases
[00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:37.520]   that we hear in our culture all the time.
[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:39.720]   It's just sex, try before you buy.
[00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:41.840]   Friends with benefits, no strings attached.
[00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:43.900]   You see, the world says practice makes perfect.
[00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:45.240]   You know what God says?
[00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:46.780]   Practice makes permanent.
[00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:50.600]   And you know this to be true, I know this to be true.
[00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:57.420]   While everything in that relationship is just wrong,
[00:25:57.420 --> 00:26:00.480]   you keep going back to him, you keep going back to her.
[00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:02.240]   Why, because you had sex with them,
[00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:04.800]   and because of that, this soul tie,
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:08.800]   this act is stronger than any other act.
[00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:10.280]   It's stronger than holding hands,
[00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:13.500]   it's stronger than kissing, it's stronger than hugging.
[00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:18.000]   And you know, science has finally caught up with the Bible.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:18.840]   You know that?
[00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:21.840]   Like psychology has affirmed
[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:23.840]   what the Bible has said for so long.
[00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:28.560]   It's this term sex glue, or this oneness,
[00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:31.420]   is a powerful bond that God describes in the Bible
[00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:34.780]   when one man and one woman gives themselves to each other.
[00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:37.960]   It's this real psychological, physiological,
[00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:40.240]   sociological phenomenon.
[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:42.760]   Let me explain, it's the building of brain synapses
[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:46.520]   that occur during orgasm in the act of sex, sex glue,
[00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:48.700]   this thing that scientists have now discovered
[00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:49.960]   that God said way back,
[00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:52.280]   that a man would leave his father and mother
[00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:53.840]   and be joined to his wife,
[00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:57.920]   and the two shall become one flesh, Matthew 19, six.
[00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:02.520]   And so this oneness, this bond,
[00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:09.080]   happens when we orgasm.
[00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:12.960]   When we experience release, our mind and our five senses,
[00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:17.360]   it begins to adhere to whatever you look at in that moment.
[00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:19.240]   Because your five senses are heightened,
[00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:22.800]   and in that time, you have these chemicals
[00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:24.500]   that are released called dopamine.
[00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:28.240]   And these dopamine chemicals release
[00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:31.440]   to whatever you are looking at in that moment,
[00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:36.120]   and it's like you stick to that thing or that person.
[00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:37.320]   And so this is why counselors says,
[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:39.440]   hey, when you have sex,
[00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:43.680]   make sure that you're looking at that person in the face.
[00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:47.800]   Because there's other women or there's other men
[00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:50.840]   that have those types of parts.
[00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:55.460]   And so when you look at each other in the face,
[00:27:55.460 --> 00:27:58.440]   it bonds you unlike anything else, why?
[00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:03.440]   Because she or he is the only one with that face.
[00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:08.180]   It's like a thumbprint that bonds to your heart,
[00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:09.260]   and by God's design,
[00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:12.300]   he wants you to be bond to your spouse only.
[00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:15.900]   God created sex for the purpose of oneness.
[00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:19.900]   Not one night stands,
[00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:23.300]   not two-dimensional images on your computer screen,
[00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:26.660]   your phone, you and your wife in a committed marriage.
[00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:28.140]   How amazing is that?
[00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:30.200]   Like it's like God had this planned.
[00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:35.000]   Sex is powerful.
[00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:39.760]   So you can now imagine that if one man and one woman
[00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:44.000]   bond to each other and to each other only,
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.760]   then when they get into a marriage relationship
[00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:51.100]   and years and years pass by and things begin to sag
[00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:54.260]   and you begin to age, then what happens?
[00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:57.000]   Then that person, your spouse,
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.680]   is the epitome of your attraction.
[00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:00.520]   Why?
[00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:02.000]   Because you have nothing to compare it to.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.160]   And you know this to be true.
[00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:05.800]   Comparison is the thief of all joy.
[00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:08.040]   It robs you of all contentment.
[00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:11.800]   I was having lunch just the other day
[00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:13.320]   with another young adult,
[00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:16.640]   and he said, "Man, I had everything.
[00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:19.600]   "I was cohabitating before marriage,
[00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:21.760]   "and man, I thought it was the best thing.
[00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:24.440]   "We were having sex, and then all of a sudden,
[00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:27.800]   "I didn't even want it anymore."
[00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:28.800]   I said, "Boy, what?"
[00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:31.840]   I said, "Boy, what?"
[00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:35.720]   You got something else to tell me.
[00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:38.600]   And he said, "Yeah, man, I wanted pornography.
[00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:42.200]   "I began to be addicted to everything else,
[00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:44.500]   "and I didn't even want the real thing anymore.
[00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:51.060]   "I lost all physical attraction for the woman
[00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:54.000]   "that I was dating and living with."
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:59.340]   See, Porch, this is what you gotta understand.
[00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:02.780]   You're growing an appetite for something.
[00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:04.780]   You're not growing an appetite for oneness.
[00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:07.420]   You're growing an appetite for two-dimensional images.
[00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:12.580]   Listen, that will never satisfy you in a relationship.
[00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:14.180]   Listen, this is my story.
[00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:20.940]   I found myself in college playing baseball
[00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:23.340]   and chasing everything underneath the sun.
[00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:28.100]   I found myself in college playing baseball
[00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:30.260]   and chasing everything underneath the sun.
[00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:31.460]   If I wanted it, I had it.
[00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:33.220]   I denied myself no pleasure.
[00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:38.780]   I ran to the bottle, alcohol for celebration.
[00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:41.460]   I ran to the bottle, alcohol for consolation.
[00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:44.220]   Either way, whether I was high or whether I was low,
[00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:49.220]   whatever moment I found myself in, that's what I would do.
[00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:52.060]   The next party, the next relationship, the next woman.
[00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:56.640]   I was an addict to pornography.
[00:30:57.460 --> 00:31:00.920]   The most narcissistic, selfish person.
[00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:04.840]   I got off the bus my junior year
[00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:07.340]   from playing a three-game series.
[00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:10.360]   I began to ask myself the question, "Is that it?"
[00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:11.680]   'Cause if these things aren't gonna do it anymore,
[00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:12.520]   what's gonna do it?
[00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:13.800]   I went right down the list with everything
[00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:15.000]   I'd been filling my life with,
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.560]   went back to my apartment that night.
[00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:18.600]   My teammates, my roommates were getting ready to go out.
[00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:20.680]   I said, "I'm taking this one off."
[00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:23.040]   And I remember looking at myself in the mirror,
[00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:24.320]   bending over like this, and I said,
[00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:26.960]   "Man, I got everything.
[00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:31.320]   "Everything that I've been working so hard for,
[00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:35.440]   "only to find myself in a place of depression,
[00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:37.400]   "in a place of emptiness."
[00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:43.100]   And I cried out to God, I just like,
[00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:48.100]   "God, if you're real, reveal yourself to me."
[00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:53.680]   See, I compared my life to other people for so long.
[00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:55.280]   When you compare your life to other people,
[00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:56.760]   you can always find someone worse than you,
[00:31:56.760 --> 00:31:57.960]   which gives you security in the fact
[00:31:57.960 --> 00:31:59.860]   that you're really not that bad, right?
[00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:03.680]   I did that for years of my life.
[00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:06.800]   And over the course of the next few days,
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:10.040]   I began to examine the evidence of Christ and who he was,
[00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:13.320]   and I finally saw my sin for what it is
[00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:15.200]   in light of a holy, perfect God.
[00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:17.680]   I finally saw my sin on the cross.
[00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:19.640]   See, I finally realized that Jesus didn't die
[00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:20.840]   to make me miserable.
[00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:23.280]   He died to give me life.
[00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:26.640]   There's a way that seems right to man,
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:29.160]   but that way ends in death, Proverbs 14, 12 says.
[00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:32.520]   And I cried out to God, I said,
[00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:37.520]   "God, these other things aren't fulfilling me anymore
[00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:42.580]   "because I failed to connect the creation to the creator.
[00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:48.940]   "And I don't want any of these things if I can't have you,
[00:32:48.940 --> 00:32:52.660]   "because life is meaningless."
[00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:55.740]   Apart from you.
[00:32:55.740 --> 00:33:01.500]   And I understood that all of my shame
[00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:06.140]   and all of my blame went on him,
[00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:08.380]   and he soaked up every last ounce of God's wrath,
[00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:10.940]   the wrath that should have been poured out on you and me.
[00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:13.980]   Not only that, history says,
[00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:18.620]   and the scriptures tell us that Jesus defeated sin
[00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:21.420]   and death three days later.
[00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:23.580]   Why? So that we could experience victory
[00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:28.020]   from the things that we go back to
[00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:30.660]   that create bondage and addiction in our life.
[00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:34.240]   What I learned quickly is that Jesus never calls you
[00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:36.400]   from something without calling you to something.
[00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:39.020]   The very first thing that he called me to
[00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:41.260]   was to change my playground and my playmates,
[00:33:41.260 --> 00:33:44.980]   to pursue new community.
[00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:48.780]   And I remember like it's yesterday,
[00:33:48.780 --> 00:33:51.400]   I remember meeting up with these guys
[00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:52.820]   that wanted to be God's men
[00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:57.400]   and wanted to run with other men that wanted to be God's men.
[00:33:57.400 --> 00:34:00.220]   And I remember feeling like,
[00:34:00.220 --> 00:34:02.620]   man, I think I'm missing something.
[00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:05.060]   And they took me to James 5, 16,
[00:34:05.060 --> 00:34:07.940]   and they began to read this scripture over me,
[00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:10.900]   and it says, "Hey, confess your sin one to another
[00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:13.800]   "and then pray for one another so that you may be healed."
[00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:16.860]   See, I've been forgiven.
[00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:18.860]   First John 1, 9 says, "When you confess your sin,
[00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:20.720]   "he's faithful and just to forgive you of your sin
[00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:22.620]   "and cleanse you from all unrighteousness."
[00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:24.520]   But I hadn't been healed.
[00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:28.900]   Like I was planning on taking these things in my past
[00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:30.260]   to the grave.
[00:34:30.260 --> 00:34:33.020]   I wasn't gonna tell anybody about it.
[00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:37.660]   I'm convinced tonight that many of us walk into this place
[00:34:37.660 --> 00:34:39.500]   and we might be forgiven by God
[00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:42.500]   because we walked out, 1 John 1, 9,
[00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:45.940]   we trust what Jesus has done for us on the cross.
[00:34:45.940 --> 00:34:49.820]   But a lot of us come into this place still not healed.
[00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:54.220]   And so I gathered with those men and I said, "Here we go."
[00:34:54.220 --> 00:34:57.060]   This is where I've been.
[00:34:57.060 --> 00:34:57.900]   Everything.
[00:34:57.900 --> 00:35:01.420]   I laid it out there to them specifically.
[00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:02.500]   And then they stopped and they said,
[00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:04.400]   "Hey, let me pray for you."
[00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:06.060]   I laid out some more, then, "Let me pray for you."
[00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:07.700]   I laid out some more, "Let me pray for you."
[00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:09.780]   I laid out some more, "Let me pray for you."
[00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:13.680]   And I got up from that time.
[00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:19.860]   And the weight of the world was off my shoulders.
[00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:24.540]   And I believe in that moment that God healed me.
[00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:32.620]   So wherever you are in the room right now,
[00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:35.280]   single, dating, engaged, married, online,
[00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:37.940]   your best decision is to deal
[00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:39.980]   with the baggage that's in your life.
[00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:43.020]   This is the greatest gift that you can give to your spouse
[00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:44.100]   or your future spouse.
[00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:46.820]   Listen, the last thing I wanna do, guys,
[00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:49.820]   is just stand up here and act like, man, this is just easy.
[00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:56.580]   Like I know this isn't easy.
[00:35:56.580 --> 00:35:59.620]   I know that this is hard.
[00:35:59.620 --> 00:36:08.980]   I know what it's like to be in your 20s and still single.
[00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:11.660]   And that was me when I was in my 20s.
[00:36:11.660 --> 00:36:13.220]   I remember listening to messages like this.
[00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:15.020]   I get so frustrated thinking like,
[00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:16.740]   man, am I ever gonna get married?
[00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:19.140]   God, what are you doing, man?
[00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:20.540]   Are you trying to hold out on me?
[00:36:20.540 --> 00:36:23.900]   Are you trying to discipline me because of my sexual baggage?
[00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:28.220]   Are you trying to, you know, condemn me in a way?
[00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:33.740]   You punishing me, God?
[00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:36.840]   I wanted to compromise my convictions.
[00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:40.100]   So often there was times when, man, I lost the battle.
[00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:40.940]   I'm not gonna stand up here
[00:36:40.940 --> 00:36:42.660]   and act like I had it all together.
[00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:45.100]   But you know what I did?
[00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:46.340]   I went back to those men.
[00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:48.700]   I began to confess.
[00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:53.020]   Because the power of sin is always in secrecy.
[00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:55.500]   You want the power of sin to be released in your life?
[00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:57.180]   Then expose it to the light
[00:36:57.180 --> 00:36:59.660]   and begin to confess that to other men.
[00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:02.660]   Women, confess that to other women.
[00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:06.220]   You allow them to pray over you.
[00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:10.780]   I began to be thankful for the season of my singleness
[00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:12.820]   because Jesus grew me there.
[00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:15.220]   And then six years ago, man, I was 30 years old.
[00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:18.660]   I met the love of my life, Kathy Gauthier,
[00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:22.220]   little brown hair, brown dye, raging Cajun,
[00:37:22.220 --> 00:37:24.220]   Dallas plant from New Orleans.
[00:37:24.220 --> 00:37:28.180]   And we were coming to the porch at that time.
[00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:31.340]   Listen, we sat right back there in the second tier seating.
[00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:32.860]   I remember hearing messages like this.
[00:37:32.860 --> 00:37:34.940]   And I began to say, man, I gotta unlearn
[00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:37.340]   some of these things that I learned for so long.
[00:37:37.340 --> 00:37:39.940]   And God began to do a work.
[00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:44.460]   In our life personally and in our relationship,
[00:37:44.460 --> 00:37:48.460]   he began to take our brokenness,
[00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:50.740]   began to heal some areas of our life.
[00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:53.580]   He began to show us what it looked like
[00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:57.300]   to pursue purity in dating and engagement.
[00:37:57.300 --> 00:38:00.100]   We ended up going through Merge,
[00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:02.460]   which is Watermark's premarital counseling ministry,
[00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:05.020]   which, listen, I highly recommend.
[00:38:05.020 --> 00:38:07.740]   We actually went through pre-engagement counseling.
[00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:09.300]   Had all kinds of baggage.
[00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:10.940]   Come from a divorced family.
[00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:14.100]   I always thought that I would end up there.
[00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:15.260]   Didn't like commitment.
[00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:19.900]   But they began to show me what it looked like
[00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:24.900]   to pursue a woman in a godly way.
[00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:30.020]   And God used that season in our life
[00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:31.860]   to grab ahold of our hearts.
[00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:35.020]   And then when I was 31 years old,
[00:38:36.740 --> 00:38:40.380]   I said I do to one another and we got married.
[00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:48.820]   And five plus years later, this is my family.
[00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:51.100]   My wife, Kathy.
[00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:57.180]   My little girl, Camille, who's almost three,
[00:38:57.180 --> 00:38:59.900]   and Isabella Marie, who's one.
[00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:04.580]   Listen, I share that tonight to offer hope.
[00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:07.740]   I'm not claiming that you're gonna get married
[00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:08.980]   and have kids.
[00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:12.140]   You might never get married.
[00:39:12.140 --> 00:39:13.100]   You might never have any kids.
[00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:14.300]   You might not even wanna get married.
[00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:16.700]   Hey, listen, singleness is a gift.
[00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:20.060]   That's a whole 'nother message for a whole 'nother night.
[00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:21.620]   Love to talk to you about that.
[00:39:21.620 --> 00:39:24.060]   But I share this with you tonight
[00:39:24.060 --> 00:39:28.220]   because I want you to see the grace of God in our life.
[00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:31.660]   And listen, He's offering you the same grace tonight.
[00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:35.020]   Like He's saying, hey, the God of the galaxies is saying,
[00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:36.940]   hey, you can have a restart.
[00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:41.420]   Like you don't have to keep going down the same road,
[00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:43.900]   doing the same stuff, doing the same.
[00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:48.900]   God just say a crap and expected a different result.
[00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:54.140]   That's the beauty of the gospel
[00:39:54.140 --> 00:39:56.580]   is no longer counting your sins against you.
[00:39:56.580 --> 00:39:59.020]   He's removed your transgressions, the Bible says,
[00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:01.140]   as far as the east is from the west.
[00:40:01.140 --> 00:40:04.540]   You right now can say, God, I've been a fool.
[00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:06.940]   I've pursued things on my own.
[00:40:06.940 --> 00:40:09.260]   I've stiffed armed you, God,
[00:40:09.260 --> 00:40:11.420]   when it comes to the area of relationships
[00:40:11.420 --> 00:40:13.140]   and sex and purity.
[00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:16.100]   And I need you, God.
[00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:19.980]   I know it's not gonna be easy.
[00:40:19.980 --> 00:40:21.940]   I know Satan's trying to dupe me.
[00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:24.340]   I know Dallas is trying to dupe me,
[00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:28.220]   but I trust not what this guy is saying up on stage.
[00:40:28.220 --> 00:40:29.940]   I trust what your word is saying.
[00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:32.340]   (soft music)
[00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:38.380]   And right now, tonight, he wants to give you a restart.
[00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:40.740]   He wants to reset your life.
[00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:44.980]   And I'm a living testimony that by his grace,
[00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:48.180]   nothing on my own accord.
[00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:50.460]   Let me pray that he would do that for you tonight.
[00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:55.020]   A prayer that I pray often
[00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:01.580]   is Lord, would you quench my curiosity
[00:41:01.580 --> 00:41:04.100]   and restore my innocence?
[00:41:04.100 --> 00:41:08.620]   Lord, would you quench my curiosity
[00:41:08.620 --> 00:41:10.540]   and would you restore my innocence?
[00:41:10.540 --> 00:41:14.180]   It's a prayer that I still pray to this day.
[00:41:14.180 --> 00:41:16.340]   I'll never claim to be perfect.
[00:41:16.340 --> 00:41:20.100]   I'll never claim to have it all together.
[00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:27.540]   God is still in the business of sanctifying me,
[00:41:27.540 --> 00:41:30.060]   trying to make me look more like Christ.
[00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:33.100]   Maybe that's a prayer you need to pray tonight.
[00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:35.620]   Lord, would you quench my curiosity
[00:41:35.620 --> 00:41:37.020]   and restore my innocence?
[00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:38.540]   God in heaven, we come before you
[00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:42.020]   and we ask that you would do a work that only you can do.
[00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:45.900]   This is not a work of man.
[00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:48.420]   This is a work of you, God.
[00:41:48.420 --> 00:41:53.340]   That you're using
[00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:55.420]   and that you're using it.
[00:41:55.420 --> 00:42:01.100]   All of my past,
[00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:06.700]   all of the present things in my life in spite of me tonight.
[00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:11.620]   And I pray, God, that you would do the same for my friends.
[00:42:11.620 --> 00:42:13.420]   I pray that you would intersect their life
[00:42:13.420 --> 00:42:15.260]   in a powerful way.
[00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:17.620]   In Christ's name we pray, amen.
