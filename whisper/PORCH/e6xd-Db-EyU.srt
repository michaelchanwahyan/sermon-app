1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:23,340
 Come on, come on man.

3
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,380
 I'm so pumped to be with you guys tonight.

4
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,760
 If you're tuning in somewhere online,

5
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,860
 if you're in Fort Worth, Houston, Tulsa, Cedar Rapids,

6
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:33,320
 wherever you're at, we're so glad that you're listening

7
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,680
 and learning from the word of God with us this evening

8
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,280
 as we continue this series, Bad Advice.

9
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,280
 I wanna start by telling you something really awesome

10
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,000
 that you get to do when you get married.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,440
 It's not that, it's not that.

12
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:56,000
 It's called gift registry, okay?

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,640
 There's these really cool things that are called showers

14
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,880
 where people shower you with gifts.

15
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,240
 I know that's really materialistic and superficial

16
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,640
 and worldly, but hang with me, I'm going somewhere.

17
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,000
 And so you get to do this thing

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,920
 called registering for gifts.

19
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,040
 And so you get to pick out these places

20
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,040
 and like container store, you know, wherever you shop, okay?

21
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:19,320
 And so, whatever that is, Magnolia, I don't know,

22
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,160
 wherever you are.

23
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,280
 And so you get, and they give you these guns, right?

24
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,340
 And they're like not guns that shoot things,

25
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:26,640
 but you get to shoot stuff

26
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,860
 and it goes on your registry, right?

27
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,840
 And so Monica and I are going through this routine

28
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,960
 called gift registry or registering for gifts.

29
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,800
 And I'm just kind of shooting everything.

30
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,960
 She's like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

31
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,160
 Hey, don't, we don't need a popcorn popper.

32
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,000
 Like, what are you doing?

33
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,880
 And I'm like, no, no, no.

34
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,040
 Listen, I sit her down, I'm like, hey, you know,

35
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,080
 I'm an idiot, you know, 12 years ago.

36
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,920
 And I'm just like, hey, I got this, okay?

37
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,160
 I got a strategy.

38
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,740
 Let me give you some advice.

39
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:54,720
 We just need to register for everything, okay?

40
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,320
 And then when the wedding comes,

41
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,560
 we can take back whatever we don't want

42
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,520
 and we'll get gift cards.

43
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,000
 And then we can take the gift cards

44
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,960
 and whenever we need something, we're gonna be rich.

45
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,040
 You know, we're gonna be gift card rich

46
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,360
 and we can take the gift cards

47
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,600
 and we can do whatever we want.

48
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,520
 And so that's what I told her.

49
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,080
 So that's what we did, you know,

50
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,160
 and we kind of going through this and we're shooting things

51
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,880
 and we're stacking up the gift registry.

52
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,400
 And so it seemed to work out.

53
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:23,520
 And then just the other day,

54
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,840
 I'm going through drawers and I find the jackpot.

55
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:32,620
 I find this Ziploc bag full of gift cards.

56
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,780
 And I'm like, the plan worked.

57
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,940
 This is what I'm talking, this is why, you know,

58
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,940
 you married me, you lucked out,

59
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,860
 these plans, these strategies.

60
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:44,340
 And then, you know, it's a stack of Dillard's gift cards.

61
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,340
 I'm like, ah, Dillard's, you know,

62
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,140
 not my thing so much anymore, but whatever.

63
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:49,560
 You could buy all kinds of stuff at Dillard's, let's go.

64
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,120
 And so I'm sitting there and I'm thinking, man,

65
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,120
 here, you know, what are we gonna do?

66
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:52,960
 What do we need?

67
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,600
 We could buy this for so-and-so, we can buy this for us,

68
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,000
 we can get clothes, appliances.

69
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,680
 Dillard's kind of has everything.

70
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,360
 We're gonna do this big.

71
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,880
 And so I'm trying to like, okay,

72
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,000
 counting the gift cards, how much money we have.

73
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,840
 And I'm like, you know what?

74
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,840
 I'm just gonna call and make sure that, you know,

75
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,420
 this one's full, we haven't used any of these.

76
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:10,760
 I call and get, let me put, type in the number.

77
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:14,160
 Ah, this gift card is expired.

78
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,400
 What?

79
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,240
 Expired.

80
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,020
 What does that mean?

81
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:26,660
 It means it's worthless.

82
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,460
 It means it's useless.

83
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,860
 There's this thing that I had

84
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:33,620
 that was extremely valuable and useful

85
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,500
 and I can do all of these things with it

86
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,180
 and now it's expired and useless

87
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:40,380
 and I can't do anything with it.

88
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:46,000
 I had given my bride some bad advice, evidently.

89
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,460
 And there's this other bad advice out there

90
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:52,920
 that says life begins when you're married.

91
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,580
 Here's what it looks like.

92
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:56,680
 Maybe someone's told you this.

93
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,740
 It's like, hey, hey, live your life, do what you want, right?

94
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,100
 And then when you're getting married, you can settle down.

95
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,580
 Or maybe you've thought this, like, hey,

96
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:06,100
 right now is your time to go and see the world

97
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,620
 and do things and kind of experience

98
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,940
 everything that is out there.

99
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,140
 And then when you get married,

100
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:14,100
 you can start having like really rich, quiet times

101
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,280
 and family devos and hey, everybody gather around

102
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,420
 and let me teach you the word.

103
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,880
 Like you're just gonna just know it somehow

104
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,160
 when that happens.

105
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,960
 And that's really bad advice.

106
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,440
 Because life doesn't start when you're married.

107
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:31,400
 Life starts when you begin to follow Jesus.

108
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,840
 And singleness, the scripture tells us, is a gift.

109
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,360
 And what I'm telling you this evening,

110
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,760
 as lovingly as I can possibly say to you,

111
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,240
 is it's a gift with an expiration date.

112
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,960
 It's going to expire.

113
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,520
 And in that moment, you don't wanna look back

114
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,400
 and think, man, I wish I would have used

115
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,080
 that gift differently.

116
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,460
 I wish I would have done something else with it.

117
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,600
 When you haven't used something

118
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,160
 and you find out it's expired,

119
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:03,640
 you feel like you just completely wasted the gift.

120
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,000
 And I wanna spare you of that.

121
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,120
 And I know most of you have never married.

122
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,640
 Some of you are here, you're divorced.

123
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,320
 And some of you, you can't even use this gift

124
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,880
 of singleness because you're so distracted

125
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,880
 by your overwhelming desire to be married.

126
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,780
 And I'm not saying that that desire is a bad thing

127
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:26,200
 until it begins to distract you from kingdom building

128
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,480
 and kingdom work and what God wants to do in your life,

129
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,080
 and then it becomes a bad thing.

130
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,120
 We can call it idolatry.

131
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,380
 Others of you, you have no desire to get married

132
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:37,240
 and you're taking this gift of singleness

133
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,080
 and you're wasting it on yourself.

134
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,640
 You're using it in all the wrong ways.

135
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,520
 You've never even given any strategic thought

136
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,320
 to why the Lord might have you single today.

137
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:53,120
 And God's gonna tell us through his Holy Spirit,

138
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,400
 through his word, through the Apostle Paul

139
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,160
 in 1 Corinthians chapter seven.

140
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,840
 Singleness, it's a gift that everyone has at some point,

141
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,200
 but not everyone uses.

142
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,240
 And I hope that changes for those of you

143
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,820
 that are hearing this right now.

144
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,280
 See, if you're a part of the church, and I hope you are,

145
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,560
 I hope you belong to a church,

146
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,660
 that you're in community there, you're contributing there,

147
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:16,280
 you're serving there, you're under the elders there,

148
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:19,480
 then you're a part of the most powerful engine

149
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,840
 that the world has ever seen,

150
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,920
 or you're the engine of the most powerful force

151
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,360
 that the world has ever seen,

152
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:29,260
 which is Jesus's bride, the church.

153
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,980
 And when I think of singles in the church,

154
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:34,120
 I've spent the last decade watching world changers

155
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:38,540
 give their life to Jesus and live a life full of purpose,

156
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,340
 using the gift to honor him.

157
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:43,380
 That's what I wanna call you to from the scriptures today.

158
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:46,560
 But let me give you a couple of disclaimers up front.

159
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,520
 Okay, disclaimer number one.

160
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:51,120
 The church has elevated marriage so much.

161
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,720
 We've spent so much time saying marriage is a good thing,

162
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,320
 it is a good thing, scripture says it's a good thing.

163
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,460
 But we've said that marriage is such a good thing

164
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,160
 so many times over and over and over.

165
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,360
 We've made it sound like singleness is a bad thing.

166
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,240
 And the scripture says singleness is a good thing.

167
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,960
 And so we've elevated marriage

168
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,600
 to the point of confusing you guys, and I'm so sorry.

169
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:15,720
 I mean that, I wanna apologize on behalf of the church,

170
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,960
 the big C church, the worldwide church,

171
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,280
 that we have devalued singles.

172
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,320
 You're so valuable, so valuable to this mission

173
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:29,280
 and this ministry and all that God wants to do.

174
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,920
 Second disclaimer, I'm married.

175
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,800
 And so I know it's like, oh man, another married guy

176
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,240
 telling me how awesome singleness is.

177
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,960
 It's so awesome, why'd you get married?

178
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,720
 And I get that, I get that.

179
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,720
 Let me tell you a couple things.

180
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:46,720
 One, I was a single adult who began to follow Jesus.

181
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,280
 So I remember very much what it was like

182
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,240
 to be single and Christian.

183
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,620
 And I began to, the Holy Spirit began to do a work

184
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:57,120
 in my life calling me to the full deployment

185
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,160
 that the scripture's gonna call us to this evening.

186
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,380
 And the other thing I wanna tell you

187
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,520
 is I've spent the last decade meeting

188
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,800
 with tens of thousands of single people.

189
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,680
 And so I've seen people do this really, really right

190
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,920
 and I've seen people do this really, really wrong.

191
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,640
 And I only have grown convinced

192
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,160
 that those who are doing it right

193
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:17,240
 experience this really beautiful thing of purposeful mission

194
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:21,000
 within the church that I hope to call you to.

195
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,200
 And then the third thing I just wanna say,

196
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,960
 third disclaimer is let's be honest,

197
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,260
 most of you assume you will get married.

198
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:35,360
 Maybe your parents prayed for your spouse,

199
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,680
 your entire life you've kind of seen the Disney movies

200
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,680
 and everything has sat in anticipation

201
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,200
 of one day you'll get married.

202
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,360
 And what that means is the world hasn't prepared you

203
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,320
 for singleness.

204
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:49,780
 You've just assumed that, you've forgotten this category

205
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:54,200
 in the scriptures that is this gift of singleness.

206
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,060
 And so therefore you don't know how to use the gift.

207
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:01,380
 And so life doesn't begin when you're married,

208
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:06,380
 life begins when you start following Jesus Christ

209
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,840
 in full devotion.

210
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,180
 I'm not just like talking about a quiet time in the morning,

211
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:13,380
 I'm talking about full radical followership.

212
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,820
 And so where we're gonna be in 1 Corinthians 7,

213
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:19,340
 we're gonna look at how your single status is a gift,

214
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,620
 how we need to use this gift for another world

215
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,220
 and before you leave here this evening,

216
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:26,840
 I want you to know the reason that God has you single today.

217
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,500
 Paul writes this letter from the town of Ephesus

218
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:33,420
 to the church in Corinth at about 55 AD,

219
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,660
 several things going on.

220
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:37,420
 Nero is emperor and he's turning up the heat

221
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:39,260
 on Christian persecution.

222
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:41,580
 And so he's about to begin to persecute Christians

223
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,180
 to support, Paul anticipates this.

224
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:48,100
 And so he addresses that in this letter to the Corinthians

225
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:51,500
 and something else is going in the city of Corinth

226
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,340
 is there's a temple there to Aphrodite's

227
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:57,340
 and the way that you would worship the goddess Aphrodite's

228
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:59,780
 is you would go and have sex with your choice

229
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,660
 of a thousand temple prostitutes.

230
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:04,140
 So you would go to church and have sex with prostitutes.

231
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:06,100
 And so he's writing into this culture

232
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,940
 that's extremely sexually charged

233
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,100
 and Christians that are converts

234
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,020
 that have come into a relationship with Jesus,

235
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,580
 they've overcorrected something.

236
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:16,260
 They've seen this atrocity and they've said,

237
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,460
 okay, sex with anybody is bad.

238
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,900
 And so Paul writes that in response to their letter,

239
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,300
 he says that no, no, no, no, no,

240
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,940
 you should experience sexual intimacy

241
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,860
 only with your own spouse.

242
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,460
 And according to God's design,

243
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,820
 and then he says in verse seven,

244
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,740
 I wish that all of you were as I am.

245
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,660
 Now what does he mean as I am?

246
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:37,740
 Paul's Facebook status would be single.

247
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:40,940
 He's a single guy saying, hey, I wish you were as I am,

248
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:44,220
 but each of you has your own gift from God.

249
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,420
 One has this gift and another has that.

250
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,680
 Now to the unmarried and the widow,

251
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,260
 I say it is good for them to stay unmarried as I do,

252
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:53,980
 but if they cannot control themselves,

253
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:56,220
 they should marry for it is better to marry

254
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,300
 than to burn with passion.

255
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,300
 What the Holy Spirit through the apostle Paul just did

256
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:03,100
 is that he called his own singleness

257
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:07,420
 and generically, generally speaking singleness, a gift.

258
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:10,900
 A gift, it's the word charisma.

259
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:14,600
 It literally translates a gift given according

260
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,580
 to God's grace.

261
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:18,800
 And so my first point is your single status is a gift.

262
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,520
 Your single status is a gift from God.

263
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:25,940
 And so some of you are like, okay,

264
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:26,780
 what kind of gift?

265
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,100
 Is it a kind of gift that comes with a receipt

266
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,380
 and one that I can exchange for another gift?

267
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,580
 And the problem with that thinking

268
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:34,780
 is that's not seeing it as a gift,

269
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,180
 that's seeing it as a curse.

270
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:39,740
 You've been trained to see it as a curse.

271
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,580
 See, like if you get an invitation,

272
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:44,260
 like if you get a wedding invitation

273
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:48,060
 and you're like mixed of, hey, I'm excited for my friend,

274
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,020
 but I'm more angry it's not me, you know,

275
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,740
 you might have a problem.

276
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:52,980
 You might be seeing it as a curse.

277
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:56,340
 If you see that plus one and you throw it out the window

278
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,500
 because you have no plus one, right?

279
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,940
 You might not be viewing this in the right light

280
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:08,140
 because the essence of seeing something as a God-given gift

281
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:13,140
 is to use that gift, is to understand why you have it.

282
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:17,900
 I think about a friend gave me a Bluetooth speaker

283
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,820
 like that connects to the internet, Sonos Play One.

284
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:23,660
 And I got that and it wasn't anything

285
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,220
 that I was necessarily looking for or asking for,

286
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:30,260
 but I got it, it's amazing, I use it every single day.

287
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:32,380
 And every now and then I'll be using it

288
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,740
 and I'll send him a picture or I'll text him,

289
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,520
 I'm like, hey, thank you so much for this gift.

290
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,420
 The essence of me showing my gratitude for the gift

291
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:43,100
 is that I utilize the gift according to its purpose

292
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,580
 and I can show him that I'm thankful for it.

293
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:49,100
 It's something useful.

294
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:53,260
 It's kind of like platinum status on American Airlines.

295
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:57,820
 It's something that you have that you can use for something.

296
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:02,060
 It does something, you can use it.

297
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:04,340
 What do you use it for?

298
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:06,220
 What do you do with it?

299
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,780
 And so some of you right about now, you're like,

300
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:12,640
 well, how do I know if I have the gift of singleness?

301
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,220
 How do I determine that?

302
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:18,180
 After doing this for over a decade,

303
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,800
 I've learned that I can identify

304
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,180
 if you have the gift of singleness with one question,

305
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:25,020
 100% accuracy.

306
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:28,760
 I can ask you one, every single person listening right now

307
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,700
 is about to find out if they have

308
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,200
 the gift of singleness or not.

309
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,700
 I know you're nervous, okay?

310
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:35,700
 Sad.

311
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,260
 Here's the question, you ready?

312
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:42,540
 Did you wake up this morning single?

313
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:47,900
 And by single, I mean not married.

314
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,060
 Some of you are like, oh no, I'm dating.

315
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,900
 No, did you wake up this morning not married?

316
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:56,820
 If you did, you have the gift of singleness today.

317
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,500
 Then you're like, well, is it a permanent or temporary?

318
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,020
 I don't know, God didn't tell me.

319
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:03,100
 He rarely communicates a five-year plan to us.

320
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,620
 Very rarely does he say,

321
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,980
 here's what I've outlined for your entire life.

322
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:09,000
 Like I think we wanna think that way,

323
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,180
 but it doesn't matter.

324
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,020
 Today you have the gift of singleness.

325
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,120
 How'd you use it today?

326
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:18,340
 How did you steward that gift today?

327
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:21,940
 It's a gift that he entrusted to you today.

328
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:24,500
 And so when you think of gift,

329
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,140
 don't think of like little white box

330
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:29,540
 wrapped up with a bow.

331
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,220
 Think superpower.

332
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:35,580
 Paul has a, think gift like talent,

333
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,780
 like gift, something you can use.

334
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:41,300
 Paul has a gift that he's riding with from this gift.

335
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,380
 It's the same gift that Superman has,

336
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:45,620
 Batman has, and Wonder Woman.

337
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,860
 And Paul couldn't fly.

338
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,800
 It's the gift of singleness.

339
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:53,260
 It's being freed up to do something bigger than himself

340
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:56,480
 that he couldn't do if he was hindered in a different way.

341
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,820
 And he makes it clear,

342
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,140
 marriage is a gift, singleness is a gift,

343
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:02,780
 but he makes it clear that his preferred gift is singleness

344
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:05,960
 even though he realizes that means celibacy.

345
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:09,040
 Because he says it's better to marry

346
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,560
 than to burn with passion.

347
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,260
 If you cannot control themselves, they should marry.

348
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,660
 He doesn't say if they cannot control themselves,

349
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:16,860
 they should play married.

350
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,300
 If they cannot control themselves,

351
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,260
 they should look at pornography.

352
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:21,460
 If they cannot control themselves,

353
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,620
 they should move in together.

354
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:23,460
 He doesn't say that.

355
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,660
 He puts two categories.

356
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:27,260
 He's like, man, there's this amazing gift of singleness

357
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,760
 that comes with celibacy.

358
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:32,460
 And if you just can't handle that,

359
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:35,620
 then you need to be looking toward marriage,

360
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:37,940
 but don't forsake that this is a gift.

361
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:42,820
 Why, why would he prefer the gift of singleness?

362
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:43,660
 Here's why.

363
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:46,540
 Paul was ministry minded.

364
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:50,700
 He wanted to change the world for the sake of Jesus Christ.

365
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,700
 He wanted to give his life,

366
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,620
 he wanted it poured out like a drink offering

367
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,060
 for the sake of the gospel.

368
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:58,260
 And so he's like, man, I wish you were like me

369
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,900
 so that you could run to these cities

370
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,620
 and share the gospel like I do.

371
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:04,900
 I remember when I was,

372
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,160
 so I was raised in the church

373
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,060
 and went to like a Bible study growing up

374
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,460
 and church school for nine years,

375
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:12,660
 church twice a week growing up.

376
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,340
 And then I went to college

377
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:17,980
 and I didn't have any of the maturity

378
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:20,340
 to go with the freedom that college offered me.

379
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:23,540
 And so what that meant for me is it was almost like

380
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:24,780
 as soon as I got to college,

381
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,420
 as soon as my parents left the campus,

382
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:29,620
 I just started running from God as hard and fast as I could.

383
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:30,980
 And what that specifically looked like

384
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:35,380
 is sexual relationships with women and drinking.

385
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:37,140
 It's like I stayed drunk for months

386
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:39,620
 and just constantly looking for the next party

387
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,880
 and whatever drug was there that people were doing,

388
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,300
 I'm like, sure, I'll give that a shot.

389
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,780
 And every single night while doing this,

390
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,140
 like I would say my prayers,

391
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,620
 I'd lay in bed and I'd say my prayers.

392
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:50,060
 I consider myself a Christian.

393
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,880
 And one night I'm in my twin size bed

394
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,540
 on my campus apartment and I'm saying my prayers

395
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:58,700
 and I just start all by myself start weeping, crying.

396
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,760
 And I'm like, God's not listening.

397
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:05,360
 No, he doesn't hear me.

398
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,620
 I have filled my life with all the things

399
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:11,500
 he, a loving father, instructed me to stay away from.

400
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,220
 He's not listening.

401
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,900
 And I woke up the next day and I called a friend

402
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,900
 that I respected because they were successful

403
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:19,660
 and I just started pouring my junk out to them.

404
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:20,860
 Like just confessing like,

405
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:22,940
 here's everything that I've done wrong.

406
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:25,020
 And they're sitting on the other side of the phone

407
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:27,340
 and they say, that's just kind of what you do

408
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:28,340
 when you're single.

409
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:32,060
 They say, you just kind of live your life,

410
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:36,460
 you experience things and then you settle down

411
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:38,820
 and get married and you get right with God.

412
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:43,820
 What a waste of a gift.

413
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:46,460
 And that's why the apostle Paul's calling us

414
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:48,340
 to something different.

415
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:52,820
 It's not just wasting a gift, it really is abusing a gift

416
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:55,860
 when you use it like that on yourself.

417
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,700
 The second reason I think Paul sees his singleness

418
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:00,060
 as a gift is because he trusts the giver.

419
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:03,100
 He knows that God is a good God

420
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:05,000
 that gives good gifts to his children.

421
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,540
 I was at a Christmas gift exchange once

422
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:11,500
 where you draw numbers, you know,

423
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,660
 and then you go in order, like what's that game called?

424
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,500
 White elephant, dirty Santa, whatever.

425
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:20,300
 So we play that game and it's always around it,

426
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,140
 it's always, there's always dysfunction there.

427
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,300
 It's like, what are the rules?

428
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,420
 Is it three steals and frozen?

429
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:28,340
 And that doesn't look like a $15 gift

430
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,180
 and why did you spend $25?

431
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,700
 And why didn't you spend $15?

432
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:32,860
 And there's just dysfunction.

433
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:35,980
 And so we do this and the game's over

434
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:39,940
 and my brother-in-law ends up with this stopwatch

435
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:43,580
 in this old box, it's like in this old box

436
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:46,060
 and he opens it up and it doesn't work.

437
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:49,340
 And he gets a broken stopwatch and he's mad

438
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:51,140
 and I'm like, hey, can I see that?

439
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:52,500
 And he's like, you can have it.

440
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,340
 And I'm like, are you sure?

441
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,900
 He's like, it's a broken stopwatch.

442
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,060
 Yeah, I don't want it.

443
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:59,220
 But I knew his uncle had brought that

444
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:02,840
 and his uncle's a good guy, really nice guy.

445
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,180
 And I just was, my mind was feeling like,

446
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:07,140
 why would his uncle bring a broken stopwatch?

447
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,700
 Like, why would he do that?

448
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:11,140
 And so I went on eBay or I looked it up first

449
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:15,140
 and I found out it's a Tag Heuer limited edition stopwatch

450
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:17,020
 that was used in the Olympics.

451
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:19,860
 And so then I went on eBay and I sold it

452
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,860
 for $150 before I left.

453
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:25,620
 (congregation laughing)

454
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,460
 And that's using a gift.

455
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:30,780
 (congregation laughing)

456
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,460
 And the reason that I was able to do that

457
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:35,580
 is because I was like, man, the giver's good.

458
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,780
 The gift can't be bad.

459
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:40,940
 And so if what you have is not good,

460
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:44,520
 God has not done or your perspective is off.

461
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:47,180
 If what you have is not good,

462
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,860
 then God has not done or your perspective is off.

463
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,420
 Jesus says this in Matthew 7.

464
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:53,980
 He says, the father only gives good gifts to his children.

465
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,260
 James in chapter one says,

466
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:58,980
 "Every good and perfect gift comes down from God above,

467
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:01,520
 "from that father of heavenly lights

468
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,980
 "who doesn't change, he gives us good things."

469
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:08,260
 And so I know that marriage is a metaphor

470
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:10,260
 and teaches us about Christ and the church.

471
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,620
 I know that's a beautiful metaphor.

472
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:14,060
 I love that God gave us that to teach us

473
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:16,260
 about Christ's relationship with the church.

474
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,940
 But you need to know that singleness

475
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,260
 teaches us something too.

476
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:24,660
 Singleness teaches us about the supremacy

477
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,820
 and the sufficiency of Jesus Christ.

478
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,620
 Do you understand what I'm saying?

479
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:33,620
 Singleness teaches the world that Christ is enough.

480
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:38,880
 That if you have Jesus and you can go through this world

481
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,320
 and you can be content, they're like,

482
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,480
 man, that's confusing.

483
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,040
 What's wrong with, don't you want,

484
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,800
 haven't you watched all the shows and this and that?

485
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,120
 And why are you not boy crazy like all the other girls?

486
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,240
 Man, listen, if God has a husband for me, awesome.

487
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:55,240
 But if he doesn't, he's enough.

488
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:58,460
 Singleness teaches us about the supremacy

489
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,840
 and the sufficiency of Jesus.

490
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,560
 Remember Jesus, one who died for all your sins,

491
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:08,320
 one who loved you, the one who God raised from the dead,

492
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,880
 giving you, offering you eternal life with God,

493
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,260
 the gospel, the good news.

494
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,100
 And so what I'm trying to tell you

495
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:18,440
 is the giver of this gift, he is good and he can be trusted.

496
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:22,240
 Back in 28, verse 28, he says,

497
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,480
 "But if you do marry, you have not sinned."

498
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,440
 That's incredible news.

499
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,700
 (congregation laughing)

500
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:31,740
 "And if a virgin marries, she has not sinned.

501
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:34,320
 "But those who marry will face many troubles in this life,

502
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,300
 "and I wanna spare you of this."

503
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,540
 What I mean, brothers and sisters,

504
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:38,740
 is that the time is short.

505
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,880
 "From now on, those who have wives

506
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,860
 "should live as if they do not,

507
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,940
 "and those who mourn as if they did not,

508
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:47,180
 "and those who are happy as if they were not,

509
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,600
 "and those who buy something

510
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,360
 "as if it were not theirs to keep,

511
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,860
 "and those who use things of the world

512
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:55,480
 "as if it not engrossed by them.

513
00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:00,480
 "The world in its present form is passing away."

514
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:05,620
 What?

515
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:08,700
 What does that mean?

516
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,460
 What's he, I mean, that's the most confusing.

517
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:14,500
 Those who are married should live as if they were not,

518
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,340
 mourn as if they did not, those are.

519
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:19,540
 The sentence key to understanding this passage

520
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:22,280
 is where he says there at the end.

521
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:28,040
 The world in its present form is passing away.

522
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,060
 And so, how he began,

523
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:31,400
 "I want you to live as though time is short."

524
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:35,300
 The second point from this passage is,

525
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,460
 and I'll explain it,

526
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,760
 is I want you to use your singleness

527
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,100
 to live for another world.

528
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:43,360
 Use the gift of singleness to live for another world.

529
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,480
 You've seen the narrative, Superman, Wonder Woman,

530
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:48,820
 they come from another place down to the world,

531
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:49,880
 and they're on this mission,

532
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,240
 they're trying to accomplish something here,

533
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:54,320
 they're fighting evil, and they're doing something good

534
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,260
 for the betterment of humanity.

535
00:22:56,260 --> 00:23:02,120
 I want you to use this gift for another world,

536
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,680
 because the world that we currently live in,

537
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:08,240
 it's passing away, and the priorities of this world,

538
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,880
 they're passing away, and the priorities of heaven

539
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,720
 are different than the priorities of this world,

540
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,400
 and our time on earth, it's very short.

541
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,840
 So if you mourn, and it's okay to mourn,

542
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,680
 it's okay to be sad, but if you do,

543
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:23,040
 do not mourn like those who do not have hope.

544
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:26,640
 You mourn differently than the world.

545
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,600
 And if you're happy, great, so good to be happy,

546
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,680
 it's fun to be happy, happiness is good,

547
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:38,320
 but happiness is a glimpse of the eternal joy.

548
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:42,920
 It's a tiny, short snippet of a commercial

549
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,140
 of the eternal joy that God has for us.

550
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:48,400
 So don't be happy like it's the ultimate happiness.

551
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,160
 It's not, it's fleeting happiness.

552
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,520
 It's short, temporary happiness.

553
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,740
 There's an eternal joy waiting for you.

554
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:59,040
 Let this happiness remind you of this.

555
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:03,320
 And if you buy stuff, it's okay to buy stuff,

556
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,760
 things you need, things you don't need that you can enjoy.

557
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,840
 A Bluetooth speaker, it's okay.

558
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:13,200
 But just know that rust and moth are gonna destroy that.

559
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,900
 The only thing that lasts forever is God,

560
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,140
 His people, and His word.

561
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:19,840
 They're those things that you buy,

562
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,220
 they're not the things of eternity, just know

563
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:26,540
 they're temporary things that you can enjoy in this earth,

564
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:28,640
 and so you've gotta realign yourself

565
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,940
 with the priorities of heaven.

566
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:32,220
 And so he says, if you're married,

567
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,960
 live as though you're not married.

568
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,160
 He's saying something really key here.

569
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,980
 Understand, listen, listen,

570
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:40,160
 understand there's an eternal family.

571
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:43,740
 Some of you, you love your family.

572
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,540
 You love to go home and holidays

573
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:48,420
 and be with them and the nostalgia, and that's fine.

574
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:50,420
 But look around you right now

575
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:52,960
 and learn to love the people around you right now

576
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,540
 because those that have trusted in Christ,

577
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:58,060
 death and resurrection for the forgiveness of their sins,

578
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,960
 you're gonna be with them forever.

579
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:03,180
 Forever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever

580
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,700
 and that's your family.

581
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:07,500
 There's this understanding and expectation

582
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,700
 that you would belong to a church

583
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:13,420
 and it would have this familial vibe.

584
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:16,660
 Like you would go to church and be like,

585
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:18,100
 man, I'm with my family right now,

586
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,540
 my brothers and sisters,

587
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:22,300
 the ones I'm gonna be with forever.

588
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:27,340
 Because you know what you won't be in heaven?

589
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:29,420
 Married.

590
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:33,660
 Jesus says that in Matthew 22.

591
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:37,420
 No one is married or given in marriage in heaven.

592
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:38,900
 Some of you, you're here tonight

593
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:42,780
 and you're afraid that you're gonna be single forever.

594
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:44,180
 And can I tell you something?

595
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:45,940
 You will be.

596
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:48,420
 Forever.

597
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:52,860
 Forever and ever and ever and ever.

598
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:55,300
 A billion years from now, you're gonna be single.

599
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:58,860
 Six billion years from now, still single.

600
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:02,460
 You're gonna be single forever.

601
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:07,860
 So why not figure out how to be single well right now?

602
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:11,180
 Remember when they came to Jesus and they said,

603
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:13,420
 hey, Jesus, yo, your mom's here.

604
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:15,300
 I don't know if they say yo,

605
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,540
 but they say, hey, your mom's here.

606
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:18,380
 And he's like, my mom?

607
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:19,220
 He's like confused by it.

608
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:21,100
 He's like, my mom's here.

609
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,220
 Oh man, don't you know?

610
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:26,180
 Like those who do the will of my father

611
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:29,780
 or my mother, brothers, sisters.

612
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:33,020
 Hey guys, these are my family.

613
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:33,980
 The ones who know me,

614
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:37,300
 these are the ones I'm gonna be with in eternity.

615
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:40,660
 You met my earthly mom, okay, yeah.

616
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:42,060
 This is my family here.

617
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:45,220
 And so don't make marriage your idol.

618
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:46,820
 Don't make any relationship an idol.

619
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:48,700
 I know Proverbs 18, 22.

620
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:51,140
 I know the scripture says that marriage is good.

621
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,260
 I get it, marriage is good,

622
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:54,980
 but it doesn't mean that not being married is bad.

623
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:58,940
 In fact, God clearly says here it's good.

624
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:03,820
 And if you disagree with that, you disagree with God.

625
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:05,780
 And Paul goes as far as to say,

626
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:07,420
 with marriage comes trouble.

627
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:10,500
 Marriage comes trouble.

628
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,620
 So many of my single friends think

629
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:14,860
 that all their problems will be solved

630
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:16,100
 if they just got married.

631
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,540
 And you're right to laugh at that,

632
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:20,340
 'cause it's silly.

633
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:22,740
 What happens when you get married

634
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:24,700
 is all your problems grow, they double.

635
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:29,380
 And in fact, I've done marriage counseling for a while now.

636
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:31,260
 I've never met anyone with marriage problems.

637
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:33,420
 I've only met people with single people problems

638
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,620
 that they brought into marriage

639
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:37,840
 and they just grow and expand and multiply.

640
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:41,180
 And you think, ah, okay, well, it can't be.

641
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:43,140
 Like, let's just compare some things real quick.

642
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:46,780
 Let's compare you going to Chipotle

643
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:48,140
 with me going to Chipotle.

644
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:51,340
 You can eat at Chipotle for $8.

645
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:54,860
 We go to Chipotle and it's $40.

646
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:57,500
 Every time we go.

647
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,820
 It's five of us.

648
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:02,540
 Three meals a day, figure that out.

649
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:03,460
 You do the math.

650
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:06,100
 And tithe.

651
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,540
 I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

652
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:08,580
 I'm just joking.

653
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:09,420
 That was a joke.

654
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:13,260
 Let's compare your church experience to mine.

655
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:15,100
 Right?

656
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:18,220
 You come to church, you're like, man,

657
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:21,260
 I hate that I gotta park so far away.

658
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:23,860
 You roll out of bed, brush your teeth,

659
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,480
 probably come to church.

660
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:30,500
 We wake up extra early.

661
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,780
 You gotta get three kids fed and clothed.

662
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:35,880
 We get in the car somehow.

663
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,700
 We drive here.

664
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:42,060
 We play a real live game of Frogger in the parking lot,

665
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:46,220
 trying not to lose a child to a Suburban or some other SUV.

666
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:50,060
 We get in the building usually,

667
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:52,980
 and then out of chaos, we check them in.

668
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:54,580
 Usually right about that time I found,

669
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:56,460
 I realized I lost one, okay?

670
00:28:56,460 --> 00:29:00,020
 And then we take my son down here at Green One,

671
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,300
 which is a room down here.

672
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,820
 We take one daughter to the other building upstairs

673
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:06,340
 on the second floor, and then my other daughter

674
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:08,940
 over here near the chapel, okay?

675
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:11,380
 And then we try to get in here before worship starts,

676
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:14,340
 and about that time we're completely stressed,

677
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:15,660
 and my single friends are walking by

678
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:17,260
 with Starbucks and a smile.

679
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:19,820
 (congregation laughing)

680
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:22,640
 Just like, you look stressed, JP.

681
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,460
 Are you stressed, buddy?

682
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:28,020
 Pray for me, you know?

683
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:31,860
 And so it's just different.

684
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:34,420
 And so what he's saying, listen,

685
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:36,500
 what he's saying when he says,

686
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,300
 those who are married should live as though they're not,

687
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,500
 he's really saying this.

688
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:44,500
 He's saying single people should set the pace in the church

689
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:48,420
 of what full devotion to Jesus looks like.

690
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:50,660
 That everybody else in the church

691
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:51,980
 should be looking at you guys like,

692
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:54,060
 man, that's what it's like to be a Christian.

693
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:56,860
 That's what it's like to live radically for Jesus.

694
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,900
 They're just going for it, man.

695
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:01,040
 Like, wow, all our single friends,

696
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,580
 they're just loving God, their life,

697
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:04,380
 it's a full devotion to Jesus,

698
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:07,540
 that you guys should really be setting the pace

699
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:09,820
 of what full devotion looks like,

700
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:12,220
 that you would certainly be in community,

701
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:14,300
 and that you would use the gifts and talents

702
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:16,860
 God gave you to serve him, and use your treasures,

703
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:19,420
 and the money that he's temporarily entrusted to you

704
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:21,180
 to do incredible things with,

705
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:25,500
 that you would set the pace of what full devotion looks like

706
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,380
 because you can.

707
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:27,660
 Think about this for a second, okay?

708
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:30,740
 Imagine if, imagine if I got a fleet of helicopters

709
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:32,700
 outside right now, okay?

710
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,600
 And we just got word from the government in Syria

711
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,860
 that we can get some Christians in there,

712
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:38,980
 but you gotta go right now.

713
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:40,420
 There's this window to get in there,

714
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:44,140
 and they wanna see the nation just turn over in Christianity

715
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:46,220
 and it's a closed country, but if you go,

716
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:48,500
 you're gonna be provided for,

717
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,300
 all your needs are gonna be met,

718
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,200
 your meal, you're gonna have food to eat,

719
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,300
 and you're even going to get paid.

720
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:58,420
 But here's the catch, you've gotta go right now.

721
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:00,300
 There's a short window.

722
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:02,780
 And we can go right now or not at all,

723
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:04,020
 and I'm like, who's in, right?

724
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,260
 Who could go?

725
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:06,640
 Who could go right now?

726
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,340
 Oh, y'all didn't hear me.

727
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:10,460
 Who could go, right?

728
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:11,940
 There's a fleet of helicopters out there.

729
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,220
 Some of you are like, well, I don't know, man,

730
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:14,060
 I gotta ask my mom.

731
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:16,580
 No, you could go right now.

732
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:18,420
 Every single one of you could go.

733
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,260
 You know who couldn't go?

734
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,080
 I couldn't go.

735
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:20,920
 You know why?

736
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,420
 I got soccer practice.

737
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:24,820
 You got, oh, it's Weston has swimming lessons next week,

738
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:27,100
 you know, Finley's doing this thing.

739
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:30,840
 You could go right now.

740
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:35,100
 That's, you can do.

741
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,420
 Some of you shouldn't go.

742
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:41,300
 You know why some of you shouldn't go?

743
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,980
 'Cause you're fully deployed right here.

744
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:45,620
 Some of you are my heroes, man.

745
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:48,140
 I see it all the time.

746
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:51,060
 I think about my friend, one of my heroes, Chital,

747
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:53,180
 she's not married.

748
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:56,700
 She serves with International Justice Mission.

749
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:01,860
 That's a organization that helps end human trafficking

750
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,460
 and sex slavery.

751
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:04,860
 She raises money for them.

752
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:08,580
 She's helped fund five rescue missions

753
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:12,660
 where girls were set free from pimps in other places

754
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:15,640
 where they were abused sexually for profit.

755
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:20,540
 She not only serves here at the port, she leads a team.

756
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:23,540
 She's very successful in corporate America,

757
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:25,320
 but it's just a mission field.

758
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,700
 It's just a place where they pay her

759
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:28,300
 to share the gospel with people.

760
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:32,660
 She's an amazing aunt to her nephews and nieces,

761
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:35,940
 an incredible daughter, has a ministry to her family.

762
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:37,540
 She's just going for it.

763
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:40,020
 I think about my buddy Mo, man.

764
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:44,620
 I remember when the earthquake hit Haiti,

765
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:47,660
 he grabbed a backpack and went to the airport.

766
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:49,580
 He's like, I'm going, man, they need, people are dying,

767
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:52,100
 they need me, I'm gonna go there armed with a gospel

768
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,380
 and whatever I can do.

769
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:54,840
 And he just went, I bumped into him the other day,

770
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,940
 he said, Mo, where have you been lately?

771
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:57,780
 What have you been doing?

772
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:58,600
 This is what he said.

773
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,700
 Well, I went to Northern Uganda.

774
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,220
 I was helping to rebuild an economy

775
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:02,360
 with other single friends.

776
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,380
 I went to Ethiopia.

777
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:05,180
 I was sharing the gospel with Muslims.

778
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,800
 I went to South Sudan.

779
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:09,520
 I was helping those impacted by war heal with Christ.

780
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,740
 Oh, I went to Northern Iraq.

781
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:12,540
 I was working for Samaritan's Purse there.

782
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:14,440
 I went to Jordan, Turkey, Iran.

783
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,120
 I was documenting refugee camps,

784
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,860
 loving, serving, sharing the gospel.

785
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:19,060
 I went to the Congo.

786
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:21,400
 I was helping people recover from war

787
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,180
 and sharing the gospel.

788
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:25,520
 It's hard to do that when you're married.

789
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,560
 And some of you are like, well, that's cool.

790
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,400
 He's a missionary.

791
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,240
 No, he's not, he's employed here in Dallas.

792
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,400
 He's just going for it.

793
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:36,280
 He's just saying, hey, God, what do you want me to do?

794
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,120
 Or you want me to go?

795
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,480
 I remember when I became a Christian,

796
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,200
 I mean, just like on fire for Jesus,

797
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,200
 new eyes to see the world, new lens to see the world.

798
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,480
 I went to Africa, had this incredible opportunity

799
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,620
 to teach the government there

800
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:53,060
 on conflict resolution in Rwanda.

801
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:56,040
 Went to Haiti, served in orphanages,

802
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,960
 went in the mountains, went in the city,

803
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:01,940
 went in rural areas, went into the Amazon, to Brazil,

804
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:05,280
 got on the Amazon River, six days down the river on a boat,

805
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:09,600
 got off in remote villages, sharing the gospel with people,

806
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:12,480
 playing soccer with kids and having Sunday school

807
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,880
 and just teaching the Bible.

808
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,280
 And we got married and family grew.

809
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,240
 I haven't gone anywhere like that.

810
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:21,080
 I went to Haiti one time, had to abbreviate the trip

811
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,220
 'cause there was like a soccer tournament

812
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:23,320
 or something back here.

813
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,360
 Had to come back early.

814
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:28,820
 Guys, how are you using your gift?

815
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:32,600
 You got an incredible gift today.

816
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,800
 How are you using it?

817
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,920
 What are you doing with this?

818
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,120
 And I'm not just, I don't want you to leave here

819
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,440
 and like go and get on orbits

820
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,720
 and just start booking plane tickets.

821
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,620
 It's not about that, right?

822
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:47,760
 I think of people who just serve faithfully

823
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,040
 in our kids' ministries, their moms and dads,

824
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:53,140
 to hundreds of kids as they sit

825
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:55,700
 and they learn the scriptures and they teach the scriptures.

826
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:58,180
 They visit people in hospitals.

827
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,460
 They care for the sick.

828
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:02,720
 They use their time to lead community groups

829
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:03,580
 and serve others.

830
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:05,380
 Like it's just everyday faithfulness,

831
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:07,340
 long obedience in the same direction.

832
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:08,320
 They're my heroes.

833
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,820
 They're my heroes like Mother Teresa.

834
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:12,880
 Think about what she did, never married,

835
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,580
 but gave her life to serving lepers in Calcutta.

836
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:18,180
 Amy Carmichael, who opened an orphanage

837
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:20,400
 and founded a mission in India.

838
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,760
 I think of Corey Timboom,

839
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,480
 who helped the Jews escape the Holocaust.

840
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,600
 None of these people were married.

841
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,000
 I think of Dietrich Bonhoeffer,

842
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,480
 who sought to save the world from Nazi Germany

843
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,600
 and Hitler's regime.

844
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,280
 And he began to recruit people.

845
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,160
 And one of the requirements to be on his team

846
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,700
 is you had to be single.

847
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:38,480
 You had to be single.

848
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:42,840
 I think of C.S. Lewis most of his life

849
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:46,120
 and so many others, a long list of heroes

850
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,600
 with an extraordinary gift.

851
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,240
 And why I say this, friends,

852
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,560
 is because if you're here

853
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,740
 and you're using your singleness,

854
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:54,300
 if you're listening to me right now

855
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:57,060
 and you're using your singleness

856
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:59,520
 in full devotion to Christ to build the kingdom,

857
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,960
 you are my hero.

858
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:06,400
 I'm so thankful for the way you steward your life

859
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,040
 and you steward your God-given gift

860
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,500
 and you're making a difference.

861
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,600
 Keep going, friend.

862
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:14,360
 And if you're here

863
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:21,320
 and you're using your singleness

864
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,880
 to look for the next party

865
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,620
 or the next lay

866
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:30,720
 or to try to make a million dollars before you're 30

867
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:34,400
 or to seek the next codependent relationship,

868
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,860
 you're wasting a gift.

869
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:39,380
 You need to know that.

870
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:41,180
 It's like that guy who gave me that Bluetooth speaker.

871
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,480
 If I never plugged it in

872
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,560
 and I just used it as a paperweight,

873
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,220
 it wasn't meant for that.

874
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:49,160
 I can do so much more than that.

875
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:51,360
 You're squandering a gift.

876
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:54,800
 And if you're here and the world has taught you

877
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,820
 that you're not complete until you're married,

878
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:57,860
 I want you to know something.

879
00:36:57,860 --> 00:37:00,140
 You're complete in Jesus Christ.

880
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:03,380
 I mean, can you think of a more complete person

881
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:05,740
 than Jesus Christ, who was single, by the way?

882
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:09,020
 Complete.

883
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:11,520
 Who's gonna look at Jesus and call him incomplete?

884
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:15,720
 You are complete, or at least you can be.

885
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:18,320
 In Jesus Christ, verse 32.

886
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:22,240
 I would like you to be free from concern, he says.

887
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,560
 An unmarried man is concerned about the Lord's affairs,

888
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,920
 how he can please the Lord.

889
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,660
 But a married man is concerned about the affairs

890
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:29,600
 of this world, how he can please his wife.

891
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,740
 And his interests are divided.

892
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:33,600
 An unmarried woman or virgin is concerned

893
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,600
 about the Lord's affairs.

894
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,840
 Her aim is to be devoted to the Lord

895
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,800
 in both body and spirit.

896
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,240
 But a married woman is concerned

897
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,880
 about the affairs of this world,

898
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:44,040
 how she can please her husband.

899
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,300
 I'm saying this for your own good,

900
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:48,400
 not to restrict you, but that you may live

901
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:53,280
 in a right way, in undivided devotion to the Lord.

902
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,840
 The third and final point is simply this.

903
00:37:56,840 --> 00:38:00,120
 God has a purpose for your singleness.

904
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,800
 And let me say it like this.

905
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,720
 There's a reason you're single.

906
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,320
 You're single for a reason.

907
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,700
 And it's not because you're too flirty,

908
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:11,840
 or you come on too strong, or you don't make enough,

909
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,400
 all that might be true.

910
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:19,000
 But that's not the God-given reason that you're single.

911
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,560
 It's not that you don't make enough money,

912
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,420
 or you don't do CrossFit enough,

913
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:23,880
 or you don't have the right job,

914
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,240
 or you don't dress well enough,

915
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,920
 or you have bad breath or BO.

916
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,620
 It's not any of those things.

917
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:32,920
 It's that God desires you to use you

918
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:35,240
 in a unique way in this season of your life,

919
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:38,640
 that you might give it in full devotion to Jesus.

920
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,940
 What do you think full devotion looks like?

921
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:44,280
 I want you to think about that.

922
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,120
 Like even ask yourself right now,

923
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:51,300
 am I living a life in full devotion to Jesus?

924
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:54,280
 Here's what it's not.

925
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:57,480
 It's not lukewarm, it's not church on Sundays,

926
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,880
 it's not, well, I read the Bible

927
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,120
 for 15 minutes in the morning.

928
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:02,160
 It's not any of those things.

929
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,760
 What's full devotion?

930
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:09,160
 But that's the reason that you're single.

931
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:11,540
 Undivided devotion to the Lord, it says.

932
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,880
 This is the great time to fill your heart with scriptures,

933
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:18,760
 to learn his truth, to belong to a church,

934
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:21,800
 to begin to foster that church family.

935
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:24,800
 And so some of you, like lest you think

936
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,460
 that Paul was just bitter.

937
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:27,920
 Like it's like reading this, it's like,

938
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,320
 yeah, but it's just one chapter,

939
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,240
 and what does that even mean?

940
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,160
 And maybe Paul was just mad,

941
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,480
 and he wanted the whole world to be single,

942
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,000
 and so the Holy Spirit kind of turned around,

943
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,160
 and he just started writing real fast.

944
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,720
 I mean, is that what happened here?

945
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,880
 Lest you think that, I want you to know,

946
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,720
 all Paul's doing is expounding

947
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:44,160
 on the teachings of Jesus Christ.

948
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:47,640
 This is simply a commentary on Matthew 19,

949
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,080
 where Jesus, I don't know if you know

950
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,440
 what's going on in Matthew 19,

951
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:53,160
 but they're like, hey, Jesus, hey, when can we get divorced?

952
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,180
 And Jesus is like, divorce?

953
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:55,360
 Listen, marriage is permanent.

954
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,120
 And they're like, what do you mean permanent?

955
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:02,120
 And he's like, like, you don't get out of it, permanent.

956
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:04,480
 And they're like, like, permanent, permanent?

957
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,680
 He's like, yeah, permanent.

958
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:09,420
 And they're like, well, if that's true,

959
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:12,920
 like, if it's that permanent, like in the earth permanent,

960
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:15,020
 then why would anybody get married?

961
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:17,960
 That just seems like it really limits your options.

962
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:21,120
 And he says this, Jesus replied,

963
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:23,280
 not everyone can accept this word,

964
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,160
 but only those to whom it has been given,

965
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,640
 for there are eunuchs who were born that way.

966
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,600
 What's a eunuch?

967
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:32,880
 It's where we get the word unicorn.

968
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,440
 No, it's not that, I'm kidding.

969
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,280
 (congregation laughing)

970
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:40,280
 A eunuch is a person who sexual organs are not there.

971
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:43,660
 They do not have sexual organs, reproductive organs.

972
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:47,060
 And so for there are eunuchs who were born that way,

973
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:50,640
 and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by others.

974
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,660
 That's a really sad situation.

975
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:55,620
 Let's just acknowledge that.

976
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:58,780
 And then there are those who choose to live like eunuchs.

977
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:00,820
 Okay, now what does that mean?

978
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:02,140
 Let me just say this.

979
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:05,520
 Then there are those who choose to live celibate lives

980
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,100
 for the sake of the kingdom of heaven.

981
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:10,200
 And then he says this really crazy thing.

982
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,640
 The one who can accept this should accept it.

983
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:15,300
 Why have we read our Bibles like this isn't in there?

984
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:18,600
 It's right there, it's the words of Jesus Christ.

985
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:22,900
 He says that, that there are those who live celibate lives

986
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:27,340
 to focus on undivided devotion to the Lord,

987
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:29,720
 for the sake of the kingdom of heaven.

988
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:32,880
 And so that life begins when you're married,

989
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,680
 it's really bad advice.

990
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:36,780
 Life starts when you begin to live

991
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:39,140
 in undivided devotion to Jesus.

992
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:41,860
 When you begin to kingdom build,

993
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:44,880
 when you have a new mind and you begin to see and realize,

994
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,120
 like, whoa, I have these gifts given to me by God for God,

995
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:50,880
 and I can do incredible things with them, like superpowers,

996
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,840
 and I can use my time for him.

997
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:55,840
 And all of a sudden people's eternity can be changed.

998
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,960
 And it's not this kind of lukewarm, sad,

999
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,160
 like, hey, church on Sunday.

1000
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,440
 It's an all in, it's radical, it's not lukewarm,

1001
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,800
 it's on fire, it's full devotion.

1002
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:07,320
 It's that the whole kind of trajectory of my being

1003
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,400
 and my thoughts and everything that I do

1004
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,080
 is about Jesus Christ.

1005
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:14,320
 That that's why I would live.

1006
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:17,260
 That when I go to work tomorrow,

1007
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:20,560
 I've got Jesus on the forefront of my mind.

1008
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:24,000
 That I understand that heaven and hell are at stake.

1009
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,280
 And there's kingdom, there's a kingdom to be built

1010
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,400
 that will last forever.

1011
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:30,200
 The things that I see here, they won't last forever.

1012
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:36,400
 Except God and his word and the souls of people.

1013
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,220
 So I got work to do.

1014
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:44,320
 We have work to do.

1015
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:48,740
 I wasted my gift for a long time.

1016
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:51,480
 I listened to the advice of that friend.

1017
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,920
 I'd hit the bars and the clubs and work hard.

1018
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,880
 It was like wash, rinse, repeat, you know,

1019
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,520
 'cause sin robs you of creativity.

1020
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:00,000
 I've said that before, it really does.

1021
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,160
 Like I would dream about like,

1022
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:03,560
 I'm gonna backpack through Europe one day,

1023
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:06,440
 but tonight let's go to the bar and get wasted.

1024
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:07,440
 'Cause that's life.

1025
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,960
 And you wake up from that bad dream one day

1026
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:12,360
 and you're like, really, wow, I wasted my life.

1027
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:15,840
 That must be why they call it wasted, you know?

1028
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:16,840
 Wasted my life.

1029
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:19,160
 A lot of bar tabs.

1030
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:24,400
 And I was at a bar one time and somebody invited me to church

1031
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,160
 and I sat in the back row hungover.

1032
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:29,640
 And I started wrestling with who is this Jesus character?

1033
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:30,880
 All my life I had heard about him.

1034
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,560
 I even said that I believed in him.

1035
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,640
 But until I gave my life to him,

1036
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:40,880
 only then did I find purpose and meaning in life.

1037
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:43,080
 And my life began before I met my wife

1038
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:44,720
 or before I married my bride.

1039
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:49,640
 When I was in right relationship to Jesus,

1040
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:51,520
 that's when life started.

1041
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,980
 And some of you, you're here and you're like,

1042
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:56,320
 I'm just gonna struggle, man, until I'm married.

1043
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:59,500
 It's okay to wanna be married.

1044
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:03,640
 It's not okay when that becomes a distraction

1045
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:04,760
 from your purpose.

1046
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:06,720
 And so if you're here and you're like,

1047
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:10,040
 man, I'm gonna struggle with porn until I'm married.

1048
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:13,120
 When you get married, you'll be what you call an adulterer.

1049
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:17,520
 And some of you are like, well, man, I'm just, you know,

1050
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:21,360
 I'm gonna struggle until I'm married.

1051
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:23,240
 I'm gonna party until I'm married.

1052
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:26,780
 In marriage, you're called an alcoholic.

1053
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:30,420
 And some of you are like, well, I'm just gonna date around

1054
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:31,260
 until I'm married, man.

1055
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:33,480
 I'm just gonna keep dating around until I'm married.

1056
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,280
 In marriage, you're called divorced.

1057
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:39,100
 You're training for something, see?

1058
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:43,960
 You're gonna do more of then what you do now.

1059
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:48,020
 And so why not live full devotion right now?

1060
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:52,560
 In summary, see your single status as a gift.

1061
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:55,700
 Use it to live for another world

1062
00:44:55,700 --> 00:45:01,500
 and understand God's purpose in this gift.

1063
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:09,700
 I found identity in relationships my entire life

1064
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:15,060
 until I found the one relationship that mattered most.

1065
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:16,620
 The other day, my four-year-old,

1066
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:18,740
 his name is Weston, he's a really cute kid.

1067
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:21,320
 He comes home from preschool.

1068
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:25,620
 And he says this, he's funny, he just says funny things.

1069
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:27,740
 He's like, "Daddy, we gotta talk."

1070
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:29,300
 And I'm like, "Okay."

1071
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:31,000
 He's like, "No, no, no, sit down."

1072
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:31,980
 (congregation laughing)

1073
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:32,940
 "All right."

1074
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:35,860
 I sit down and he like looks at me real serious.

1075
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:39,540
 He's like, "Daddy, I'm gonna marry Isabella."

1076
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:42,280
 (congregation laughing)

1077
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:43,620
 And I'm like, "How much you wanna bet?"

1078
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:44,460
 You know?

1079
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:47,500
 And just think about how ridiculous it would be

1080
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:49,260
 like if I just was like, "Man, really?

1081
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:50,580
 "No, we should get on planning that."

1082
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:51,420
 You know?

1083
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:54,220
 And let's talk about that.

1084
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:55,940
 And just 'cause it would,

1085
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:57,380
 think about how much of his life

1086
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:58,860
 would be wasted on that reality.

1087
00:45:58,860 --> 00:45:59,920
 He's four years old.

1088
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:02,080
 Think about your own life

1089
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:04,260
 and how many relationships you've been in and out of.

1090
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:05,220
 Not just relationships,

1091
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:07,900
 think about how much community group time you've gathered.

1092
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:09,020
 And he's like, "The Bible's there,

1093
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:10,700
 "but wait, wait, wait, let me tell you about this date.

1094
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:11,540
 "Let me tell you what I did, let me tell you what I did.

1095
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:12,360
 "Let me tell you what I did, let me tell you what I did.

1096
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:14,260
 "I met this girl, I met this girl."

1097
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:18,820
 Think about how much time you've wasted.

1098
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:21,860
 See, laying in bed, controlling your emotions,

1099
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:25,000
 up and down and up and down and highs and lows,

1100
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,980
 back and forth, just constantly obsessing

1101
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:31,260
 about relationships and the opposite sex.

1102
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:34,140
 It's okay to desire to be married.

1103
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:35,940
 One day you probably will be.

1104
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:40,940
 But don't let it rob you of your purpose right now.

1105
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:42,900
 Here's why I tell you that.

1106
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:46,140
 Did you know that people don't even know if,

1107
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:48,420
 scholars don't know if Paul was ever married.

1108
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:52,220
 And the majority of biblical scholarship

1109
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:54,680
 believes that he was married at some point.

1110
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:56,420
 We know right here he was single,

1111
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:58,860
 but that maybe his wife had died or something had happened.

1112
00:46:58,860 --> 00:47:00,460
 That's what a lot of people think.

1113
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:03,440
 But the reason we don't know is because of all the letters

1114
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:06,220
 and all the things that we have perfectly preserved

1115
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:10,300
 from the Apostle Paul that he wrote, none of them tell us.

1116
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:11,140
 Why?

1117
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:13,980
 Because there was another relationship to him

1118
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:15,220
 that he saw as ultimate.

1119
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:19,140
 And you got this book, it's all about relationships,

1120
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:20,820
 but the ones that are about marriage,

1121
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:24,260
 it's like maybe that much, it's about another relationship.

1122
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:27,580
 And what I'm trying to tell you is everybody here,

1123
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:31,340
 one day, much sooner than you think, you're going to die.

1124
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:35,340
 And you're gonna meet Jesus face to face.

1125
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:38,700
 And in that moment, it's going to be this sober reality

1126
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:41,780
 of what relationship mattered most.

1127
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:46,060
 You're like, oh, it's Jesus, you mattered most.

1128
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:47,980
 I wish I could live, I don't know if there's regrets there.

1129
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:49,260
 I doubt there is, but if there were,

1130
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:51,980
 it'd be like, I wish I could live every other relationship

1131
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:54,900
 in light of this relationship

1132
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:56,580
 that I would have lived radically

1133
00:47:56,580 --> 00:47:57,620
 and completely sold out for you

1134
00:47:57,620 --> 00:47:59,020
 'cause I'm gonna be with you forever and ever and ever

1135
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:01,020
 and ever and ever and ever and ever now.

1136
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:03,700
 And that was really just training

1137
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:06,500
 for being with you forever and ever and ever and ever now.

1138
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:10,180
 And what's not gonna happen, none of you, nobody,

1139
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:12,860
 I promise, not one of you is gonna be like,

1140
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:15,620
 yo, Jesus, what was up with that, man?

1141
00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:19,500
 You didn't want me to get married or what?

1142
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:21,500
 Like you didn't want some dude to cross my path

1143
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:22,580
 or some girl to cross my, like,

1144
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:24,820
 why did you keep me single?

1145
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:29,100
 Jesus, did you not realize I was 33 years old and single?

1146
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:32,380
 He's just gonna be like, I can relate.

1147
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:33,460
 So was I, you know?

1148
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:34,380
 (congregation laughing)

1149
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:37,300
 Right, I mean, nobody's gonna say that.

1150
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:40,220
 Nobody's gonna say that.

1151
00:48:40,220 --> 00:48:44,460
 And if that relationship is gonna matter most then,

1152
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:47,060
 why does it not matter most now?

1153
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:51,100
 In the same way, I remember, like,

1154
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:53,580
 in not even the same way, it's a silly illustration,

1155
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:58,180
 but similarly, when that automated 800 number said,

1156
00:48:58,180 --> 00:49:00,140
 I'm sorry, this gift card is expired,

1157
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:02,020
 that's what's gonna happen.

1158
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:04,820
 I do, I do, season expired.

1159
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:07,620
 It's done, how'd you use it?

1160
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:11,500
 What did you do with it?

1161
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:14,420
 Whose lives were changed because of it?

1162
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:16,100
 Who was free because of it?

1163
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:19,820
 What is there because of it?

1164
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:22,580
 What kingdom's been built because of it?

1165
00:49:22,580 --> 00:49:25,740
 It's gone now, it's expired, how'd you use it?

1166
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:26,980
 Let me pray you'd use it.

1167
00:49:26,980 --> 00:49:29,380
 And Father, thank you so much

1168
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:31,420
 just for the words of your servant, Paul,

1169
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:36,380
 for the gospel, for your son, Jesus Christ,

1170
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:38,700
 who died on a cross for our sins,

1171
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:42,420
 who was complete in every way, God.

1172
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:46,900
 Father, help us not to listen to the lies of this world.

1173
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:50,140
 Father, for my friends here that desire marriage,

1174
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:53,460
 I pray that you would bring a God-fearing person

1175
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:55,500
 into their lives in your perfect timing,

1176
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:56,980
 and until that moment, Lord,

1177
00:49:56,980 --> 00:49:58,900
 that you would align their hearts with your will,

1178
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:01,220
 that they would live completely

1179
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:03,380
 and radically unleashed for you.

1180
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:06,300
 And Father, for those that can't sleep at night,

1181
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:08,420
 they're wrestling because they think about

1182
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:10,140
 just wanting that so bad,

1183
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:11,860
 and they feel like I haven't even been on a date,

1184
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:13,740
 or all I date is losers, or whatever.

1185
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:16,820
 The lie is, God, that you would just replace that lie

1186
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:18,700
 with truth, that you're enough.

1187
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:24,420
 God, would you convince us that you're enough,

1188
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:28,460
 and help us to walk that fine line of wanting a spouse

1189
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:30,580
 and even looking for a spouse,

1190
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:33,780
 but not idolizing marriage,

1191
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:37,580
 and not missing out on using the gift of our singleness?

1192
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:39,860
 Father, thank you for this ministry,

1193
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:41,460
 and all that you've done through it,

1194
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:42,700
 and all that you're doing through it.

1195
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:44,500
 Would you just continue, that's all we ask.

1196
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:47,700
 Would you just continue to do what you do in spite of us?

1197
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:53,060
 In Christ's beautiful, amazing name, amen.

1198
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:57,140
 In Christ's beautiful, amazing name, amen.

1199
00:50:57,140 --> 00:50:59,140
