1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 And I thought about you guys tonight,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,340
 and the verse where we're headed,

3
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:06,300
 and just all of those songs that we just sang,

4
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:07,220
 the way that we worship.

5
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:09,800
 See, you're here tonight, and I want you to know

6
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,140
 with the rest of your life, you're gonna build some things.

7
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,100
 You really are, you're gonna build some things.

8
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,760
 You're gonna build a career, okay?

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,300
 You may build a house one day.

10
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,420
 You're gonna build relationships, alright?

11
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,180
 You're gonna build an image of yourself,

12
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:27,800
 like when you think of you, you identify yourself

13
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,500
 with some things, maybe I'm the cool guy, the surfer guy,

14
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,540
 maybe I'm the trendy girl, or maybe I'm the smart girl,

15
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,420
 or the engineer, or whatever it is

16
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:37,620
 that you kind of identify yourself with.

17
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,920
 Maybe I'm the skater, right?

18
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,020
 And the reality of it is, is what the Lord

19
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:46,180
 didn't build in and through you, it's not gonna last.

20
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:48,340
 When Christmas comes, it's thrown out.

21
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:52,760
 You get that?

22
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,660
 Like when Jesus comes back,

23
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:57,580
 those things that God didn't do in and through you,

24
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:58,780
 the things that you held onto,

25
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:01,340
 the things that you didn't let go of,

26
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:02,800
 the things that you tried to control,

27
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,460
 the things that were a lot of you and not a lot of him,

28
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:07,740
 that's not going to last.

29
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,980
 It's vanity, it's meaningless, the scriptures say.

30
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:15,020
 And so I fear for us that we're gonna get up there

31
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:16,900
 and this conversation is gonna look like this.

32
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,380
 We're gonna stand there with God

33
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:20,780
 and we're gonna be in heaven, praise God,

34
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:23,180
 and by his grace, and we're standing there with him,

35
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:24,900
 and I don't know if this will happen this way,

36
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,860
 but we'll be like, hey God, remember when we,

37
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:29,260
 and he's like, no, that wasn't we, that was you.

38
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:33,700
 No, remember when we did that thing and it was good thing,

39
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,780
 remember when we served the poor,

40
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:37,380
 remember when I went to that job,

41
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,820
 remember when we did that,

42
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,660
 he's like, no, that wasn't, that wasn't,

43
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,220
 I was actually telling you to do something else,

44
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:43,260
 you weren't listening.

45
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:47,260
 No, I was actually calling you to some other thing,

46
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:48,860
 but you weren't tracking with me.

47
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:52,220
 No, I think you had good intentions,

48
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:53,860
 yeah, you got all fired up, you read a verse,

49
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:56,500
 you heard a sermon, but you weren't listening to me.

50
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,820
 That was about you, let's be honest,

51
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,100
 that was about you, here you are, you're here,

52
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,020
 well done, good and faithful servant,

53
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:06,380
 but that wasn't, that wasn't me, that was you.

54
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:10,780
 And so tonight I just thought about this one verse,

55
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:13,220
 it's not even a whole verse, it's really just a half a verse,

56
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:17,660
 it's Psalm 127, one, and when I got with our team,

57
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,380
 our young adult team, and we thought about the vision

58
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,460
 of the poor and what God would have for us,

59
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,340
 we thought about this verse, which is,

60
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,820
 it's a real simple idea, it says,

61
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:28,300
 unless the Lord builds the house,

62
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:31,340
 its builders labor in vain.

63
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:34,580
 And so I wanted to spend a short time with you,

64
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:35,820
 and then we're gonna be back to worship,

65
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,740
 I wanna spend a short time with you tonight

66
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:41,020
 just telling you about what is to come in 2013,

67
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,140
 because the way that we take that month off,

68
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,100
 and I know some people, that frustrates some people,

69
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,180
 but what we're doing there is we're dreaming

70
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:50,020
 and fasting and praying and asking God

71
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:52,420
 what he desires for us for the next year

72
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,300
 as we look at this city, so I'm just gonna give you

73
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,140
 three things, because the way my mind works,

74
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,700
 I kinda remember things in threes,

75
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,100
 and so it's three things that we have heard,

76
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,580
 our team has heard from the Lord,

77
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,740
 as we've asked him, hey, as you build this house,

78
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:07,500
 what do you want us to be about?

79
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,420
 And the first one is simply this, transformational truth.

80
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:14,420
 You come to this place every Tuesday, seven o'clock,

81
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,580
 and what you're going to hear, I hope,

82
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:19,380
 is us teaching you the truth from the scriptures,

83
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,700
 so that you don't just come and be entertained

84
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:25,620
 or hear a speaker or leave and get some tips

85
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,780
 and tricks for life, but that you would hear

86
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,620
 the word of God, that the spirit of God

87
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:33,740
 would make real to you, and that he would awaken your heart,

88
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:34,980
 and that as you leave this place,

89
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,300
 that you would live out those truths,

90
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,680
 and that this wouldn't be the only place

91
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,980
 of your Bible intake, but we wouldn't just teach you

92
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:43,360
 the Bible, but we would teach you how to learn

93
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,400
 from the scriptures, even on your own.

94
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:50,460
 And so you will never come here and get some,

95
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:53,340
 you know, feel good, just hey, here's how to do

96
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,900
 life message, you're gonna come here

97
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,820
 and get teaching from the scriptures

98
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,460
 that are relevant to 20 and 30 somethings

99
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:04,820
 as they move and live in Dallas, Texas.

100
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:07,580
 And what's happened historically, as we've looked backwards,

101
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,620
 is as we have read from the scriptures,

102
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,760
 and the Holy Spirit has changed lives.

103
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,660
 You have to understand that to be a follower

104
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,760
 of Jesus means to change.

105
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,400
 So I don't care where you're at, right?

106
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,120
 I don't care where you're at, I don't care

107
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,640
 what you're struggling with, pornography,

108
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,560
 or materialism, or you killed somebody in the parking lot,

109
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,560
 or maybe you made up a fake girlfriend on Twitter,

110
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:36,560
 or you said you doped, or you didn't dope,

111
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,880
 or whatever, and won seven tour de France,

112
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,220
 I don't care what you did, okay?

113
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,220
 I don't care who you are, right?

114
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,800
 I don't care, right?

115
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,600
 The only thing that I care about is we don't stay there.

116
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,000
 Is that the Spirit of God would continue to conform us

117
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,080
 to the image and the character of Christ

118
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,240
 as we look at these scriptures,

119
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,400
 and His Spirit informs your heart,

120
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,120
 unless the Lord builds the house.

121
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,680
 It's builder's labor in vain.

122
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,680
 And so that's what we're about here,

123
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,120
 transformational truth.

124
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,340
 So just to give you a heads up of where we're headed,

125
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,840
 we're gonna teach through two books this year,

126
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,740
 both Galatians and the New Testament,

127
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,360
 one of Paul's letters to the Church of Galatia,

128
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,400
 and Ecclesiastes of the Old Testament.

129
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,060
 We're gonna go through some topical series

130
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,920
 on worry, anxiety, doubt, and depression.

131
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,380
 Courage, we're gonna talk about courage,

132
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,960
 evangelism, living on mission.

133
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,000
 The spiritual disciplines,

134
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,200
 hey, how can I really learn to read my Bible?

135
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,040
 How do I learn to apply this book to my life?

136
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,960
 What does it look like to have a healthy prayer life?

137
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,800
 And those sorts of things.

138
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,760
 And we're gonna kick off with a dating series

139
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,160
 called Cupid, Dating Myths.

140
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,000
 Why?

141
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,560
 Because I think that, frankly, one reason,

142
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,540
 the vast majority of the people in the room are single.

143
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,320
 Another reason is a lot of folks in the room

144
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,800
 wanna be married, but even if you don't,

145
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,280
 we're gonna talk about how I think

146
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,160
 this is the single most effective way

147
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,600
 for you to disqualify your ministry.

148
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,920
 We see a lot of people here are dating,

149
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,640
 but not a lot of people here are dating

150
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,440
 in a way that honors God.

151
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,080
 And so what does it mean to look towards

152
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,680
 the creator of the heavens and the earth

153
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,400
 and say, hey, how do I live my life

154
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,880
 most effectively for you?

155
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,720
 And so we're gonna start here,

156
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,540
 and I know there's some girls here like,

157
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,380
 hey, man, I'd love to apply that to my life,

158
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:12,640
 if only I'd get asked out, you know?

159
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,260
 And so I'm gonna tell the guys to ask you out.

160
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,960
 Come, just come back for that, okay?

161
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,080
 So we're gonna talk through that.

162
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,600
 And we're gonna talk about those problems

163
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,600
 that we have in the ministry.

164
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,240
 Unless the Lord builds the house,

165
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,120
 it's builder's labor in vain.

166
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,800
 And so this is what this is about, this change.

167
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,460
 Do you ever feel like you're looking at your life,

168
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,160
 and it's kind of like that gingerbread house,

169
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,840
 when you start, when you're like thinking,

170
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,320
 okay, I've gotta pray more, I resolve,

171
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,000
 2013, I'm gonna pray more.

172
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,680
 And you start praying more, and then all of a sudden,

173
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,960
 the Bible study thing kind of falls off.

174
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,840
 You're like, oh, no, I'm gonna study the Bible more.

175
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,200
 You know, and then you start studying the Bible more,

176
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,880
 and then all of a sudden, that sin struggle

177
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,560
 rears its ugly head.

178
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,280
 You're like, okay, I'm gonna do away with that now.

179
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,880
 2013 is my year, I'm gonna never look at that,

180
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,760
 or go there, or be that again.

181
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,840
 And then all of a sudden, this other thing,

182
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:00,360
 you know, like your community group just becomes a problem.

183
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,840
 Or something else kind of rears its head.

184
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,600
 Or maybe you're going through life,

185
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,000
 and you're looking at your career,

186
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,600
 and your relationships, and your image,

187
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,160
 and all of these things that make you you,

188
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,240
 and you kind of feel like a house of cards.

189
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,320
 That any given moment, it's about to all come crashing down.

190
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:20,720
 What does it really mean practically

191
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,520
 to stop and to say, hey, God, unless you build this house,

192
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,440
 I'm laboring in vain.

193
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,760
 God, take your word and instruct my heart,

194
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:32,240
 and help me to be a woman or a man of God,

195
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,440
 living a life that honors you,

196
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,240
 so that in that great and wonderful day,

197
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,200
 you would say, well done, good and faithful servant.

198
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,920
 The second thing we wanna be about

199
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,760
 is allowing you the opportunity

200
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,760
 to connect to Christ followers.

201
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:51,240
 So don't labor in vain, but also don't labor alone.

202
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,480
 The Christian life, the life,

203
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:57,640
 one life following Jesus was never meant to be done alone.

204
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,120
 And so this is why people get in fraternities,

205
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:04,840
 and sororities, and clubs, and even find niches at work.

206
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,560
 We wanna help you find a group of folks

207
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,760
 who are serious about following Jesus.

208
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,600
 We wanna help you with that.

209
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:18,400
 We wanna hand it to you as much as we can.

210
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,800
 And look around, it's a big place, I get it.

211
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,840
 Okay, it can be intimidating.

212
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,040
 It can't be intimidating, though.

213
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,200
 The bigger we get, the smaller we must become.

214
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,600
 I was at a coffee shop this weekend,

215
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,040
 and a friend of mine, Greg, and I were there,

216
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:36,680
 and Greg engaged with the barista and just said,

217
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,080
 hey, you have a church home?

218
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,240
 And she said, yeah, I like to think I do.

219
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,040
 And so we were talking, I just said,

220
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,680
 hey, you ever heard of Watermark?

221
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,880
 And she goes, yeah, the church?

222
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,600
 Yeah, and she goes, oh yeah,

223
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,800
 I've been to the young adults thing there.

224
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,400
 I was like, oh, that thing, man.

225
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,520
 (congregation laughing)

226
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,440
 I was like, oh, that thing, it's a meat market.

227
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,040
 And she goes, no, it wasn't that.

228
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,840
 I was like, yes, praise God.

229
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:05,000
 And she goes, but it was intense.

230
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,400
 Oh yeah, that hair tick up front, it is intense.

231
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,360
 No, I said, what do you mean by intense?

232
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,480
 She said, well, there was just a lot of people there.

233
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,120
 See, I didn't know there were that many people ever

234
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,480
 at my age that gathered to talk about Jesus.

235
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,200
 And it just hit me, I was like,

236
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,240
 it's a problem if people come in,

237
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,600
 and it feels big and it feels lonely.

238
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,760
 And so we are really going to put forth effort this year

239
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,800
 to provide a place for you to connect deeply

240
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,160
 with those who follow Jesus, but I want you to know,

241
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,840
 and this is really important that you know this, okay,

242
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,760
 not everyone here is following Christ.

243
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,920
 And so just because they've memorized some scripture

244
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,000
 and they're carrying around a Bible

245
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,600
 and maybe they graduated from seminary,

246
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,640
 it doesn't mean they know Jesus, okay?

247
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,280
 So don't just say, okay, well, they're safe

248
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,520
 because I met 'em at the porch.

249
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,440
 Be aware of that, okay?

250
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,680
 Kind of check a track record or inspect the reputation,

251
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,120
 if you will, take some time.

252
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,560
 And so that's just kind of a public servant announcement.

253
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,320
 But I am, public service rather, announcement.

254
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,320
 I am passionate about you.

255
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,920
 I am passionate about you finding those folks

256
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,520
 who are gonna be bridesmaids at your wedding,

257
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:13,520
 groomsmen at your wedding, folks whose children

258
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,480
 will play with your children growing up,

259
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:20,440
 folks who you will bury, or at your funeral

260
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,000
 they will talk about your life.

261
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,840
 But for now, I am passionate about you finding people

262
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:30,200
 that you can step into this amazing adventure

263
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,400
 that is following Jesus with,

264
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,300
 so that you don't have to do it alone.

265
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,340
 Because you'll feel alone in Dallas.

266
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:39,100
 I'll tell you, there's a lot of people following Dallas,

267
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,940
 not Jesus, right?

268
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,020
 There's a lot of people here tonight

269
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,620
 following Dallas, not Jesus.

270
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:47,340
 And so we want to help you find some folks

271
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:51,620
 who follow Jesus so that you can connect deeply with them.

272
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,260
 And so one way that we're going to do that

273
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:57,020
 is just January 27th, that's this Sunday, is a group link.

274
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:59,740
 And so if this is your home church, come to group,

275
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,860
 simple as this, I'm gonna make this real easy on you.

276
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,860
 If this is your home church and you don't have

277
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:06,820
 a community group, come Sunday at 2 p.m.

278
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,420
 and we're gonna help you find a community group.

279
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,700
 Okay, if this is not your church home,

280
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:12,640
 the vast majority, in fact, probably half of you or more,

281
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,780
 this is not your church home, so be free.

282
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,460
 Like, you're welcome here.

283
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,860
 We want to be a young adult ministry that serves the city.

284
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:21,080
 In fact, I spent a lot of my time over break

285
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,540
 meeting with other senior pastors

286
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,340
 and young adult pastors in this area

287
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:26,820
 and just talking about what could be if we yoked arms.

288
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:30,220
 And I know a lot of them actually send their folks here.

289
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,860
 And so we're glad you're here, welcome.

290
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:34,580
 What we want to do with you is we want to help you,

291
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:38,000
 help equip you to find that community at your home church

292
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,580
 so that you can come here together, be blessed together here

293
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,180
 but at the same time return there

294
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,940
 and continue to make a difference.

295
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:46,320
 And so we exist to serve you as well.

296
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,140
 But if you're here, if this is your church home,

297
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,100
 then there's no excuse for you.

298
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,340
 We're really going the extra mile to help you connect.

299
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:54,980
 And there'll be the community rooms will continue

300
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,260
 after group link is over.

301
00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:00,260
 And so I'm not talking about fake relationships,

302
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,580
 I'm talking about real relationships.

303
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:02,700
 If you want fake relationships,

304
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,080
 go to desperateforfriends.com or something.

305
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:08,240
 But we're talking about real relationships of people

306
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,420
 who are following Jesus that you can lock arms with

307
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,820
 and change this city and change this world.

308
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,620
 And so speaking of changes in this city and this world,

309
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,620
 the last thing that we want to be with about

310
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:20,020
 is sending and serving.

311
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:25,140
 Sending you to serve others, okay.

312
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:28,480
 We want to provide a place so that you can come

313
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,600
 but then we want to provide opportunities for you to go.

314
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,100
 And so we want to be about serving this city

315
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,880
 that is called Dallas and changing the world.

316
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,080
 We did a series last year just talking about

317
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,860
 changing the world and some people caught that vision.

318
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:45,160
 And so every year we go to Haiti and we go to Africa

319
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,920
 but I want you to know we're gonna go

320
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,480
 wherever there is need, okay.

321
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,660
 If a hurricane hits the coast, God forbid,

322
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,680
 of New Orleans tonight, right,

323
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,520
 then soon we will be there rebuilding that city.

324
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,360
 Wherever there is need in this country,

325
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,000
 wherever there is need in this world,

326
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,320
 we will go there stewarding the gospel,

327
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,760
 the good news of Jesus Christ,

328
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,600
 his death and resurrection which saves people,

329
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,320
 not their lives, not gives them something to eat simply

330
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,800
 but allows them a place to live for eternity.

331
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,300
 But we will also give them something to eat,

332
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,800
 we will also give them water to drink,

333
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,400
 we will also give them clothes to wear.

334
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,160
 That's what we're about.

335
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,240
 And so we're gonna do that, okay.

336
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,520
 We're gonna do that this year.

337
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,800
 We're gonna continue to do that.

338
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,320
 God's going to continue to do that through us.

339
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,880
 We can't do it alone, we don't wanna do it without him.

340
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,960
 We're going to be about changing this world.

341
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,680
 You guys remember me talking about,

342
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,440
 if you were here, if you're a guest tonight,

343
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,040
 you may not know this story but there was a guy,

344
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,800
 his name was Simon, he lived in Sweden, okay.

345
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:45,440
 He stole some software, some pirated software

346
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,200
 which had a watermark on it.

347
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,640
 Simon had never in his life heard the gospel

348
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,000
 and this is gonna rock your world

349
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,520
 'cause we live in Dallas now but Sweden

350
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,880
 is one of the most atheist countries in the world.

351
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,040
 If not the most atheist country in the world.

352
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,560
 Simon had no idea who Jesus was, okay.

353
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,240
 He's 20 something years old and he's got this

354
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,400
 pirated software which he stole that has a watermark on it.

355
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:09,440
 So he Googles how to get the watermark off this software.

356
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:14,200
 He finds a series on YouTube called Boy Meets Girl.

357
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,600
 It was the porch, he watched it.

358
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,760
 He was intrigued because this tall, goofy guy

359
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,600
 was telling him that he shouldn't be having sex

360
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,520
 if he's single, all right.

361
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,680
 And he's like, who in the world,

362
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:27,160
 why would anybody listen to this idiot

363
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,120
 who's telling people that they shouldn't enjoy

364
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,200
 the pleasure of sex?

365
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,920
 This is crazy but he was intrigued

366
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,640
 and so he caught some other messages, right.

367
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,280
 Then I'm sitting in my office,

368
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,340
 one afternoon my phone rings and it's Simon from Sweden.

369
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:42,320
 So I tell Simon about Jesus 'cause he said,

370
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,640
 man, there's something different about those people.

371
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,720
 I tell him about Jesus, he prays to receive Christ

372
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,200
 right there on the phone.

373
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,160
 He gets plugged into a church there in Sweden

374
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,800
 and maybe you've heard that, yeah, it's worth it.

375
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,560
 He gets plugged into a church there.

376
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,480
 (congregation applauds)

377
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:58,080
 Check this out, he gets plugged into a church there

378
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,640
 and then he tells them about this place

379
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,160
 and so now their young adult ministry in Sweden

380
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:06,120
 podcasts the porch, that's what they do.

381
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,000
 That's what they do when they gather.

382
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,340
 But guess what, Simon's not there today.

383
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:12,680
 This happened in 2012, guys.

384
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,560
 Simon's not there today, why?

385
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,400
 He's a missionary in the Philippines.

386
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,960
 You tracking with me?

387
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:22,240
 The dude had never heard about Jesus

388
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,760
 and now he's like, wait a minute,

389
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,160
 there's some people in the Philippines

390
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,080
 who don't know about Jesus.

391
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,520
 I gotta go tell them about Jesus now.

392
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:33,520
 He is now a missionary, 365 days a year

393
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:37,160
 in the Philippines, this is God,

394
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,500
 unless he builds the house.

395
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,880
 Those who build it, labor in vain.

396
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,600
 Okay, he's doing stuff.

397
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:48,760
 And here's the deal, we wanna be missionaries in Dallas.

398
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,600
 I've heard it said you either are a missionary

399
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,680
 or you need one, okay?

400
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,680
 You either are a missionary or you need one.

401
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,600
 And so I want you to be a missionary tonight

402
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,600
 and tomorrow in the morning

403
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,120
 and when you show up to work, you're a missionary.

404
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,560
 And there's some people that are getting this.

405
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,560
 We want to serve this city so that when the mayor has need,

406
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,600
 he or she calls the porch, okay?

407
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,460
 That we would be first responders in serving the city.

408
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:16,240
 Jesus says in Matthew five that we're light of the world.

409
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,220
 That's who we are and so let me just show you some pictures.

410
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:22,600
 This is where we are, strategically placed in this city,

411
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,560
 right, I think we have some images.

412
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,880
 There we are, that's us, we're right there.

413
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:31,220
 We are by one of the single most busiest intersections

414
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:34,240
 in the entire country of the United States of America,

415
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,980
 strategically placed right here.

416
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:40,680
 And if you zoom out now, this is our city.

417
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,880
 And that A right there, that's where we're at.

418
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,600
 And so we want to impact those areas around us, okay?

419
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,960
 Those are our areas of focus

420
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,220
 and so as you look at that map,

421
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:52,380
 if your mission is Addison, there you go, you're right there.

422
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,220
 If your mission is Uptown, you're there.

423
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,420
 The M Streets, you're there.

424
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,680
 University Park, you're there.

425
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,060
 Maybe you live around White Rock

426
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,520
 and Lakewood or Lake Highlands.

427
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,200
 There's your mission, okay?

428
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,780
 That's where you will be a missionary.

429
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:06,440
 Maybe you work downtown, that's your mission.

430
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:10,680
 Maybe you're here from Garland or Plano or Richardson.

431
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:14,460
 Welcome, we're gonna send you.

432
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:17,940
 If you don't go to Africa or Haiti with us

433
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,640
 or somewhere else, we're gonna resource you

434
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,780
 to impact your neighborhoods and your communities

435
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:26,200
 because man, if you're building something,

436
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:29,620
 if you're just building a beautiful U,

437
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:33,160
 you're just building a big old house,

438
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,960
 it's gonna crumble one day.

439
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:39,160
 It's not gonna matter one day.

440
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,980
 We always say this, I always ask it,

441
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:43,500
 I think it's relevant, you know,

442
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,100
 not many people here know their great-great-grandfather's

443
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:49,580
 name, he was alive 50 years ago.

444
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:53,100
 That means 50 years from now, no one's driving

445
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,660
 down the street saying thank you,

446
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:57,400
 oh great-great-grandfather, great-great-grandmother.

447
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,020
 Insert your name.

448
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:05,140
 You are but a memory and the only thing that will last

449
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:08,340
 is the impact that you made for the kingdom.

450
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:13,380
 Did you guys know, did you know that 34 of your peers

451
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,980
 went out into the city and did a 48 hour

452
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:16,280
 mission trip this weekend?

453
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:19,140
 It was incredible.

454
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:23,260
 34 of your peers went out and just shared

455
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,580
 the gospel in Dallas.

456
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:27,460
 The way that this happened is we were in Haiti

457
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:29,320
 and we were sharing the gospel there in Haiti

458
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,580
 and you have to speak to an interpreter

459
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,820
 and it's a frustrating process 'cause you say something

460
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:34,660
 and the interpreter says something

461
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,500
 and the interpreter's a believer, a Christ follower,

462
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,540
 and so you just kinda get to this point

463
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:38,940
 where you're like hey, just tell them.

464
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:41,060
 Just tell them about Jesus, like let's not do this,

465
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:43,340
 I say it, you say it, just tell 'em, just tell 'em.

466
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:44,820
 And then we said that at night,

467
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,380
 we were kinda venting that frustration

468
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:47,580
 and we said well wait a minute, we don't do that.

469
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,440
 I mean this guy's walking through his village.

470
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,980
 When's the last time we walked through our village

471
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,140
 and said hey, can I tell you about Jesus?

472
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,420
 Hey, what about you, can I tell you about Jesus?

473
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,660
 What about you, can I tell you about Jesus?

474
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:57,140
 And so one of the guys there says hey, I'm gonna do it

475
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,420
 and I'm gonna take some people with me.

476
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,820
 So he came back, Ryan Wall came back here

477
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:03,220
 and he put together a team and these folks,

478
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:05,840
 our porch volunteers, they went into the city,

479
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,700
 they stayed in uptown and they walked around uptown

480
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:12,140
 and downtown Dallas just sharing the gospel.

481
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:14,760
 It was incredible, the first person they talked to

482
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,780
 in the parking lot trusted Christ.

483
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,660
 And so these are some of the folks that they shared with.

484
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,900
 They engaged with a Hindu, a Muslim, an atheist, a Jew,

485
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,940
 a Buddhist, de-churched, unchurched, dead-churched,

486
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:25,920
 watermark attenders, porch attenders, meth addicts,

487
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,180
 a girl considering an abortion and one of the girls

488
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:30,540
 that was there that was with us had had an abortion,

489
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,860
 got to sit with her and so now she's reconsidering

490
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:36,940
 that decision, a guy who literally had just been released

491
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,780
 from prison that day.

492
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,980
 One team didn't engage all weekend with a single person

493
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:47,220
 in Dallas, Texas who called themselves a Christian.

494
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:51,760
 That's our city and that's why we wanna change it.

495
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,640
 I'll read this, one girl just wrote this,

496
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,040
 one of our leaders wrote this when she got back.

497
00:19:56,040 --> 00:20:00,060
 "It came to reality Sunday evening

498
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:02,200
 "that these truly are the days.

499
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,880
 "There is a specific reason I have the job,

500
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,580
 "the community, the serving opportunities around me.

501
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:11,120
 "I realized I'm in my prime and it's a short window

502
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,200
 "where I will have the energy and time to do it all

503
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,960
 "and right now I wanna do it all.

504
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,120
 "I wanna go overseas as often as I can.

505
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,540
 "I wanna study the scriptures as deeply as I can.

506
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:22,520
 "I wanna learn and grow as much as I can

507
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,720
 "and I wanna pour out as much as I can.

508
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,800
 "All weekend and throughout the young adult's world,

509
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:32,000
 "I see so many people distracted and individuals searching

510
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,120
 "for something to fill themselves.

511
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:37,380
 "I see girls living for a man and doing everything they can

512
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:38,480
 "to fill that desire.

513
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,520
 "I see people searching for the next thing to hold onto

514
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,740
 "or the next thing they think will make them happy,

515
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:46,980
 "yet they are never satisfied and it's heartbreaking.

516
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:49,540
 "I sat back this weekend and realized I want my life

517
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,140
 "to be different from the world

518
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:55,060
 "and I continually need to remind myself

519
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:57,980
 "that this earth is not my home.

520
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:01,320
 "I don't want to get caught in the lies

521
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,040
 "and distractions all around me.

522
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,420
 "For me personally, I'm seeing even more

523
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:08,080
 "that my singleness and the season of life I'm in

524
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,660
 "is truly a gift from God.

525
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:12,200
 "It's an opportunity to go, serve, and learn.

526
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,960
 "I would be wasting my days and time on earth

527
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,320
 "if I did not take advantage

528
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,980
 "of the opportunities around me.

529
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:20,720
 "I'm still only a few hours removed from this weekend

530
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,780
 "and there are a number of things

531
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,080
 "the Lord needs to do in me, but all in all,

532
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,660
 "I want this year to be a time where I do it all,

533
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,960
 "not for me, but for Him.

534
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,280
 "For unless the Lord builds the house,

535
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,880
 "it's builder's labor in vain."

536
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,360
 And so he's building the house.

537
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,300
 We need only to surrender and to look His way

538
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,500
 and to say, "God, what would you have me do?

539
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,700
 "What is faithfulness for me?

540
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,840
 "I don't want to manage my life.

541
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,940
 "I don't want to balance my career and my relationship

542
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:48,000
 "and my image and my reputation.

543
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,100
 "I give it all to you.

544
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:53,000
 "Father, use it for your glory."

545
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,300
 So here at the porch, we're gonna instruct you

546
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:59,180
 to hear through His word, the building up the temple,

547
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,300
 His temple in you.

548
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:03,820
 We're gonna show you others in your life stage

549
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:06,540
 who you can connect with, who also desire Him.

550
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:10,160
 And we're gonna give you opportunities to serve this city

551
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:13,200
 and change this world through your faithfulness.

552
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,440
 That's Him working through your faithfulness.

553
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:20,740
 Over the break, as we got together and prayed,

554
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,760
 one thing that we did, we went to this house,

555
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:27,000
 and it was a new house, just a friend of ours had built.

556
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,320
 It's really a beautiful home.

557
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,520
 We all kind of had house envy at the end of the time.

558
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,160
 I mean, just this incredible stone house

559
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:37,600
 with hand-scraped hardwoods and big cedar posts

560
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,880
 and just an incredible structure,

561
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,840
 really, really nice home.

562
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:46,520
 And the reality of it is, is it's not gonna last.

563
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:50,660
 Jesus said that, not one of these stones will stand upright.

564
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,620
 And it took two years to build this home,

565
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,300
 and I just reflected with the team.

566
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,860
 I was like, you know, one day, this home,

567
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:58,240
 it was just a slab.

568
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,240
 And nobody's really looking at the slab.

569
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,640
 The guy shows up to the construction site,

570
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,320
 and all that's there is a big old sheet of concrete,

571
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,240
 and he's not standing there, you know, thinking,

572
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:10,200
 oh, hey, look at this amazing, beautiful concrete.

573
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,440
 I mean, there is somebody, right, who's doing that,

574
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,200
 the person who built the slab, right?

575
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,360
 He's like, it's a beautiful slab.

576
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,640
 But the reality of it is,

577
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,360
 is the structure hasn't been built yet.

578
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,880
 And I think the temptation for us today

579
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,080
 is to look around and say, oh, look at what we got.

580
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,280
 Look at what we've built.

581
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,160
 Look at what I built with my hands.

582
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,920
 Even look at this ministry.

583
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,760
 That's my temptation.

584
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,400
 Look at the ministry, right?

585
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,320
 Look how it's grown.

586
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,960
 Look at the incredible things that we've done.

587
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,400
 No, man.

588
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,720
 One, he's done it.

589
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,920
 There's none of us that good.

590
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,760
 It's him that's done it.

591
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:50,280
 And I think, I think we're standing on the slab.

592
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:53,800
 I think today, as you look around,

593
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,800
 we're standing on the sheet of concrete.

594
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,600
 And God's saying, hey, we just wait.

595
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,800
 The best is yet to come.

596
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:04,480
 I'm gonna build something beautiful through you,

597
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,120
 and we're gonna change this city.

598
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:11,640
 34 of your peers handed God their lives this weekend.

599
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:14,080
 I wanna invite the band to come back up.

600
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,120
 And we're gonna go back to worshiping him.

601
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,920
 But I wanna say this.

602
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:21,680
 34 of your peers, right,

603
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:24,760
 they handed God their lives this weekend.

604
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:29,760
 Can you imagine if 3,400 of us did that?

605
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,720
 3,400 of us marching through uptown,

606
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,880
 arms locked, saying, hey, let's change this place

607
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,920
 for the cause of Christ.

608
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,360
 Because one day, very, very soon,

609
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,840
 we're gonna be dead.

610
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:47,360
 In our car, in our house,

611
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,680
 in those shallow relationships,

612
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:53,520
 in our career, in our image, in our reputation.

613
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,360
 It's vanity.

614
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,960
 One day, very soon, it's not gonna matter.

615
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,720
 All that's gonna matter is how we built his kingdom,

616
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,480
 how we shared his truth.

617
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,640
 (silence)

618
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,800
 (silence)

619
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:18,800
