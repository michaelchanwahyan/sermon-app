00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 [Music]

2
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 How we doing porch?

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Come on, come on, come on, come on.

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 It's so great to be back with you this evening.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 Recently I took my family to Waco.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 My wife is from Waco.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 And so yeah, some of you are too.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 And so we went to Waco and there's this thing there called the BSR Cable Park.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 So it's like if you have ever been wakeboarding, there's these things called cable parks

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 where they like pull you around on a wakeboard on a cable.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 And there's also this thing there called the Royal Flush, okay.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 You probably have no idea what I'm talking about, but it's these crazy slides that like should be illegal, okay,

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 because they shoot you up and just like launch you.

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 And it's like some college kid is running.

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 I remember getting to the top of it looking down this really steep slide.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 And somebody had just gone and I looked at him and I'm like, "Hey, can I go?"

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 And he was like, "I don't care when you go."

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 I'm like, "Oh, okay, good. So it's safe."

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 And it's just the craziest thing.

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 And you go down this slide at like 600 miles an hour and then it shoots you up in like 50 feet in the air.

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 Like here's a picture.

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 Just okay, so that's the slide, right, and that's me.

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 And so it's just like the second you're going down it, it's like, "What did I just do?"

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 And then it just launches you uncontrollably in the air and you're kind of like, "Oh, no."

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 And so I thought I would take my five-year-old, my nine-year-old, and my seven-year-old.

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 This is going to be fun.

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 But I was so proud of them.

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 I was so proud of them because they all went down it.

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 You know, I'm a proud dad.

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 My daughter was like, "Man."

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 She got in the water, hit the water, was like, "I was not ready for that."

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 And I was like, "I understand. I understand."

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 But my son, my son goes down the slide and he's headed down and he spreads his legs

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 and he grabs the side and he stops right in the middle of it.

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 And he's like, "No, I can't. I can't."

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 I'm like, "Buddy, there's no turning back now. You got no options.

37
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 There's no way off the slide, so you have to go down it."

38
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 And just this idea that we were talking afterwards like, "Oh, man, I wasn't ready for that. I don't know."

39
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 It reminded me of this meme. Have you seen this meme?

40
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 It says, "This is me sliding into adulthood."

41
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 See, I think that's like some of us, like life is just like, you know, there's kindergarten, first grade,

42
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 second grade, third grade, fourth grade, fifth grade, you know, then junior high, then high school, then college.

43
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 And then it's like all of a sudden, "Ahh!"

44
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 We're just kind of flailing, flying, you know, and flailing through the air.

45
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 It's like, "I wasn't ready for this."

46
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 And then what do you do? You're kind of like, "Okay, I don't like, like, is this the real world?

47
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 Like, I think I'm going to go back to college.

48
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 You know, maybe I'll go back. Maybe grad school. That sounds pretty good right now."

49
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 And then what you do, you're like, "Man, I don't know about this job.

50
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 Like, I think I got the wrong job, and I need to go find the right job."

51
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 And so you begin to jump around, and you know, then you start thinking, "Maybe I need to move."

52
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 You get real philosophical. You ever done this? You're like, "What if I had a, you know, a hut on the beach,

53
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 and I just surfed?"

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 And it's like, "Have you ever surfed?" "No, but I bet I could.

55
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 I bet I'd be good."

56
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 And maybe you're philanthropic or benevolent. You're like, "I don't know, maybe I'll move, you know, to a third world country and start an orphanage."

57
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 And that's awesome, man. Good for you. Right?

58
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 But it's like, "Is this, is this, is this the real world?

59
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 I wasn't ready for this."

60
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 And so we're wrapping up our series asking for a friend, and,

61
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 and the question I want to answer is,

62
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 "How do I get ready for what's next?"

63
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 How do I get ready for the real world?

64
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 I was going to call it, "How do I adult like a boss?" But they were like, "No, don't do that."

65
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 And then it was, "How to crush adulting." And they were like, "No."

66
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 So how to get ready for whatever's next.

67
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 I think for so many of us, what we need is to gain wisdom.

68
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 The Bible talks a lot about getting wisdom.

69
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 Get it at all costs.

70
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 In fact, Proverbs 4, 7 says, "The beginning of wisdom is this, get wisdom.

71
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 Though it cost all you have, get understanding."

72
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 And I think so many of us, we want a mentor.

73
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 And I've talked to some of you, you're like, "Hey, who do you want to mentor?"

74
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 You know, a godly man? Yeah, a godly man. It would be cool if he was rich, really successful.

75
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 Could tell me how to find a great woman.

76
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 And so it's like we want someone who is wise.

77
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 And so tonight you're going to learn from someone who is very wise.

78
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 Not me.

79
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 The wisest man who has ever lived.

80
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 Solomon. King Solomon.

81
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 In 1 Kings, it says that Solomon had an opportunity to ask God for something.

82
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 And he said, "Who am I, just a boy?"

83
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 Because God had favor on his father who was King David.

84
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 And Solomon says, "Who am I, just a boy? How can I rule all these people?

85
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 Lord, would you give me wisdom? Would you give me discernment?

86
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 Help me to know right from wrong. Help me to lead your people."

87
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 Then it says that the Lord was pleased with him.

88
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 And because he had asked for wisdom to lead the people,

89
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 God also gave him riches.

90
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 And he gave him honor and he gave him fame.

91
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 And so this is who Solomon is.

92
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 I want you to understand that as we think about how to get ready for whatever's next,

93
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 Solomon wrote a book called Wisdom.

94
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 In fact, when I was younger, before I was a Christian, I said,

95
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 "Hey, my dream job would be to have an advice line."

96
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 Like 1-800-ASK-FOR-ADVICE.

97
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 And I would just sit there and give people advice all day.

98
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 I remember telling my friend this in college, like,

99
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 "This would be my dream job, just to give advice."

100
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 And kind of, I had my dream job, because what happens, you guys email in all the time,

101
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 like, "Well, I'm dating this boy, and what would you do if..."

102
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 And so I just kind of give advice all day.

103
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 But you don't want my advice.

104
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 When you can get wisdom from the Creator of the heavens and the earth,

105
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 that's a much better place to get advice.

106
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 And what's funny about that slide that I showed you up front is on YouTube,

107
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 there's all these fail compilations.

108
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 Like people who've gone off that slide and landed on their head or their back or their stomach.

109
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 Like my family's probably on some of them.

110
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 And none of us want to get to the end of this life,

111
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 and our life to be one big fail compilation.

112
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 Like none of you here tonight are like,

113
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 "Man, when I grow up, I really hope I'm an alcoholic."

114
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 But some of you will be.

115
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 You're not like, "Man, I really hope, you know, to give marriage a try a couple times,

116
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 have a few divorces under my belt.

117
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 That's what I'm dreaming for."

118
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 But statistically, that will be about half of your story.

119
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 Some of your stories already.

120
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 And I'm not trying to make you feel bad or give you shame.

121
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 I'm just saying the natural drift down the slide is toward ruin and destruction.

122
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 Like that's where we go if we don't gain wisdom.

123
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 We drift toward negative outcomes that no one wants.

124
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 No one's like, "Man, I really hope one day I'm a couple hundred thousand dollars in debt."

125
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 And yet it happens all the time.

126
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 And it happens because of choices you make in your 20s and your 30s.

127
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 And so I want to talk with you about how to get ready for what's next.

128
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 And we get to gain wisdom from the wisest man in the world.

129
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 I'll tell you just a little bit about this guy.

130
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 He lived in 970 to 931 B.C.

131
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 He was a king and not just a man of power.

132
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 He was a king that other kings came to and paid for consulting.

133
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 He was a rich man.

134
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 When I say rich man, he earned the modern-day equivalent of a billion dollars a year.

135
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 That's not net worth. That's income.

136
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 A billion dollars a year.

137
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 He would throw parties, like the most epic parties you can imagine.

138
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 22,000 heads of cattle were on the menu for one of his parties.

139
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 In addition to that, 150,000 sheep and goats.

140
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 These are the kinds of parties that this man threw.

141
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 And he had women.

142
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 700 wives and 300 concubines or prostitutes.

143
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 Which you say, like some of the guys are like, "Well, he doesn't sound very wise."

144
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 Because that's a lot of presents and roses and whatnot.

145
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 But here's what you need to know.

146
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 That was actually his downfall.

147
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 It was a step in the wrong direction, his disobedience.

148
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 And that's what brought him to ruin at some point in his life, was that poor choice.

149
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 And so he's a man of power. He's famous.

150
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 Everyone knew who he was. Everyone still does.

151
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 You can go.

152
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 His palace where he lived--talk about cribs--

153
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 where he lived took 13 years to build.

154
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 He had over 30,000 employees.

155
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 30,000 personal assistants.

156
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 People that not work for his company, but worked for him personally.

157
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 Secular sites. You can go on secular websites.

158
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 And search "the richest man who has ever lived."

159
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 And you will see people who reject the Bible as truth,

160
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 acknowledge Solomon, who everyone would agree was a king in history.

161
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 In fact, you can go to Bethlehem right now.

162
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 About 5 kilometers southwest of Bethlehem,

163
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 you're going to see what's called Solomon's Pools.

164
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 They're still there.

165
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 They were used to water his garden.

166
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 Don't think garden.

167
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 Think more amazing than any arboretum that you've ever been to.

168
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 Think forest with flowers.

169
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 That's this guy.

170
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 And so we're going to get to learn from him,

171
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 because he wrote a book called Proverbs.

172
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 It's most of his writings or things that he captured from other kings

173
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 and collected and put in a book of wisdom in the Scriptures.

174
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 My preference would always be to teach a passage of the Bible,

175
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 to highlight Jesus and present the gospel to you.

176
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 But tonight's going to be a little different.

177
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 Tonight I'm going to teach through a book, verses.

178
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 Usually I teach how many points?

179
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 Three points.

180
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 Tonight I'm going to teach ten.

181
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 We're going to fly.

182
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 It's going to feel kind of like a Chris Pratt speech.

183
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 So stay with me drinking from a fire hydrant

184
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 as we look at ten pieces of wisdom

185
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 that will help you get ready for whatever is next.

186
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 And the first one is this.

187
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 Pay attention to what you pay attention to.

188
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 Pay attention to what you pay attention to.

189
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 That is, give careful thought to your thoughts.

190
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 It says this in the Proverbs, chapter 14, verse 15.

191
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 The simple believe anything, but the prudent give thought to their steps.

192
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 It says in 14, verse 12, there is a way that seems right,

193
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 but in the end it leads to death.

194
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 You think it's the right way, but if you go that way,

195
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 it's going to kill you.

196
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 This is why I say this here.

197
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 This is why this is important and it's number one on the list.

198
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 Because thoughts take you places.

199
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 Just by thinking, you can bring yourself to a place of panic,

200
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 and anxiety, and unrest, just from your thoughts.

201
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 A thought can get lodged in your head that will impact the direction you go.

202
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 In fact, somebody said it like this.

203
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 Sow a thought, you reap an act. Sow an act, you reap a habit.

204
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 Sow a habit, you reap a character. Sow a character, and you reap a destiny.

205
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 They're connecting your destiny to your thought in a moment.

206
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 Let me show you how this plays out.

207
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 What I'd love you to do for just a minute, for just a few seconds,

208
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 and campuses, you can do this too, wherever you're at.

209
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 I'd love for everyone to close their eyes for just a minute.

210
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 Just close your eyes for just a minute.

211
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 Now let's just presume that every way would lead to death,

212
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 any way you could go would lead to death, except north.

213
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 If you go north, you'll live. I want everyone to point north.

214
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 Everyone point north.

215
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 Okay, now I want you to open your eyes and look around.

216
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 Campuses.

217
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 Here's what you need to know.

218
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 Here's what you need to know.

219
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 None of you really pointed north.

220
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 You may have maybe even pointed in the direction.

221
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 You may have pointed in the direction of north, wherever you were, campuses, whatever.

222
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 You may have pointed in the general direction, but none of you pointed north.

223
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 Some of you pointed straight up in the air, which is confusing to me.

224
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 I don't know what to do with that, but let's talk afterwards.

225
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 What I want you to know is what you think.

226
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 It matters because it takes you places.

227
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 Right about now you think, "That's not a big deal

228
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 "because I have a compass on my phone.

229
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 "I can pull out the compass, and it will tell me which way north is."

230
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 That's exactly right.

231
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 What you use as a source of wisdom really matters

232
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 because it takes you places.

233
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 So consider carefully what you pay attention to.

234
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 Number two, get out of debt and stay out.

235
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 Get out of debt and stay out.

236
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 Proverbs 22, verse 7 says, "The rich rule over the poor,

237
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 "and the borrower is slave to the lender."

238
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 Monica and I often get to do premarital counseling

239
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 where we meet with a couple who's about to get married.

240
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 A lot of times what happens in that conversation

241
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 is we'll learn that one of them or both of them has debt,

242
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 sometimes a lot of debt.

243
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 Maybe it's student loans and a car loan, and it's just compiled.

244
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 Maybe credit cards that they haven't paid off,

245
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 and they get to this place, and they start to feel shame and guilt

246
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 because their debt is about to be their debt, collective.

247
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 The other person, when you think about sharing all things in marriage,

248
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 a lot of times you don't think about,

249
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 "Oh, yeah, I'm going to start off $100,000 in the hole.

250
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 "That's really the choice that I'm making."

251
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 I don't say that to make you feel shame.

252
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 I say that so that you might consider

253
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 that now is the time for you to get out of debt.

254
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 You think, "Man, there's no way I can."

255
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 I would say, "I've seen people do it."

256
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 Here's how you do it.

257
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 You live below your means, you give as much as you can,

258
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 and you use all of the rest to pay bar tabs.

259
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 No, debt.

260
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 Debt.

261
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 Cell phone bills. No, debt.

262
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 Consider your car. Can you drive a cheaper car?

263
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 When you get out of that debt, could you drive a cash car?

264
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 It never fails to surprise me

265
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 when someone has $100,000 in debt

266
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 and a brand-new 4Runner.

267
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 It's always confusing to me as well.

268
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 Consider how you might get out of that debt.

269
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 That's going to prepare you well for later.

270
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 The third point that I want to give you from the book of wisdom

271
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 is to deal with addictions now.

272
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 Now is the time for you to deal with addictions.

273
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 Proverbs 11, verse 6 says,

274
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 "The righteousness of the upright delivers them,

275
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 "but the unfaithful are trapped by evil desires."

276
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 That's Proverbs 11, verse 6.

277
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 Let me explain to you what addictions are like.

278
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 Addictions are like you have--

279
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 Anybody have a pet? A puppy or kitten or anything?

280
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 Any bird owners?

281
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 We're a bird family. I see you. We got birds.

282
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 It's like you have a pet lion.

283
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 You love it, and it's cuddly, and it purrs when you pet it,

284
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 and it comes up with its nose and nustles up against you.

285
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 It's really cute. It makes this cute sound.

286
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 You feed your lion. You love your lion.

287
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 You feed him. He grows up, and he gets bigger and bigger and bigger.

288
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 All of a sudden Simba is king of the jungle.

289
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 He's got the sharp teeth and everything.

290
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 You were the master of the lion, but now the lion's master of you.

291
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 At its will, it can devour you.

292
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 But you can't kill the lion because it's your pet. You love him.

293
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 You've grown to cohabitate with him.

294
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 He's kind of become a part of you.

295
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 You don't realize that any minute,

296
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 he's going to eat you for lunch.

297
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 So here's my question. What are you addicted to?

298
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 The people who are really bad off,

299
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 they don't think they are addicted.

300
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 It's the ones that are like, "Man, I know exactly what I'm addicted to.

301
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 Those I have hope for. They're probably going to get well."

302
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 It's the ones that don't realize that they are addicted to alcohol.

303
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 They are addicted to money, to drugs, to pornography, to shopping.

304
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 Those are the ones that I am concerned about.

305
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 The problem is, with the analogy of the lion,

306
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 when you feed something, it grows. It gets bigger.

307
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 So you think, "I can stop drinking anytime. It's not a problem.

308
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 Just one last time. I'm going to go out one last time."

309
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 What you're doing is you're feeding something.

310
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 When you feed something, it grows.

311
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 "I'm going to look at that one last time. I'm going to call him one last time.

312
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 I'm going to go there one last time.

313
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 I'm going to watch that one last time."

314
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 This is the lie of one last time.

315
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 You just fed it a little food and it got bigger,

316
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 so the next time is going to be harder, more difficult,

317
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 because you grew an appetite for it.

318
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 I've been doing this no sugar thing.

319
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 Yeah. Pray for me.

320
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 Ketogenics, anybody? Paleo, Whole30 people?

321
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 Pray for them.

322
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 So right off the bat, man, it's real hard.

323
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 The cravings are uncontrollable.

324
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 You walk by the bakery.

325
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 I just went there for fun.

326
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 You see the eclair, and they're just calling your name.

327
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 It's so difficult. You couldn't sleep at night.

328
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 I'm so hungry for dessert.

329
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 We're a dessert family.

330
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 I'm so hungry for dessert.

331
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 But what happens, and I read about this,

332
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 and I began to experience it,

333
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 but if you stop eating for it, you sustain.

334
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 The cravings go away.

335
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 I never would have thought that happened,

336
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 but the cravings went away.

337
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 But I made a mistake.

338
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 I ate one cookie,

339
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 and it was just like I was starting all over.

340
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 They were all right back on me.

341
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 It took the same amount of time for them to go away.

342
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 See, when you starve something,

343
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 you feed something, it grows.

344
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 You starve something, it dies.

345
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 So starve addictions.

346
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 Now's the time to starve addictions.

347
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 Number four, make friends that make you better.

348
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 Make friends that make you better.

349
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 Walk with the wise and become wise,

350
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 for a companion of fools suffers harm.

351
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 It's Proverbs 13, verse 20.

352
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 And so the reality is you are the average

353
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 of your five closest friends.

354
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 You are the average of your five closest friends.

355
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 So be careful who you choose as your favorites

356
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 in your phone, who your friends are.

357
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 Because maybe you think, yeah,

358
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 but I can't just leave my friends.

359
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 No, no, no, no, you can't just leave your faith.

360
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 You can leave your friends.

361
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 But the reality is your friends are gonna pull you down.

362
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 So make friends that make you better.

363
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 Okay, like it's so much easier to pull someone down

364
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 than it is to pull them up, okay?

365
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 You get that?

366
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 It's so much easier to pull someone down

367
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 than it is to pull them up.

368
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 Come here for a second,

369
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 if I can borrow you for just a minute.

370
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 My man here.

371
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 So I'm just gonna prove this point.

372
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 Pull you, no, no, you don't put your foot up there.

373
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 Help me.

374
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 Okay, now you pull me down.

375
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 No, just pull me off here.

376
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 Okay, I didn't mean like that.

377
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 Wow, okay, you had to get violent.

378
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 Geez.

379
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 Get back up here, I'm back Fort Worth.

380
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 Ah, ah.

381
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 Point proven, okay?

382
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 It's a lot easier to pull someone down

383
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 than it is to pull them up.

384
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 Okay, let me recover for a minute.

385
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 Pulled something.

386
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 Ah.

387
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 And so I said this at launch,

388
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 what some of you need to hear,

389
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 change your playmates in your playground.

390
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 Change where you go for fun

391
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 and who you hang out with.

392
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 But I can't just abandon my friends.

393
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 No, you can't just abandon your faith.

394
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 Number five, inform your heart before you follow it.

395
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 Inform your heart before you follow it.

396
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 Talking about how you prepare for what's next in life.

397
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 Above all else, guard your heart

398
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 for everything you do flows from it.

399
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 It's Proverbs 4, 23, okay?

400
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 This is the lie of follow your heart.

401
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 Jeremiah tells us your heart is wicked and deceitful.

402
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 It's beyond cure.

403
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 Who can trust it?

404
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 And yet we trust it.

405
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 And yet the Holy Spirit gives you a new heart.

406
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 Regeneration.

407
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 You have God's spirit at work in your life.

408
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 And so how do we reconcile those ideas?

409
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 Here's how you reconcile.

410
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 Before you follow your heart, you inform your heart.

411
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 You tell it where to go.

412
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 Your heart is like a bloodhound on a scent.

413
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 Do you understand the metaphor?

414
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 It's like you've given it a scent

415
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 and it's looking for the scent that you gave it, okay?

416
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 It's searching for more of what you've shown it,

417
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 what you've listened to, what you've heard,

418
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 what you've watched on TV,

419
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 what you like, what your affections are.

420
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 And so your heart is on that scent

421
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 and it's looking for that thing.

422
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 And so let me change metaphors for a minute.

423
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 Like a GPS or a navigation system, right?

424
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 A navigation system is gonna take you somewhere.

425
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 But you would never follow a navigation system

426
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 unless you put in the address.

427
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 Then you say, "Hey, this is where I want to go."

428
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 Now is the time to tell your heart where you want to go.

429
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 To feed it, to inform it,

430
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 to let it feast on the word of God

431
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 so that it knows what to look for.

432
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 Because it's looking for what you're showing it.

433
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 So if you're entertained by drama,

434
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 it's looking for drama.

435
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 You're like, "How come I can't find a good guy?"

436
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 Because you've told your heart to look for a terrible guy.

437
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 That's why.

438
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 So what if you informed your heart better?

439
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 Inform your heart before you follow it, right?

440
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 And I talked to a girl, they're like,

441
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 "Man, I just can't get over my ex.

442
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 "I don't know how I'm ever gonna get over my ex."

443
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 Hey, let me give you some advice, okay?

444
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 Stop looking at his Instagram feed, okay?

445
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 Like how is it good for your heart

446
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 you seeing him with another girl?

447
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 Like how is that a good idea?

448
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 Of course you can't get over your ex.

449
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 You're intentionally not letting your heart get over your ex.

450
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 That's what you're doing, right?

451
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 And some of you are like, "Man, I hate being single.

452
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 "I can't stand it.

453
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 "I woke up, if I see another,

454
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 "if I get invited to another wedding, I'm gonna..."

455
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 (congregation laughing)

456
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 I'm not scared, I'm not scared.

457
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 But that's because, I mean, you're listening to,

458
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 you know, these love ballads, right?

459
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 Selena Gomez telling you, "The heart wants what it wants."

460
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 Stop doing that, okay?

461
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 You're watching the rom-coms, you're feeding your heart,

462
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 you're just teaching yourself discontentment.

463
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 Comparison is the thief of joy.

464
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 I'm not confused as to why you have no joy.

465
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 All you do all day, every day is compare yourself.

466
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 Like, get rid of the Pinterest folder of wedding dresses.

467
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 That's gonna help you.

468
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 You're like, "No, do I have to?"

469
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 Yes, you have to.

470
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 (congregation laughing)

471
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 Number six, know what is evil and avoid it.

472
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 Know what is evil and avoid it.

473
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 Proverbs 8, verse 13 says,

474
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 "To fear the Lord is to hate evil."

475
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 "I hate pride and arrogance, evil behavior and perverse speech."

476
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 There's been something happening in our generation

477
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 I wanna make you aware of.

478
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 There's a lot of talk around tolerance.

479
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 Let me read you the definition of tolerance from the dictionary.

480
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 This is now labeled old tolerance

481
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 because the definition has changed on our watch,

482
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 in our lifetime, old definition,

483
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 "The ability or willingness to endure the existence of opinions

484
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 "or behavior that one dislikes or disagrees with,

485
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 "to endure, the ability to endure someone

486
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 "that you disagree with,

487
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 "who thinks in a way that you disagree with."

488
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 But new tolerance says,

489
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 new tolerance says, "Accepting different opinions as right."

490
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 Now this is completely crazy.

491
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 It is impossible for two people who believe opposites of each other

492
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 and they have to look at each other and say,

493
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 "Yeah, we're both right."

494
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 When you can't both be right.

495
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 This is a terrible definition of tolerance.

496
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 In fact, we are intolerant to old tolerance,

497
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 to what has always been tolerance

498
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 is what we've grown intolerant to.

499
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 And so why tolerate something God hates?

500
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 And you say, "Because I love."

501
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 That's right, you should love.

502
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 You should love.

503
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 And love is always gonna be paired with truth and grace.

504
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 And so don't tolerate evil, stand up against it courageously.

505
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 If you see a racial injustice, I hope you speak up.

506
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 If you see any kind of injustice,

507
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 I hope you're the loudest voice in the room.

508
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 And don't tolerate what God doesn't tolerate.

509
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 The only thing necessary for evil to prevail

510
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 is for good people to do nothing.

511
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 It's been well said.

512
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 The only thing necessary for evil to prevail

513
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 is for good people to do nothing.

514
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 And likewise, if a brother or sister in the faith

515
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 is bringing harm to themselves, help them.

516
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 And so there's this other part,

517
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 so let me just read the proverb to you again.

518
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 It says, "To fear the Lord is to hate evil.

519
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 "I hate pride and arrogance, evil behavior,

520
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 "and perverse speech."

521
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 And so here's what I would say here.

522
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 Don't be entertained by what Christ died for.

523
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 You hearing on that?

524
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 Like I just went on the Billboard chart yesterday

525
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 and just looked at the top five songs,

526
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 the number, that one, two, three, four, five songs.

527
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 And like you wouldn't believe

528
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 how much I think Satan glories in those songs.

529
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 Like what they said is crazy.

530
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 I'm talking about Nicki Minaj.

531
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 I'm talking about Cardi B.

532
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 I'm talking about Post Malone.

533
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 I'm talking about 6ix9ine.

534
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 And some of you are like, "No, not Post Malone.

535
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 "No, man, that's my boy."

536
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 Listen, I love the beat.

537
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 Can I tell you something?

538
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 Can I tell you something crazy?

539
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 I love the beat.

540
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 Man, I love it.

541
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 Like this brother's gifted, man.

542
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 But I'm afraid that that's how I'm gonna have

543
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 to explain it to Jesus.

544
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 Like we're gonna be like, "Dude, what were you doing?"

545
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 "Well, Jesus, did you hear the beat?"

546
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 (congregation laughing)

547
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 It was amazing.

548
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 No, I mean, I know what he was on about,

549
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 killing people and popping pills and calling girls.

550
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 I know, but the beat, Jesus.

551
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 (congregation laughing)

552
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 I remember being at a party right after I had become

553
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 a Christian, I had new ears, you know,

554
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 listening to everything through a new lens.

555
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 And it was my favorite song.

556
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 This was back in the day.

557
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 It was "Fitty Cent."

558
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 (congregation laughing)

559
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 And I had danced to this song like countless times.

560
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 Like loving, I was with some friends, we were dancing.

561
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 And I just started listening to the words.

562
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 I'm like, "Oh, oh, he's talking about raping women

563
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 "for profit and selling them and finding glory in that."

564
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 That's what I've been bobbing my head to.

565
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 I never even realized.

566
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 And I can only imagine how Satan just receives

567
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 that as worship.

568
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 Like just glories in that, man.

569
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 It brings him so much gladness in his heart.

570
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 Number seven, identify idols and rid your life of them.

571
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 Identify idols and rid your life of them.

572
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 Keep falsehood and lies far from me.

573
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 Give me neither poverty nor riches,

574
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 but give me only my daily bread.

575
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 Otherwise I have too much and disown you and say,

576
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 I might have too much and disown you and say,

577
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 who is the Lord?

578
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 Or I may become poor and still and so dishonor

579
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 the name of God.

580
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 It's Proverbs 30, verses eight and nine.

581
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 And so this is where Solomon ultimately missed it.

582
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 Where he married women who worshipped other gods,

583
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 who led him to worship other gods.

584
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 He followed them into worshipping other gods.

585
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 And so we think, hey, who has an idol?

586
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 And you think, well, I don't have an idol.

587
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 I don't have like a gold statue in my house

588
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 or a thing that I offer sacrifices to.

589
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 But so many of us tonight are worshipping idols

590
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 and you've gotta hear this.

591
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 And so it may be your work, okay.

592
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 It could be what you do for a living.

593
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 It could be working out.

594
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 Like you love to work out and you're looking in the mirror

595
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 and you're obsessed with your body

596
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 and you're constantly trying to figure out

597
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 where your body fat is or whatever.

598
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 It could be hobbies that you spend too much time doing.

599
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 It could be a relationship or a phone

600
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 or it could be marriage.

601
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 Like I said, if you have that Pinterest folder,

602
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 it could be marriage, right?

603
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 And you say, well, how do I know if it's an idol?

604
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 Well, does it control your emotions?

605
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 Because whatever controls your emotions

606
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 is what you worship.

607
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 Whatever makes you happy and sad,

608
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 that's an object of worship.

609
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 And maybe an idol you need to smash.

610
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 And so is God the most important thing in your life?

611
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 The only way I know to kill an idol

612
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 is to replace it with a greater idol.

613
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 And so you learn to love God more than any other thing

614
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 that your heart is chasing.

615
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 You feed your heart the things of God.

616
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 That your heart would grow a taste for God

617
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 and love God above everything else.

618
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 Number eight, become smaller.

619
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 Become smaller.

620
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 Or realize you are.

621
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 Proverbs 16, verse 18 says,

622
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 "Pride goes before destruction,

623
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 "a haughty spirit before a fall."

624
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 So this is relevant to you.

625
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 Like if you ever walk into a room

626
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 and you wonder what everyone is thinking about you.

627
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 Do they like my shirt?

628
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 Do they like my shoes?

629
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 What are they thinking about me?

630
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 Can I give you just a tip here?

631
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 I'm gonna tell you what they're thinking.

632
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 They're thinking, they're wondering

633
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 what you're thinking about them.

634
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 That's what they're thinking, okay?

635
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 That's where their mind is.

636
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 And so you can stop worrying

637
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 about what everybody's thinking about you.

638
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 Here's the truth about you.

639
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 You may not like this,

640
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 but you are unbelievably expendable.

641
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 When you're gone, the world is gonna miss you

642
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 for just a moment.

643
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 And then it's gonna move on.

644
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 And that's the truth.

645
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 But God loves you.

646
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 And if you've trusted in Christ,

647
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 he's prepared a place for you.

648
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 But right now on this earth,

649
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 you're one of 7.5 billion people.

650
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 And you're special, don't get me wrong.

651
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 You have infinite value.

652
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 You've been created in the image of God.

653
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 But you're special just like

654
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 the other 7.5 billion people are special.

655
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 Okay?

656
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 And it's just good to become small.

657
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 Because when you become big,

658
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 all the weight of the world is on your shoulders

659
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
 and that leads to panic and anxiety disorder

660
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 and everything else.

661
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 But when you become small, it's just like, okay.

662
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 It's like the pressure release valve.

663
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 It's like everything is going to be okay.

664
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 My five-year-old, we went out to eat Mexican food.

665
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
 And you know how some Mexican restaurants,

666
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 they do it big.

667
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 They got streamers and bright colors

668
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 and pinatas and sombreros

669
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 hanging from the ceiling and stuff.

670
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 That was this Mexican restaurant.

671
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 Pinatas everywhere.

672
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 And so my five-year-old walks in

673
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 and he's like, oh.

674
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
 And I'm like, why are you being weird?

675
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 What's going on?

676
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 And he's like, daddy, how did they know?

677
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 I'm like, how did they know what?

678
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 How did they know my birthday is in a week?

679
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
 You know?

680
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 He's like, they did all this for me?

681
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 And it's cute when you're five,

682
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 but not when you're 25.

683
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 Right?

684
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 You walk into a room and you think

685
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
 everything's about you.

686
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 It's not.

687
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
 It's not.

688
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
 You got a cameo in this movie

689
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 that's all about Jesus.

690
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
 And you're on the screen for about five seconds.

691
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 And that's the truth.

692
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 So live for him.

693
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 Number nine, practice patience.

694
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 Practice patience.

695
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 The wise store up choice food and olive oil,

696
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
 but fools gulp theirs down.

697
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 This is Proverbs 21, verse 20.

698
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 You may have heard good things come to those who wait.

699
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 I don't know if good things come to those who wait.

700
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:48,000
 I know that most good things come through waiting.

701
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
 That most things that are good are worth waiting for.

702
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 It's something called delayed gratification.

703
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 You need to learn it.

704
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 You need to know it.

705
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
 You need to live by it.

706
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,000
 You need to deprive your flesh of instant pleasure

707
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 in the moment so that you can have something greater.

708
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
 There's this story in Genesis chapter 25

709
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
 where two brothers, Jacob and Esau,

710
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
 Esau comes home from hunting and he's hungry

711
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 and Jacob has a bowl of stew.

712
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
 And he says, "Give me that stew.

713
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 "I'm starving to death."

714
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 And Jacob says, "Oh yeah?

715
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 "Well, I will give you some stew for your birthright."

716
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
 At this time, a birthright means an inheritance.

717
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 It means rights.

718
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
 It means you're your father's boy.

719
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 It comes with a lot of things.

720
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 But because he's hungry, he says,

721
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
 "What do I care about my birthright?

722
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
 "I'm hungry."

723
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
 And he trades his birthright for a cup of stew

724
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
 because he can't wait to eat.

725
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 Because he really wants something.

726
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
 Here's what I draw from that message.

727
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 Trust yourself the least

728
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 when you really, really want something.

729
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,000
 That is when you are the most untrustworthy.

730
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
 Trust yourself the least

731
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
 when you really want to treat yourself.

732
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 Trust yourself the least

733
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
 when you really want to treat yourself.

734
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 The sad truth of it is that most of you

735
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
 will never experience the intimacy

736
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
 that God desires for you

737
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
 because you've traded it for sex.

738
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,000
 What dogs do on the side of the road.

739
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:19,000
 And you will never experience the intimacy

740
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 as God intended.

741
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
 And you say, "Well, why would you give us

742
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
 "such a hopeless message?"

743
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
 No, it's not hopeless.

744
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
 Because I'm not saying it's not available to you.

745
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
 Okay?

746
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
 But I'm saying it comes through waiting and healing

747
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
 and a long season of patience

748
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,000
 that a lot of you won't take the time to endure.

749
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
 It downs the time.

750
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 To learn to not follow your flesh

751
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
 or follow your heart

752
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
 or do what feels good in a moment.

753
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,000
 And number 10, and this one helps with all the other ones.

754
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
 Learn to love accountability and ask for it.

755
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,000
 Learn to love accountability and ask for it.

756
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
 Proverbs 12, verse one says,

757
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
 "Whoever loves discipline loves knowledge,

758
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,000
 "but whoever hates correction is stupid."

759
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
 And this one could be, "Don't be stupid."

760
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
 There's this place in the Bible where God says,

761
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
 "Hey, this is what stupid people do.

762
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
 "They hate correction."

763
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
 And so you don't want to go at this alone.

764
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
 So here's what you might do.

765
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
 You might look back past those other one through nine

766
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,000
 and find the one that's most relevant to you.

767
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
 And you may text your community group right now

768
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
 and say, "Hey, let's talk about this one.

769
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
 "This is my area of struggle.

770
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
 "I want you guys or girls praying for me in this area.

771
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
 "I want you waging war with me in this area.

772
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,000
 "I want you asking me about this on a weekly basis.

773
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
 "Ask me if I'm lying to you,

774
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,000
 "and then ask me if I'm lying to you about lying to you

775
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
 "so that I could be free

776
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
 "and I could have the life that God desires for me

777
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,000
 "and that I'd be ready for whatever's next."

778
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
 Some of you have jumped in a community group

779
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
 and when it's hard, you jump out.

780
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 Can I tell you something?

781
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,000
 Community is not found, it's forged.

782
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
 It's not found, it's fought for.

783
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
 I got in a community group 16 years ago,

784
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
 potluck, didn't choose the guys and didn't like any of them,

785
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
 didn't have anything in common with any of them, okay?

786
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
 And I thought, "Hey, I'll never go back."

787
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
 But by the grace of God, the one thing I did right

788
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
 in a season where I did a lot of things wrong is I went back.

789
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
 And I kept going back every Thursday night.

790
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
 And I look back on that, and this is not an exaggeration.

791
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
 I say it all the time.

792
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:36,000
 God used that group of men more than any other thing

793
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,000
 to devour my life and to make me love him

794
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,000
 and to sanctify me, to call me into ministry,

795
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:50,000
 to heal my marriage, to rid my life of my porn addiction,

796
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,000
 to deal with my struggles.

797
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
 He used those men that I didn't even like.

798
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
 And I'm still running, I still run with the same men.

799
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
 We've added others to the group.

800
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
 Shane B is in my group.

801
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
 John Elmore is in my group.

802
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,000
 God, these guys that hold me accountable every single week.

803
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
 I texted them something last night.

804
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
 "Hey, would you pray for me?"

805
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,000
 This is something I just accidentally saw on my phone.

806
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,000
 "Would you pray for me?"

807
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
 And so now is the time to get wisdom.

808
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,000
 Now is the time to train for tomorrow's challenges.

809
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:32,000
 None of us want our life to look like a fail compilation.

810
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
 None of us want that.

811
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,000
 But, you know, it's funny because when we were at that park,

812
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
 that cable park, there were guys, there was this guy

813
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
 that went down off in front of me,

814
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
 and he went off that slide.

815
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
 He didn't look like I did.

816
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
 He did three flips and then dove.

817
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
 I'm like, "Dude, how'd he do that?"

818
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
 Here's what I know about that guy.

819
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,000
 That wasn't his first time.

820
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
 That guy trained for that. He had practice.

821
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
 And so it's different.

822
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
 Like when you think about athletes, right?

823
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
 Athletes train for an event.

824
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
 You would never just walk on at the Olympics

825
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
 at an event you've never done before

826
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
 because those guys have trained their whole lives for that.

827
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
 There's this idea that everything adds up,

828
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
 that every moment is training for a future moment.

829
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
 Here's the reality.

830
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
 You're all becoming something.

831
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
 Write that down.

832
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
 You're all becoming something.

833
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
 Listen, you want to be a good mom and a good wife

834
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
 or a good dad and a good husband?

835
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
 Good moms and good wives don't just happen.

836
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
 They don't just choose one day,

837
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,000
 "Hey, I know that I've been unfaithful my entire life,

838
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,000
 "and I've been promiscuous in my thoughts and my actions,

839
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
 "but now I'm going to be a great wife."

840
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
 Life doesn't work that way.

841
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
 Okay?

842
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
 "I don't like kids. I've never babysat.

843
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
 "I don't even enjoy being around children,

844
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
 "but I'm going to be a great mom."

845
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
 No, you're not.

846
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
 Okay?

847
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
 No, it's something that happens when you're 18,

848
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,000
 when you're 22, when you're 33,

849
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:02,000
 and you begin to pursue wisdom.

850
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,000
 None of us would just walk on in the Olympics.

851
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
 Every moment is training for a future moment.

852
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
 Everybody's becoming something.

853
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
 Let me show you a video of Louis Vito

854
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
 that paints this picture, a snowboarder.

855
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
 Would you watch this?

856
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
 Louis Vito didn't learn to snowboard

857
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:27,000
 by walking on at the Olympics, the X Games.

858
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
 He learned to snowboard when he got one for Christmas

859
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,000
 when he was three years old,

860
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
 and when he was in martial arts,

861
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,000
 and jumping on the trampoline when he was 16,

862
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
 and when he was skateboarding to school,

863
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
 and when he was spending hours and hours and hours

864
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
 and hours on the mountains.

865
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,000
 Right now, you are preparing for who you will be.

866
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
 That's the truth.

867
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
 That's the reality.

868
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:55,000
 Can I tell you something really important?

869
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,000
 If you don't know Jesus,

870
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,000
 the dumbest thing you could do is take this advice

871
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
 and try to avoid ruin in your life

872
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,000
 only to land in a place of eternal destruction.

873
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,000
 The smartest advice that you could take right now

874
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,000
 is to trust that Christ has died for your sins

875
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,000
 and that God has raised him from the dead

876
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
 and to live for him.

877
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
 But if you call yourself a Christian,

878
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
 if you say, "Hey, I'm a Christian,"

879
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
 would you just start living like a Christian?

880
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,000
 If you say, "Hey, I believe in God,"

881
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000
 would you just start believing in God,

882
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:41,000
 trusting in God?

883
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:47,000
 Small steps of faithfulness lead to faithful walks.

884
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
 Faithful walks with Jesus start with one foot

885
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
 in front of the other,

886
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
 long obedience in the same direction,

887
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
 trusting and obeying.

888
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
 Let me pray that you would.

889
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,000
 Father, thank you for these friends

890
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,000
 and for their desires to walk with you in faithfulness.

891
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:11,000
 Father, would you heal their hurts?

892
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
 Father, would you heal their addictions?

893
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
 Would you help them to have friends

894
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
 that can hold them accountable?

895
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:23,000
 Would you guide them in the path of life?

896
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
 Help them not to go the way that seems right

897
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,000
 but in the end leads to death?

898
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,000
 Father, would you help prepare them for whatever's next?

899
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
 Help them to be faithful today.

900
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,000
 Lord, we love you so much.

901
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,000
 We're thankful for your son, Jesus.

902
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
 It's in his name we pray.

903
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
 Amen.

904
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:57,000
