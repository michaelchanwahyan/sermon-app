00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,160
 (upbeat music)

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,740
 (upbeat music)

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:15,320
 (upbeat music)

5
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:34,220
 - All right, let's go.

6
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:35,520
 Hey, welcome everybody in the room,

7
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,200
 everybody joining us

8
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,640
 from all the different PortsLive locations,

9
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,680
 PortsIndy, PortsBoise, some of who is here,

10
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:47,160
 PortsCincinnati, PortsNorthHouston, Tulsa, Austin,

11
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,680
 all the different live locations.

12
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,960
 We're continuing this series, Point of View,

13
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,400
 looking at how they saw the Son of God

14
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,240
 when He was on this planet.

15
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,880
 And let me start with a little bit of a story.

16
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,880
 Around 11 months ago, my wife and I discovered

17
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:07,200
 that we were pregnant with our third child.

18
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,040
 And yeah, get excited, thanks for that.

19
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,520
 And shortly after that, a few months go by

20
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,640
 and we discover that we're having a son.

21
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,200
 So we've got a six-year-old boy now at the time he was five

22
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,960
 and then a three-year-old daughter

23
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,600
 and then we're gonna have a son that's gonna be born.

24
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,680
 And we picked out the name

25
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,040
 and he was gonna go by Bear, Bear Michael Marvin,

26
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,040
 like Bear Bryant or the animal.

27
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:34,000
 And my daughter was as perplexed,

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,360
 both my kids were very perplexed,

29
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,380
 and like, he's gonna go by Bear.

30
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,680
 So Crew is my son's name and Ro is my daughter's name.

31
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,160
 And my daughter goes, but Dad,

32
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,040
 in her like very list, but Daddy,

33
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,780
 how are we gonna call him Bear?

34
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:46,820
 We already have a bear.

35
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:47,660
 And I'm like, what do you mean?

36
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:49,520
 She's talking about her teddy bear.

37
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,840
 She's going, we already have that.

38
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,680
 We're gonna have two bears.

39
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,500
 It's gonna be confusing.

40
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,520
 I'm like, he's gonna start going by Teddy, okay?

41
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,860
 That's gonna be your new bear's name.

42
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,480
 And my son, we're driving in the car

43
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,680
 and this conversation's happening

44
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,760
 and I can see the wheels turning in his head

45
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,920
 and he's like, he's gonna go by Bear, Bear.

46
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,760
 And he goes, okay, I have a question.

47
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:10,460
 Let's say one day when he's grown up

48
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,840
 and we all go on a family bear hunt

49
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,500
 and we're out in the woods and we see a bear

50
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,560
 and I say, watch out for that bear.

51
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,600
 And he doesn't know we're talking about a real bear.

52
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,380
 He thinks we're talking about him.

53
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,680
 What are we gonna do then?

54
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,900
 And I was like, man, because we love bear hunts.

55
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,680
 If we ever go on a bear hunt,

56
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:34,000
 we will come up with another name that he will go by

57
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,320
 while we're on the bear hunt so that everything will be okay.

58
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,960
 And he's like, okay, that makes sense.

59
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,320
 And eventually nine months go by

60
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:46,000
 and Bear was born January 24th of this year

61
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,520
 and there he is, just little cutie

62
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,000
 and everything was great and healthy

63
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,200
 and he just was amazing.

64
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,120
 And then a week went by and we began to notice

65
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,160
 that he was having some problems with his eyes,

66
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,320
 specifically his right eye.

67
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:04,400
 And his right eye began to swell up and began to shut.

68
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,040
 And so we knew something's wrong.

69
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,880
 So we went to the hospital and they told us

70
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,920
 he has amniotic fluid trapped behind his eye.

71
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,200
 And we thought it was maybe a tear duct

72
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,840
 or just something, you know, irritated it.

73
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,480
 And they said, no, you don't get that out.

74
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,360
 It could damage his optic nerve

75
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,020
 and the fluid can even get to his brain,

76
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:24,740
 which confused me because I would assume

77
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,240
 there's more compartments in there

78
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,440
 that can keep things separated.

79
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,800
 But they said, no, you gotta make sure you get that out

80
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,920
 or his vision will be impacted.

81
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,000
 And so for the next seven days,

82
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,080
 every single day we had to go to the hospital

83
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,720
 and they had to treat him and treat his eye

84
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,160
 to restore back his vision.

85
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,560
 Now fast forward in today, I mean,

86
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,520
 here's a picture of him from yesterday

87
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,920
 where he is just happy as can be, smiles, you can't see it.

88
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,800
 But this is like the greatest stage ever

89
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,380
 where they're just chunks and they look like

90
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,560
 they have rubber bands attached all over their arms

91
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,760
 like Popeye or something 'cause there's just rolls.

92
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,680
 And he's fully healthy.

93
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,320
 And that eye treatment that we went through

94
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,760
 was significant because they basically said,

95
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,960
 hey, if you don't address these,

96
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,920
 it's going to impair his vision for the rest of his life.

97
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,760
 Now what does that have to do

98
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,480
 with what we're talking about tonight?

99
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,840
 Well, in this series, we are attempting to

100
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:19,840
 treat the flawed vision that many of us have

101
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:25,120
 when it comes to how we view God.

102
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,480
 And we're doing so by looking at the point of view

103
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,500
 of people who had encounters with Jesus

104
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,680
 when he was on the planet.

105
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,900
 And so every week we're attempting to go through,

106
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,800
 like my son in the hospital, his treatment

107
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,480
 to help address and correct the flawed perspectives

108
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:45,040
 and visions that a lot of us have when it comes to God.

109
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,640
 Because how you see God is,

110
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:50,840
 one famous theologian named A.W. Tozer famously said,

111
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,540
 "What comes to mind when you think of God

112
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:55,280
 "is what is the most important thing about someone."

113
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,760
 Because it determines if you run to him

114
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,280
 or away from him in the midst of failure.

115
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,440
 It determines if you're gonna be willing to trust him

116
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,320
 and trust his word as it relates to

117
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,560
 how you should think about life, money, finances,

118
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,040
 dating, love, relationships.

119
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,600
 Are you gonna trust him or not?

120
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,480
 Our perspective on who God is shapes our future.

121
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,080
 It's currently shaping our lives.

122
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,800
 And so we're attempting to walk through

123
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,500
 and get a correct perspective on what God is like.

124
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,140
 Because Jesus on the planet

125
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:28,620
 is the image of the invisible God.

126
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,560
 So when we look at Jesus, we're looking at God.

127
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,020
 We're able to know what he's actually like.

128
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:37,220
 And my heart tonight is that some of us that came in here

129
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:44,060
 who think that God is looking at you with disappointment,

130
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,920
 frustration, apathy,

131
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:54,160
 looking to catch you, shame you,

132
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,200
 will have an encounter and see Jesus in a more clear way.

133
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,240
 And I think some of us are gonna walk away

134
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,320
 and like the man we're gonna look at, never be the same.

135
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,160
 So we're gonna look at a story in Luke chapter 19.

136
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,280
 It's one of the more famous stories.

137
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,880
 If you grew up in church, you're familiar with it.

138
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,760
 But it's a story of an interaction between Jesus

139
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,720
 and the wealthiest man in the New Testament.

140
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,840
 And there's a song related to this man

141
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,040
 and his name was Zacchaeus.

142
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,840
 And Zacchaeus was a?

143
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,600
 A wee little man, there you go.

144
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,540
 Man, if they were writing that song today,

145
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,340
 that would be canceled very fast.

146
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:34,280
 But Zacchaeus was not just a wee little man.

147
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:39,280
 We're gonna see he was a hated man, and rightfully so.

148
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,900
 And Jesus does some very interesting things.

149
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,040
 And candidly, for those of you who do know the song,

150
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:47,360
 my greatest concern is that you're so familiar

151
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:52,360
 with the story, you've almost been inoculated

152
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:58,760
 or vaccinated from its power.

153
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,480
 Because you're so familiar with it

154
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:05,480
 that the radical ways it shocked the audience present,

155
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,940
 it shocked the man who was a part of it,

156
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:12,940
 and has shocked the church in history since, maybe lost.

157
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:16,560
 And so let me pray, and I'm gonna read the text

158
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,920
 one more time.

159
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,120
 Father, I pray that you would allow us to see

160
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,520
 what Zacchaeus and those near him saw that day.

161
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:29,360
 Which is to say, you'd allow us to see you as you are,

162
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,160
 not as we think, not as we're told,

163
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:36,160
 not as any other thing, but as who you are.

164
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:42,280
 And you would allow us to walk away, never the same, amen.

165
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:45,240
 So this starts in Luke chapter 19.

166
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,820
 Jesus is in the last week of his life on earth.

167
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,840
 So he's got very few days left.

168
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,920
 He's headed to Jerusalem to go be crucified.

169
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,960
 And he goes through a town called Jericho,

170
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,800
 and it says this in verse one.

171
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,800
 Now he, Jesus, entered Jericho and was passing through.

172
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:07,240
 And behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus.

173
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:12,240
 He was a chief tax collector and was rich.

174
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,920
 And he was seeking to see Jesus.

175
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:18,680
 He was seeking to see who Jesus was.

176
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,420
 But on account of the crowd, he could not,

177
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:24,040
 because he was small in stature.

178
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,340
 So he ran on ahead and he climbed up

179
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,940
 into a sycamore tree to see him,

180
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,900
 for he was about to pass that way.

181
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:36,240
 When Jesus came to the place, he looked up,

182
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,240
 and he said to him, Zacchaeus, hurry and come down,

183
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:45,440
 for I must stay at your house today.

184
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,780
 So he hurried and he came down and received him joyfully.

185
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:52,880
 And when they, the crowd, saw it, they grumbled and said,

186
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,440
 he's gone in to be the guest of a man who is a sinner.

187
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:03,440
 And Zacchaeus, sometime in the midst of the conversation

188
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,320
 and meal, experiences a radical change,

189
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,980
 and he stands up and says to the Lord,

190
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:13,980
 behold, Lord, half of my goods I give to the poor.

191
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:17,000
 If I have defrauded anyone of anything,

192
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 I will restore it fourfold, or four times what I took.

193
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,440
 And Jesus said to him, today salvation has come

194
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,440
 to this house, since he also is a son of Abraham.

195
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,560
 For the son of man, that's Jesus,

196
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:39,080
 came to seek and to save the lost.

197
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,080
 I wanna look at three things that we take away

198
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,120
 from this story, all of them have SOS,

199
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,580
 so if you take notes, it'll be easy to go along with.

200
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:48,720
 But first, I wanna talk about what Zacchaeus saw

201
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,200
 when he saw the Savior, and seeing him correctly,

202
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,320
 and what that included.

203
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,960
 And so the first idea I wanna pull from the text

204
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,960
 is seeing the Savior.

205
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,040
 Let me recap what just happened.

206
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,640
 Jesus, he's on his way to Jerusalem,

207
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,440
 he's got a big crowd that's going around him.

208
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:03,440
 His fame at this point is widespread.

209
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,920
 Word has traveled out, because a few chapters earlier,

210
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,000
 or a few weeks before, Jesus raised a man from the dead.

211
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,840
 And the moment you do that, just tip,

212
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,080
 your fame begins to explode everywhere.

213
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,840
 And so he brings the guy back to life,

214
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,520
 and Jesus is now a rock star.

215
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,580
 Everywhere he goes, there's crowds all around him.

216
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:20,880
 There's one crowd that's here,

217
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,440
 and he's walking through Jericho.

218
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,300
 What do you know about Jericho?

219
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:27,760
 Jericho was called by a historian at the time,

220
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,000
 the fattest city that existed.

221
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,560
 In other words, it was the most prosperous city

222
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,640
 in all of Palestine.

223
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,200
 It was the wealthiest.

224
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,000
 Today, you can go see all the palm branches.

225
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,560
 It looks like Palm Springs.

226
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,200
 And it was the center of enormous wealth.

227
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,880
 And he walks through, and he encounters a man

228
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:52,260
 who is described as being someone of enormous wealth.

229
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,680
 And his name is Zacchaeus.

230
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,640
 And we're told a few things about him.

231
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,200
 One, that he's short in stature.

232
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,320
 We're told that he's rich.

233
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,080
 And we're told he's a chief tax collector.

234
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,060
 Now, what's a chief tax collector?

235
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:04,280
 Now, a tax collector,

236
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,800
 there's really no modern equivalent

237
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,040
 inside of our society for this,

238
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,600
 but I'll try to describe why it was so hated

239
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,520
 and why he was so rejected by the people he was around.

240
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:15,640
 A tax collector had purchased the right

241
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,860
 from the Roman Empire, which had conquered the known world.

242
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:21,400
 They basically, as Rome established itself,

243
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,840
 it said, man, we need to get taxes

244
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,720
 and have people pay us taxes.

245
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,880
 So I know what we'll do.

246
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,920
 We'll get people that live in these areas

247
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,400
 like Judea or Jerusalem,

248
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,840
 and they can buy the right to say,

249
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,480
 hey, I will give you a million denarii,

250
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,920
 or I will give you this fixed price

251
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,080
 so that I can now have the right to go tax these people.

252
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,520
 And I'll give you that amount of money,

253
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,520
 and I get to add on top of it whatever I want.

254
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,200
 And Rome basically said, that's great.

255
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,480
 And so for Jews, tax collectors were people

256
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,860
 who had said, I don't believe the Jewish God.

257
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,000
 I don't want anything to do with them,

258
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,760
 and I don't mind enriching myself

259
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,340
 at the expense of other people.

260
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:58,100
 I'm gonna finance the oppression of people around me.

261
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:02,420
 And he wasn't just a tax collector.

262
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:05,400
 It says he was a chief tax collector.

263
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,680
 He's a trivia answer to a Bible trivia question.

264
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,240
 There's only one chief tax collector in all of the Bible.

265
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,940
 He's at the head of the pyramid scheme.

266
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:15,500
 He's got tax collectors working underneath him.

267
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,920
 And it makes sense why Zacchaeus was such a hated person,

268
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,000
 that he would show up,

269
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,340
 and he had the strength of the Roman centurions

270
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,340
 and the Roman army with him,

271
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:25,140
 and he'd say, hey, you need to pay me,

272
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:29,240
 an additional 50% on top of the taxes you're already paying,

273
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,280
 and if people wouldn't pay up,

274
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,180
 then he would just take things from them.

275
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:34,080
 He had the strength of Rome,

276
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:38,500
 and the ability to mistreat and abuse people,

277
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,280
 and he had done so and enriched himself.

278
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:45,180
 And then he hears about Jesus.

279
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:48,780
 And he hears of this man who's given sight to the blind.

280
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:52,440
 He's long, Zacchaeus has walked away from his faith,

281
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,560
 but he still knows the stories.

282
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,920
 He would have heard as a little Jewish boy

283
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:57,180
 of the Messiah, and when he comes,

284
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,400
 and the miracles he would do,

285
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,160
 and people were beginning to say he may be the Messiah,

286
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,800
 and so he's intrigued, and word comes,

287
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,760
 hey, Jesus is on his way into town.

288
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:10,240
 Zacchaeus decides, I just wanna go see him.

289
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,240
 And he gets to the crowd, and he's too small, we're told.

290
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,760
 It's like Danny DeVito, who I don't even know

291
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,720
 if you guys know who that is,

292
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,320
 but he's basically unable to see around,

293
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,600
 and so he decides, I know what I'm gonna do.

294
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,440
 There's a tree right there.

295
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,320
 I'm gonna climb up the tree,

296
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,600
 and he climbs up into the tree,

297
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,400
 and Jesus is walking along,

298
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,760
 and Zacchaeus just wanted to see him,

299
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:32,180
 and he gets Jesus walking right next to the tree,

300
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:37,160
 and he stops, and he looks up,

301
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:40,840
 and says, Zacchaeus.

302
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,200
 Now, they've had no interaction before,

303
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,960
 so Zacchaeus is like, he knows my name?

304
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,480
 I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing,

305
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,560
 and he says, hurry down.

306
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,320
 I need to stay at your house today,

307
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,280
 and Zacchaeus sees his Savior

308
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:59,320
 and sees what anyone who knows Jesus understands,

309
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:04,320
 at least in part, that he is a God who seeks after sinners,

310
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,760
 and seeing our Savior, we see he's a God

311
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,840
 that seeks after sinful, broken people

312
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,640
 because that's all the people that there are,

313
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:17,320
 and anyone inside of this room

314
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,280
 who has baggage inside of their past

315
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:25,240
 is a perfect candidate or in their present

316
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,560
 for someone that God wants to seek,

317
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,040
 and now, whenever we think of Jesus

318
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:29,880
 seeking the marginalized,

319
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,880
 it's hard to equate into our mind

320
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,560
 because part of us goes, man,

321
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,520
 I just, he's always going after the bad guys

322
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,320
 and the marginalized and the prostitutes.

323
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,200
 That's just Jesus.

324
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,040
 That's who I love,

325
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,120
 but if you were in the crowd,

326
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,960
 you weren't going, I'd love that.

327
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,200
 This is the most hated man around.

328
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,240
 I mean, I was trying to think of an equivalent today

329
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,440
 of who's the most hated person in society,

330
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,560
 and I could pick some political names on either side

331
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,560
 that would really quickly expose.

332
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,960
 I mean, the person that if you saw me

333
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,520
 taking a picture with on the 'gram,

334
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,320
 the comments are gonna light up of,

335
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,720
 how dare you take a picture with that person,

336
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,800
 and don't you know, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah?

337
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,400
 And so I don't know who that is for you,

338
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,280
 but the person that you would go, that's not right,

339
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:10,880
 or don't you know what you're communicating

340
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:15,400
 by associating with him is exactly the person,

341
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:21,280
 and Zacchaeus sees what maybe some of us have missed,

342
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:24,960
 that our God is a God who seeks after sinners,

343
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,920
 and seeing Jesus, we see he's a God who seeks after.

344
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,320
 In other words, there is no one who is an acceptance

345
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:35,320
 or exception to having God's acceptance through Christ.

346
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:38,200
 There is no one who's an exception

347
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:42,640
 to having God's acceptance in Christ.

348
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,680
 In other words, the part of you that thinks,

349
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,800
 man, because of the decisions I made last week,

350
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,940
 or decisions I made last weekend, I can't show up on church,

351
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:57,720
 because of the fact that, man,

352
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:01,280
 I've just been wrestling with pornography for so long,

353
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,600
 God doesn't want anything to do with me,

354
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,700
 or because of the shame I carry from a past abortion,

355
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:08,720
 I know God loves me 'cause he loves the world,

356
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,920
 but he doesn't want me.

357
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:14,000
 Zacchaeus would say, man, you're not seeing the Savior

358
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,160
 that I saw that day, 'cause he seeks after sinners.

359
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,880
 You don't have to clean yourself up first

360
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,720
 in order to have a relationship.

361
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:22,040
 Zacchaeus didn't do anything but climb a tree,

362
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,600
 and he was sought after by God.

363
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,160
 That part of us that feels like we need to clean up,

364
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,560
 Jesus would say, it's not just untrue,

365
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,760
 it's not possible apart from him.

366
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:38,280
 Like that tendency, like in my house or with my life,

367
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,600
 there'll be times where we'll host a Christmas party

368
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,940
 for a community group, or host family over

369
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,940
 for some holiday, and when that happens,

370
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,080
 gentlemen, let me just prepare you

371
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,000
 for what's gonna happen someday

372
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,880
 when you're married and your wife,

373
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,720
 she's gonna look at you, and she's gonna go

374
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,680
 into full clean mode, like we need to shove

375
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,280
 these things in closets, we need to make it look

376
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,080
 like no one has ever even lived here.

377
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,080
 We're lighting candles and putting them in bathrooms,

378
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,900
 I don't even know we had these candles before,

379
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:01,560
 she's busting out music and playing

380
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:04,120
 some new Taylor Swift album softly in the background,

381
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,220
 and I walk in, she's in an apron baking brownies,

382
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:08,680
 I'm like, I've never even eaten a brownie bake before.

383
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,200
 She just goes into full,

384
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,940
 we are gonna put our best foot forward,

385
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:16,780
 which is ironic because it's often like our family

386
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:18,820
 and closest friends, and we're like,

387
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:21,460
 we can't let them know what's actually happening here.

388
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:27,820
 And it's funny, but when it comes to God,

389
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:29,300
 that's how a lot of us feel,

390
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:32,420
 as though like we could hide things in closets

391
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:34,500
 and get them together, and man, if I had enough quiet times,

392
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,600
 then he's okay with me coming to him,

393
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:42,040
 which is crazy, 'cause he knows everything.

394
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,100
 He knows everything you've ever done,

395
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:43,980
 everything you ever will do.

396
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:47,760
 He knows sins you will commit in 2027

397
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,520
 that you don't even know about yet.

398
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,980
 And he said it's paid for.

399
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:56,720
 And whatever perspective you had on God

400
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,000
 when you came to this room, Zacchaeus would say,

401
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,040
 "You can't leave not knowing he is a God.

402
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:06,220
 "If you're gonna see our Savior who seeks after sinners,

403
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:09,080
 "I can speak from experience."

404
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:13,620
 And then he does something really interesting.

405
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:18,360
 We're given a glimpse into Jesus' focus on this man.

406
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:21,640
 Like Zacchaeus, as I said, he was focused on seeing Jesus.

407
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:27,840
 Jesus was focused on saving Zacchaeus.

408
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,120
 And he walks underneath, and he knows exactly

409
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,080
 where Zacchaeus is, and he goes to the tree,

410
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,480
 and he goes to the spot, and he knows who the man is,

411
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,500
 and he says something he says

412
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,620
 in only one place in the New Testament.

413
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:46,320
 Zacchaeus, hurry down, hurry, come on, hurry.

414
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,760
 In other words, there's no other place in the Bible.

415
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,800
 Jesus is often, he's just not in a hurry.

416
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,500
 And the one encounter that we have where he says,

417
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,820
 "Man, I am passionate about being with you.

418
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,240
 "Hurry down, I'm not gonna wait.

419
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,080
 "You get down here.

420
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,260
 "I can't wait to be inside of your house."

421
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,620
 And then he calls him by name.

422
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:01,720
 You know what's ironic about that?

423
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,320
 You know what the name Zacchaeus means?

424
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,640
 This man who had been seen.

425
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,240
 Rabbis taught that if you were a tax collector,

426
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,280
 you can't go to temple,

427
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,980
 you can't go worship among God's people.

428
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,360
 They taught that if you went into the home

429
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,440
 of a tax collector or had them in your home,

430
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,880
 anything that they sat on would become unclean.

431
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,600
 It was taught that rabbis,

432
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,480
 which is just Jewish teachers of the day, would say,

433
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,220
 "Hey, it's not a sin to lie to a tax collector

434
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:22,920
 "because they're less than human."

435
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:27,440
 How long, and he'd been treated this way,

436
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,340
 and he'd only gone further and further.

437
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,240
 I mean, he's not a tax collector who just started.

438
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,920
 He is the chief of the tax collectors.

439
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,200
 10 years, 20 years.

440
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,400
 How long it had been since somebody

441
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,660
 had even been in his home.

442
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:42,400
 Sure, he's got the ride, the Lambo, the mansion,

443
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,000
 but it's empty.

444
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,040
 Just like Zacchaeus' heart.

445
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:54,280
 And the son of God says,

446
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:57,140
 "Man, I'm in a hurry to be with you.

447
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:59,220
 "You come down."

448
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:05,560
 The name Zacchaeus means innocent or pure.

449
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:11,840
 His Jewish parents named him right,

450
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,160
 and at some point he took a turn

451
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,240
 and became anything but innocent and pure.

452
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:20,040
 And Jesus says, "I'm about to help you

453
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:22,000
 "be what your name means,

454
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,260
 "and I'm gonna call you innocent and pure,

455
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:27,480
 "and you come down."

456
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,880
 And then they go to his house.

457
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,600
 We're told the crowd begins to grumble.

458
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,880
 In verse eight it says,

459
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,480
 "They're having this meal,

460
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,280
 "and something shifts in Zacchaeus."

461
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,880
 Maybe it was just the fact that he's sitting

462
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,360
 and he's looking into the eyes of somebody,

463
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,200
 and they looked at him in a way that he hadn't felt

464
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,680
 since maybe like his mom had looked at him

465
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,020
 or somebody who loved him.

466
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:53,060
 And he's conversing with them.

467
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:56,280
 Something shifts, and Zacchaeus begins to go,

468
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,760
 "Man, I'm leaving everything.

469
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,000
 "I'm changing jobs.

470
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 "I'm giving it away.

471
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,260
 "I'm making wrongs right."

472
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,560
 Maybe in the midst of the conversation,

473
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,920
 Jesus miraculously brought up things

474
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,880
 as he does in other places in the New Testament,

475
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,120
 and Zacchaeus knew this is not a normal man.

476
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,760
 Maybe he brought up names of his siblings

477
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,800
 or something he experienced when he was a child

478
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,760
 or some reason that Jesus said,

479
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,520
 "I remember when you got into tax collecting.

480
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,460
 "I remember the day that you walked away from God

481
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:26,200
 "because of the disappointment you faced."

482
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,120
 We're not even told,

483
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,120
 but he has some conversation with Jesus,

484
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,120
 and halfway through the lunch, he stands up and says,

485
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:36,320
 "Lord, I'm leaving it all,

486
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,580
 "and I'm gonna give half of my possessions

487
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,420
 "away to the poor."

488
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,600
 This is the richest man around.

489
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,640
 This is Elon Musk standing up saying,

490
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,560
 "I'm not buying Twitter.

491
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,900
 "I'm giving half of the things that I own away,

492
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,500
 "and the other half I'm gonna keep

493
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,240
 "'cause I'm gonna go and I'm gonna make every wrong

494
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,420
 "that I've done right,

495
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:53,640
 "and I'm gonna show up in people that I've stolen from.

496
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,440
 "I'm not just gonna give 'em back what I've stolen.

497
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,160
 "I'm gonna give 'em four times as much."

498
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,840
 Imagine the guy who ripped you off,

499
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,700
 stole $10,000 from you,

500
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,900
 and he shows up at your door and says,

501
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,960
 "Man, I met Jesus.

502
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,840
 "Here's $40,000.

503
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:07,980
 "I'm really sorry."

504
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:10,880
 That's exactly what happened

505
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:16,560
 because Zacchaeus, in seeing our Savior,

506
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:20,440
 he also shows us how we see our salvation.

507
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:25,420
 Jesus says, "Salvation came to this house."

508
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:27,300
 In other words, this is not lip service.

509
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,020
 This is a changed man.

510
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:31,340
 The second point I wanna highlight is seeing our salvation.

511
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:33,140
 The Bible says that two things are made apart

512
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:36,380
 of someone experiencing salvation.

513
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:40,020
 The first is that they have to see themselves as a sinner.

514
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,160
 In other words, one of the barriers

515
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,220
 to people becoming a believer,

516
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,720
 and candidly, some of you guys in the room,

517
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:46,820
 is you think that, "Yeah, I'm not perfect,

518
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:50,180
 "but if I give enough to charity

519
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:52,340
 "and I'm a nice person and I don't commit adultery

520
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:55,220
 "or kill anybody and I just try to be good

521
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:58,220
 "and follow the way, then I'll get to go to heaven."

522
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:01,420
 And that's not true at all.

523
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:04,780
 The Bible says you're unable to save yourself,

524
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:06,220
 and if you don't see yourself as a sinner,

525
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:08,420
 you're never gonna have a need for a Savior,

526
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:11,860
 that you need a solution that, on your own,

527
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:12,900
 you can't provide.

528
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:15,100
 A couple months ago, we went to Indianapolis,

529
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,460
 and we were up there, and we were at the porch,

530
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:19,460
 Indianapolis, and while we were there,

531
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:21,860
 the person who basically invited us

532
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:24,420
 and had us come speak, he rented a car for us,

533
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:25,620
 and we showed up, and he said,

534
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:28,940
 "Hey, man, I got you a Tesla rental car.

535
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,760
 "Just wanted you guys to have fun.

536
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,160
 "And I don't know how you roll,

537
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,380
 "I'm not exactly a Tesla."

538
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:34,780
 Man, that's a lot about Elon tonight,

539
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,420
 but, "I'm not exactly a Tesla person.

540
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:37,420
 "I've never driven a Tesla."

541
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:38,480
 So we get in it, and it's like,

542
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,160
 "Man, I'm not sure exactly how this works,

543
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,620
 "and I'm looking for the keys, and there's no keys."

544
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:44,820
 And I'm like, "Man, there's gotta be,

545
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,460
 "it's surely, it's around here."

546
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:48,020
 And I'm with Josiah, and he's looking for it,

547
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:50,620
 and we're trying to find, "How do you do this?"

548
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:52,700
 And we're like, "On, on!"

549
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:56,820
 Trying to do anything we can to get this car to start,

550
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,740
 'cause we don't know what we're doing.

551
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,800
 And eventually, I'm like, "Man, we're running late.

552
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,100
 "We are gonna be late."

553
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:05,740
 I just pull up YouTube and go, "How do you start a Tesla?"

554
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:10,020
 And it turns out, there's a card

555
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:12,300
 that you have to put in a very specific thing,

556
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:16,300
 or location, and that turns on the car.

557
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,780
 Whatever reason, that's how they describe it.

558
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:20,060
 That's how you do it.

559
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:23,540
 Now, that scenario, we could've either sat there

560
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:27,180
 and been unable to move, and continued to attempt

561
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:30,180
 to figure it out on our own, or make the decision,

562
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:33,180
 "I'm not gonna arrive at this on my own."

563
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:36,020
 And that's the same with eternal life,

564
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,580
 and knowing Jesus in this life,

565
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,480
 that it's something you can't arrive at on your own.

566
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,900
 Having a relationship with God,

567
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,820
 and the right to be with Him for eternity,

568
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,660
 you will never get there on your own.

569
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:48,500
 And it requires doing what Zacchaeus saw,

570
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:51,020
 of, "Man, I see I'm a sinner."

571
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:52,940
 And this is where he had an interesting

572
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:55,940
 head start on the crowd.

573
00:24:55,940 --> 00:25:02,020
 'Cause you remember, the crowd said,

574
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:04,380
 "Does he not know?

575
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:07,300
 "Do you not know who you're associating yourself

576
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,500
 "with, a sinner?"

577
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:11,900
 And Zacchaeus knew.

578
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,260
 Jesus knew.

579
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:18,180
 What they didn't know is that

580
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:21,900
 he only associates with sinners.

581
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:27,220
 The only people who've ever lived are sinners.

582
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:29,940
 And you can't experience salvation,

583
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,220
 and have a need for a Savior,

584
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:34,900
 if you don't see yourself as a sinner,

585
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:35,740
 and someone broken.

586
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:37,580
 And if that's the case, if that's how you see,

587
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:41,060
 you are the perfect candidate for experiencing God's grace.

588
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:43,500
 The second thing we see about what makes up salvation,

589
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:47,460
 is that it comes not through a process, but a person.

590
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:50,420
 Salvation comes through a person, not a process.

591
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:54,020
 Jesus said, "Salvation came to this man's house,

592
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:56,100
 "like I walked in his door."

593
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,940
 Salvation came in this door.

594
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:59,540
 Christianity has never taught,

595
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:01,340
 salvation is something that you earn,

596
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:03,420
 and you must do a bunch of good works,

597
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:05,420
 keep the sacraments, and if you do enough,

598
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:06,860
 and if you don't, then you're gonna lose it.

599
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:08,380
 Salvation doesn't come through a process.

600
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:10,580
 It doesn't come through a mantra, it comes through a man.

601
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:12,780
 Doesn't come through a process, it comes through a person.

602
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,740
 And that person is named Jesus.

603
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:18,340
 And when you encounter him, everything begins to change.

604
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:19,220
 That's the third thing we see,

605
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:21,300
 is his salvation impacted his life.

606
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,480
 It led to a life change.

607
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,500
 But it wasn't a life change directed by law.

608
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,540
 That doesn't change.

609
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:29,940
 This extravagant, over the top,

610
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:32,100
 giving fourfold back from what you stole,

611
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,580
 that's well beyond what the Old Testament even taught.

612
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:37,140
 If you rob somebody, you gotta pay this.

613
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:38,340
 It's four times as much.

614
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:41,260
 It's like, he's just in love.

615
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:42,500
 He does what you do when you're in love.

616
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,060
 He's going, man, I'm giving it all away.

617
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:50,060
 He experienced a love that led to a life change.

618
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:52,820
 And this is why, tell me, guys, you come around,

619
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,340
 maybe it's your first time here, and you got friends,

620
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:56,140
 and they just love the porch, and they talk about it,

621
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:57,420
 and it's beginning to impact their life.

622
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:59,020
 Jesus is beginning to impact their life.

623
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:00,380
 And you begin to see them change.

624
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:01,300
 You know why they change?

625
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:03,180
 It's not because they come and they lead a,

626
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,900
 or we read a big list of rules,

627
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,580
 and you need to stop doing this, and you need to do this,

628
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:08,540
 and this, and this, and this, and then God will love you.

629
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:11,780
 They experience the love of God, and they begin to change.

630
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:13,540
 So they begin to know,

631
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:15,460
 because of God's acceptance inside of me,

632
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:17,260
 it's just doing something in my life.

633
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,500
 And the way I used to date,

634
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,060
 I just don't date that way anymore.

635
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:22,380
 In fact, even trying to pick up girls at the bar,

636
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:24,780
 I just find myself unable, I'm not as good, I can't do it.

637
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:28,980
 I'm like, hey, girl, do you, you own a Bible?

638
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:33,980
 And you're just experiencing God's love

639
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:36,220
 begin to change you.

640
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:38,020
 Like some of you guys, I've seen it.

641
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:40,780
 The way you dress, it's beginning to shift,

642
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:42,220
 'cause you used to dress and go, man,

643
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:43,180
 how, what do I need to wear

644
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:45,580
 that's gonna bring the most attention to me?

645
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,340
 And now you ask, hey, what am I gonna wear

646
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:50,220
 that could distract from attention being on God?

647
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:54,340
 And it's because, not some law,

648
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:56,900
 like the love of God got introduced,

649
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:58,380
 and it's beginning to impact your life,

650
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,300
 'cause that's what leads to lasting life change.

651
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:04,000
 And it's what happened with Zacchaeus in this story.

652
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,500
 It's not dissimilar to this.

653
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:09,020
 Whenever, I mentioned getting married,

654
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,260
 it's like that relationship,

655
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:12,820
 and I got married to my wife almost 10 years ago.

656
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:14,580
 Having that relationship introduced

657
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:18,500
 began to produce tremendous change.

658
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:21,540
 And it began to change how I use my time,

659
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:24,740
 began to use how I money, what I spend on.

660
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:27,540
 And so it went from like, man, I'm sleeping on a futon,

661
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:30,740
 to I'm sleeping on a comforter with 97 pillows.

662
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:33,060
 I used to be in a flag football league,

663
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:34,980
 and now I'm a member at the Arboretum.

664
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:37,620
 And just life begins to change,

665
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:39,980
 and how you spend your time, and what you watch,

666
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:41,740
 and used to eat dinners where guys,

667
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:43,500
 I know you're in the room, bro, I was one of you.

668
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,460
 Well, you get home, and you're like,

669
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:46,100
 man, is it gonna be a Hot Pocket night,

670
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:49,420
 or just something else, leftovers, or pizza for breakfast?

671
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:50,620
 And now you're gonna sit down,

672
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:52,860
 and you're gonna have a dinner, and you're gonna talk,

673
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:55,180
 and there's gonna be a longer meal.

674
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:57,980
 And that relationship just brings about change.

675
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:58,880
 And you know what?

676
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,500
 When you step into that relationship,

677
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,220
 it's not a change that you resist.

678
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:06,420
 Because you're in love, it's a change you welcome.

679
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:07,940
 And that's what we experience in Christ,

680
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:11,620
 and that's what Zacchaeus experienced in that moment.

681
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:13,660
 And then finally, we're introduced

682
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:19,800
 to the most powerful mission statement Jesus would ever give

683
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:23,740
 where in verse 10, Jesus lays out,

684
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:26,340
 "Here's why I'm here.

685
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:29,920
 "Here's God's passion.

686
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:33,620
 "Here is God's focus.

687
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:36,260
 "Here's what I'm about."

688
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:40,380
 In other words, companies have mission statements.

689
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:43,600
 Amazon to provide a place where you can get anything

690
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,060
 to anyone, anywhere.

691
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:49,380
 Or Nike to provide athletic wear,

692
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:51,000
 whatever the mission statement is,

693
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,340
 that your company has one probably that you work for,

694
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:54,940
 and they have a mission statement that shapes

695
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:57,620
 what we're about and how we decide and make decisions.

696
00:29:57,620 --> 00:30:00,620
 And Jesus gives us, here's the mission statement of God.

697
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:01,860
 And it's also the mission statement

698
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,820
 of anyone who loves Jesus.

699
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:07,340
 Because when you love Jesus, you love what Jesus loves.

700
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:10,060
 And he says this in verse 10.

701
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:14,880
 "For the Son of Man," which is Jesus,

702
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:21,060
 "came to seek and to save the lost."

703
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:24,980
 Do you guys know why I'm here?

704
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:27,860
 Like I'm gonna give sight to the blind,

705
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,100
 I'm gonna raise somebody from the dead,

706
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,500
 and I'm gonna do a bunch of miracles.

707
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,440
 But do you know why I'm here?

708
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:35,500
 Do you know what moves the heart of God?

709
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:42,220
 Seeking and saving the lost, every lost person,

710
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,340
 everyone you've ever seen.

711
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,820
 When I talked about the most hated person,

712
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:46,020
 whatever comes into your mind,

713
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:46,940
 the person that you'd be like,

714
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:49,140
 "I can't believe that that person

715
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:50,940
 "would associate with him."

716
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:54,700
 You know what Jesus' top concern for them is?

717
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,980
 Seek and save them.

718
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:00,740
 You know what Jesus' top concern for every person

719
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:03,320
 that you work with, regardless of what they claim

720
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,700
 is their gender orientation or their sexuality,

721
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:10,120
 above anything, he wants to seek and save them.

722
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:14,320
 And people who know Jesus, like Zacchaeus,

723
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,460
 in this moment, steps into a relationship,

724
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:19,680
 people who love Jesus are gonna love what he loves.

725
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,720
 What does he love?

726
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,560
 People.

727
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:25,480
 And he says, "I'm here to seek and to save,"

728
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,080
 and I'm gonna do a bunch of other things,

729
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,480
 but I'm going to a cross,

730
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,360
 because I'm here to seek and save lost people.

731
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,920
 And if you're gonna be about what I'm about,

732
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:37,760
 you're gonna be about seeking and saving lost people.

733
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,800
 Third idea we see from the text is sharing our savior.

734
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:44,480
 Another S-O-S, Jesus' mission statement.

735
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,680
 Repeatedly, he would say, "This is why I'm here."

736
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:52,300
 And as Christians, it's why we're here.

737
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:53,820
 Three chapters earlier in the book of Luke,

738
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:56,140
 in Luke chapter 15, there's three stories

739
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:58,160
 Jesus rattles off.

740
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,440
 And in each of the stories, or the first two,

741
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:05,200
 he tells us the only time there is a celebration in heaven

742
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,400
 that takes place when an action happens.

743
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:13,400
 He says, "There is rejoicing before the angels in heaven

744
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:16,720
 "when one person comes to God."

745
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,820
 Luke chapter 15, verse 10.

746
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:21,920
 "Just so I tell you, there is joy before the angels,

747
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,820
 "a rejoicing among the angels of heaven

748
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:25,000
 "over one sinner who repents."

749
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,920
 That means, you know what happened?

750
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:29,160
 If you're a Christian, you trusted in Jesus,

751
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,920
 there was an eruption of joy and celebration

752
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,240
 in heaven for you.

753
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:37,440
 What somebody celebrates shows you what they value.

754
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,200
 And people celebrate the Cowboys, you know, winning,

755
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,680
 or the Mavs going on to the playoffs.

756
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,980
 People celebrate those things.

757
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:44,480
 People throw parades for Super Bowls

758
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,840
 because they value that victory.

759
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,540
 What somebody celebrates shows what they value.

760
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:49,520
 What heaven celebrates shows us what they value.

761
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,920
 What do they value?

762
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:51,740
 People.

763
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:54,960
 Coming to know Jesus.

764
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,420
 Of every story, every background, every history,

765
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:59,820
 what does Jesus value?

766
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:04,180
 Seeking and saving the lost.

767
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:09,000
 And there's a group of people in the crowd

768
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,400
 and they're grumbling, and Jesus says,

769
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,000
 "You don't know what I'm like.

770
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,380
 "As I'm here to save people, broken people,

771
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:20,000
 "which is the only type of people."

772
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,600
 Which means that as Christians,

773
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:28,640
 we have an opportunity to be a part of sharing our faith

774
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,720
 in your apartment complex,

775
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,080
 with the people that you work with,

776
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,640
 with the family that you're a part of,

777
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,720
 and opening up and looking for occasions

778
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:39,800
 to open up and share what you believe,

779
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,900
 where you find hope.

780
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:47,720
 And in doing so, be about what Jesus is about.

781
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,680
 What's interesting is the passage in Luke 19

782
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,960
 tells us Zacchaeus got saved.

783
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,360
 Salvation came to his house.

784
00:33:55,360 --> 00:34:00,960
 History tells us he spent the rest of his life

785
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,600
 sharing that salvation.

786
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,800
 In other words, him walking away,

787
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,880
 we're told by the church fathers,

788
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:10,480
 and basically the men who came right after the disciples,

789
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,400
 and they record, and they write out Zacchaeus,

790
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:16,600
 who was the tax collector,

791
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:19,120
 went on to become the Bishop of Caesarea.

792
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,880
 In other words, in the same area

793
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,880
 where he was taxing people and taking from them,

794
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,360
 he gave the rest of his life

795
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,580
 to sharing the gospel with them.

796
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:31,560
 He became a pastor.

797
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:37,440
 Sharing the Savior that he met that day.

798
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,840
 And as Christians, we've been invited and are called

799
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:44,040
 to spend our life being about what Jesus is about

800
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:48,400
 and sharing the Savior that we have.

801
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,840
 As I said, people who love Jesus

802
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,680
 love what he loves, which is people.

803
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:57,000
 In 1996, I'm about to close.

804
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,940
 In 1996 in Arlington, Texas,

805
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,760
 which is right in between Dallas and Fort Worth,

806
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,480
 if you're listening.

807
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,080
 It's basically right in our hood.

808
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:10,080
 There was a little girl whose name was Amber,

809
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,960
 and she was nine.

810
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:16,440
 She would be 35 today.

811
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:19,440
 She was out playing and riding her bike,

812
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:23,160
 and a black pickup truck pulled up alongside of her

813
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,740
 and abducted her.

814
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:29,200
 And they searched, and they searched.

815
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,520
 It's 1996.

816
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:35,520
 The widespread use of communication and cell phones

817
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,780
 that just look very different.

818
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:40,400
 And this nine-year-old girl, her family,

819
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,280
 they searched and searched and searched,

820
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,600
 and they couldn't find her.

821
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:49,680
 And then eventually they found, tragically,

822
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,680
 that she had died.

823
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,560
 She'd been killed.

824
00:35:54,560 --> 00:36:00,120
 And her family didn't want anyone

825
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,620
 to ever go through that again.

826
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:04,020
 So they came up with something,

827
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:06,480
 and they were a part of the creation of something

828
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,880
 called an Amber Alert.

829
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,240
 Now I bet you've experienced what I've experienced,

830
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:16,520
 which is an Amber Alert going off.

831
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,600
 You know what's interesting?

832
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:21,360
 When that happens, the general reaction for most of us,

833
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:24,680
 'cause it kind of all go off at once,

834
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:27,320
 is grab my phone and turn it off.

835
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:30,660
 And sometimes I read it, and sometimes I don't.

836
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:35,240
 You know who always reads it?

837
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:41,080
 The parents of somebody looking for their little girl,

838
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:44,200
 somebody looking for their little boy.

839
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:47,200
 In fact, if there was someone in your life

840
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,360
 who had lost somebody, and you knew that,

841
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,000
 and you knew they were gonna send an Amber Alert out,

842
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,560
 I'm confident you would be passionate and going,

843
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,080
 "Hey, hey, make sure you check your phone.

844
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:55,920
 "Make sure you know that.

845
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,520
 "Make sure you, if you see that car,

846
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,360
 "if you see that person, if you see this happening."

847
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,120
 'Cause someone I know is lost.

848
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,240
 And we wanna do anything we can to prevent them

849
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:11,640
 from being separated from those who love them.

850
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:18,860
 The message of Jesus is that God has placed an Amber Alert

851
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:20,200
 on all of humanity.

852
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:24,240
 And he's got a Kyle Alert, and a Kelly Alert,

853
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:27,320
 and an Allison Alert, and a John Alert,

854
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,840
 and a Tyler Alert, and a Kevin Alert.

855
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:33,680
 And he wants humanity to not be separated

856
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,720
 from the one who loves them.

857
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,400
 And he's invited the church to be a part,

858
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,960
 just like with a parent who's looking for a child,

859
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,880
 and saying, "Man, hey, there are people

860
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:44,660
 "who are far from their Father in heaven.

861
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:47,720
 "And I'm inviting you to be about what I'm about,

862
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,180
 "which is bringing the message of a God

863
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:51,220
 "who's there to seek and save, not rip people off,

864
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:52,620
 "not condemn them.

865
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:56,840
 "Of a God who would give his life for them."

866
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,760
 And Zacchaeus, he's sitting in the tree,

867
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,320
 and it begins to all click.

868
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,300
 "Everything I thought about God was wrong.

869
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:08,300
 "Everything I even walked away from was wrong."

870
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:12,440
 And our God is a God who seeks after sinners.

871
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,440
 He wants to save humanity.

872
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,760
 And now, as someone who knows him,

873
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,520
 I get to be about sharing the message of Jesus.

874
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:21,760
 S-O-S, that's what Jesus is crying out.

875
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,840
 And S-O-S, in terms of nautical terms,

876
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:26,000
 is basically a ship saying, "We need help.

877
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,080
 "We need help.

878
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,040
 "We need help."

879
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,940
 And the message of the Bible is that to anyone

880
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:32,140
 who is willing to say to God, "I need help.

881
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:33,180
 "I need help.

882
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:34,500
 "I need help.

883
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,020
 "I can't do it on my own,"

884
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:40,400
 is a candidate to receive the gift of eternal life

885
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,640
 because they are receiving.

886
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,600
 Jesus gave his life for them.

887
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,080
 Zacchaeus wanted to see Jesus.

888
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,680
 Jesus wanted to save Zacchaeus.

889
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:51,680
 And Jesus says, "Come down from the tree, Zacchaeus.

890
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,840
 "I wanna be with you now and forever,

891
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:58,160
 "which is why I'm gonna be placed on a tree, Zacchaeus,

892
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:03,660
 "for you and all of hurting, broken humanity."

893
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:05,740
 And if you are someone in the room

894
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:08,540
 who has never received that free gift,

895
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:09,740
 let me be abundantly clear.

896
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:13,060
 You're sitting in a church on a Tuesday night at 8.25.

897
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:14,360
 You could be at happy hour.

898
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,580
 You could be watching sports.

899
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:16,820
 You could be doing a bunch of things.

900
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:17,980
 You know why you're here?

901
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,620
 You think it's 'cause some friend invited you

902
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:21,220
 and you thought you were showing up to a restaurant

903
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:22,460
 and voila, here you are.

904
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:25,420
 It's because God is seeking you

905
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:28,620
 and wants a relationship with you.

906
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:31,500
 He's not holding the things that you've done

907
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,080
 or will do against you.

908
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,920
 He paid for them.

909
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:39,040
 And the rest of us, he's invited,

910
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,200
 man, are you gonna be about what I'm about?

911
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,820
 The passion that a parent feels for their child

912
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:47,340
 being separated is the passion and intensity

913
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:49,060
 that I feel for humanity.

914
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:51,980
 Are you gonna give your life

915
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:56,140
 to what the world says matters?

916
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,220
 Building your own kingdom,

917
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:05,020
 focused on making rich people richer and enriching yourself.

918
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:10,060
 Are you gonna be about what Jesus is about?

919
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:13,460
 And if you don't know him,

920
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:15,820
 let me tell you what he's about,

921
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:20,820
 you and you knowing him now and forever.

922
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:21,980
 Let me pray.

923
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:26,300
 Father, I thank you.

924
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:31,100
 I thank you that we love because you first loved us.

925
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:38,100
 The generosity of Zacchaeus is as generous

926
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:42,740
 as perhaps anyone in the New Testament except you.

927
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:47,620
 That he gave away half of the things he had

928
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:53,100
 and you gave away all of the life you had.

929
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:58,220
 And I pray for anyone hearing my voice now,

930
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:02,860
 in the room, online, or some future date,

931
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:09,300
 you would help them see you are savior

932
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:15,860
 and cry out in an SOS, I need your help, God.

933
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:21,860
 I'm a sinner, but in you I have a great savior.

934
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:24,940
 We worship you now in song.

935
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:28,540
 Would we worship you their lives

936
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:33,540
 for those of us who know you by sharing that savior, amen.

937
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:38,300
 That's Savior. Amen.
