[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.460]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:25.800]   Hey, Porch, how we doing tonight?
[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:26.800]   OK.
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:27.880]   Hey.
[00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.960]   If we haven't gotten a chance to meet, my name is Grace Ball.
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.800]   And on behalf of our staff team, we
[00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.560]   are so thankful that you've decided to trust us
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.280]   with your Tuesday night.
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.520]   I want to give a special shout out to our Porch Live locations.
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.600]   So shout out to Porch Live Tulsa, Porch Live Boise,
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.640]   and Porch Live Springfield.
[00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.240]   We are so thankful for you guys.
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.560]   Yeah, let's give it up for them.
[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.360]   I love that.
[00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.400]   Hey, we're excited for tonight because we
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.880]   get to hear from a special guest, a friend of the Porch.
[00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.920]   And I have the joy of getting to introduce him.
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.720]   He is an illusionist, a pastor, a Bible teacher,
[00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.120]   and so much more.
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.280]   But what our team knows about him
[00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.760]   is he is someone who is faithful to know God's word, to teach it
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.240]   and to live it out.
[00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.520]   And so Porch, I need your help tonight, OK?
[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.160]   I need you to help me in welcoming
[00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.160]   our good friend of the Porch, Drew Worsham, to the stage.
[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:33.600]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.840]   Well, Porch, how are we feeling tonight?
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.240]   We're good?
[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.320]   Ah, you sound amazing.
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.040]   Well, like Grace said, my name is Drew.
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.720]   Man, I live in San Antonio, Texas with my amazing wife,
[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:47.280]   Jane.
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.360]   And we've got two kiddos.
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.120]   I have a five-year-old little girl named Matilda
[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.080]   that we call Tilly.
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.120]   And then I have a three-year-old son named Linden.
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.920]   And they might be tuning in, but I'm
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.080]   hoping they're asleep because it's bedtime.
[00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.680]   And it's a huge honor to get to be with you tonight.
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.960]   I love the Porch so much.
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.840]   And I love this church.
[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.400]   And I love just Kylan's vision for the young adults of Dallas
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.280]   and just his heart.
[00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.960]   And so proud of him and Brooke and welcoming their son, Cash,
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.680]   into the world last week.
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.880]   And so it is a huge honor to get to just step into this space
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.960]   so that he can be home loving his family.
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:30.640]   Grateful for him.
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.040]   Love your pastor, TA, at Watermark, one of my closest
[00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.360]   friends in the world.
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.480]   And I just-- listen, I think I said this last time.
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.400]   Alex, I mean it.
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.440]   We have talked often about moving to this area
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.320]   just to be a part of the Porch and to be a part of Watermark.
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.240]   It's just the housing market, guys.
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.960]   It's crazy.
[00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:56.600]   So if any of you know someone who has a house for free,
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:57.760]   let me know.
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.160]   We'll be into it.
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.960]   Well, if you have a Bible tonight,
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.680]   I'd love for you to grab it and meet me in Colossians chapter
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:05.360]   1.
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.160]   Colossians chapter 1.
[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.680]   Now, I know that in the spring semester
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.320]   and going into the summer, you guys did a walk through
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.880]   Colossians, Watermark, you guys as a church are going through.
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.760]   But as you guys have been in this space of looking out,
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.840]   what it looks like to be a disciple of Jesus,
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.080]   and just kind of, if you will, the secret sauce of it all,
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.480]   I don't know if there's a more potent few verses than
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.480]   from the Apostle Paul in Colossians.
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.640]   So if you just give me the permission, I want to go back.
[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.160]   And I want us to look at just a really impactful verse.
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.840]   And my hope and my prayer for you
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.600]   tonight is however you walked into this space,
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.400]   wherever you are in the spiritual journey
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.080]   that Jesus would invite you into deeper waters,
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.880]   and maybe, just maybe, that because of his word
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.760]   and him speaking to you that you may walk out of this room
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.000]   and forever changed.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.680]   And so as we look at Colossians chapter 1,
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.480]   I want you to see starting in verse 24,
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.920]   this is what Paul says.
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.240]   He says, "Now I rejoice in my sufferings for you,
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.520]   and I'm completing in my flesh what
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:22.360]   is lacking in Christ's afflictions for his body.
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.000]   That is the church."
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.600]   Now, pause real quick.
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.000]   At first glance, you may read that verse
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   and think that what Paul is saying or trying to communicate
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.800]   is that what Jesus did was only half sufficient,
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.080]   that Jesus got the ball like two men in the 50-yard line,
[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.640]   and now it's Paul's responsibility
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:41.800]   to get the rest of the way.
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.400]   And that is not what he's saying.
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.200]   What Paul is saying is that Jesus, his blood, and his death
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.040]   and resurrection, it's all sufficient.
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.680]   There's nothing that we could add to it.
[00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.080]   But what he's going to communicate
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.520]   is, though, even though Jesus died on a cross,
[00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.280]   went to a tomb, three days later walks out of the grave
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.480]   holding the receipts to sin and death,
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:08.240]   there were still people who had not yet heard this story,
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.680]   this life-changing story.
[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.920]   And so the fact that he's in prison,
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.000]   that he's been suffering these afflictions
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.400]   has actually been a catalyst for more people
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:17.840]   to get to hear this story.
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:23.680]   And so in verse 25, he says, "I have become its servant,
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.600]   "according to God's commission that was given to me for you
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.620]   "to make the word of God fully known,
[00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.460]   "the mystery hidden for ages and generations,
[00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.620]   "but now revealed to his saints.
[00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:39.140]   "God wanted to make known among the Gentiles
[00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:41.960]   "the glorious wealth of this mystery,
[00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.220]   "which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.
[00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:48.020]   "We proclaim him warning and teaching everyone
[00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:51.420]   "with all wisdom so that we may present everyone
[00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:55.440]   "mature in Christ, a labor for this,
[00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:00.440]   "striving with his strength that works powerfully in me."
[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.760]   Jesus, in these next few moments,
[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:09.000]   I just pray that you would speak to us.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.200]   That there's not a person in this space or this room
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.520]   that needs to hear anything that I have to say.
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.480]   They don't need my thoughts or my opinions,
[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.300]   Jesus, we need you.
[00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:22.520]   And so Father, I pray that you would speak
[00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:27.440]   to every single one of us in a way that we can understand,
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.200]   that you would whisper directly to our hearts
[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:33.960]   and that you would invite us into something unique,
[00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.300]   something special, something intimate.
[00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:39.880]   So Jesus, remove all the noise.
[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:43.760]   And tonight, may we encounter you,
[00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:46.660]   and because of that encounter, leave forever changed.
[00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:50.860]   We love you and we trust you.
[00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:53.720]   And it's in your name we pray, amen.
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:07:00.300]   Well, in March of 2014, I was dating Jane,
[00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:05.700]   and we lived in Washington State
[00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:08.060]   where we both served on staff at a church.
[00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:12.320]   And Jane had never gotten to see this side of my life,
[00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:15.360]   like never got to see the touring performer side.
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:19.460]   And we were doing an event, a conference in Nashville.
[00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:22.700]   And so I invited Jane to like fly out
[00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:25.700]   and meet me in Nashville for this two-day conference.
[00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:26.740]   And so she gets there,
[00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:28.780]   we had lots of friends that live in Nashville.
[00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:30.900]   And so we're both there.
[00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:32.780]   We finished the conference Sunday morning,
[00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:35.380]   we head to the airport early in the morning.
[00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:37.780]   And I don't know if you've ever been to BNA,
[00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:38.860]   which is the Nashville airport.
[00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:41.260]   When you walk in, there's a huge sign,
[00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.980]   much like many airports with all the locations
[00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:45.940]   to where they're flying in that day.
[00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:47.740]   And so I look at Jane and I was like,
[00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:50.620]   "Hey, if you had, just for fun,
[00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:53.120]   "if you had to pick any city in the world
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:55.360]   "that you see up there that you would like to fly to,
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:56.900]   "which one would you pick?"
[00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:59.220]   And she's like, "Ah, my favorite city is New York City."
[00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:00.840]   And I was like, "Surprise,
[00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:02.240]   "we're not going home to Washington,
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.220]   "we're actually going to New York City
[00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:05.900]   "where we're going to have lunch."
[00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:08.220]   And she immediately starts to kind of tear up a little bit,
[00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:10.740]   which as a guy, it's just immediately like,
[00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:13.380]   "Chi-ching, we're on the right page."
[00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:16.140]   So we walk through security, we get on the plane,
[00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:17.380]   we sit down, we take off.
[00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:19.500]   And the moment we take off, I reach into my bag
[00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:21.180]   and I pull out an envelope
[00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:22.980]   that just has the number one written on it.
[00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:24.420]   And I hand it to her.
[00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:27.580]   She opens it and inside of it, there was a postcard.
[00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:29.660]   And what she didn't know is that every city
[00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:32.860]   that I had visited and toured or performed at or spoke at
[00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:34.860]   over the course of our dating relationship,
[00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:36.220]   I bought a postcard.
[00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:39.340]   And on the back of it, I would write a prayer,
[00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:40.340]   just like almost like a love letter
[00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:41.940]   of what I was processing and feeling
[00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:45.340]   about our relationship at that point in time.
[00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:47.860]   And I had about 30 of these in my bag.
[00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:50.100]   So every 15 minutes, I'd pull one out, I'd give it to her,
[00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:50.940]   she would open it up, she would read it,
[00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:52.780]   and then we just kind of talk about it.
[00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:54.900]   We land in New York City and have a car
[00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:56.700]   that's waiting on us that picks us up
[00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:59.900]   and takes us into Manhattan where we grab a slice of pizza.
[00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:01.800]   Second thing is, I know that Jane's favorite food
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:03.100]   in the world is pizza,
[00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:06.140]   and no one quite does it like New York City.
[00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:07.540]   And so we grab a slice of pizza
[00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:08.940]   and then we head to Central Park,
[00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:10.420]   right outside of Central Park.
[00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:13.500]   I had rented a, not rented, I guess, yeah,
[00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:14.900]   reserved, that's the right word,
[00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:17.380]   a hotel room right outside Central Park.
[00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:18.580]   Now, here's what's crazy.
[00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:21.180]   This is just so in case you go in,
[00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:22.420]   I wasn't trying to be shady.
[00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:23.280]   Here's the deal.
[00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:25.060]   We walk into the lobby and I was like,
[00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:27.620]   "Hey, the room's yours.
[00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:29.940]   I want you to go shower, get ready,
[00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:31.800]   because ladies, here's the deal.
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:35.080]   You know that when you wake up super early for a flight,
[00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:37.280]   you're not always photo ready, you know?
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:39.280]   You're rocking like sweats and a side pony."
[00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:42.960]   So I was like, "Hey, you go get ready, do your thing."
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:45.640]   So I stayed in the lobby and she makes her way up.
[00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:47.440]   She goes into the room and in the room,
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:49.440]   there's flowers waiting on her
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:52.280]   along with a lot of these postcards that I'd sent ahead.
[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:54.640]   And so she's getting ready, reading these postcards.
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:57.880]   She comes down, got like all dressed up.
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:09:59.440]   And then we just walk through the city,
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:02.040]   grab coffee, whole time talking about our relationship.
[00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:05.000]   The whole time I'm just giving her these postcards.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.240]   We find our way to Central Park
[00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:09.620]   and we sit down on a park bench.
[00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:11.020]   And I reach into my bag and I was like,
[00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:14.380]   "Hey, this is the last one."
[00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:15.220]   And I hand it to her.
[00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:18.940]   She opens it up and it's a postcard from Central Park.
[00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:21.400]   The picture taken from where we were seated,
[00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:24.580]   the bridge and kind of the ponds and overlooking the city.
[00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:26.240]   She flips it around and it says,
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:29.040]   "This one's from all over the world."
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:30.560]   I hand her my phone.
[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:33.640]   And what I had done is I'd had all of our friends
[00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:36.560]   and family from across the globe
[00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:39.980]   send in just a video of just speaking blessing
[00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:43.040]   over our relationship and just like
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:46.200]   how what they saw God do with us together.
[00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:51.000]   When the video was done, I put the phone into my pocket
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.680]   and I pulled out a ring and I went down on one knee.
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:59.800]   And for the very first time in our relationship,
[00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:02.480]   I told Jane that I loved her.
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:04.480]   Those words meant something to me
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:06.160]   and I wasn't gonna say them
[00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:08.720]   till I could back them up with a promise.
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:11.880]   Ask her to spend the rest of her life with me.
[00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:14.440]   She obviously said yes
[00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:16.240]   or I wouldn't be telling that story.
[00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:19.360]   Thank you, thank you.
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:22.860]   (congregation applauding)
[00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:26.280]   (congregation cheering)
[00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:30.940]   True story, while we're in Central Park,
[00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:32.980]   when I go down on one knee,
[00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:36.640]   it immediately starts snowing in Central Park.
[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:37.780]   Which at this point you're like,
[00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:40.980]   "Drew, I feel like I was tracking with you now,
[00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:42.780]   "I just feel like you're making all this up."
[00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:44.180]   (congregation laughing)
[00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:47.260]   The only reason I know that is some of our closest friends
[00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.500]   had flown to New York before us
[00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:52.060]   and were taking photos of the whole thing.
[00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:53.460]   And so I have a photo of it,
[00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:55.860]   it's like halfway snowing coming down
[00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:56.940]   while I'm on one knee.
[00:11:56.940 --> 00:12:00.300]   Now, why do I tell that story?
[00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:02.780]   One, it's an amazing story
[00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:06.660]   and I earned every bit of it, okay?
[00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:11.300]   And then two, fellas, just trying to raise the bar, okay?
[00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:13.340]   (congregation laughing)
[00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:16.140]   (congregation cheering)
[00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:17.400]   Ladies, you're welcome.
[00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:22.020]   Well, that moment, listen,
[00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:23.900]   we immediately began to kind of start
[00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:25.660]   to plan the wedding day.
[00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:27.900]   And then just a few months later,
[00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:30.500]   here in Dallas, Texas,
[00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:34.660]   I watched Jane walk down an aisle dressed in white,
[00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:36.100]   that she earned every bit of that.
[00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:39.460]   And we stood on an altar and we made promises
[00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:41.700]   that my life is no longer mine,
[00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:44.540]   like I will use every heartbeat to serve you,
[00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:46.700]   to support you and vice versa.
[00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:49.260]   And then we celebrated the night away
[00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.700]   with all of our closest friends and family.
[00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:53.900]   And at the very end of the night,
[00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:56.700]   like we ran through a hallway of sparklers
[00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:58.380]   that our friends were holding.
[00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:01.460]   And I wanna just pause and I want you to imagine
[00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:04.260]   that as we walked through those sparklers
[00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:05.340]   headed to the limousine,
[00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:08.140]   that once we got to the end of the sparklers,
[00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:10.060]   if I looked at Jane and I said,
[00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:12.580]   "You did amazing out there.
[00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:15.820]   "High five, good game, I'll see you next week."
[00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:20.940]   And I just walk away, get in my car
[00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:23.020]   and drive to my apartment.
[00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:27.100]   And she gets in her car and goes to her apartment.
[00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:28.980]   And then I just see her a couple of days later.
[00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:31.900]   Like immediately something in you is like,
[00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:35.460]   "Ugh, like no, like surely not, right?"
[00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:39.340]   Like that's not how I pictured my story going.
[00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:42.260]   Well, here's why, and I want you to not miss this.
[00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:46.660]   Because every single one of us in this space,
[00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:48.940]   and in this room, or tuning in live,
[00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:53.380]   like you know that no matter how amazing
[00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:55.980]   the engagement story is,
[00:13:55.980 --> 00:14:00.040]   no matter how beautiful the wedding is,
[00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:02.540]   neither of those are actually the point.
[00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:08.220]   The point is what you do after you say, "I do."
[00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:10.940]   And the life that you begin to build together
[00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:12.740]   and live out together.
[00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:18.540]   And my fear is that so many of us in this space
[00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:22.100]   that we have a tendency to do this exact same thing
[00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:23.660]   with Jesus.
[00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:25.940]   That we show up every Tuesday night
[00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:27.820]   and we have an amazing experience.
[00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:30.620]   And we sing the songs and we raise our hands
[00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:31.780]   at the appropriate time.
[00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:35.500]   And we sing the Christian karaoke and we take notes
[00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:37.700]   and we lean in and we walk out.
[00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:39.420]   We have this amazing feeling.
[00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:41.420]   And then it's like we walk out with Jesus
[00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:44.460]   and we're like, "You are amazing out there, Jesus.
[00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:48.000]   "Phenomenal, high five, I'll see you next Tuesday.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.860]   "I'll see you next Sunday."
[00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:57.300]   Not realizing that this is beautiful.
[00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:59.980]   This is amazing.
[00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:04.820]   Just like the engagement or the wedding.
[00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:08.420]   But this is not the point.
[00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:12.640]   And if we make this the point,
[00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:18.700]   we may miss out on the beauty of the relationship
[00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:21.440]   that Jesus is inviting you and I into.
[00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:25.620]   And I love that at the porch,
[00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:27.940]   and that you guys have been walking through this series
[00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:32.180]   all about discipleship and really growing in the intimacy
[00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:34.320]   and relationship with Jesus.
[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:38.300]   And so tonight, what I want to do
[00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:42.880]   is I want to share with you the one thing
[00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:47.880]   that has changed my entire journey and walk with Jesus.
[00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:53.400]   The thing that I wish desperately that I would have known
[00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:57.100]   when I was in your season and in your seat.
[00:15:57.100 --> 00:16:02.080]   And Paul here just walks us through it.
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:07.000]   And that he says this, just actually,
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.180]   I want you to see this again.
[00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:12.200]   Jump down to, we'll do verse 26.
[00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:16.680]   Paul is writing this letter to a people
[00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:22.480]   that honestly, if they were living today here in 2024,
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:26.180]   they would find themselves getting more of their theology
[00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:29.000]   from TikTok than Jesus.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.640]   Glad none of us do that.
[00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:35.960]   For many of them, Jesus was just a supplement
[00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:38.800]   to their lives.
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:41.440]   So life is good, we just sprinkle a little Jesus
[00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:43.400]   and he makes it a little bit better.
[00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:45.140]   Almost like he was a genie.
[00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:49.240]   But they found themselves stagnant and confused
[00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:50.520]   in the spiritual journey,
[00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:53.220]   begging the question, is there more?
[00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:57.080]   So Paul in verse 26, he says this again.
[00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:58.000]   Oh, this is so good.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.200]   I hope you don't miss it.
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:05.120]   He says the mystery, the mystery of all of this,
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.440]   this whole thing that's been hidden for ages
[00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:13.160]   and generations, but now revealed to his saints,
[00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:14.880]   that's you and I.
[00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:16.520]   Which listen, that just immediately,
[00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:18.720]   when we read that, that should beg the question,
[00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:21.120]   ooh, what's this mystery?
[00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:23.720]   Paul, please tell us more.
[00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:25.360]   And he says in verse 27,
[00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:29.080]   God wanted to make known among the Gentiles,
[00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:30.680]   which is the vast majority of us,
[00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:32.240]   especially if we're not Jewish,
[00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:35.020]   the glorious wealth of this mystery.
[00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:36.860]   Here it is.
[00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:42.980]   Which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.
[00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:52.860]   What Paul just said is that the secret to all of this,
[00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:55.940]   if you want to know what it really boils down to,
[00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:58.180]   the heartbeat of Jesus's message
[00:17:58.180 --> 00:17:59.780]   and throughout the rest of the New Testament,
[00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:01.940]   if you want to know what it all centers around,
[00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:06.940]   here it is, it's the fact that Christ is in you.
[00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:10.100]   That the God of the universe,
[00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:12.540]   the moment that you and I say yes to him,
[00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:13.620]   that for whatever reason,
[00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:18.380]   he chooses to take up residence inside of us.
[00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:22.860]   And what is so strange
[00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:27.920]   is that for many of us in the Western church,
[00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:32.260]   you hear me read that or say it or repeat it.
[00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:38.580]   And for many of us, our default setting is big deal.
[00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:44.480]   Like so many of us in this room
[00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:47.460]   could be underwhelmed by that fact.
[00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:51.060]   That you hear, you're like, yeah, Drew, big deal, we know.
[00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:53.620]   Listen, man, like this is not our first time
[00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:54.940]   at a church event.
[00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:57.860]   Like many of us, like we grew up in vacation Bible school.
[00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:00.540]   We know the songs, we even know the motions
[00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:03.180]   that Jesus deep, deep down in our heart, spell it.
[00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:04.700]   Like we know, bro.
[00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:12.340]   But porch, what I want you to hear tonight
[00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:14.460]   is that this is a really big deal.
[00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:22.860]   At the moment that you and I meet Jesus,
[00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:30.120]   at the moment that we surrender our lives to him,
[00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:35.780]   that the scripture says that the very God
[00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:39.580]   that spoke the world into existence
[00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:46.300]   for whatever reason now lives and dwells inside of you,
[00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:54.820]   that the very power that brought Jesus Christ
[00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:59.820]   out of the grave now courses through your veins.
[00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:04.260]   Let that just sink in.
[00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:09.100]   And just can we be real for a second?
[00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:15.700]   For so many of us, if I were to take the average person
[00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:17.420]   who claims to be following Jesus,
[00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:19.420]   claims to be a disciple of Jesus,
[00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:21.700]   and I were to hold them next to a person
[00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:24.760]   who's not yet a follower of Jesus,
[00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:26.540]   and I were to have us dissect and go,
[00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:29.580]   what's the difference between these two people?
[00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:32.340]   What's the difference between you and a coworker
[00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:34.400]   that doesn't claim to know Jesus?
[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:37.700]   What many of us would find out is that,
[00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:40.840]   well, I cuss a little bit less.
[00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:45.300]   I party a little less hard.
[00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:49.560]   I watch a few less rated R movies.
[00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:53.760]   I wait to date two to really like make out hard.
[00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:59.140]   Like, and then I have this like boring committee meeting
[00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:00.720]   thing that I have to do on Sunday mornings
[00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:02.580]   and occasionally Tuesday nights.
[00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:05.360]   But other than that, that's about it.
[00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:09.320]   Are you kidding me?
[00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:13.320]   Is that all there is?
[00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:17.260]   That we're just a little bit more moral
[00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:18.700]   than the world around us?
[00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:23.580]   Or could it be true?
[00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:26.920]   That the mystery to this thing,
[00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:30.440]   the secret to this thing, the power in this thing,
[00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:37.080]   is that Christ actually lives and dwells inside of us
[00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:40.220]   and so few of us are actually tapping into that.
[00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:45.720]   So we just think for a second,
[00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:50.100]   to see the bigness of this.
[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:55.160]   The entire Old Testament, if you wanna sum it up tonight,
[00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:58.620]   was marked by three different words.
[00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:04.480]   And three words were there, was this, God with us.
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:06.880]   You hear it repeated over and over again
[00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:08.720]   throughout the Old Testament.
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:11.280]   That God was with Adam and Eve
[00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:13.120]   in the cool of the day in the garden.
[00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:17.360]   That God was with Abraham.
[00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:18.940]   That God was with Moses.
[00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:20.680]   God was with the Israelites.
[00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:23.120]   Clyde by day, fire by night.
[00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:24.800]   God was with King David.
[00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:27.500]   God was with the prophets.
[00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:30.560]   That even, oh my gosh, we're getting closer to Christmas.
[00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:32.840]   That Jesus, God in the flesh,
[00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:34.200]   wraps himself in human flesh
[00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:36.960]   and when he shows up in Christmas time, we call him what?
[00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:38.680]   Anybody remember?
[00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:41.680]   Emmanuel, anybody know what that translates as?
[00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:43.340]   God with us.
[00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:46.680]   Yeah, but then he ascends into heaven
[00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:51.500]   and in this moment, everything shifts.
[00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:55.580]   From this moment forward,
[00:22:55.580 --> 00:23:01.360]   like our identity is no longer marked simply
[00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:04.200]   by God with us.
[00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:10.200]   But for us, Christ is in you.
[00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:12.640]   He's in me.
[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:13.480]   He's in us.
[00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:16.760]   Like this is really big deal.
[00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:19.560]   And for those of you who maybe you're more
[00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:22.760]   of a visual learner, I have something for you, okay?
[00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:23.600]   To be helpful.
[00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:24.700]   It's not a magic trick.
[00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:26.600]   Don't get ahead of me, okay?
[00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:28.300]   You'll be disappointed at the end.
[00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:31.000]   So here's what we're gonna do.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.280]   Tonight, what I want you to do is I want you
[00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:37.240]   to let the water here in this bottle
[00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:41.880]   represent the manifest presence of God, okay?
[00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:45.160]   And in the garden of Eden,
[00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:47.200]   listen, at the very beginning of the book,
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:50.920]   God speaks the world into existence.
[00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:53.760]   Everything that we know and the things that we don't know,
[00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:56.800]   God uses his words like a paintbrush
[00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:58.880]   and he creates all things.
[00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:01.360]   On the sixth day, God reaches into the dirt.
[00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:02.440]   It would be the very first thing
[00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:04.640]   that God would ever touch in the scriptures.
[00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:08.200]   He breathes life into humanity.
[00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:09.040]   Why?
[00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:13.680]   So that we could have a deep, intimate relationship
[00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:15.240]   with the God of the universe.
[00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:19.720]   So that his presence, that we could experience it
[00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:22.320]   in its fullness in the garden,
[00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:27.440]   like no distractions, no sin, no pain.
[00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:32.440]   We make it three chapters into the book
[00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:35.040]   before we screw it all up.
[00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:37.280]   And we looked at God and said,
[00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:39.240]   hey, kind of thank you, but no thanks.
[00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:41.200]   I wanna do this my own way.
[00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:44.480]   And we gave God kind of the proverbial middle finger
[00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:46.240]   and said, I wanna do this on my own.
[00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:47.440]   And in that moment, listen,
[00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:50.680]   humanity committed treason against the high King
[00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:55.240]   and it fractured the world as we know it.
[00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:56.700]   And so listen, we all feel that.
[00:24:56.700 --> 00:24:58.880]   Like you don't scroll very long before you're like,
[00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:00.440]   yeah, it's pretty jacked up.
[00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:03.240]   Or you're better yet, like maybe this is just me.
[00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:05.720]   Maybe you can't relate, but I have a three-year-old son.
[00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:07.480]   He hangs out with other three-year-olds.
[00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:08.680]   I don't hang out with them very long
[00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:09.720]   before I back up and go,
[00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:12.000]   whoa, those are the most evil creatures
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.540]   on planet earth right there.
[00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:19.200]   But what's interesting is we don't have to pull my son
[00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:23.160]   aside and go, hey, buddy, when you don't get your way,
[00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:26.120]   bite him, punch him in the throat,
[00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:28.520]   grab what you want, yell mine and run.
[00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:30.800]   Like we don't have to rehearse that.
[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:32.560]   Like it's his default setting.
[00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:35.360]   Okay, you're tracking with me.
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:37.280]   Now, but here's the deal.
[00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:39.320]   That even in that brokenness,
[00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:44.440]   that God chooses to not give up on humanity.
[00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:47.040]   And he wants to be with his people.
[00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:51.000]   He wants the intimacy restored.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:55.280]   And so you see in the scripture, God's presence, it shifts.
[00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:58.120]   And the first place that you really see the manifestation
[00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:00.000]   is that of the mountain.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.560]   Mount Sinai, if you wanna like think about Moses,
[00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:04.180]   or he has the burning bush moment
[00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:05.920]   where he goes up there to the 10 commandments.
[00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:07.520]   Or even if you think about the woman who's caught
[00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:10.780]   in the well, or not caught in the well, she is caught,
[00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:12.680]   sorry, I've just merged two stories.
[00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:14.280]   The woman who's at the well,
[00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:15.400]   not the woman caught in adultery,
[00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:18.080]   the woman caught in the well, I'll just say it again.
[00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:22.220]   The woman at the well, she quizzes Jesus and she says,
[00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:25.240]   okay, like some people say that we worship on this mountain.
[00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:27.320]   You say we're on this mountain, like which one is it?
[00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:29.900]   It's all this idea that the presence of God
[00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:31.900]   was found at the mountaintop.
[00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:37.280]   Now, when the Israelites are released from captivity,
[00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:40.040]   and they begin to wander through the desert,
[00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:42.580]   God's presence, yes, cloud by day, fire by night,
[00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:47.420]   but he instructs the Israelites to build a tabernacle.
[00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:49.560]   And when the tabernacle is built,
[00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:52.120]   God's presence would descend into this place.
[00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:54.400]   And this is where the people of God could go
[00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:56.800]   and meet with him.
[00:26:56.800 --> 00:27:00.240]   When they make their way into the promised land,
[00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:02.400]   God gives Solomon the instructions
[00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:06.720]   to build a permanent tabernacle called the temple.
[00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:10.820]   And it moves from the tabernacle to the temple.
[00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:16.960]   Then, when you move from Malachi into Matthew,
[00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:19.720]   the Old Testament to the New Testament,
[00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:22.040]   something crazy happens.
[00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:25.560]   Because the very presence of God
[00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:28.860]   chooses to leave its throne room
[00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:32.280]   and wrap itself in human flesh
[00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:34.760]   in the person of Jesus.
[00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:40.680]   That Jesus walks on our planet for 33 perfect years,
[00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:42.840]   teaching you and I what it means
[00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:46.000]   to be fully human and fully alive.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:51.840]   And then Jesus willingly lays his life down on a cross.
[00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:54.000]   And don't miss this, somehow I did.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:00.120]   But that was not Jesus's cross.
[00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:02.720]   That was your cross.
[00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:07.240]   That was your death penalty
[00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:09.240]   for your treason against the king.
[00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:13.600]   And Jesus was willing to climb onto that cross
[00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:16.320]   and all, man, of the judgment
[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:18.800]   due to the brokenness of the world,
[00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:22.240]   man, aimed at Jesus and he absorbed it like a sponge.
[00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:24.840]   And goes into the grave.
[00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:27.560]   And three days later, walks out of the grave
[00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:30.600]   holding the keys to both sin and death.
[00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:34.680]   Walks on earth for a couple of weeks
[00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:36.960]   with his closest friends
[00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:38.760]   and then he ascends back to heaven.
[00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:44.240]   Which begs the question,
[00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:49.520]   where is the manifest presence of God now?
[00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:52.160]   We don't have a temple.
[00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:55.040]   We don't have a tabernacle.
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:58.560]   We don't worship at the top of a mountain.
[00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:02.560]   So where is the presence of God now?
[00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:07.560]   It's here.
[00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:23.240]   It's in us.
[00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:24.480]   It's in us.
[00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:31.720]   This is why Paul would use language like we are the temple.
[00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:37.360]   That the presence of the living God
[00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:42.360]   chooses to live and dwell inside of you.
[00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:47.360]   That it courses through your veins.
[00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:52.040]   It's a really big deal.
[00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:57.040]   And I pray tonight that you begin to believe that
[00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:59.640]   and understand it and walk in it.
[00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:02.960]   So tonight,
[00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:06.520]   let me maybe put it this way.
[00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:14.480]   Whatever question that you walked into this room with,
[00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:20.520]   like whatever you were hoping for,
[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:22.560]   and psychologists would say,
[00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:24.760]   there's really just a handful of questions,
[00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:27.600]   like seven questions that you probably are asking
[00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:29.920]   in every scenario that you step into.
[00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:31.200]   And here's the beauty of it.
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:33.720]   Christ answers all seven of those.
[00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:35.880]   And so tonight,
[00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:39.720]   if the question that drives you is the question,
[00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:40.960]   am I safe?
[00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:44.560]   Am I safe physically, emotionally?
[00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:48.400]   Maybe I have a temple.
[00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:51.440]   Maybe I have a tendency to let fear creep in,
[00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:52.760]   but the question of am I safe?
[00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:54.120]   Here's what I want you to see.
[00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:59.120]   That Christ in you means that you are never alone.
[00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:02.360]   That no matter the chaos around you,
[00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:07.200]   you're held securely by the one who's in complete control.
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:11.840]   And at the Lion of Judah, not only pads beside you,
[00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:14.360]   he dwells inside of you.
[00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:20.560]   Maybe your question is, am I secure?
[00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:26.480]   Maybe anxiety or worry are clouding your thoughts.
[00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:28.520]   Maybe it's fear of the future.
[00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:33.920]   Tonight, you can feel secure
[00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:39.000]   knowing that the God who owns a cattle on a thousand hills
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.040]   calls you son or daughter
[00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:45.440]   and that he is closer than your skin tonight.
[00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:50.440]   Or maybe, maybe you walk into this space
[00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:53.680]   and the question that you're constantly asking
[00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:57.400]   of every environment and every relationship is, am I loved?
[00:31:57.400 --> 00:31:59.800]   Am I truly loved?
[00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:01.000]   Am I worthy of love?
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:06.560]   Tonight, may you hear that God's love for you
[00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:08.520]   is not conditional.
[00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:12.960]   That Christ chose to live in you
[00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:17.960]   so you're loved deeply, fully, and unconditionally,
[00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:21.440]   even on your worst days.
[00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:25.680]   Maybe your question is, am I wanted?
[00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:31.280]   Then tonight you need to hear that you're,
[00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:34.560]   because of Christ in you, you are not tolerated.
[00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:37.200]   You are wanted.
[00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:41.600]   Christ in you is a constant reminder that you belong,
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:44.560]   that you are chosen before the foundations of the earth
[00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:47.480]   by God himself and that he wants to be near you
[00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:49.000]   in the most intimate way.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:53.320]   Or maybe tonight your question is, am I successful?
[00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:58.560]   That you find yourself constantly trying to prove
[00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:02.360]   that you're enough in this, that you're successful.
[00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:06.640]   Then tonight you need to be reminded
[00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:08.200]   that you have nothing to prove.
[00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:13.800]   That God is already so proud of you
[00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:17.080]   because he finds you worthy enough to dwell inside of.
[00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:19.640]   Let that sink in.
[00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:23.920]   Who are you trying to prove what to?
[00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:28.080]   The God of the universe finds you worthy
[00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:31.480]   and says, that one's mine.
[00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:33.640]   I'll take residence inside of that one.
[00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:37.280]   Or maybe tonight you step into this space
[00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:39.600]   wondering, am I good enough?
[00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:42.720]   With Christ in you, you are complete.
[00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:44.320]   You don't have to prove your worth
[00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:47.960]   because he fills every gap and calls you worthy.
[00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:50.080]   You can stop performing for his approval
[00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:53.560]   and you can learn to just enjoy Christ in you.
[00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:56.880]   Or maybe your question is, do I have purpose?
[00:33:56.880 --> 00:34:00.080]   Christ in you gives your life meaning.
[00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:02.560]   He's guiding you to impact the lives of others
[00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:07.160]   and to live with purpose every single day.
[00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:10.600]   These truths remind you that with Christ in you,
[00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:14.560]   your worth, security and purpose are already established
[00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:16.640]   that you can live free.
[00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:21.600]   And Porch, this is huge and it changes everything.
[00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:24.520]   This isn't just, it's not like an app
[00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:27.040]   or it's not just something that you download.
[00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:30.320]   Like this is not an accessory or an update.
[00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:33.600]   No, this is a whole new operating system
[00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:37.960]   and it changes everything in us and around us.
[00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:40.680]   Here, can I just give you just a few tonight?
[00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:42.600]   Like think about it this way.
[00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:45.160]   So many of us, we think about prayer
[00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:48.720]   and prayer for those of us who recognize
[00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:52.480]   that Christ is in us, that he's in you.
[00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:57.440]   It moves from being us just talking to an imaginary friend
[00:34:57.440 --> 00:35:01.240]   and listing out all of our wants or needs or hopes
[00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:04.320]   that we say like it's some type of incantation
[00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:06.680]   and then like we just write to make God
[00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:08.720]   like do what we need or want.
[00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:15.200]   But it moves, prayer moves into a regular heartfelt practice
[00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:23.240]   that helps us cultivate deeper intimacy with Jesus
[00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:27.400]   by allowing us to share our deepest needs,
[00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:31.880]   to seek guidance and most importantly,
[00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:35.180]   just experience his presence.
[00:35:35.180 --> 00:35:42.680]   Your prayer life alone will shift and change
[00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:45.840]   if you really believe that Christ is in you
[00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:47.840]   or take scripture reading.
[00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:49.440]   Both of these things, prayer, scripture,
[00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:51.720]   many of us were like, oh, I know I should,
[00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:53.840]   I just don't want to.
[00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:55.880]   So scripture reading moves from being something
[00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:59.120]   that we check off our list, some spiritual to-do list
[00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:02.000]   or cramming for some spiritual pop quiz
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.800]   or making ourselves feel better
[00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:06.800]   because we're jumping through some religious hoop
[00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:13.240]   to engaging a 66 book love letter
[00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:20.200]   written to show us who we are, who he is
[00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:24.720]   and how we get to live life to the fullest.
[00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:29.560]   Dang, that'll get you up early in the morning
[00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:33.480]   or maybe it's obedience.
[00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:35.400]   When Christ is in you, obedience,
[00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:38.720]   it moves from somehow trying to earn God's approval
[00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:43.360]   to actually trusting Jesus and aligning our lives
[00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:45.100]   to his perfect will.
[00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:48.520]   Or maybe it's worship.
[00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:50.960]   I joked earlier, it moves from being
[00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:53.440]   this feel good Christian karaoke
[00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:55.920]   to actually deepening our connection
[00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:59.920]   and intimacy with Christ, helping us focus on his greatness
[00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:02.600]   and draw strength from his presence.
[00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:05.560]   Or maybe it's community.
[00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:11.080]   Community moves from an obligation
[00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:14.480]   or a solution to loneliness
[00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:19.080]   to stepping into relationship with others,
[00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:20.920]   brothers and sisters in the journey
[00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:26.800]   to offer and gain support, encouragement
[00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:30.720]   and reminders of who we really are when we get distracted
[00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:35.620]   and getting to experience Christ's power collectively.
[00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:42.200]   Or maybe, last one, it's how we view serving
[00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:47.200]   or even giving, that these things move from being a duty,
[00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:51.640]   something that we feel like we should do
[00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:57.280]   to an opportunity to let the love and power
[00:37:57.280 --> 00:38:02.200]   of Jesus Christ flow through your hands and feet
[00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:06.680]   in order to make places that we live, work and play
[00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:09.820]   look and feel more like heaven.
[00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:18.080]   This is a really big deal, church.
[00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:24.080]   And my hope and my prayer is that tonight
[00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:31.160]   that you feel the invitation to step towards Jesus.
[00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:41.000]   The number one question that I get
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:42.880]   when having this conversation is like,
[00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:44.040]   "Drew, this is cool."
[00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:49.520]   But like, "Okay, how do we tap into this?
[00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:50.920]   "How do we, what do we do?"
[00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:56.240]   And tonight I want you to hear, listen,
[00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:58.220]   if you know and love Jesus,
[00:38:58.220 --> 00:39:00.280]   like there's been this moment
[00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:02.040]   where you've pushed all the chips in,
[00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:04.840]   like Texas Holdemstall, your life is his.
[00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:11.840]   Then there's nothing you do.
[00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:13.500]   Christ is already in you.
[00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:20.320]   For example, 10 years ago, a little over 10 years ago,
[00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:26.480]   I stood on that altar with my wife and made huge promises.
[00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:33.540]   I am no more married today than I was 10 years ago.
[00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:41.320]   But I am more deeply in love with Jane
[00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:43.600]   than I was 10 years ago.
[00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:46.760]   I'm closer to her.
[00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:51.200]   She's legitimately become my best friend.
[00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:55.000]   I really feel like in many situations
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.040]   that I can tell exactly what she's thinking
[00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:59.580]   before she even says what's on her mind.
[00:39:59.580 --> 00:40:03.140]   How does that happen?
[00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:06.000]   Hear me, church, please.
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:12.800]   Not because of performance or pretending.
[00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:18.800]   It has everything to do with proximity and time.
[00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:22.640]   That's it.
[00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:25.000]   That's it.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:27.960]   That's it.
[00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:33.520]   And so tonight,
[00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:39.400]   may you feel the invitation of Jesus
[00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:44.040]   to just be with him.
[00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:50.560]   And in his presence, you will become more and more aware
[00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:53.720]   of his presence in you.
[00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:57.840]   And that's what changes everything.
[00:40:57.840 --> 00:41:03.760]   So Jesus, tonight,
[00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:12.640]   Father, I pray that you have spoken clearly to your people.
[00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:15.280]   I pray that every single person in this room
[00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:18.360]   feels zero condemnation, but instead, Father,
[00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:20.840]   they feel your loving kindness,
[00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:23.740]   drawing them closer and closer to you.
[00:41:23.740 --> 00:41:28.760]   And Jesus, whatever you have spoken over your people,
[00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:31.360]   I pray that they would have the courage
[00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:34.320]   and the boldness to say yes.
[00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:37.900]   Believing that you really are trustworthy,
[00:41:37.900 --> 00:41:40.080]   that you really are good.
[00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:47.320]   And Jesus, may we live in this life-changing truth
[00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:51.260]   of Christ in us.
[00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:55.680]   We love you.
[00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:59.160]   And we are learning to trust you.
[00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:02.760]   That's the new way of praying.
[00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:05.340]   (gentle music)
