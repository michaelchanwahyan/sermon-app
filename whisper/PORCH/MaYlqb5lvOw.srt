 [MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:28,480
 Thanks, guys.

3
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,920
 Thank you.

4
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,420
 All right, well, I'm glad to be here.

5
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:33,120
 I usually hang out with college students.

6
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,160
 They're now gone for the summer, so I get to be here tonight

7
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,360
 and to hang out with you guys.

8
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,360
 Really excited to talk about this topic tonight

9
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:46,720
 because, without a doubt, a big part of my quarter life crisis

10
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,160
 involved the topic that we're going to talk about tonight,

11
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,920
 and that is the topic of money.

12
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,880
 So when I moved here to Dallas in 2002,

13
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,720
 I just want to just kind of set up

14
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:00,520
 the context of my story a little bit and let you guys in

15
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:03,440
 on how this topic of money created

16
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,720
 such a crisis in my life.

17
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,400
 So I moved here to Dallas in 2002 to go to seminary.

18
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,760
 Moved here to go to seminary.

19
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,960
 And a little bit of a picture of my financial situation

20
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:17,560
 when I moved here was this, is I was moving here,

21
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,000
 and I had no full-time job.

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,840
 I was going to be a full-time student, maybe do

23
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,020
 some part-time work.

24
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:26,420
 I had very little money in my savings account.

25
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,720
 In fact, the little bit I had, I burned through right away

26
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,360
 because I didn't have a job.

27
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,040
 I had about $20,000 in student loan debt,

28
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,440
 and I was driving a car that was about nine years old

29
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,160
 and had well over 100,000 miles on it.

30
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,720
 And so that was kind of my financial situation.

31
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:46,560
 I was easily one of the most eligible bachelors in Dallas

32
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,240
 showing up with that resume.

33
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,020
 And so it will not surprise any of you

34
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,680
 that I got a date right away.

35
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,680
 So after being here a few months, I met this phenomenal girl.

36
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,560
 Her name was Jackie, and there was like,

37
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,580
 everything about her was amazing.

38
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,680
 And I knew from the beginning that this relationship

39
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,220
 was gonna be very, very different.

40
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:07,720
 And so Jackie was beautiful.

41
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,780
 She loved Jesus.

42
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:10,520
 She had a servant's heart.

43
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,280
 She laughed at my jokes.

44
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,180
 She liked peanut butter.

45
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,520
 She tolerated that I was a NASCAR fan.

46
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,200
 I mean, all this kind of stuff was just, it was amazing.

47
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,420
 I knew this relationship, like God was in it,

48
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,400
 but there was something even better about her

49
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,600
 than all of that other stuff.

50
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,360
 And the thing that was better,

51
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,460
 the thing that was just the icing on the cake

52
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,460
 is that she was an attorney.

53
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,280
 All right?

54
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,720
 And so, I mean, hey, no shame here, all right?

55
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,380
 I was thinking, this is my sugar mama, okay?

56
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:43,840
 This is, I don't know about you guys,

57
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,320
 but this was Psalm 37, four, just playing out,

58
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,660
 like delight yourself in the Lord,

59
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:52,560
 and he will give you the desires of your heart.

60
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,000
 And at the time, I mean, moving here,

61
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,120
 I did not know that the desires of my heart

62
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,200
 were a beautiful attorney that was going

63
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,840
 to just pay off my debt, buy me a new car,

64
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,400
 but it sure sounded awesome.

65
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,340
 And I thought, this is exactly the way God works, right?

66
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,280
 This is it.

67
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,000
 You follow his will.

68
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,200
 You move to Dallas.

69
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,080
 You seek to become a pastor.

70
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,600
 He blesses you with a rich wife, okay?

71
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,560
 And so that's, it's in my Bible.

72
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,040
 I don't know about yours, but that's in my Bible.

73
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,600
 So this relationship was amazing,

74
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,540
 and things started heating up real quick

75
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,600
 and getting real serious real quick.

76
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,760
 And so it came time in the relationship

77
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,640
 that Jackie and I had to sit down

78
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,360
 and share our financial situation.

79
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,180
 And I was really excited about this conversation, okay?

80
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,920
 And so it got to that night,

81
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,160
 and I remember sitting on the couch going,

82
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,100
 all right, here's my situation.

83
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,280
 I really don't have any income right now,

84
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,240
 nor do I have any prospects of great income

85
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,760
 because I'm in seminary, okay?

86
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,660
 So I've got that.

87
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:45,880
 I've got a used car.

88
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,020
 I got $20,000 in student loan debt.

89
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,080
 And at this point, I've got nothing in savings, okay?

90
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,120
 So there's my situation, yada, yada, yada.

91
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,040
 You love me, all right, let's go.

92
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:53,880
 What's yours?

93
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,700
 What's yours, okay?

94
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,540
 I wanna hear yours.

95
00:03:55,540 --> 00:04:00,240
 And that conversation didn't go anywhere close

96
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,320
 to how I thought it was gonna go.

97
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:05,640
 She told me about her income, and I was like,

98
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,080
 like, what's that number?

99
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,440
 No, that's your bonus, right?

100
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,520
 That's not your income.

101
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,920
 That's your annual bonus, no?

102
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,080
 So she had like this much, much lower income

103
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,900
 than I thought.

104
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:19,480
 Her car that she was driving was a lease.

105
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,320
 She had no savings.

106
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,880
 She had about three or $4,000 in credit card debt.

107
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,720
 And then get this,

108
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:30,040
 she had $100,000 in student loan debt.

109
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,580
 You guys heard of Texas A&M?

110
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,840
 Yeah, she didn't go there, okay?

111
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:41,240
 You guys are whooping because that place is cheap

112
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,100
 and you got no debt, all right?

113
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,980
 All the different colleges in Texas

114
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,940
 that she could have chosen to go to,

115
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:51,420
 she said, I'm gonna go to the two private colleges.

116
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,500
 I'm gonna go do my undergrad at Baylor,

117
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,660
 and then I'm gonna go to SMU Law School,

118
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:56,940
 which, no, don't clap.

119
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:57,940
 This was debt, okay?

120
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,100
 This was a lot of money.

121
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,420
 That stuff is expensive.

122
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:05,300
 And so here we are, I'm sitting there going,

123
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,220
 all right, well, I thought you were gonna be my sugar mama.

124
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,580
 And she's like, I thought you were gonna be my sugar daddy.

125
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,600
 And we're just sitting there going, we got no sugar.

126
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,440
 There's nothing.

127
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,880
 (congregation laughing)

128
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,680
 And so you know what we did?

129
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,520
 We got married.

130
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:22,160
 'Cause all we needed was love, right?

131
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,400
 That that was gonna carry us through.

132
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,660
 So here we are, late 20s.

133
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:29,200
 Late 20s, we get married, and our financial situation

134
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,120
 is relatively low income,

135
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,080
 considering the amazing degree that she had.

136
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,360
 There is no real prospects of major income,

137
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,080
 really, in the future.

138
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,400
 There's one lease and a used car that's getting pretty old.

139
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,240
 There's no savings, and there's $120,000

140
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,780
 in student loan debt, and we did not have a plan.

141
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:53,460
 And I don't know about you guys,

142
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:56,440
 but to me, that really felt like a crisis.

143
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,160
 When I imagined where I was gonna be

144
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,700
 in my late 20s financially,

145
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:03,680
 that was not where I thought I was gonna be.

146
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,120
 That was not the script that I would have written.

147
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,720
 And so the quarter life crisis for me

148
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,480
 had a tremendous amount of pressure with it.

149
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,800
 Because I looked at the situation,

150
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:21,080
 this financial situation, and it just felt very hopeless.

151
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,720
 And I know, and I share that story,

152
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,440
 'cause I know that there's some of you tonight

153
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,880
 that your quarter life crisis regarding money

154
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,720
 may be exactly the same as mine,

155
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:33,240
 where your situation is riddled with anxiety

156
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,160
 and frustration and pressure,

157
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,000
 because you too have a tremendous amount of debt.

158
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,640
 You too don't have a plan.

159
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,160
 You too feel like it's just this mountain

160
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,400
 that you're never, ever, ever going

161
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,520
 to be able to get out of.

162
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,320
 And so maybe that's some of the circumstances

163
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,680
 surrounding your crisis.

164
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,560
 Or maybe for you, your situation,

165
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,880
 maybe you don't have a lot of debt,

166
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,280
 but there's just a lot of fear and anxiety.

167
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,720
 Every time you watch the news

168
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,240
 or read the Wall Street Journal or read the newspaper,

169
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,360
 and you start to hear about what's going on in the economy,

170
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,800
 the state of the dollar,

171
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,560
 you're watching where the markets are going,

172
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,040
 you're wondering what's gonna happen

173
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,560
 if there's another terrorist attack,

174
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,960
 what's gonna happen if the global economy

175
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,280
 really starts to collapse

176
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,280
 like certain people think that it will.

177
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,160
 And so for you, your crisis is,

178
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,520
 you're sitting there and you are just so, just fearful.

179
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,560
 And what you want is you want more money

180
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,160
 to try to protect yourself.

181
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,040
 And so that may be part of your crisis.

182
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,960
 For some of you, it may be that you don't have debt

183
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,080
 or maybe the fear isn't getting you,

184
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,400
 but you just always feel like

185
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,760
 you're trying to catch up financially.

186
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:45,840
 For you, it just feels like you cannot get ahead,

187
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,080
 you can't get anything in a savings account.

188
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,680
 It always feels like there's a bill that needs to be paid

189
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,960
 and you're often running out of money

190
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,920
 before the next paycheck.

191
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,400
 And it's just exhausting

192
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,800
 and you don't know how you're gonna get out of it.

193
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,880
 Or for some of you, it may just be,

194
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,400
 you're just generally discouraged

195
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,000
 because it seems like you feel like in your friend group,

196
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,800
 you're the only one that has to say no.

197
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,840
 You're the only one that can't do

198
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,920
 what it seems like everybody else is doing.

199
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,120
 And so we all may have a different circumstance

200
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,280
 leading to our quarter life crisis with money.

201
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,920
 We all might have different circumstances,

202
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,080
 but what I wanna share with you all tonight

203
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,480
 is that the step out of our crisis,

204
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,880
 regardless of the circumstances,

205
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,600
 the step out of our crisis,

206
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:36,280
 in fact, the first step out of our crisis

207
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,920
 is going to be the exact same

208
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,000
 no matter what your circumstances are.

209
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,400
 So if you've got a tremendous amount of debt

210
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,840
 or if you're just afraid or if you're discouraged

211
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,760
 or you feel like you're always catching up

212
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,520
 or maybe there's some other scenario

213
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,280
 and you feel like you're in a financial crisis right now,

214
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,880
 regardless of the circumstances,

215
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,400
 the first step for you is the exact same first step

216
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,960
 as it was for Jackie and I.

217
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,120
 And it's this biblical principle

218
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,080
 that we're gonna look at tonight.

219
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,000
 And in my time in ministry,

220
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,200
 and I had an opportunity to lead the Money Wise Ministry

221
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,920
 here at Watermark for about 18 months.

222
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,320
 And so in my time in ministry

223
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,400
 and helping out with that Money Wise Ministry,

224
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,080
 and in my time dealing with young adults

225
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,840
 through the merge class,

226
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:24,360
 I have seen that this principle time and time again

227
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,920
 provide a tremendous amount of motivation

228
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:31,360
 for people to take that first step out of their crisis.

229
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,080
 And begin to experience some freedom

230
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,000
 from that crisis financially.

231
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,280
 In fact, this principle was an enormous motivator

232
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,200
 for Jackie and I.

233
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,520
 And so shortly after we got married,

234
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,040
 we just ignored our debt situation for about six months.

235
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,680
 And then six months after we had been married,

236
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,200
 we came into this church in the summer of 2004.

237
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,760
 One of the leaders of this church

238
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,960
 was teaching the principles

239
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,040
 that we're gonna look at tonight.

240
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,200
 And it rattled our cages

241
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,480
 and it provided inspiration for us

242
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,040
 to do something about the debt.

243
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,760
 And so we went home armed with this principle

244
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,160
 and we went home and we said,

245
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,000
 okay, we've gotta do something about this.

246
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,400
 And we started running some numbers

247
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,840
 and figuring out some different scenarios

248
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,680
 and we started praying

249
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,960
 and we started having conversations

250
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,080
 with a lot of our friends.

251
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,800
 And we made that, at the time to us,

252
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,920
 we felt like some really drastic changes in our life.

253
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,400
 And I dropped out of seminary

254
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,080
 and Jackie left her job and found a new job.

255
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,560
 And by the grace of God in the late fall of 2004,

256
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,920
 we made our very first aggressive debt payment

257
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,080
 on that $120,000 in student loan debt.

258
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:41,120
 In March of 2008, we made our last debt payment.

259
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,360
 And so in less than four years,

260
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,640
 we were able to pay that off.

261
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,000
 Thank you.

262
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,160
 Thank you for clapping for me doing something

263
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,720
 I'm legally obligated to have to do, is pay that back.

264
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,680
 So I wore my seatbelt today.

265
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,080
 All right, thank you.

266
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,200
 That's amazing.

267
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,080
 It's such an encouraging crowd.

268
00:10:59,080 --> 00:10:59,920
 I love it.

269
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,640
 Okay, and so that's this principle.

270
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,120
 So let's talk about that principle.

271
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,080
 If you got your Bibles,

272
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,040
 open up to 1 Chronicles 29.

273
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,080
 We're gonna look at this amazing prayer of David.

274
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,200
 And Shane was referencing it a little bit during worship.

275
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,320
 And so here's the situation of what's going on in Israel.

276
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,160
 In the history of Israel,

277
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,240
 this is an enormous moment for them.

278
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,280
 Enormous moment for them.

279
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,280
 They are settled in Jerusalem.

280
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,000
 David, their king, is a good king.

281
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,320
 They had been wandering for years

282
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,360
 and now they're starting to put down roots.

283
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,120
 David has built a grand palace for himself.

284
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,680
 And he has decided that it is now time

285
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,240
 to build a permanent structure for God.

286
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,240
 It is now time to build a temple for God

287
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,240
 because the Israelites at this point

288
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,160
 had to go and worship him in a tent.

289
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,040
 And they felt like, hey, that's probably not great.

290
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,080
 He's the God of the universe.

291
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,000
 He owns everything.

292
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,080
 Maybe we should build him a permanent structure.

293
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,720
 And so David and the leaders

294
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,800
 went through this enormous building campaign type thing

295
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,720
 where they raised all of this money.

296
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,440
 And so here's this kind of this commemorative ceremony

297
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,840
 where David has gathered all the leaders together.

298
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,080
 They have raised all the money

299
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,520
 and they're about ready to launch

300
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,880
 into the building of this permanent structure for God.

301
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,880
 It's a huge moment, a huge moment in the history of Israel.

302
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:17,840
 And it also happens to be the last recorded prayer

303
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,400
 that we have of King David.

304
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,760
 So these are some of his final words.

305
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,520
 And what we're gonna see in this prayer,

306
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,640
 we're just gonna look at six or seven verses tonight.

307
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,600
 We are gonna see this principle

308
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,920
 that if we embrace this,

309
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,200
 we'll be the first step out of our quarter life crisis

310
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,360
 when it comes to money.

311
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:37,200
 And we'll completely transform

312
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,560
 the way we view money and possessions.

313
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,400
 So let's look at this.

314
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,080
 1 Chronicles 29, verse 10.

315
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:42,920
 This is David.

316
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,040
 "David, praise the Lord in the presence

317
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,960
 "of the whole assembly, saying,

318
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:49,440
 "Praise be to you, Lord, the God of our father Israel,

319
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,400
 "from everlasting to everlasting.

320
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,440
 "Yours, Lord, is the greatness and the power

321
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,680
 "and the glory and the majesty and the splendor."

322
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,400
 Get this next verse.

323
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,960
 If you don't mind underlining your Bible,

324
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,360
 you may wanna underline this phrase.

325
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:09,360
 "For everything in heaven and earth is yours."

326
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,120
 For everything in heaven and earth is yours.

327
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,400
 "Yours, Lord, is the kingdom

328
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,920
 "and you are exalted as head over all.

329
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,480
 "Wealth and honor come from you.

330
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,080
 "You are the ruler of all things.

331
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,480
 "In your hands are strength and power to exalt

332
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,920
 "and give strength to all.

333
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,200
 "Now, our God, we give thanks and praise your glorious name."

334
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,480
 And then look at this.

335
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:33,660
 "But who am I and who are my people

336
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:37,440
 "that we should be able to give as generously as this?

337
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:42,900
 "Everything, everything comes from you

338
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:47,000
 "and we have given you only what comes from your hand.

339
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,760
 "We're foreigners and strangers in your sight

340
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,040
 "as were all of our ancestors.

341
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,320
 "Our days on earth are like a shadow without hope.

342
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,520
 "Lord, our God."

343
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,460
 Look at how he wraps this up.

344
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,240
 "All this abundance that we've provided

345
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:01,280
 "for building you a temple for your holy name,

346
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:06,280
 "it comes from your hand and all of it belongs to you."

347
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:11,720
 So I don't know where your circumstances are,

348
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:16,400
 but the principle, the principle that we have to embrace,

349
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,800
 the first step for any of us

350
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,760
 in getting out of our quarter life crisis

351
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,160
 when it comes to money

352
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:26,720
 has to be a deep, deep, deep understanding

353
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,020
 that we are not owners of anything.

354
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:36,800
 David understood in the midst of this enormous moment

355
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,080
 where there was all of this money

356
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,060
 and they were about ready to embark

357
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:42,120
 on this crazy building program,

358
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:46,000
 David understood that all of that, all of that was God's.

359
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,380
 They didn't bring anything to the table.

360
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:50,440
 David understood he was broke.

361
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:55,120
 All he did, all he did

362
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,280
 and all the rest of the leaders of Israel did

363
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,480
 is they just took what God in his grace

364
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,180
 and his mercy had given to them

365
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,740
 and they just turned right back around

366
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:04,940
 and gave it back to God.

367
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:09,400
 The thing that David understood

368
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:13,000
 that I know it took me so long to understand and embrace

369
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,520
 and I know so many people struggle with is this,

370
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,680
 is that our relationship with money and possessions

371
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,300
 is not to be one of ownership,

372
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,760
 it is to be one of stewardship.

373
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,760
 Let me define what I mean by a steward.

374
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,080
 A steward is this,

375
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:33,760
 it is somebody who manages another's property

376
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,920
 and seeks to manage that property

377
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,480
 according to the owner's vision and values.

378
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,600
 That's basically what David was praying here.

379
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,600
 God, everything in heaven and earth is yours,

380
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,880
 it's all yours, wealth and honor come from you.

381
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,080
 God owns it all, God is the one who loans it all to you,

382
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,600
 he's the one who distributes it all to you,

383
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,000
 everything comes from your hand,

384
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,360
 we've only given you what comes from your hand.

385
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:00,160
 And all this abundance that you've provided for your temple

386
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,320
 comes from your hand and it all belongs to you.

387
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,520
 Our relationship is not to be one of ownership,

388
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,560
 it is to be one of stewardship.

389
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,160
 And like that blew my mind the first time I heard that.

390
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,440
 And it completely flipped all of my preconceived notions

391
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,280
 about my relationship with money and possessions,

392
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,420
 it just turned them all upside down.

393
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:28,360
 And became this enormous motivator for Jackie and I

394
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,920
 to finally do something about this debt situation

395
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,060
 that we were in and it transformed every category.

396
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,780
 I mean, it was so far reaching,

397
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:41,240
 it completely changed the way we thought about income.

398
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,080
 I don't know about you guys,

399
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,960
 but right after I graduated from college,

400
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,920
 I was an accounting major

401
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,800
 and so I was working in the accounting industry.

402
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,320
 And so when I first graduated from college,

403
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,900
 I thought that income was a scoreboard.

404
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:56,760
 When I had that ownership mentality,

405
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,880
 my income was a scoreboard,

406
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:03,200
 it was something to tell you all how successful I was.

407
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,900
 It became this numerical determination

408
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,640
 of my value to the world.

409
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,660
 And every time I got a raise or a bonus,

410
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:13,260
 there was something in me that just kind of wanted

411
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:15,580
 to well up and bow up and just kind of be like,

412
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:17,700
 yeah, that's right, they're finally starting to see

413
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:20,620
 the value that I bring to this organization,

414
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:22,020
 I think they owe me more.

415
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,980
 Like income became this thing that made me arrogant.

416
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:31,060
 But if we understand that we're not owners

417
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,100
 and we are stewards,

418
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:35,300
 then it completely changes the way we think about income.

419
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:38,340
 Income's no longer a scoreboard,

420
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:41,660
 it is now an enormous responsibility.

421
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:47,480
 This is money that the creator of the universe

422
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,820
 has given to me

423
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:54,340
 because he trusts me and he wants me to use that

424
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,740
 not according to my vision and values,

425
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,860
 but according to his vision and values.

426
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,780
 Completely changed the way we thought about income,

427
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,300
 completely changed the way we thought

428
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,080
 about spending and stuff.

429
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,160
 I don't know about you guys, but the way I grew up,

430
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,620
 the way I grew up, money equaled fun.

431
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:12,460
 That was the way that I saw it.

432
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:15,140
 I mean, I didn't even grow up in Dallas, right?

433
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:19,140
 I grew up in Maryland, up in the Washington DC area,

434
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:22,800
 and I understood that, that totally threw me off.

435
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,940
 I am so sorry about that.

436
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:24,780
 I was like, are they whooping?

437
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,060
 Did I say A and M by accident?

438
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:28,220
 I didn't know what the whoop was, so I'm sorry.

439
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,940
 Okay, again, forgive me.

440
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,620
 So, all right, so I grew up in the DC area

441
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:34,780
 and it was just like this, money was just this fun thing.

442
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,660
 This was a way to go out and have a blast.

443
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:39,140
 I mean, and I still, just a full confession,

444
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:42,820
 I still am so excited about buying new things.

445
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:46,380
 Just like last week, Jackie, I came home

446
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:47,620
 and she told me the wonderful news

447
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,980
 that our vacuum cleaner was acting up.

448
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,500
 And I was like, yes!

449
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,620
 We're gonna go buy a new vacuum.

450
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,100
 This is amazing, okay?

451
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,540
 So you're worried about still being single.

452
00:18:58,540 --> 00:18:59,680
 That's what you got to look forward to,

453
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:03,300
 being excited when you get married about vacuums.

454
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:06,060
 But I was thrilled going, like researching it

455
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:08,380
 and we got this shark thing that was just amazing

456
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,940
 'cause it's called Shark and it sucks everything up.

457
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:13,220
 And I was so excited to get home that day

458
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:16,040
 and put that thing together and go around and vacuum

459
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,620
 and all to the glory of God, you know?

460
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:20,980
 And so it was just all of this stuff.

461
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:25,580
 It just felt fun, but that's like the ownership mentality

462
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:28,580
 is that these goods and the spending is here for me

463
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:31,940
 to make me happy, to feed my emotions.

464
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,420
 But if we understand that we're stewards,

465
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:36,380
 then it's every spending decision,

466
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,020
 really it's a question of, all right, God,

467
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:40,660
 is this what you want me to do with your money?

468
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,220
 Is this going to honor you?

469
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,580
 So it changed our view of income.

470
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,260
 It changed our view of spending.

471
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,380
 Completely changed our view of debt.

472
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:50,660
 When I went to college, when I left for college,

473
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:53,420
 my mom and dad gave me a credit card.

474
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:55,740
 It had my name on it and everything.

475
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,580
 Little Visa, Chase Visa card.

476
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:00,740
 And they were like, had $500 on it, which was amazing.

477
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,700
 That was so much money to me.

478
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,300
 And they gave it to me and they said,

479
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:07,060
 "Adam, this is for emergencies."

480
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:13,380
 They didn't define emergency, okay?

481
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,180
 But it was, all I knew was it was for emergency.

482
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,420
 So when I graduated from college,

483
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:20,320
 I somehow had $3,000 on that card

484
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,820
 that started off with 500, because to me,

485
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:25,560
 an emergency like debt was this tool

486
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:28,240
 to get what I wanted without waiting.

487
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,020
 It was this tool to live one or two income levels

488
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:34,420
 above where I actually was.

489
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,300
 And so, you know, anytime I saw an emergency,

490
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,580
 hey, my friends are going on spring break,

491
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:39,180
 I want to go with them, I don't have money in the bank.

492
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,860
 Emergency, you know, swipe.

493
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,180
 And hey, I need new basketball shoes.

494
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,820
 Emergency, and you know, just swipe.

495
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:46,260
 And it ended up with, it was just this tool.

496
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:47,900
 It felt like everybody else was doing it.

497
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,140
 That was the ownership mentality.

498
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,820
 And then when we start to understand

499
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,780
 and embrace stewardship, we start to realize

500
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:56,340
 that God actually has something to say about debt.

501
00:20:56,340 --> 00:21:00,960
 And what he says is it's dangerous.

502
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,760
 And it's not something to be entered into lightly.

503
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,920
 Proverbs 22, seven says, "The rich rule over the poor."

504
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,640
 Listen to this emotion, like, this is emotional language.

505
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,000
 "The rich rule over the poor,

506
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,860
 "and the borrower is slave to the lender."

507
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:20,120
 The debt, it traps us, and that's certainly what we felt

508
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:23,740
 when we were facing that $120,000 in student loan debt.

509
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:27,740
 And so it became this enormous change

510
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:29,660
 in the way that we viewed debt.

511
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:33,220
 But the category that I think it probably changed us

512
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:38,220
 the most was the way that we thought about generosity.

513
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:42,860
 What I saw growing up when it came to generosity

514
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,220
 was every once in a while,

515
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,420
 giving money to somebody that asked.

516
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:48,560
 I didn't grow up as a follower of Jesus,

517
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,860
 but I had one great example growing up

518
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:51,700
 that I'll never forget.

519
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:55,580
 My aunt, my mom's sister, was a follower of Jesus.

520
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:58,980
 And I do, I would still to this day describe my Aunt Linda

521
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:01,220
 as being one of the most generous people

522
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,380
 on the face of the earth.

523
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:05,060
 And she was very vocal about her generosity

524
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:07,900
 or very excited to be a giver.

525
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,900
 And to me, as like a little kid when I was watching this,

526
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,700
 it meant that she gave great Christmas gifts.

527
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:14,720
 And when she babysat, she gave like twice as much ice cream

528
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,060
 as my mom would give me.

529
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,860
 And so to me, generosity was like,

530
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:19,600
 Jesus, he gives a lot of ice cream

531
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,640
 and they give good Christmas gifts.

532
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:25,680
 But that's basically all I saw of generosity growing up.

533
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,500
 And so when I went to college

534
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,220
 and right through the middle of my college career,

535
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:31,260
 when I became a follower of Jesus,

536
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:34,060
 I just, I started to hear about this thing called generosity

537
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:34,980
 and thought, all right, this is something

538
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:35,820
 I probably should do.

539
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:36,980
 I should probably start giving.

540
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:40,280
 And so I developed early on in my walk with Jesus,

541
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:43,340
 I developed what I thought was the single most generous,

542
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:45,900
 greatest generosity plan ever.

543
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:50,900
 And it was this, is I would go to the ATM machine

544
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:54,020
 on a Friday night and I would get all my money out

545
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:54,940
 for the weekend.

546
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:57,720
 And I had this agreement with God

547
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:01,480
 that anything I had left over on Sunday night,

548
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,940
 because I went to church on Sunday night,

549
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:05,680
 anything I had left over on Sunday night,

550
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,660
 I would give to him, I'd give to the church.

551
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,660
 And so I'd put that money in my pocket

552
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:12,320
 and I'd go all Friday night, all day, Saturday,

553
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,100
 Saturday night, all day Sunday.

554
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,800
 And whatever I had in my pocket,

555
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,300
 I'd walk into church that night

556
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,740
 and I'd drop that little money in there.

557
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:21,100
 And most of the time it was nothing.

558
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,820
 Oftentimes it was one or $2,

559
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:26,340
 but I will never forget the night I walked in

560
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:30,820
 and there was a $5 bill in my pocket.

561
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:33,180
 And I was so nervous because up to that point,

562
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:35,260
 this I had never given away that much money.

563
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,580
 And so I'm walking in there just going,

564
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:37,860
 is it ones or five?

565
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:39,580
 No, it's a five.

566
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:41,940
 All right, did I tell anybody about this plan?

567
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:43,800
 I think, well, God knows.

568
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:46,300
 All right, so I walk in there

569
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,700
 and I walk over to the little table

570
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,260
 and I'm like, huh?

571
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:52,060
 And I just kind of look around

572
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:53,620
 and I put the $5 bill in there.

573
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:56,620
 And I mean, I was just kind of walked around like, yep.

574
00:23:56,620 --> 00:24:00,700
 That just happened, all right?

575
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:04,460
 $5, five whole dollars I just gave to God,

576
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,780
 you are welcome, okay?

577
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:08,000
 And thought they were gonna name the building after me

578
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:08,900
 or something like that.

579
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:11,660
 And so to me, my mindset with generosity,

580
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:14,040
 which is what I think is the mindset with so many of us

581
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,320
 when we take an ownership mentality is this,

582
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,780
 my mindset was live first, give leftovers.

583
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:22,900
 Make sure I'm taken care of

584
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:25,600
 and then just give whatever is left over.

585
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:30,520
 But if we understand that we're not owners of anything,

586
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,580
 but we're rather stewards of everything,

587
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:35,360
 then it flips that around and it says, no,

588
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,040
 your first priority is generosity

589
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:41,540
 and you live off whatever else is left over.

590
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:45,940
 Here's the thing that I've noticed about generosity.

591
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:50,320
 When somebody really understands stewardship,

592
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,980
 this is the first area

593
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:55,580
 where you see the evidence of stewardship.

594
00:24:55,580 --> 00:25:02,500
 I would go so far to say, this is the best indicator

595
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:06,060
 that you understand that you are a steward, not an owner

596
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:09,360
 is how generous you are.

597
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,480
 There's something about generosity.

598
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,780
 It's in the way that we're wired.

599
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:16,940
 It's in the way that we're wired

600
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:19,180
 and there's something about generosity

601
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:22,740
 that what we start to realize when we understand,

602
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:25,620
 when we understand this concept

603
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:29,700
 and we understand that God in his grace and in his mercy,

604
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,860
 he is inviting us in,

605
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:34,940
 inviting us in to be a part of what he is doing.

606
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:38,700
 His vision and values is for the needy and for the oppressed

607
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:42,100
 and for those who are slaves to their sin to be set free.

608
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:44,360
 That's his vision and values.

609
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:49,380
 And in this amazing, amazing thing, God says, guess what?

610
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:51,660
 I'm gonna entrust resources to you

611
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:55,020
 and you get to be a part of this amazing thing

612
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:58,820
 of watching, watching needs be met.

613
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:00,780
 So I've got two boys, a five-year-old and a three-year-old

614
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:02,820
 and last year we were at White Rock Lake

615
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,700
 and we were standing by the water

616
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,180
 and there were some ducks around

617
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:08,260
 and this woman was there with her children

618
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:11,960
 and she was throwing out all this bread to the ducks

619
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,500
 and the kids, or I'm sorry,

620
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,620
 this woman was there with her kids

621
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:16,460
 and they were throwing out bread to the ducks.

622
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:19,100
 And so my two boys, I did not plan appropriately.

623
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,380
 I did not have any bread to give to the ducks.

624
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:23,760
 And so my two boys are watching these other boys

625
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,780
 just have a blast, have a blast,

626
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:27,840
 just freely giving out to the ducks

627
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,380
 and seeing the joy that they have.

628
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,860
 And I'm watching this situation

629
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:32,940
 just starting to feel smaller and smaller.

630
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:34,500
 Like I'm such a terrible parent

631
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,420
 because I didn't bring any bread for my kids to give out.

632
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,620
 And my boys are watching this

633
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:39,780
 and I know where this is going.

634
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:42,300
 This is gonna go to like freak out

635
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,160
 and I'm gonna have to leave.

636
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,500
 So I'm kind of like, all right, boys, let's go.

637
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,820
 Yeah, it looks like they're having a blast.

638
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:47,820
 And so this woman in her kindness,

639
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,620
 she looked at my two boys watching

640
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,740
 and she just took a piece of bread out

641
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,460
 and she just gave it to my boys and said,

642
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:55,560
 "Here, you can have some fun too."

643
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:58,500
 And then my boys sat there and they started giving it out.

644
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,420
 And I was like, what a great picture

645
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:04,620
 of what God is doing with us.

646
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:07,900
 That He is taking His bread.

647
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:11,380
 I mean, He could solve all the world's problems on His own,

648
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:14,900
 but for some crazy reason, He loves to use us.

649
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,380
 And He's inviting us into this and He's saying,

650
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:18,700
 "Hey, here's some bread.

651
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:22,260
 You get to have a blast as you're generous

652
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:24,980
 and you get to go out there and help people."

653
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:30,900
 Here's the thing you guys will understand about generosity.

654
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:36,900
 It is the most fun you will ever have with money.

655
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:39,100
 That's it.

656
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:42,060
 It's the most fun you will ever have.

657
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:48,740
 And I want to show you that, not just tell you that.

658
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:52,060
 And so watch this.

659
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:55,560
 (congregation applauding)

660
00:27:55,560 --> 00:28:06,340
 Don't miss this guys.

661
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:14,460
 There is nothing that you could buy.

662
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:18,900
 There is no car you could drive,

663
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,720
 no article of clothing that you could own.

664
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,380
 There's no apartment that you could live in

665
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:23,380
 or home that you could buy.

666
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:25,900
 There's no restaurant you could eat at.

667
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:28,080
 There's no vacation that you could go on.

668
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:33,500
 That when you completed that transaction,

669
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:37,540
 it would give you the satisfaction

670
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:41,000
 and the joy that generosity does.

671
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:48,900
 That's what I'm looking for when I go to North Park.

672
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,040
 That's what I'm looking for

673
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,760
 when I start to think about what can I buy?

674
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,600
 What can I buy?

675
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,360
 What else can I add to my life?

676
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:57,340
 I am hoping that that thing that I purchase

677
00:28:57,340 --> 00:29:00,340
 is gonna provide some sort of an emotional satisfaction

678
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:01,860
 and lift and fulfillment.

679
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:04,540
 And it never ever does.

680
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:09,780
 Because I have been wired and you have been wired

681
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:13,660
 not to be owners, but rather to be stewards.

682
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:19,700
 When we embrace this life and money and possessions

683
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:22,420
 and our relationship with that stuff is one of ownership,

684
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:23,980
 it leads to crisis.

685
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:28,540
 It leads to crisis, it leads to discontentment,

686
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:30,660
 it leads to frustration, it leads to fear,

687
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:31,940
 it leads to anxiety.

688
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:33,700
 And for every single one of us,

689
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:36,420
 the first step out of that is to understand

690
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:38,540
 that we're not owners, we're stewards.

691
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:44,500
 So I don't know which one of the people in that video

692
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,140
 you identify with more.

693
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:49,260
 Maybe for some of you, you identify with that,

694
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:50,980
 with the widow, with the worker.

695
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:54,740
 And you feel like you're just behind

696
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:58,380
 and there is no hope for your situation.

697
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:01,180
 And what I wanna remind you of is what that sweet lady

698
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:06,180
 put as her license plate, Jay Jaira, Jehovah Jaira,

699
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:11,460
 the name of God that is the Lord provides.

700
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:15,980
 So if you're in a situation that seems hopeless

701
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:18,420
 and you think God has fallen asleep at the wheel

702
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:19,900
 with your financial situation,

703
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:22,620
 I just wanna remind you that you worship the God

704
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:25,180
 of the universe who owns everything

705
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:28,340
 and that you are more important than the birds of the air

706
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:30,580
 and the flowers of the field that Jesus told us,

707
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:32,540
 if God feeds and clothes those,

708
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:34,740
 then he is going to feed and clothe you,

709
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,020
 he's not forgotten you.

710
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:40,620
 And maybe some of you though in this room

711
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:42,580
 feel more like the bakery owners,

712
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:48,100
 where you have been entrusted with more resources

713
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:52,940
 and you have an opportunity to change hundreds,

714
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:55,020
 if not thousands of lives

715
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:58,180
 with a complete and total reordering

716
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:59,740
 of your financial world.

717
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:03,220
 And if that's you, I just want to remind you

718
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:05,540
 of also what Jesus said that to whom much is given,

719
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:07,940
 much is expected and entrusted.

720
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:11,600
 And with a room this size guys,

721
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,940
 with this many people in here,

722
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:15,020
 if just a few of you,

723
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:17,180
 if just a few of you embrace the stewardship

724
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:18,420
 and flipped everything around

725
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:21,380
 and understood that you were stewards and not owners,

726
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:25,120
 I'm telling you, things will change in this city.

727
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,860
 You guys talk about changing the world

728
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:27,940
 through the lives of young adults,

729
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:31,900
 I think God wants to work in and through the resources

730
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:34,180
 that he has entrusted to you.

731
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:36,660
 You guys have an enormous responsibility

732
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:39,940
 and I want you to feel that pressure.

733
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,580
 I don't want you to walk out of here tonight

734
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:43,180
 just feeling the same.

735
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:44,660
 I'm just going, hey, I'm a scoreboard.

736
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:45,940
 This stuff is here for me.

737
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:47,660
 It's not for you.

738
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:51,220
 And God in his grace and mercy,

739
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:54,900
 he's invited you in, you get to participate.

740
00:31:54,900 --> 00:32:00,800
 There's something in you that comes alive

741
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,620
 when you are seeking to be generous.

742
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:07,620
 But the flip of that is also true.

743
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:10,580
 There's something in each and every one of us

744
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:15,580
 that is dead if we are not embracing this stewardship.

745
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:21,300
 So our relationship is not to be one of ownership,

746
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:23,420
 it is to be one of stewardship.

747
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:25,980
 Our job is to get to know the owner

748
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:29,740
 and seek to manage those resources that he has given us,

749
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:32,100
 not according to our vision and values,

750
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:35,520
 but according to his vision and values.

751
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,540
 Let's pray that we can do that, will you?

752
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,820
 (congregation murmurs)

753
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:43,420
 God, you're the owner of it all.

754
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:47,260
 We just confess that here tonight before you.

755
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:52,260
 You own everything.

756
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:57,440
 So there is no need in this room that is too big for you.

757
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:02,340
 And the resources that you have given to us are not,

758
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:05,240
 not just to make our life easier or more comfortable.

759
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:10,260
 So God, as we were praying before this night started,

760
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:12,880
 change us, call us out, Lord.

761
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:19,580
 Rattle our cages and help us, Lord,

762
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:22,760
 to see that what we've been entrusted with,

763
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:26,020
 that that can change the world.

764
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:30,620
 God, help us to be generous

765
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:35,340
 because that is such a phenomenal representation

766
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:36,300
 of who Jesus is.

767
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:40,260
 And God, we worship you for your generosity.

768
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:43,540
 And thank you that you have paid a debt for all of us

769
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:44,660
 that we could not pay.

770
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:48,860
 And thank you for sending your son, Jesus.

771
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,500
 Change us, Lord.

772
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,180
 Use us, Lord, please.

773
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:54,260
 Amen.

774
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:55,100
 Amen.

775
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,680
 (upbeat music)

776
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:00,260
 (upbeat music)

777
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:10,260
