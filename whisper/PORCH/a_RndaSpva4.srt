1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:17,040
 - What's up guys?

3
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,240
 (audience cheering)

4
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,500
 Hey, if you're here in Dallas,

5
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,820
 I just wanna thank you for your patience

6
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,000
 in putting up with the parking.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,240
 And man, we got an amazing parking team out there though,

8
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,740
 man, can we give those guys a hand?

9
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,040
 (audience cheering)

10
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,760
 If you're not here in Dallas,

11
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,280
 you're in Fort Worth or Houston or El Paso or Tulsa

12
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,840
 or somewhere else tuning in around the world,

13
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,720
 we wanna welcome you.

14
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,880
 And so thank you for being a part of this movement.

15
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:45,080
 Thank you for believing in the gospel in your city,

16
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,440
 for wanting to learn from God's word in your city

17
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,720
 and changing the world with us.

18
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,800
 And so that's what we're here to do.

19
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,680
 And so I'm always encouraged when I come out here

20
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,200
 and I see all of you because when I was in college

21
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:59,380
 and thereafter college, I was not walking with God.

22
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:04,020
 And I wanted to just pursue all the things in the world.

23
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:04,980
 And so that's where I was.

24
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:07,460
 I wouldn't have been here candidly.

25
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:09,940
 And so I'm glad that you guys are.

26
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:11,780
 And so as a part of that story,

27
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,580
 one time when I was in college, I got arrested.

28
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:15,420
 A true story.

29
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:18,220
 It wasn't, not anything great,

30
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:21,100
 not that getting arrested is great under any circumstances,

31
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,460
 but not a super cool story.

32
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,900
 I was just drunk, okay?

33
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,660
 And so public intoxication evidently is against the law.

34
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:31,700
 And so a police officer comes,

35
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,220
 wants to give me a breathalyzer.

36
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:38,060
 I say no, and he throws me in the back of his sedan.

37
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,920
 And so with some hardware, with some bracelets.

38
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,580
 And so he takes me to the jail

39
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,380
 and like as hard as I thought I was,

40
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:50,700
 and just like, you know, confident as I thought I was,

41
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,780
 I was scared.

42
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,980
 It's not fun to go to a jail.

43
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,660
 And so they like take you through this process,

44
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:58,100
 your mug shots, the whole deal,

45
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,580
 puts you in a cell.

46
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,260
 I get to share a cell.

47
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:04,260
 My new roommate speaks no English whatsoever.

48
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,340
 And so I don't know if he's a serial killer

49
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,880
 or what he's in there for, you know?

50
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,720
 That was the first one.

51
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,620
 I'm like, so what did you do?

52
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,300
 And he can't communicate back to me.

53
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,180
 And so I'm like, that is unfortunate.

54
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:15,180
 And so you stay over there, I'll stay over here.

55
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:18,820
 And it was cold and it was gray and dark and everything.

56
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:22,140
 And so then this police officer comes over to me

57
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,180
 with the keys and everything, unlocks the door,

58
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,820
 slides the door open and says, come on.

59
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,620
 And I'm like, that's it, I'm out, you know, let's go.

60
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:30,600
 And he goes, no, no, you gotta make a phone call.

61
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,580
 You get to make a phone call.

62
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,140
 And I was like, that's a real thing?

63
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,940
 It is a real thing, by the way.

64
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,980
 And so he's like, you get to make a phone call.

65
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,940
 And I'm like, who, I'm telling this officer,

66
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,740
 I'm like, who am I gonna call?

67
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,820
 I'm not, I'm good, like, I'll pass.

68
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:43,900
 Give my phone call to him.

69
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:48,540
 And he goes, no, he goes, you need to make a phone call.

70
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,380
 I said, sir, who am I gonna call?

71
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,340
 And he says, you need to call your dad.

72
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,760
 And I was like, nah, I'm good, man.

73
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,220
 (congregation laughing)

74
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,660
 I was like, I'll call your dad, you know.

75
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:01,940
 I'm not calling my dad.

76
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,740
 Like, why, I'm not gonna call my dad.

77
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,140
 You know, what are you talking about?

78
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,020
 And so let's just push pause right there

79
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,340
 for just a second, okay?

80
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,020
 And so you feel the circumstance,

81
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,300
 you understand the situation.

82
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,840
 Why didn't I want to call my dad?

83
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,140
 Now, you can just think about that for a moment.

84
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,940
 Like, everything that's going on right there.

85
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:22,940
 Like, why did I not want to call my dad?

86
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:25,440
 And you can think of the list of reasons.

87
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,780
 You could come up with the real list of things.

88
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:31,540
 I'm thinking, man, he's gonna be so disappointed in me.

89
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,460
 Like, I don't wanna deal with that.

90
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,620
 He's gonna be discouraged.

91
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,700
 I don't wanna call my dad and get an earful.

92
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,540
 You did what?

93
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,820
 I can't believe this, you know, I told you that.

94
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,940
 I just, I don't wanna do that, right?

95
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,460
 And then I'm thinking, man, my dad,

96
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:45,540
 he's dealing with other things.

97
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:48,580
 He doesn't have time to handle this situation.

98
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:49,980
 And then I'm thinking, my dad doesn't even know

99
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,680
 how to handle this situation.

100
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,500
 Like, what's he gonna do?

101
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,180
 You know, he doesn't have a lot of money.

102
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,580
 Like, I don't know how he's gonna get,

103
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,540
 not gonna post bond or bail or whatever.

104
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,660
 Like, he, why would I call him?

105
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:03,380
 There's not anything that he's going to do.

106
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:06,220
 In fact, he's just gonna do what he wants to do anyways,

107
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,660
 right, these are the things going through my mind.

108
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:10,360
 And then I'm thinking, you know what, I can handle this.

109
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,680
 Like, you know what, I can keep this from them.

110
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,540
 They don't ever have to know that I was in here.

111
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:16,740
 We don't have to talk about it,

112
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:19,420
 I don't have to deal with it, I can handle it.

113
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:24,420
 And so for those reasons, I didn't want to go to my father.

114
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:26,940
 And as you think about that,

115
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,680
 I think these are the same reasons

116
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,220
 we don't want to go to our father, okay?

117
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,160
 I don't know what your day looked like today.

118
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,300
 If you're here, you're a follower of Jesus Christ,

119
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,380
 if you are, if you trust in Christ,

120
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,820
 you identify as a Christian, okay?

121
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,000
 You call yourself a Christ follower.

122
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,840
 What that means is that a part of your day today

123
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,880
 was spent communing with God, talking with God,

124
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,440
 conversing with God.

125
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,920
 You spent some extended time in prayer,

126
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,640
 both all the time, all your different circumstances,

127
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,440
 and then probably at some point in your day,

128
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,800
 you stepped away and said, hey God, it's just me and you,

129
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,640
 I want to talk to you.

130
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,320
 And if you didn't, you need to ask yourself why.

131
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,080
 Well, why, and why would you assume

132
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,940
 that you're a Christ follower?

133
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:13,120
 Why would you assume that you have a relationship

134
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,800
 with God, the creator of the heavens and the earth,

135
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,740
 you have access to him,

136
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,940
 and you didn't take advantage of that today?

137
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:22,520
 And if you start to wonder why you didn't,

138
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:25,100
 and I'm gonna ask you, why didn't you?

139
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:28,000
 I think you're gonna come up with a really similar list.

140
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,480
 Man, I just, I don't know, I've done some things.

141
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:35,680
 God, he's gonna be disappointed in me,

142
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,640
 he just feels far right now.

143
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,920
 I mean, does he even care?

144
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,980
 And he's got bigger things,

145
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,720
 I mean, there's children dying today,

146
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,920
 and people starving,

147
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,920
 and I'm not gonna come to him with my little,

148
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:49,680
 and isn't he just gonna do what he wants to do anyways?

149
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,680
 Like, why would I pray?

150
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,440
 Isn't he just going to do his thing?

151
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,440
 And you know what, I think I can handle this stuff.

152
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,080
 I got it under control.

153
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,440
 And in fact, I asked you on social media,

154
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,960
 I just pinged you guys out there,

155
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,600
 and just said, hey, why don't we pray?

156
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,840
 Why doesn't young adults pray?

157
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,400
 Why don't young adults pray?

158
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,040
 And you guys had some great responses, thank you for that.

159
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,320
 And so on Twitter, and Facebook,

160
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,800
 and the social media I'm a part of,

161
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,040
 you said that list, and you added to it two other things.

162
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,600
 You said, because we're busy,

163
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,400
 and because we don't know how.

164
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,760
 And so let's just talk about that.

165
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,160
 We're in this series talking about the remnant.

166
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,160
 Let me define the remnant for you really clearly.

167
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,640
 The remnant just means God's people.

168
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:42,080
 And so we're talking about what God's people do,

169
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,080
 how we stand apart in this world,

170
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,680
 how we're not a part of this world,

171
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,480
 we stand in contrast to this world,

172
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:53,160
 and what marks the remnant, what marks God's people.

173
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,920
 God's people talk to God.

174
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:01,720
 Simply put, the remnant are people who pray.

175
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,160
 So if you're a part of the remnant,

176
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,480
 something that's normal to your life,

177
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,880
 is that you converse, you have the privilege

178
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:15,840
 of conversing with the creator of the heavens and the earth.

179
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,960
 And here's what I need you to know,

180
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,920
 this is so important, lean in.

181
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,560
 If you miss everything else tonight,

182
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,280
 I want you to hear this.

183
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,480
 God loves you.

184
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:30,240
 He's not mad at you.

185
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,520
 He's not disappointed in you.

186
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:38,160
 And he's eager to talk to you.

187
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,360
 He wants to converse with you.

188
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,160
 He wants you, this is crazy what I'm about to say,

189
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,000
 you ready?

190
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,240
 He wants you to ask him for stuff.

191
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:54,800
 Anything that is spinning around in your heart and your mind

192
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,440
 he wants you to go to him with.

193
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,960
 He wants to hear about it.

194
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,320
 He wants you to talk with him.

195
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,840
 He desires that.

196
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,080
 The scripture says this so many times

197
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,720
 in so many different ways, over and over and over.

198
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:15,760
 And I think you're right when you say we don't know how.

199
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,800
 We don't know how.

200
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,720
 We're so weird about prayer.

201
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,520
 We brought all this baggage in with us.

202
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,480
 I don't know what your church background is,

203
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,160
 but we're like, hey, I'm gonna do it.

204
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:30,560
 Dear God, like I'm writing a letter.

205
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,720
 Dear God.

206
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:36,520
 And we just say silly things.

207
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,080
 Like why do we do that?

208
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,080
 And some of the things that we say aren't silly,

209
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,920
 but we don't know why we say them.

210
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:51,720
 We use the word bless, which means to make happy.

211
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,320
 Lord, bless this food.

212
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,640
 Make it cheerful.

213
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,880
 Make it happy food.

214
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,840
 And bless the hands that prepared it.

215
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,200
 Make them happy hands.

216
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:08,520
 And maybe you pray to saints.

217
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,280
 Somebody told me the other day, a friend of ours was sick,

218
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,520
 and they just said, hey, I'm sending thoughts your way.

219
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,360
 As a Christian, I'm sending thoughts your way.

220
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,360
 What does that mean?

221
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,520
 Stop it.

222
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:22,640
 Send prayers my way.

223
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,480
 How about that?

224
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,360
 I don't need your thoughts.

225
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,040
 I'll take your prayers, right?

226
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,320
 And maybe you cross yourself.

227
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,240
 Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

228
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,960
 Or at the end, you say, in Jesus' name, which is fine.

229
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,800
 That's fine you say that.

230
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,240
 Do you know why you say that?

231
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,400
 Why do you say in Jesus' name?

232
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,720
 Is it just because everyone's always done that?

233
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,760
 Why do we do what we do?

234
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,360
 Let's learn how to pray.

235
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,680
 The remnant prays.

236
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,080
 If we believe that there's a God who loves you

237
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,760
 and he's eager to help, I think we'd pray more.

238
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,520
 I think the reason that we don't pray,

239
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,280
 the number one reason we don't pray

240
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,280
 is we have a wrong perspective of God.

241
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,840
 He's a Father who loves us, who's crazy about us,

242
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,800
 and desires us to talk to them.

243
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,360
 And with prayer, I want you to know

244
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,000
 there is only benefit, no cost whatsoever,

245
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,320
 only benefit to your life.

246
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,800
 It is one thing, a very few things in this world

247
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:20,560
 that you can do that has zero downside, all upside,

248
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,520
 as you get to talk to the creator

249
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,440
 of the heavens and the earth.

250
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:26,880
 As we move through this text in Luke chapter 11,

251
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,240
 we're gonna look at what is prayer,

252
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:32,160
 how we pray, and why we pray

253
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,400
 before you leave here this evening.

254
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,840
 Luke wrote this in about 59 AD.

255
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,000
 He was not one of the apostles.

256
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,160
 He researched the life of Christ and wrote it down.

257
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,600
 This is a very well-researched document,

258
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,840
 the Gospel of Luke.

259
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,200
 And so in prayer, I could've gone

260
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,040
 a lot of different places.

261
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,720
 I could've gone 1 Thessalonians 5,

262
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,000
 Colossians 4, Philippians 4, James 1,

263
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,280
 James 4, James 5, Matthew 6,

264
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:57,920
 Jeremiah, Isaiah, Ephesians 6.

265
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,080
 But I went here because Jesus

266
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,320
 is going to teach us how to pray.

267
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,280
 And he says this, it starts off,

268
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,000
 "One day Jesus was praying,"

269
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,500
 so he's modeling it for us in a certain place,

270
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,920
 which is odd, okay, because he's been with God

271
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,060
 for eternity past.

272
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,160
 He is God.

273
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,560
 He's been with the Father eternity past,

274
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,020
 but when he was here on this earth,

275
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:21,760
 he spent a lot of time talking to the Father.

276
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,600
 And so that's something to take note.

277
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,720
 And when he finished praying,

278
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,000
 one of his disciples said to him,

279
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,360
 "Lord, teach us to pray just as John

280
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,880
 "taught his disciples," all so strange.

281
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,400
 Because have you ever seen someone praying,

282
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,440
 you're like, wow, you're really good at that.

283
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,440
 Will you teach me how?

284
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,280
 I mean, it's just not something,

285
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,120
 you might be like, hey, teach me how to shoot a free throw

286
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,640
 or something, but probably not.

287
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,480
 Wow, I'm so amazed at your ability to talk.

288
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,200
 Can you teach me how to do that?

289
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,480
 And so he said to them,

290
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,640
 "When you pray, say, Father."

291
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,800
 Stop right there.

292
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:58,760
 He says, "I want you to address the creator

293
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:02,320
 "of the heavens and the earth as Father."

294
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,060
 Just that one word has so much depth and meaning.

295
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:07,320
 But then he says, "Hallowed be your name."

296
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,160
 And he sets up this dichotomy

297
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,280
 that God is holy and set apart,

298
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,280
 that even his name is holy.

299
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,600
 That's what hallowed means.

300
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,880
 His name is holy, and yet you get to call him Father.

301
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:21,300
 (congregation laughing)

302
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:25,160
 Give us each day our daily bread.

303
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,200
 Give us what we need today.

304
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,360
 Forgive us our sins,

305
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:34,200
 for we also forgive everyone who sins against us.

306
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,440
 And lead us not into temptation.

307
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,720
 And so he says, hey, this is how you pray.

308
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,400
 You pray to the Father,

309
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:45,600
 and you tell him, or you ask him for things.

310
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,600
 He gives, he forgives, and he helps us.

311
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:54,080
 We need to know that, that he gives to us,

312
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:57,580
 he forgives us, and he helps us in this world

313
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:00,240
 with the problems that we encounter here,

314
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,460
 namely temptation.

315
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:04,120
 And so my first point tonight, what is prayer?

316
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,960
 We're answering the question, what is prayer?

317
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:09,280
 It's accessing God as Father.

318
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:14,040
 Prayer is accessing God as Father anytime.

319
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,680
 You can access him as Father anytime.

320
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:22,680
 The remnant accesses God, the creator, as their Father,

321
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:28,880
 and they can do it anytime they want.

322
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,460
 Friends, prayer, simply put, you're like, I don't know how.

323
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:34,720
 If you know how to speak, you know how to pray.

324
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,640
 If you know how to ask somebody for anything,

325
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,980
 you know how to pray.

326
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:40,940
 You don't have to go somewhere special.

327
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:44,400
 You don't have to use particularly careful words.

328
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:48,920
 You can just say, hi, God, this is what's going on.

329
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,240
 I need your help.

330
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,800
 Can you show me this?

331
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,160
 Can you give me this?

332
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,640
 Can you help me understand this?

333
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:06,480
 Prayer is asking, it's confessing, it's thanking,

334
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,960
 and it's worshiping or adoring.

335
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:14,940
 You can just stop during the day and say, God, you're amazing.

336
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:18,060
 You're so holy.

337
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:21,740
 You're set apart, you're sovereign, you're all powerful.

338
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,060
 You amaze me, God.

339
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:26,620
 Thank you for bringing the son up today, God.

340
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:29,020
 I'm going to work today.

341
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:34,020
 In a car, God, it's amazing the way you've blessed me, God.

342
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:39,180
 But Jesus says something profound here, guys.

343
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:43,660
 He says, you get to call my daddy your daddy.

344
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:49,860
 16 times in the Old Testament, God is referred to as Father.

345
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:53,200
 But all 16 times in the Old Testament,

346
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,760
 it's like father of a nation, father of Israel.

347
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,300
 It's like a generic kind of like our forefathers,

348
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,140
 if you will.

349
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:02,100
 And then Jesus shows up on the scene,

350
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,900
 and Jesus calls him Abba.

351
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,020
 He calls him Daddy, calls him Father,

352
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,740
 over and over, Father, Father, Father.

353
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,140
 And then he shows up here, and he says,

354
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:13,580
 hey, you get to call my dad your dad.

355
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,780
 He can be your dad.

356
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:18,220
 It's a very personal thing.

357
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,980
 And you know why you can do that?

358
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:22,660
 Because Jesus allows you to do that.

359
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:26,620
 Remember when Jesus died on the cross and the veil was torn?

360
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:28,980
 Now you have access to God anytime.

361
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:29,820
 Why?

362
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:30,980
 Because he's with you.

363
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:33,220
 God's Holy Spirit is with you.

364
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:35,520
 Anywhere you go, he's with you.

365
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,800
 When you sit at your cube, he's with you.

366
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,600
 Go into your office, he's with you.

367
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,340
 Into your apartment, he's with you.

368
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:44,220
 In the car, God is with you.

369
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:47,500
 In the bathroom, God's there too.

370
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:51,960
 And you can talk to him like he's right there.

371
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:55,100
 You ever felt lonely?

372
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,320
 You're never alone.

373
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:00,500
 God is with you.

374
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,480
 Wherever you go, God is with you.

375
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:09,160
 Hebrews 4, it says, because Jesus is now our high priest,

376
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:12,000
 that we, it says, let us then approach God's throne

377
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,320
 of grace with confidence so that we may receive mercy

378
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,560
 and find grace to help us in our time of need.

379
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,360
 That Jesus is the mediator.

380
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,880
 This is what this means.

381
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:25,760
 It's like when I'm in that jail and I call my dad.

382
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:29,460
 You know, and the phone's ringing and I'm there nervous

383
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:32,000
 because I've done something wrong and I've got to tell him

384
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,140
 I got arrested.

385
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:35,120
 It's like Jesus answers the phone.

386
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:35,960
 Hello?

387
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,720
 Jesus, can I talk to my dad?

388
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,800
 Hold on a second.

389
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,300
 Hey, it's your son and he's innocent.

390
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:49,500
 Completely blameless, faultless.

391
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,960
 He hasn't done anything wrong.

392
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,660
 You remember I erased that?

393
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:57,340
 I paid for that.

394
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:01,200
 That you literally get to talk to God today as blameless.

395
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,560
 He doesn't look at you and see the pornography

396
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:07,600
 or the abortion or the identity in relationships

397
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,600
 or that you stole or the words you used.

398
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:15,920
 That he sees the payment in his son, Jesus Christ,

399
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,080
 and you get to approach the father

400
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:21,000
 as a faultless, righteous child,

401
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,440
 declared righteous through the son.

402
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,320
 This is crazy.

403
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,880
 This is unbelievable.

404
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,340
 In the gospel, this is what it means, friends,

405
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:29,680
 to pray in Jesus's name.

406
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,960
 That's why we add that on the prayer at the end

407
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,880
 when you say in Jesus's name,

408
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,540
 and you don't have to say it,

409
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:37,240
 you can pray in the name of Jesus.

410
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,320
 It's because of what Jesus did

411
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,280
 that you get to talk to the father.

412
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:46,620
 You go to the father through the son by the spirit.

413
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:50,040
 And so if you've trusted in Christ,

414
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,120
 then you get to come to God like a child.

415
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:56,640
 Not like a child, like his child, and that's different.

416
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:01,780
 I was speaking at a camp a couple weeks ago,

417
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:04,840
 and I took my son with me.

418
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,560
 He's out of state, and I took my son with me,

419
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:10,280
 and they had someone watching him

420
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,920
 while I was speaking, and I went long,

421
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,200
 which is not crazy for me.

422
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,360
 Sometimes that happens.

423
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,840
 And so he got tired of waiting,

424
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,640
 and for some reason, I don't know why,

425
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,520
 but he thought that I left him.

426
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,340
 And so he got scared.

427
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:24,360
 He's five years old, and he just started crying.

428
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,000
 He's thinking, "Daddy left him,

429
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,640
 "and they wouldn't let him come to me."

430
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:31,400
 So he's pretty quick, and he just kind of made a break

431
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,980
 for it, and he got away, and he kind of ran across the camp,

432
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,360
 this five-year-old, by himself,

433
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,440
 and kind of stumbled into the chapel that I was at,

434
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,080
 and he came in, and they held him back

435
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,040
 'cause I was speaking, and they were like,

436
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,600
 "Hey, somebody's talking to you."

437
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,760
 And he's like, "That's my dad."

438
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:49,360
 And I know it was sad.

439
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:53,360
 And I finished, and then they brought him to me,

440
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,740
 and they were like, "Hey, he wanted you,

441
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,760
 "but we didn't want to interrupt you."

442
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,280
 And I was like, "I'm not angry, but you don't have kids.

443
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:05,300
 "If he wanted me, I'll let him come.

444
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:08,160
 "Like, if they need me right now, I'm done."

445
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,320
 I'm like, "D-Marv, come, step up.

446
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,520
 "My family needs me."

447
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:16,080
 At any moment, at any time, regardless the situation,

448
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:21,080
 I'm available to my children, and I'm a bad dad.

449
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:24,760
 Like, you know, I'm a good dad, but I'm a bad dad.

450
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,440
 I'm a sinful dad, I'm a fallen dad.

451
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,520
 Your Father in Heaven, He's a perfect Father,

452
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,880
 very different than your earthly father, a perfect Father.

453
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,600
 He's so crazy about you.

454
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,720
 He's crazy about you.

455
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,640
 He's not disappointed in you.

456
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:45,320
 He's thrilled about you.

457
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,860
 And He just, more than anything He wants,

458
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,680
 if you know Him, if you have a relationship with Him,

459
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,340
 He wants you to get to know Him more,

460
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,200
 and have a relationship with Him.

461
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,900
 And so the remnant approaches the Father as His child.

462
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:03,560
 Verse five, "Then Jesus said to them,

463
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:06,360
 "'Suppose you have a friend, and you go to him at midnight

464
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,840
 "'and say, "Friend, lend me three loaves of bread."'"

465
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,440
 A friend of mine, this is the next verse,

466
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,960
 the literal next verse, so He doesn't finish our Father,

467
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,560
 right, He doesn't, "Our Father who art in Heaven,

468
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,400
 "hallowed be thy name.

469
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,540
 "Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on Earth

470
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:18,380
 "as it is in Heaven.

471
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:19,240
 "Give us this day our daily bread."

472
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,080
 He doesn't say that.

473
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,840
 He says that in Matthew 6, but the reason He doesn't say

474
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:26,120
 that here is 'cause Jesus isn't telling us what to say.

475
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:30,400
 He's not saying, "Hey, use these words."

476
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,800
 He's saying, "Hey, this is how you approach the Father,

477
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,280
 "with this spirit, with this attitude."

478
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:39,520
 Suppose you have a friend, and you go to him at midnight,

479
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,640
 and say, "Friend, lend me three loaves of bread.

480
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,980
 "A friend of mine on a journey has come to me,

481
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:46,120
 "and I have no food to offer him."

482
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:50,160
 And suppose the one inside answers, "Don't bother me.

483
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,720
 "The door is already locked, and my children and I

484
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,680
 "are in bed.

485
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,360
 "I can't get up and give you anything."

486
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,400
 I tell you, even though He will not get up

487
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,040
 and give you the bread because of your friendship,

488
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:04,520
 yet, because of your shameless audacity,

489
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,600
 it says, "Shameless audacity, He will surely get up

490
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,680
 "and give you as much as you need."

491
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:14,280
 Shameless audacity there is the word anodia in the Greek.

492
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,520
 It's one word.

493
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,260
 He's saying, "Hey, this is why He's going to give it to you.

494
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:22,420
 "So I say to you, ask, and it will be given to you.

495
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,640
 "Seek, and you will find.

496
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,520
 "Knock, and the door will be opened to you.

497
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,200
 "For everyone who asks, receive.

498
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,960
 "The one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks,

499
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,080
 "the door will be opened."

500
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:40,320
 This shameless audacity, the asking, seeking, finding,

501
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,760
 has to do with your persistence.

502
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,720
 He's saying, "You come to God persistently."

503
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,600
 Now, what He's not saying is, like,

504
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,120
 if God has this magic number, and if you ask Him

505
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,320
 this magic number of time, then He's going to give it to you.

506
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,640
 Like, once you ask 792 times, He's going to say,

507
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,520
 "Okay, good, here you go."

508
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,240
 That's not what He's saying.

509
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:02,920
 He's saying that because you believed

510
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,800
 that He could meet your need,

511
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,980
 right, you sat there at the door, you're like,

512
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:11,040
 "I need food, you got food.

513
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,640
 "I'm not going anywhere,

514
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,220
 "because I know you have what you need.

515
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:18,340
 "I know you have what I need, rather.

516
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:22,740
 "I have faith that you can meet my need,

517
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:26,660
 "and you're a father, so I'm staying here," right?

518
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:29,180
 And some of you said, "Hey, the reason I don't pray,

519
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:31,860
 "my mind wanders, I'm trying to pray,

520
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,580
 "but my mind drifts, I get distracted,

521
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:36,440
 "my iPhone beeps, I get a text message that comes in,

522
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,860
 "you know, something happens, someone interrupts me."

523
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:40,500
 This is, this verse speaks to this,

524
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,620
 that you sit there, and you focus,

525
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:45,860
 and you fight to hold the thought in your head.

526
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:48,820
 Psychologists have now said, even secular psychologists

527
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:51,360
 have said that this is good for the human,

528
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,820
 that it is a cure for anxiety, for panic disorder,

529
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:58,420
 it's a cure for obsessive-compulsive disorder,

530
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:02,100
 that it's a cure for depression.

531
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:06,900
 They might call it meditation, or mindfulness,

532
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,220
 but that you would sit somewhere,

533
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,680
 and you would fight to hold a thought.

534
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,500
 And if you're a follower of Jesus Christ,

535
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,200
 it's that you're holding a thought

536
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,540
 that God is who he is, and you're asking for him,

537
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:19,620
 and you're blocking out the rest of this world,

538
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:22,020
 you're putting your phone in the other room,

539
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:25,980
 you're making time to prioritize God.

540
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:28,880
 And so how we pray?

541
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,660
 Inactivity and attitude.

542
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,760
 How we pray?

543
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:37,040
 We pray inactivity and attitude.

544
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,740
 The remnant prays inactivity and attitude, right?

545
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:44,260
 Jesus says, "This is how you pray," and then he prays,

546
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:46,220
 and then he models the attitude

547
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:48,520
 that God can give us our daily bread,

548
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:51,920
 that we have an attitude of dependence,

549
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,680
 that we believe that he has what we need,

550
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,700
 that he can meet our needs.

551
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:00,340
 So both in the activity and in the attitude,

552
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:04,540
 let me explain this with two quotes, actually.

553
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:07,300
 The first quote inactivity, this comes from Martin Luther,

554
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,900
 he says, "I have so much to do today

555
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:11,540
 "that I will spend the first three hours in prayer."

556
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:13,740
 You see what he's saying?

557
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:15,340
 "I've got so much to do today

558
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:17,860
 "that I need to start by centering my life

559
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:20,740
 "with just me and God, spending time with him."

560
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:25,340
 This is normal for the believer, for the Christ follower,

561
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:29,700
 that tomorrow you would set aside time

562
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:32,700
 where you don't do anything else but talk to God.

563
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:33,780
 Can I tell you something?

564
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,540
 Test me on this.

565
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:38,700
 It will be the single most productive thing you do tomorrow.

566
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:43,140
 You will have gotten more done in that 30 minutes

567
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,740
 or that hour than any other time

568
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,660
 because who do you think's more effective,

569
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:49,300
 you, little old you,

570
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,540
 or the creator of the heavens and the earth?

571
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:55,100
 So you can do it on your own

572
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:58,660
 or you can invite the creator of the heavens and the earth,

573
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:00,540
 all-powerful God who says,

574
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:03,220
 "Call me Father to partner with you."

575
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:06,060
 Now the problem is we don't believe that.

576
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:09,340
 It's the most productive thing that you will do.

577
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:12,300
 The most important thing that you will do

578
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,980
 is talking to God tomorrow.

579
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:19,220
 And so set time aside to talk to God.

580
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:21,260
 And then the attitude, so that's activity,

581
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:23,100
 the attitude, and here's a quote,

582
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,300
 "I rarely pray for 20 minutes,

583
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:28,500
 "but I rarely go 20 minutes without praying."

584
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,340
 That is this attitude of dependence

585
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:32,380
 that constantly I'm talking to God.

586
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:36,260
 I know that I can trust him, that he knows better than me.

587
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:38,500
 I believe that you can meet my need, God,

588
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:42,860
 so I'm remaining persistent even as I go about my day.

589
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:44,580
 I'm constantly talking to you

590
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,860
 with an attitude of dependence.

591
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,060
 You guys imagine, like whatever,

592
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:51,100
 like your boss comes in, leaves, you're frustrated,

593
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,100
 you're just like, you go to God,

594
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:55,020
 "God, help me to respond in the spirit."

595
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,340
 Relationship doesn't go as,

596
00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:01,020
 "Well, Lord, help me to date in a way that honors you,

597
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,780
 "protect me from myself,

598
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:05,460
 "remove this from my life if it's bad for me.

599
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:08,220
 "And Father, my heart hurts right now

600
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,060
 "because of what happened.

601
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,500
 "Will you help me heal?

602
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:13,540
 "God, I wanna do this this weekend.

603
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:15,500
 "Is that good, is that smart?

604
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,100
 "I don't wanna do anything outside your will.

605
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,580
 "I mean, my flesh, I really want to,

606
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:19,860
 "but I don't know if you want me to,

607
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,380
 "and I get the sense that you don't want me to,

608
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:22,460
 "but I really, really want to,

609
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:23,300
 "but if you don't want me to,

610
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,260
 "please don't let me, okay?"

611
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:28,460
 It's okay, you can handle that kind of stuff.

612
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:31,140
 You can talk to him just like that.

613
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:37,220
 You should talk to him just like that all the time.

614
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:40,980
 That that would be normal for your life.

615
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,740
 And so Jesus, he did both of these,

616
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:45,060
 the attitude and the activity.

617
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:47,020
 He would pray all the time.

618
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:48,140
 We see that in the Gospels,

619
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,700
 but he would also have long prayers.

620
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,100
 Luke 5, verse 16 says,

621
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:54,820
 "But Jesus often withdrew to lonely places and prayed."

622
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:58,140
 And so you guys told me that one of the reasons

623
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,620
 you don't pray is 'cause you're too busy.

624
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:03,140
 If you're too busy to pray, you're too busy, period.

625
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:07,020
 If you're too busy to pray, you're too busy.

626
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:10,300
 Like you have to change something

627
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:13,340
 'cause life only gets busier, I promise you.

628
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,380
 There's not a person in the room

629
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:19,020
 who is going to disagree with me on that statement later.

630
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:21,140
 It only gets busier.

631
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,300
 So you have to right now when you're 18,

632
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:26,300
 when you're 22, when you're 23, when you're 35,

633
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:28,900
 you have to prioritize prayer right now.

634
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:32,060
 If you don't, you will not later.

635
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:35,980
 And if we don't pray, we're taking God for granted.

636
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:37,660
 Listen, prayer, you gotta hear me.

637
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:40,700
 Like, prayer works.

638
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:44,140
 Like, prayer works.

639
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:46,660
 I've heard it said that when we work, we work,

640
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,660
 but when we pray, God works.

641
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:51,740
 Prayer, it's effective.

642
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:54,620
 The Scripture even says it's powerful and effective.

643
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:57,220
 Praying in the will of God is a really powerful thing,

644
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:59,380
 maybe the most powerful thing in your life.

645
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:05,060
 I was in Disney World with another child recently.

646
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,500
 I told you about it several weeks ago.

647
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,700
 So my daughter and I got to go to Disney World

648
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:12,260
 and we went to Animal Kingdom and there's a ride there

649
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:15,660
 in Pandora, which is like Avatar land, it's pretty amazing.

650
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:20,660
 And there's a ride there called The Flight of the Avatar.

651
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:23,740
 And I heard it's incredible and I wanted to go.

652
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:25,540
 Anybody been in The Flight of the Avatar?

653
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:27,780
 Okay, good, yeah, you gotta know, it's awesome.

654
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:31,260
 And so they told me, people who know Disney World said,

655
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:33,620
 hey, you gotta get there right when it opens

656
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:38,620
 and race to that ride if you want any hopes of riding it.

657
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:39,700
 And so we did that.

658
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:40,940
 We got there at 9 a.m.

659
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:43,580
 When the park opened, gates opened, we ran to the ride.

660
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:48,580
 It's now 9.01 and I'm walking up and the line is four hours.

661
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:53,980
 Four hours at 9.01, are you serious?

662
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,180
 And so I'm there and I'm like,

663
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:57,820
 we are not gonna spend half our day in this line.

664
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,660
 I don't care how awesome it is.

665
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:02,140
 And my daughter Finley, she's just,

666
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:02,980
 I'm like, what are you doing?

667
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,140
 She goes, I'm praying that we would have

668
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,980
 a FastPass to this ride.

669
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:08,540
 FastPass, it's a thing at Disney.

670
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:10,460
 You can just go right on the ride.

671
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:12,780
 But I'm like, baby girl, we don't have a FastPass

672
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:15,540
 because daddies that really love their children

673
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:17,980
 got on the app early and I didn't.

674
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:22,180
 No, and I'm like, we don't have a FastPass, sweetie.

675
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:23,220
 I'm sorry.

676
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:25,900
 And she goes, well, that's why I'm praying that we do.

677
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,580
 [congregation laughing]

678
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:30,060
 And I go, okay, well, let's go see what else there is.

679
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:32,220
 She goes, no, no, let's go see if we have a FastPass.

680
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:34,780
 I'm like, but I'm telling you, we don't.

681
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:37,620
 And I walk up there, the guy there in the FastPass booth,

682
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:39,700
 you put your little bracelet on there

683
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:42,460
 and if you have a FastPass, it turns green.

684
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:45,420
 I put my little bracelet up there to that Mickey

685
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:46,980
 and it turned red.

686
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:49,220
 [congregation laughing]

687
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:53,140
 And I'm like, I told you, no FastPass.

688
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:57,580
 And the guy there that was manning the booth said,

689
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:59,260
 is it just the two of you?

690
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:00,100
 And I said, yes, sir.

691
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,500
 And he goes, go ahead.

692
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,460
 [congregation laughing]

693
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:04,300
 And I said, what?

694
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:05,500
 He goes, go ahead.

695
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:08,180
 [congregation laughing]

696
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:10,980
 And I said, is this a four hour line?

697
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,100
 He goes, go, go ahead.

698
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:14,980
 And Finley's like, I told you.

699
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,780
 [congregation laughing]

700
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:19,460
 And I was just like, are you serious?

701
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,300
 Are you serious?

702
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:22,140
 So we go and I mean, it's amazing.

703
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:24,300
 Waited four minutes for that ride.

704
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,460
 It was incredible.

705
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:29,540
 And it's, I mean, God, I was just like,

706
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:31,500
 God, how amazing are you?

707
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,380
 You care.

708
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:35,900
 He cares for you too.

709
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:36,740
 He loves you.

710
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:38,540
 He cares about silly things.

711
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:40,580
 And I understand all the thoughts

712
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:41,780
 that invade your mind right now.

713
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:43,460
 If he cares about that, what about this?

714
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:45,300
 I get it, I get it.

715
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,900
 You know, but he cares.

716
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,860
 That's what you need to know.

717
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:51,980
 And that same little girl, two days later,

718
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:55,580
 comes into my bedroom at night,

719
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:58,860
 tears running down her face,

720
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:01,420
 saying, Daddy, I prayed that I wouldn't have bad dreams.

721
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:03,380
 I prayed that I wouldn't have bad dreams.

722
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:05,260
 And I keep having them.

723
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:06,940
 Doesn't God care?

724
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:11,140
 Why doesn't he care?

725
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:16,660
 She made the same mistake that we made.

726
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:23,460
 Same mistake that I'm tempted to make.

727
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:24,860
 God, don't you care?

728
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:27,140
 You see me down here?

729
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:29,980
 This goes south, don't you care?

730
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:36,020
 Yes, he cares.

731
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:42,220
 There are a lot of reasons he may not answer your prayer.

732
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:45,300
 But it's not because he doesn't care.

733
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:48,340
 He cares.

734
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:51,820
 He came here in the form of Jesus Christ,

735
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:54,300
 lived a perfect life, and died the death

736
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:58,100
 that you deserve for you to pay for your sins

737
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,300
 so that you could commune with him.

738
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:04,660
 And you say, well, why doesn't he answer my prayer?

739
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:06,340
 I don't know why.

740
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:08,340
 I don't know.

741
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:11,100
 But one day you will.

742
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:15,020
 Okay, and can we just look backwards for just a moment?

743
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:17,260
 Like, let's just, for a moment, can I tell you something?

744
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:21,220
 Like, my desires in life have changed.

745
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:24,620
 Has yours ever changed?

746
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:26,900
 Like, I can remember when my sister got married

747
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:31,900
 and I was 16 and my brother-in-law,

748
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,460
 my now new brother-in-law asked me, he's like,

749
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:35,620
 hey, what kind of car, if you could have any car

750
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,740
 for the rest of your life, what would you want?

751
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:40,300
 He said, if you could have any car

752
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,580
 for the rest of your life, what would you want?

753
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:43,780
 I said, oh, man, that's easy.

754
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:48,780
 I want an Isuzu Amigo on Daytons with hydraulics

755
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:50,540
 for the rest of my life.

756
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,660
 (congregation laughing)

757
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:54,460
 You guys, you're like, what are Daytons?

758
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:56,300
 Those are Daytons.

759
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,260
 With a candy paint, that was also what I said.

760
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,100
 With candy paint.

761
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:02,020
 I said, do I drive that for the rest of my life?

762
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:03,500
 Right, can't wait.

763
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,820
 We got another one if you wanna see it, just a variety.

764
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:07,340
 It's a thing.

765
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:08,420
 It's a thing, yeah.

766
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:10,660
 Somebody stop judging me, okay?

767
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:12,220
 Jeez, wow.

768
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:14,220
 So many crazy faces.

769
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:16,460
 That's what I wanted, right?

770
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:19,660
 Now, call me crazy, but that's not really

771
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,660
 my dream car anymore.

772
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:22,780
 You're like, why was it then?

773
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:24,780
 'Cause I was a straight up gangster, that's why.

774
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:25,820
 (congregation laughing)

775
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:28,260
 And so, you know, our desires change.

776
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:30,580
 Let me just go one more with you, okay?

777
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:33,260
 So I was actually in my hometown this past week,

778
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:37,300
 and while I'm there, I happened to run into my ex-girlfriend.

779
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,860
 Wasn't awkward at all, you know?

780
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:40,060
 I'm like, hey, how you doing?

781
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:40,900
 You look good.

782
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:41,720
 I mean, you don't look good.

783
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,420
 I mean, okay, whatever.

784
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:45,700
 What am I doing with my hands right now, you know?

785
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:49,000
 And I'm like, it's good to see you,

786
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,580
 and so, and bye.

787
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:53,540
 And so anyways.

788
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:55,500
 (congregation laughing)

789
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,540
 And I just think, because here's the deal,

790
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:58,900
 'cause she broke up with me.

791
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:01,460
 Yeah.

792
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:02,460
 And it hurts.

793
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:05,540
 It hurt real bad.

794
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:07,900
 I can remember how bad it,

795
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,900
 I can remember going to God,

796
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,300
 tears streaming down my face.

797
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:13,420
 God, please change her heart.

798
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:14,900
 Please bring her back.

799
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,960
 Lord, would you supernaturally make her love me, okay?

800
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,880
 See, past all my faults, right?

801
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,600
 And I'll, you know, thank God,

802
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:27,440
 as they say for unanswered prayers.

803
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,960
 That would have been a disaster.

804
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,760
 I look at my kids today, my amazing wife today.

805
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:37,040
 Like I wanted her more than I wanted anything in life

806
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:41,440
 at one moment, and I'm begging God, don't you care?

807
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,960
 And he's like, dude, I got, yes, I care.

808
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,880
 I don't know if he says dude,

809
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,280
 but he says I care.

810
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,600
 Right?

811
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,840
 He's like, yes, I care.

812
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,520
 I mean, thank God for unanswered prayers.

813
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,580
 No offense, Kelly.

814
00:34:55,580 --> 00:35:01,160
 I changed her name, that's not her real name.

815
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:08,020
 But I think you're gonna get up there,

816
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:12,520
 and I think God's gonna be like,

817
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,880
 why didn't you ask me more?

818
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,160
 Why didn't you ask me more?

819
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,880
 Like, was I not clear you could ask me for anything?

820
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,560
 James four, verse two says,

821
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,640
 you have not because you ask not.

822
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:32,800
 He says, you do not have because you do not ask God.

823
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,720
 You do not have because you do not ask God.

824
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,560
 He's like, there's things that God wants to give you

825
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,600
 that he's waiting for you to ask for.

826
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,200
 Like, that's amazing.

827
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,040
 And that if we asked, he'd give them to us.

828
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,840
 That seems to be what that verse says.

829
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,800
 I don't wanna have bad theology,

830
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,540
 but it seems clear there.

831
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:51,960
 And so here's what I know,

832
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,200
 is I can ask God for whatever I want

833
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,240
 while I can seek what he wants.

834
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,840
 And that as I stand at that door and I knock,

835
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:02,000
 he's going to, and his Holy Spirit at work in my life,

836
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,560
 he's going to change my desires to his desires.

837
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,760
 Ultimately, I can keep asking and keep asking

838
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:09,840
 and keep asking, and he will work in my life

839
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:12,440
 to show me what he wants of me.

840
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:15,560
 And that as I ask in that process, there's two results.

841
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:18,120
 One, is he's going to give me what I'm asking for,

842
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,600
 or two, he's going to ultimately change

843
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:24,440
 what I'm asking for to match what he desires for me.

844
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,840
 And I'm not preaching prosperity gospel right now,

845
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,880
 which is wicked.

846
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:31,760
 God is not a genie, you know, that you can command to do

847
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,440
 or obligate to do anything that you want.

848
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:37,040
 He's a loving father that desires

849
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,140
 to give you what you need most.

850
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:44,520
 He is a loving father that desires

851
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,840
 to give you what you need most.

852
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:50,360
 And when you ask of him, you can trust him.

853
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:54,480
 And so our attitude in prayer is dependence

854
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,440
 while our activity of prayer is intentional.

855
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,660
 And the power is not in the one who asks,

856
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:02,720
 but the one who answers.

857
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,340
 He has the power.

858
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:08,840
 Verse 11, "Which of you fathers," Jesus says,

859
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,080
 now he's talking to them, he's like,

860
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,960
 "Hey, you guys are dads, you got children.

861
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,220
 "Which of you, if your son asked for a fish,

862
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:16,720
 "would give him a snake instead?

863
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,720
 "Or if he asked for an egg, would give him a scorpion?

864
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:22,720
 "If you then, though you are evil,

865
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,840
 "know how to give good gifts to your children,

866
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:27,220
 "how much more will your Father in heaven

867
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:32,220
 "give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him?"

868
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:37,280
 And so why we pray, third point, why we pray,

869
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,560
 because we know who answers.

870
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,440
 We pray because we know who answers.

871
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:47,740
 The remnant knows the one who answers our prayers.

872
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:49,400
 And so if you have a high view of God,

873
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,120
 he's so holy and mighty and uninterruptible,

874
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,840
 you have a wrong view of God.

875
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:57,000
 He is holy and omnipotent and all powerful,

876
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,400
 and he loves you and he comes to you

877
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,880
 and he's moving towards you

878
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,640
 and he desires you to talk with him

879
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,280
 like you talk to anybody.

880
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,760
 He wants a relationship with you.

881
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:15,240
 Zephaniah 3, verse 17, "The Lord your God is with you.

882
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,920
 "The mighty warrior who saves,

883
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,140
 "he will take great delight in you.

884
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:22,160
 "In his love, he will no longer rebuke you,

885
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:25,300
 "but will rejoice over you with singing."

886
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:28,960
 And this is fulfilled in Christ, this prophecy.

887
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,780
 It's fulfilled in Christ.

888
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:38,680
 I love my kids, and I hate watching them struggle

889
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:42,440
 with something when I can help them and they don't ask me.

890
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:44,920
 I'm like, sometimes I'm here, I'm like,

891
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,360
 why don't you ask me?

892
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:54,240
 God's not trying to give you snakes and scorpions.

893
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,480
 One time when Weston, before he could talk

894
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:02,080
 when he was younger, we were eating at Matito's,

895
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,960
 which is a Mexican restaurant here in Dallas.

896
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,640
 I remember trying the hot sauce,

897
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:13,040
 we're kind of hot sauce people, salsa people,

898
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,880
 that's a big thing in our home.

899
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,720
 And I told my wife, I'm like, hey, it's really hot today.

900
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:18,960
 Like, wow.

901
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,680
 They broke out the ghost pepper or something,

902
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:21,760
 like, this stuff is hot.

903
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,720
 And I'm like, patting my forehead, like, whoa, it's hot.

904
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,680
 And my son, he's right there in his high chair,

905
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,800
 and he's like, uh, uh, uh, 'cause he couldn't talk,

906
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,940
 he's like, uh, uh, you know, give me some of that stuff

907
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:34,440
 that you're eating, the red stuff, the bright red stuff,

908
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,120
 give it to me.

909
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,760
 And I move it back.

910
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,000
 And you know what he's thinking, right?

911
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,440
 He's like, how wicked are you?

912
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:43,240
 Like, I'm right here, I want that,

913
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,480
 and you're gonna move it away from me while you enjoy it?

914
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,480
 Like, what's your problem?

915
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:50,720
 And like, how wicked would I have had to been

916
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,960
 if I was just like, oh, you want this?

917
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,460
 Okay, we'll see how bad you want this.

918
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:54,980
 Go ahead, buddy.

919
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:56,660
 Right?

920
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:57,980
 We'll see.

921
00:39:57,980 --> 00:39:59,760
 But he's confused.

922
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,700
 From his perspective, it just looks like

923
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,200
 I'm holding something back from him.

924
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,700
 And right now, you're thinking, yeah,

925
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:07,000
 yeah, that's fine for your son,

926
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,200
 but what about my mom with cancer?

927
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,240
 What about the breakup?

928
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,480
 What about that sickness?

929
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,900
 What about the loss of the loved one?

930
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:15,440
 What about that job, JP?

931
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,200
 That's different than your silly hot sauce story.

932
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:21,640
 And I'm like, I don't know.

933
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:24,360
 But can I tell you something from my son's perspective?

934
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,480
 It looks the same.

935
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,160
 He just sees a dad who's supposed to love him

936
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,600
 holding something back from him while I enjoy it.

937
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,340
 That's all he sees.

938
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:35,760
 And he's confused, and I know you're confused.

939
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:42,160
 And all I know to tell you, 100% certain of it,

940
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,200
 you can trust God.

941
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,440
 I've had a mom with cancer.

942
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,840
 I've lost loved ones.

943
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:50,280
 I've had hardships.

944
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:54,160
 And I choose to trust that the Father is good,

945
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,880
 and He desires to give me good.

946
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:02,560
 And trusting that has served me really, really well

947
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,300
 since I've been a Christ follower.

948
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:07,200
 And I commend you to try it.

949
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,480
 I commend you to do it.

950
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:14,980
 So you might be like, why ask God if He knows any ways?

951
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:17,640
 Can I answer that?

952
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:20,360
 Because He wants you to.

953
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:22,680
 He likes it.

954
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:25,840
 He enjoys you asking Him.

955
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:31,580
 Like, who doesn't love to give people things

956
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:32,960
 that they ask for?

957
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,000
 Like, when someone comes to you,

958
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,200
 and they're like, I really, really want this,

959
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,320
 and you're like, oh, I could give you that.

960
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,160
 There you go.

961
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,000
 Like, that's God.

962
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:38,820
 Like, He can do that.

963
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:42,140
 He enjoys you asking Him.

964
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:45,000
 The Scriptures make that really clear.

965
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:50,680
 And so, the answer of our prayers is a loving Father

966
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:52,080
 who knows best what we need.

967
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:55,640
 Let me just give you three applications real quick.

968
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:58,660
 One is from a book I read called A Praying Life.

969
00:41:58,660 --> 00:41:59,500
 I commend it to you.

970
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:00,760
 It's an incredible book.

971
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,180
 It's called A Praying Life.

972
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:03,060
 You're gonna email me later.

973
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:04,020
 What was the name of that book?

974
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:06,740
 A Praying Life is the name of that book.

975
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:08,860
 And in it, one of the things it recommends

976
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:12,220
 is not so much a prayer journal, but these prayer cards.

977
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:13,960
 And this has really been effective for my life.

978
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:16,880
 And so, as I struggle to pay attention during prayer,

979
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:17,860
 you just write out a card.

980
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:20,060
 I have one for Monica, one for every child,

981
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:23,000
 one for the ministry, one for friends that I work with,

982
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,660
 one for myself, for my career, for my ministry.

983
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:27,660
 And it just has a verse on it

984
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:31,540
 that is a verse that I pray over each one of those people.

985
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:33,420
 It changes depending on who the person is

986
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:34,740
 and what the situation is.

987
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:36,260
 And it just has like one, two, or three

988
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:37,340
 prayer requests with it.

989
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:39,140
 And so, here's the one for the porch, right?

990
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:42,780
 And the verse up top is Ephesians 3, verses 16 through 19.

991
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:44,860
 I just prayed, Lord, would you strengthen them

992
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:46,260
 with your Holy Spirit?

993
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:48,780
 I pray that Christ would dwell in their hearts.

994
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:52,340
 I pray that they would understand the love of Christ

995
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:53,180
 deep within them.

996
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:54,620
 That all comes straight from that verse.

997
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:57,580
 That you would be used by God.

998
00:42:57,580 --> 00:43:01,180
 And I pray that he would use you to change the world.

999
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:03,820
 That young adults are listening,

1000
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:05,420
 that you're not just consumers,

1001
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:07,420
 that you don't just love it 'cause it's good worship,

1002
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:10,300
 or it makes you feel good, chicken soup for the soul,

1003
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:12,300
 shot in the arm, but that you'd leave here

1004
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:13,700
 and you would put into practice.

1005
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:16,140
 Could you imagine what would happen to the world

1006
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:19,740
 if everyone left here and prayed daily,

1007
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:22,500
 regularly, in activity and attitude?

1008
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,860
 You would literally change the world.

1009
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:27,900
 Jesus may come back the moment that happens.

1010
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:30,760
 Okay, what if we did that?

1011
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:33,500
 The second thing, application I'd give you is this week,

1012
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:36,620
 and you can do this right now, schedule a time to pray.

1013
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:39,080
 Maybe tomorrow, find some extended time

1014
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:41,220
 for you to go to a place without your phone,

1015
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:45,080
 without distractions, and just pray and fight to focus.

1016
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:48,180
 You stand at that door and you knock.

1017
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:52,140
 Fight to focus, 20 minutes, 30 minutes, two hours,

1018
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:55,260
 whatever is the right number for you, what you have.

1019
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:58,700
 Spend some time alone praying.

1020
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:01,860
 And the one thing that's helped me is I cut off my radio

1021
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:04,180
 and I pray out loud, that really helps me focus,

1022
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:07,020
 is just pray out loud in the car, audibly.

1023
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:08,900
 You can try that tomorrow, just when you get in the car,

1024
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:10,380
 cut off your radio, cut it off tonight

1025
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:11,980
 so that when you get in tomorrow, you remember,

1026
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:15,460
 oh, it's off, so I'm gonna pray, all right?

1027
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:17,800
 And so in summary, Jesus gives us the authority

1028
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:20,140
 to approach the Father anytime.

1029
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:23,300
 And we approach Him in prayer with an attitude

1030
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:26,420
 of dependence in the intentional activity.

1031
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:30,060
 And we know, thirdly, the one answering is our Father

1032
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:32,100
 who loves us and knows what is best

1033
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:34,500
 and has the power to bring it about.

1034
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:40,740
 So I remember being in that cell, that guy came

1035
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:43,300
 and he pulled open that door and he said,

1036
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:45,500
 you gotta make a phone call, and I remember that dialogue

1037
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:46,340
 like it was yesterday, I'm like,

1038
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:49,400
 I don't wanna call my dad, this officer is ministering

1039
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:51,280
 to me in the moment, he's like, hey, son,

1040
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,720
 you need to call your father.

1041
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:56,680
 And I remember calling my dad, I remember sitting there

1042
00:44:56,680 --> 00:45:00,000
 on this end of the phone and it ringing

1043
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,740
 and just being so nervous at what was about to happen.

1044
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:06,920
 And he answered the phone, sometimes my mom

1045
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:08,600
 will answer the phone, but this time he answered the phone,

1046
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:09,440
 hello?

1047
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,460
 I said, Dad?

1048
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:13,660
 Yeah.

1049
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:16,560
 I'm in jail.

1050
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:20,840
 Well, we need to get you out.

1051
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:27,400
 (congregation laughing)

1052
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:28,240
 Okay.

1053
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:31,360
 Yeah, how can I get you out?

1054
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:35,840
 And I just remember thinking, man, I wish I'd have known

1055
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,560
 that's how he was gonna respond.

1056
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:40,120
 He's like a loving father.

1057
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:45,040
 What, do I need to drive there?

1058
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,740
 How much do I need to pay, do I need to sell something?

1059
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:50,480
 What do I need to do?

1060
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:53,060
 I'm gonna get you out.

1061
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:56,620
 The father did this for you through the gospel,

1062
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:59,440
 his son Jesus Christ, you were stuck in your sin

1063
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:00,260
 in a prison.

1064
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:05,240
 And if you're wondering if he loves you, he said,

1065
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:07,040
 what do I need to do to get you out?

1066
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:12,560
 To pry your life out of the grip of the enemy.

1067
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,000
 What must I pay?

1068
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:20,000
 Should I give my Weston for you 'cause I'll do it?

1069
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,280
 And he did it.

1070
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:27,400
 He loves you that much, he's crazy about you.

1071
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:30,240
 I said, you know what we're gonna do?

1072
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:35,240
 It's late, but we got a few more minutes.

1073
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:38,080
 We're gonna pray.

1074
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:42,040
 If you're at another campus, your worship leaders

1075
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:44,620
 are gonna come up as I pray.

1076
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:47,560
 And I want you guys to spend just a few minutes

1077
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:48,560
 wherever you're at in prayer.

1078
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,760
 Here in Dallas, I want you to stay right where you're at

1079
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:53,040
 and I want you to focus your mind on prayer.

1080
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,120
 You may write it out on your phone.

1081
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:56,680
 If you do, you might turn your phone

1082
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:58,380
 on airplane mode first.

1083
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:02,680
 For some of you, this is gonna be the most uncomfortable

1084
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:05,360
 three minutes of your life 'cause you haven't talked

1085
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:06,800
 to the father in a long time.

1086
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:10,840
 But I want you to fight to do that right now,

1087
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:15,040
 to hold your attention, to not think about anything else

1088
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,960
 but a conversation with the creator.

1089
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:22,560
 And if you don't have a relationship with the creator,

1090
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:23,720
 start just like this.

1091
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:25,400
 I'm just gonna give you three things to hit on.

1092
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:28,480
 Start with God, I have sinned against you.

1093
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:32,040
 I have gone my own way.

1094
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:35,920
 But I know you sent your son Jesus Christ

1095
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:40,480
 to die for my sins and you raised him from the dead.

1096
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:43,160
 Lord, would you give me your Holy Spirit

1097
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:45,240
 and lead me the rest of my life?

1098
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:51,440
 Confess your sins, acknowledge Christ's payment

1099
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,320
 and ask for his Holy Spirit.

1100
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:58,940
 Father, we thank you that you are a good God to us.

1101
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:03,520
 You're an amazing God to us.

1102
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:09,180
 You're a father who loves us.

1103
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:14,420
 You're no longer counting our sins against us.

1104
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:18,420
 There's no condemnation for us.

1105
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:22,500
 You sent your son Jesus to pay for our sins.

1106
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:25,100
 I don't even know what that was like to watch him die

1107
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:30,940
 for my sins, for my addictions and my foolishness.

1108
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:35,720
 God, you raised him from the dead.

1109
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:38,620
 Wow.

1110
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:42,380
 (congregation murmuring)

1111
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:43,780
 Lord, would you help my friends

1112
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:46,620
 to fix their hearts and minds on you

1113
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:50,180
 and just to let their native language flow in their minds

1114
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:53,200
 in a conversation with you?

1115
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:57,820
 Would you help them hold their attention towards you, God?

1116
00:48:57,820 --> 00:48:59,020
 Would you do that now?

1117
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:02,020
 (crickets chirping)

1118
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:12,020
