4
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:25,020
 All right, Porch, how are we doing tonight?

5
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:26,020
 We doing okay?

6
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,020
 It's great to see you.

7
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:30,020
 Welcome back to another Tuesday night.

8
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:32,020
 We're so grateful that you would choose to be here with us.

9
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:34,020
 Not just those of you that are here in the room, but everyone that is

10
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,020
 tuning in online.

11
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,020
 We have not forgotten about you.

12
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:40,020
 This is the amazing thing, y'all.

13
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,020
 I was just thinking this sitting over in my seat.

14
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:48,020
 God is so very clearly doing something.

15
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:53,020
 And he always is doing something, but he has his thumb on the young

16
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,020
 adult generation.

17
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:59,020
 You see, he is working, yes, in our room, but he is working in rooms

18
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:03,020
 like ours all over the nation and really all over the world.

19
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:07,020
 And so to gather together and to be with a group of people that are

20
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,020
 from the exact same generation, they're in their 20s and they're in

21
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:14,020
 their 30s, and they believe similarly about the things of God.

22
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:18,020
 There's a united hunger for more of God is a great place to be because

23
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:22,020
 God loves to satisfy his people.

24
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,020
 So if you're here and you're wondering what the heck have I been --

25
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:28,020
 what the heck have I stepped into, let me just welcome you.

26
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,020
 We're really glad that you would make time to be with us here on

27
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,020
 Tuesday night, and if you've been rolling with us for a long time,

28
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:35,020
 welcome back.

29
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,020
 Special shout out to our Porch Live locations, particularly Porch

30
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:41,020
 Live Dayton/Fort Worth, and put your hands together for those guys.

31
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:44,020
 Hey, I'm so excited for tonight.

32
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:48,020
 Yes, because it's Tuesday, but also because we have a very special

33
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:51,020
 guest joining us tonight.

34
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:55,020
 Whenever it comes to identifying people we want to preach in a

35
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:59,020
 guest-speaking spot here at the Porch, we really do the hard work of

36
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:02,020
 praying through God, who would you have come?

37
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:05,020
 And this person certainly feels like an answer to prayer.

38
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:09,020
 When I was a young man, I mean, fresh in my relationship with God,

39
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:13,020
 learning what it looked like to walk with Jesus, it was his voice that

40
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:17,020
 God used to really teach me not just about what to do, but particularly

41
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:20,020
 about who he was, who Jesus is.

42
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:24,020
 I would ride in my 2004 GMC Sierra from Longview, Texas, to College

43
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:28,020
 Station, Texas, and it would be his voice that would keep me company as

44
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:31,020
 he would teach me the things of Jesus.

45
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:36,020
 And I know that voice has timelessly tuned my faith even to this day, and

46
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:38,020
 it's not just true of me.

47
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,020
 I know it is true of so many of you.

48
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:44,020
 And so, Porch, would you please do an amazing job of helping me welcome

49
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:48,020
 old-time friend, guest speaker tonight, elder, lead pastor of the

50
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:50,020
 village, Matt Chandler.

51
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:52,020
 [Applause]

52
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,020
 Let's hug.

53
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:55,020
 It's just daffing hug.

54
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,020
 All of you both.

55
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:58,020
 There it is.

56
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:00,020
 Hey, Porch, it's good to be back, man.

57
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:02,020
 You guys look amazing.

58
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:04,020
 Especially you, bro.

59
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,020
 Just living the dream.

60
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:08,020
 If you have your Bibles, go ahead and grab those.

61
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,020
 We're going to be in Exodus chapter 3.

62
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:15,020
 If your Bible's on your phone and you trust yourself, you have self-control,

63
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:18,020
 then go ahead and do it that way.

64
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:21,020
 If not, just check on the screen behind me.

65
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:25,020
 I loved the worship set was just unbelievable.

66
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:29,020
 I don't know whether they are, but that was just not only anointed,

67
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:32,020
 but just God-ward.

68
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,020
 Like we weren't singing about us.

69
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:36,020
 We weren't singing about our stuff.

70
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:38,020
 We were singing about God's God-ness.

71
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:43,020
 And that has a shaping force that over time, like when you get to be

72
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:49,020
 Papaw Chandler's age, you start to appreciate the shaping force of

73
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:54,020
 God-ward-ness in regards to your own joy and delight in life.

74
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:58,020
 If you've listened to me preach or you've followed anything I've done,

75
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:03,020
 written or anything like that, you know I'm not prone to starting stuff

76
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:06,020
 with ancient pagan prayers.

77
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:15,020
 But tonight I'm going to read an Assyrian prayer from around 668 to 633 B.C.

78
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:20,020
 The title of the prayer was "A Prayer to Every God."

79
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:22,020
 Let me read it to you.

80
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:25,020
 It's longer than I would like, but they wrote it.

81
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:30,020
 "May the fury of my Lord's heart be quieted toward me.

82
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:34,020
 May the God who is not known be quieted toward me.

83
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:38,020
 May the goddess who is not known be quieted toward me.

84
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:43,020
 May the God whom I know or do not know be quieted toward me."

85
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,020
 Just brother covering his bases.

86
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:50,020
 "May the goddess whom I know or do not know be quieted toward me.

87
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:53,020
 My transgressions are many.

88
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:57,020
 Great are my transgressions which I have committed.

89
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:00,020
 Indeed, I do not know.

90
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:04,020
 The sins which I have done, indeed, I do not know.

91
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:09,020
 The forbidden thing which I have eaten, indeed, I did not know.

92
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:14,020
 The prohibited place on which I had set foot, indeed, I do not know.

93
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:19,020
 The Lord in the anger of his heart looked at me.

94
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:23,020
 The God in the rage of his heart confronted me.

95
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:28,020
 When the goddess was angry with me, she made me become ill.

96
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:33,020
 The God whom I know or do not know has oppressed me.

97
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:39,020
 The goddess whom I know or do not know has placed suffering upon me.

98
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:44,020
 How long, O my goddess whom I know or do not know,

99
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:47,020
 ere your hostile heart will be quieted?

100
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,020
 Man is dumb.

101
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:52,020
 He knows nothing."

102
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:55,020
 This is very different than the prayer of Jabez, if you remember that.

103
00:05:55,020 --> 00:06:00,020
 "Mankind, everyone that exists, what does he know?

104
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:05,020
 Whether he is committing sin or doing good, he does not even know.

105
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:10,020
 O my Lord, do not cast your servant down.

106
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:14,020
 He is plunged into the waters of a swamp.

107
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:17,020
 Take him by the hands."

108
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:19,020
 Now, make some eye contact with me.

109
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:24,020
 By the grace of God, we never have to pray like that.

110
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:28,020
 You and I, as children of the creator God,

111
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:33,020
 are not left guessing what pleases God or displeases God.

112
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:35,020
 How would God behave?

113
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,020
 What does God love?

114
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,020
 What does God require of us?

115
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:41,020
 What's the meaning and purpose of our lives?

116
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:43,020
 What's this thing all about?

117
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,020
 We don't have to pray this prayer at all,

118
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:50,020
 because God in his grace has revealed himself to us.

119
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:54,020
 He has let us know who he is, what he wants,

120
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:57,020
 what life's all about, what our purpose is,

121
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:01,020
 and he has not left us groping in the dark,

122
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:05,020
 hoping we get it right when all's said and done.

123
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:09,020
 God has made himself known.

124
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:13,020
 Now, what's interesting, not just in our generation,

125
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,020
 but in all generations before us,

126
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:19,020
 each generation has this bad habit

127
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:23,020
 of disregarding God's revelation of himself

128
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:28,020
 and instead creating a new God made in our image that we like,

129
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:30,020
 and here's the way it works.

130
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:33,020
 Now, all of us, in this moment we're living in,

131
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,020
 all the inputs are creating

132
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:39,020
 what sociologists would call plausibility structures.

133
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,020
 Here's all that means.

134
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:44,020
 There's things that just make sense to us.

135
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:47,020
 Like when we see 'em, when we hear 'em, when we watch 'em,

136
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:50,020
 it just makes sense to us,

137
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:52,020
 and so then what we're prone to do

138
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:56,020
 is we're prone to make God in our own image.

139
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:58,020
 We're prone to make God submit

140
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:01,020
 to the current cultural's plausibility structures,

141
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:04,020
 and so God obviously doesn't believe

142
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:07,020
 what he used to believe about sexuality, bro.

143
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,020
 It's so 2025.

144
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:14,020
 It just makes sense to us that God would think like us

145
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:18,020
 and not like God has actually revealed himself to be,

146
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:22,020
 but God refuses to play this game with us.

147
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:25,020
 God will not let you give him a makeover.

148
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,020
 In fact, if I could be so bold

149
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:30,020
 without not trying to be offensive,

150
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:35,020
 it does not matter what you think about God.

151
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,020
 God is God,

152
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:39,020
 and your little opinion of how he should behave

153
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:41,020
 or what he should be like or how,

154
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,020
 he will not bend to your will.

155
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:46,020
 He will not become what we think he should become.

156
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:50,020
 He is what he is, and he's unapologetic,

157
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,020
 and as we'll read in a second,

158
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:55,020
 he has no plans on changing his name.

159
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:58,020
 He has no plans on changing his character

160
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:01,020
 so we think he's more palatable.

161
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:07,020
 God is God, and there is no one else like him,

162
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:12,020
 and our opinion of him has no bearing on who he is.

163
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:16,020
 He is who he is,

164
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:19,020
 and so what I want to emphasize tonight,

165
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:21,020
 and we sang it through the whole set,

166
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:26,020
 is I want to talk about the holiness of God

167
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:30,020
 and then some really good news around that holiness.

168
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:34,020
 God is ultimate reality.

169
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:37,020
 He's not a concept that you and I get to shape,

170
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:40,020
 and so I want to read this Exodus passage.

171
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:42,020
 If you've got a church background,

172
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:44,020
 here's the story all through Genesis.

173
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:48,020
 In the early part of Exodus, you see God working.

174
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,020
 You see him moving.

175
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:51,020
 You see him working and doing things,

176
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:54,020
 but he never actually introduces himself.

177
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:58,020
 He just, as at work and people, he's just God,

178
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:02,020
 and then what happens is the people of Israel are enslaved.

179
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:04,020
 God hears their crying.

180
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:07,020
 In fact, it's one of my favorite passages in the Bible

181
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:11,020
 that God heard them, saw them, and came down,

182
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:14,020
 which is good for you to dwell on and think on

183
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:17,020
 that God sees, he hears, and he has come down.

184
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:21,020
 So we read that, and then God goes and finds a man

185
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:24,020
 that's going to be used by him in profound ways

186
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:27,020
 to deliver his people out of bondage,

187
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:31,020
 and he comes to Moses, and Moses makes sense, right?

188
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:33,020
 He's fluent in Egyptian.

189
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:35,020
 He knows the layout of the palace.

190
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:39,020
 He knows he's the perfect guy for the job,

191
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:42,020
 and so God shows up, and Moses wants no part of this.

192
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:45,020
 He had already tried his own little rebellion back in the day.

193
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,020
 He had murdered a man with his hands,

194
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:49,020
 and then did a really poor job of burying the body,

195
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:52,020
 and they found the body, and then he had to flee and run

196
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:54,020
 when Pharaoh came after him,

197
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:59,020
 and he's just lived out in median in like total isolation,

198
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:01,020
 like he deleted the apps.

199
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:03,020
 No one knew what he was doing, no pictures of lamb,

200
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:05,020
 and none of that.

201
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:07,020
 He's just out working the pasture,

202
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:11,020
 and he comes across this bush that was on fire

203
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:13,020
 and not being consumed,

204
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:17,020
 and God begins to speak to him out of the bush

205
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:19,020
 to tell him, "Hey, you're my guy.

206
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:21,020
 "I know you're a stutterer.

207
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:22,020
 "I know you're a murderer.

208
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,020
 "I know you're kind of rage.

209
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:25,020
 "You still kind of freak out in traffic

210
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,020
 "if somebody's in the left lane

211
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,020
 "not quite going the way they should.

212
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,020
 "I know you've got some issues, but you're my guy.

213
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:31,020
 "It's not going to be your Egyptian skills.

214
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:33,020
 "It's not going to be your knowledge of the past.

215
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:35,020
 "It's going to be my power

216
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:38,020
 "that leads my people out of bondage,"

217
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:40,020
 and Moses kind of keeps deflecting,

218
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:42,020
 keeps deflecting, keeps deflecting,

219
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:44,020
 and then he finally in desperation goes,

220
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,020
 "They're going to ask me who sent me.

221
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,020
 "What do I say?"

222
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:49,020
 And this is the first time in the Bible

223
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:53,020
 God introduces himself by giving his name to his people.

224
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,020
 So let's look at this.

225
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:58,020
 Exodus 3, I'm going to start in verse 14.

226
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:02,020
 "God replied to Moses,

227
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:05,020
 "'I am who I am.

228
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:10,020
 "'This is what you are to say to the Israelites.

229
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:13,020
 "'I am has sent me to you.'

230
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:17,020
 "God also said to Moses, 'Say this to the Israelites.

231
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:19,020
 "'The Lord, the God of your ancestors,

232
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:22,020
 "'the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac,

233
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:25,020
 "'the God of Jacob has sent me to you.'"

234
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:27,020
 And here's, this is a huge sentence.

235
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:31,020
 "'This is my name forever.

236
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:33,020
 "'I am who I am.

237
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:36,020
 "'I am Jehovah, Yahweh.

238
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:40,020
 "'That is my name forever,

239
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:42,020
 "'and how I am to be remembered in every generation.'"

240
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:44,020
 So you remember a moment ago when I said

241
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,020
 God's not going to change his name

242
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:48,020
 to kind of meet our cultural standards.

243
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,020
 There it is.

244
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:53,020
 "'This is my name in every generation.

245
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:59,020
 "'I will not change who I am to fit your cultural norms.

246
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:04,020
 "'I sit at the center of reality enthroned on high.

247
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,020
 "'You will conform to me.

248
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:08,020
 "'I will not conform to you.'"

249
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,020
 That's the thrust of the passage.

250
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:12,020
 Now this, "I am who I am,"

251
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:15,020
 is meant to blow up our categories, right?

252
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:18,020
 It's translated Yahweh or Jehovah.

253
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:20,020
 If you're reading in the Old Testament,

254
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:23,020
 you're going to see this as the Lord in all caps.

255
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:26,020
 And so every time you see the Lord in all caps,

256
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:29,020
 you're reading this, "I am, Jehovah, Yahweh."

257
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:31,020
 But this, "I am who I am,"

258
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:34,020
 it's there to kind of blow up our categories.

259
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,020
 Here's what I mean.

260
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:37,020
 You are, I am something.

261
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,020
 I am.

262
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:41,020
 It's hard for me to explain to you who I am

263
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,020
 without giving you the something.

264
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,020
 I am a pastor.

265
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,020
 I am a husband.

266
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,020
 I am a dad.

267
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,020
 I am a friend.

268
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:49,020
 I am a fill in the blank.

269
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,020
 I am these things.

270
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:52,020
 It could be my socioeconomic.

271
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,020
 It could be my ethnicity.

272
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,020
 I am something.

273
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:58,020
 I have to use I am, but God isn't that way.

274
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:01,020
 He isn't shaped by others.

275
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:03,020
 I have been shaped by others.

276
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:05,020
 God has never been shaped by anyone.

277
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:09,020
 Like you did not just spontaneously arrive here tonight

278
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:12,020
 with all your compulsions and fears and hopes and joys.

279
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:17,020
 No, that was shaped by your environment to some degree.

280
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:19,020
 God isn't built like that.

281
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:22,020
 He's not shaped by anyone.

282
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,020
 And then he goes on,

283
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:25,020
 and here's what's funny about I am who I am.

284
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:27,020
 In the Hebrew, a better translation would be,

285
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:31,020
 I be who I be, which sounds cooler, but it's bad English.

286
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:34,020
 So they translated I am who I am.

287
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:36,020
 But God is saying in this,

288
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:39,020
 I have always been who I have always been.

289
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:41,020
 He is unchanging.

290
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:43,020
 You and me, we change.

291
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:47,020
 God, immutable, does not change.

292
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,020
 He is the unchanging God.

293
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,020
 I am who I am.

294
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:52,020
 Now I've been shaped by others.

295
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,020
 You've been shaped by others.

296
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:55,020
 God is not shaped by others.

297
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:58,020
 And then I will be who I will be.

298
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:01,020
 God will be what matters in the future.

299
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:04,020
 God is ultimate reality.

300
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:07,020
 Past, present, and future.

301
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:11,020
 Now, let me take my opening illustration

302
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:13,020
 and give you an example of what I mean

303
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:15,020
 by plausibility structures

304
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:17,020
 and how we tend to try to define God

305
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,020
 in our own cultural moment

306
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:21,020
 as opposed to letting God tell us who he is

307
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,020
 and heeding that.

308
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:25,020
 So if you were to ask,

309
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:30,020
 like even your most unbelieving friend

310
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:33,020
 to tell you what God was like,

311
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:40,020
 90% shot that they're gonna say God is love.

312
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,020
 God is love.

313
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,020
 That's who God is.

314
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:45,020
 God is love and love is love and God is love.

315
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:47,020
 And that's the refrain of our--

316
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:49,020
 Now here's the problem.

317
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:52,020
 The problem with that is love is a junk drawer word

318
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:54,020
 in English.

319
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,020
 It has no meaning.

320
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,020
 And I know that for how we use it

321
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:59,020
 because I will oftentimes talk about

322
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,020
 how much I love my wife

323
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:03,020
 and I'll tell you how much I love a good ribeye.

324
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:05,020
 And I'm not talking about the same thing

325
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,020
 when I use that.

326
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:08,020
 I love my dog and I love my children

327
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,020
 and I'm not saying--

328
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:12,020
 It's just a junk drawer word.

329
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:14,020
 So it's been emptied of meaning

330
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,020
 and most of the time,

331
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:17,020
 when people say God is love,

332
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:21,020
 what they're saying is God and I are cool.

333
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:23,020
 Like God doesn't have any problem with me.

334
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:26,020
 Like God doesn't have a problem with anyone.

335
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:28,020
 Like he's like Tinkerbell from Peter Pan.

336
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,020
 He just kind of flies around

337
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:32,020
 and sprinkles things on people and they fly.

338
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:35,020
 And he's always just cheering everybody on

339
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:37,020
 to their ideal self.

340
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:39,020
 And this is what we've done.

341
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:41,020
 That God is love.

342
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:46,020
 And what we mean is that God is who I want him to be.

343
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:48,020
 And here's what's hard.

344
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:51,020
 God is love.

345
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,020
 It's not something he has.

346
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:54,020
 It's actually, he is it.

347
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,020
 He is love.

348
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:58,020
 In fact, we read that twice in the same passage

349
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:00,020
 in the New Testament.

350
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:04,020
 And yet, if we're just perusing the canon,

351
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:07,020
 Genesis to Revelation,

352
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:13,020
 he is called something else 400 times in the Bible

353
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:17,020
 and 400 times in the Bible compared to two.

354
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:20,020
 He is called holy.

355
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:25,020
 So I think we can start teasing from this

356
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:28,020
 that the main kind of thrust of God wanting us

357
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:32,020
 to get to know him is not that he is love,

358
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:35,020
 but that his love has been informed by his holiness.

359
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:37,020
 Are you tracking with me when I say that?

360
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:41,020
 It's not his love that informs his holiness.

361
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:43,020
 It's his holiness that informs his love.

362
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,020
 Now, for that to make sense,

363
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:47,020
 we have to actually have a definition

364
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:49,020
 for what holiness is.

365
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:51,020
 'Cause here would be my bet, and I could be wrong.

366
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:53,020
 I don't know where you go to church.

367
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:55,020
 If I just stopped and I was like,

368
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:57,020
 put an open mic out there, and I were to ask you,

369
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:59,020
 tell me what holiness is.

370
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:01,020
 I'm curious.

371
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:03,020
 I mean, I'm not, no smoke.

372
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:06,020
 This is a discipleship, Western evangelical issue.

373
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,020
 It's not yours.

374
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:10,020
 So here, we just sang like 30 songs

375
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:12,020
 that talked about his holiness.

376
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:15,020
 And I was looking around, like, holy, holy.

377
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:17,020
 And I'm just wondering,

378
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:20,020
 do you even know what you're saying?

379
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:22,020
 This is such a sad thing.

380
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,020
 We've got these Bible words,

381
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,020
 this kind of Christian nomenclature

382
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:30,020
 that's been empty of its meaning, depth, and power.

383
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:34,020
 So let me throw up the definition of holiness.

384
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:36,020
 It means wholeness,

385
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:38,020
 entireness,

386
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:41,020
 perfection in a moral sense.

387
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:44,020
 And so when we say God is love,

388
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,020
 we're not wrong.

389
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:50,020
 We're just saying his love is different than our love

390
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:52,020
 in that his love is whole.

391
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:55,020
 His love is entire.

392
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:59,020
 His love is perfect in a moral sense.

393
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:01,020
 We can't love like that.

394
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:03,020
 God can love like that.

395
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:06,020
 So his love isn't indifference to our sin.

396
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:10,020
 His love isn't indifference to our rebellion.

397
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,020
 His love is holy.

398
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,020
 It's entire.

399
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:15,020
 It's morally perfect.

400
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:19,020
 And a good place to see this is in Revelation chapter four.

401
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:21,020
 In Revelation chapter four,

402
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:24,020
 what we see is Christ enthroned on high.

403
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:26,020
 Like he's on his throne,

404
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:29,020
 and there are these 12 thrones to his right,

405
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:31,020
 these 12 thrones to his left,

406
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:36,020
 symbolizing the 12 tribes of Israel and the 12 apostles.

407
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:38,020
 What they're standing for is the people of God

408
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:40,020
 across human history.

409
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,020
 And then in front of him,

410
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:44,020
 you've got men and women from every tribe,

411
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:46,020
 tongue, and nation on earth,

412
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,020
 and they're there and they're worshiping him.

413
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,020
 And you've got a rainbow behind his throne,

414
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:53,020
 and you've got crystal and topaz and all these things

415
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:55,020
 that are just meant to communicate

416
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:57,020
 that all the beauty and all the power

417
00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:01,020
 and all the authority belong to Jesus.

418
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:03,020
 And then in the middle of the scene,

419
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:05,020
 there's these four freaky creatures.

420
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:07,020
 I mean, the stuff of nightmares.

421
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,020
 I'm telling you, you can read it.

422
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:11,020
 You wake up and one of those floating above your head,

423
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,020
 you're freaking out.

424
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:14,020
 You ain't like worshiping all of a sudden.

425
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,020
 You're wetting yourself.

426
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:18,020
 And so you've got these four freaky little creatures,

427
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:20,020
 and they're made up of these different things.

428
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:22,020
 Like they're part ox, they're part eagle,

429
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:25,020
 they're covered in eyes, they've got faces like men,

430
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,020
 they've got these wings,

431
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:28,020
 and they're covering stuff with their wings

432
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,020
 and they're fluttering.

433
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,020
 The Bible says since the beginning

434
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:35,020
 'til forever into eternity, they sing the same song.

435
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:40,020
 Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty

436
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,020
 who was and is and is to come.

437
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,020
 Do you catch it?

438
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:46,020
 They're not around the throne singing,

439
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:49,020
 mercy, mercy, mercy, or love, love, love,

440
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:53,020
 or you fill in the blank with your favorite attribute of God.

441
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:56,020
 No, they're saying, no, he is holy, he is mighty,

442
00:20:56,020 --> 00:21:00,020
 he is enthroned on high, his name will not change.

443
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,020
 Did you see the line I just drew?

444
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:04,020
 So he introduces himself as what?

445
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:08,020
 Yahweh, I am who I am, I will not change my name.

446
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:10,020
 I have always been this, I am this now,

447
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,020
 and I will always be this.

448
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:15,020
 And then we fast forward to Revelation four

449
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,020
 and what are they saying?

450
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:18,020
 This is my name in every generation.

451
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:20,020
 The same thing he said in Exodus three.

452
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:26,020
 This is the God of the Bible, holy, perfect.

453
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:31,020
 This is the giant obvious idea in the Bible

454
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,020
 that God is holy.

455
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:35,020
 If I could say it more simply,

456
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:40,020
 Jesus might be your friend, but he is not your homeboy.

457
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,020
 Jesus might be your friend, but he is,

458
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:46,020
 you see him, you will not dap him up, 100%.

459
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:49,020
 People can't even see angels without falling on the ground

460
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,020
 like dead people.

461
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:52,020
 You think you're gonna dap up the king of kings

462
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,020
 and lord of lords?

463
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,020
 You will not.

464
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:59,020
 He might be your friend, John 15, he is not your homeboy.

465
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:02,020
 He is holy, and look right at me,

466
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:05,020
 'cause this is where things are gonna get more difficult.

467
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:12,020
 God will not violate his holiness for any reason.

468
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:16,020
 God will not violate his holiness for any reason.

469
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:20,020
 He is not understanding like that, if you will.

470
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:24,020
 Now, what I've just done is created tension with the text.

471
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,020
 Here's what I mean.

472
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:30,020
 God is holy, but God is love.

473
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:35,020
 Now, this is a problem because God is holy,

474
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:39,020
 and here, look at me, don't, and God loves you.

475
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:40,020
 But here's the problem.

476
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:44,020
 When holiness, when the pure holiness of God

477
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:51,020
 manifests presently, it destroys anything that's not holy.

478
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:54,020
 I don't know if you ever thought about God's wrath this way,

479
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:55,020
 but let me frame it like this.

480
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:58,020
 God's wrath is not rage.

481
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:01,020
 It's priestly fire.

482
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,020
 I'm gonna say that again.

483
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:04,020
 God's wrath is not rage.

484
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:06,020
 It's priestly fire.

485
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:12,020
 The very essence of who he is will obliterate anything

486
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:16,020
 that is sinful, twisted, dark, and broken, anything.

487
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:18,020
 Even if it's a small, little thing,

488
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:21,020
 it happens just because of the nature of his holiness.

489
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:23,020
 When you read about the wrath of God in the Bible,

490
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:26,020
 it's not like God freaking out like your mom or dad used to

491
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:28,020
 and flipping over, you know, whatever.

492
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,020
 That's not what it is.

493
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:31,020
 It's priestly fire.

494
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:33,020
 It's his holiness obliterates.

495
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:37,020
 And so now you've got a God who wants to be near to us.

496
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,020
 He wants to love us,

497
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:41,020
 but all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God.

498
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:48,020
 He loves us, and his holiness will destroy us if he comes near.

499
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:51,020
 How can that be fixed?

500
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:53,020
 It can't be fixed by us because the Bible says

501
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:55,020
 that we were born in iniquity,

502
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:57,020
 that we were born with a bent,

503
00:23:57,020 --> 00:24:00,020
 that we came out of the womb headed towards rebellion.

504
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:03,020
 If you've ever been around toddlers, this is true.

505
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:05,020
 Like, look, I mean, my kids are older now,

506
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:07,020
 but I can tell you there were things I saw my kids do

507
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:10,020
 that they did not learn in our environment, if you will.

508
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:14,020
 Like, my mouth to God's ear,

509
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:16,020
 they never watched me shove down Lauren

510
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:18,020
 and snatch the remote out of her hand

511
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:21,020
 and scream "mine" into her face.

512
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:25,020
 They did not learn that in my home.

513
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:28,020
 They had broken little hearts.

514
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:30,020
 And from the earliest ages,

515
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:33,020
 when they didn't get what they wanted, they acted violently.

516
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:35,020
 They acted in rebellion.

517
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:38,020
 This is how all of us come into the world,

518
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:40,020
 in iniquity, bent towards rebellion.

519
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,020
 So God loves you.

520
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:43,020
 He wants to move towards you.

521
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:45,020
 And if he moves towards you in his holiness,

522
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:48,020
 you will be obliterated.

523
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:51,020
 And so here's what's crazy about God's holiness.

524
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:54,020
 For all his incommunicable attributes,

525
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:59,020
 all of the things that he is and we can never be,

526
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:03,020
 this is the one he's offering to make us.

527
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:06,020
 So God doesn't say, "I'm going to make you transcendent.

528
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:08,020
 "I'm going to make you omnipresent.

529
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:10,020
 "I'm going to make you omnipotent.

530
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:12,020
 "I'm going to make you omniscient."

531
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:14,020
 He's not saying, "I'm going to make you immutable."

532
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:16,020
 None of those are gods and gods alone.

533
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:21,020
 But God, who is holy, solves the problem of holiness and love

534
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:27,020
 by offering holiness to those who will believe by faith

535
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:29,020
 in the grace made available.

536
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:34,020
 And he does this namely through the blood of Jesus Christ.

537
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:36,020
 I don't know if you've ever thought about this.

538
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:38,020
 When we talk about blood in church,

539
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:41,020
 if you're not a Christian, it probably sounds weird.

540
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:44,020
 Like the only two people that sing about blood

541
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:47,020
 are like heavy metal bands and Christians.

542
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:49,020
 It's like there's Pantera and Chris Tomlin.

543
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:53,020
 It's just like that's who's singing about blood.

544
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:55,020
 But there's a reason that we're singing about blood

545
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,020
 because the Bible's been really clear

546
00:25:57,020 --> 00:26:00,020
 about the effects of sin.

547
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:05,020
 It talks about the scope of sin, that sin fractures everything.

548
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:08,020
 It fractures everything at a macro level and a micro level.

549
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:10,020
 Like when sin entered the cosmos,

550
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:14,020
 it fractured everything down to the cellular level.

551
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:19,020
 He talks a lot about the damages, causes along the horizontal plane,

552
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:22,020
 the damage it does to us and then the damage it does to others.

553
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:27,020
 The scriptures are clear about this, that sin leads to death,

554
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:33,020
 that sin wreaks havoc, that bitterness and strife and anger

555
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:38,020
 and lust rot out the soul.

556
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:42,020
 And then he gives God's solution for it.

557
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:45,020
 We see when the Bible talks about blood,

558
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:47,020
 so the ancient Near East, when it talked about blood,

559
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:49,020
 when we see blood, we think death.

560
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:51,020
 It's just what we think.

561
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:53,020
 Like we see blood and we think death.

562
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:56,020
 Ancient Near East saw blood and thought life.

563
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:57,020
 It's opposite.

564
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:59,020
 Like ancient Near East, they saw a sacrifice,

565
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:01,020
 they saw blood flowing out of a temple,

566
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:04,020
 they thought life, life is there.

567
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:09,020
 So when the Bible's talking about the blood, namely the blood of Jesus,

568
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:11,020
 here are the things it says about his blood,

569
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:15,020
 that it establishes a new covenant.

570
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:18,020
 That means God enters into a covenant with you,

571
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:21,020
 a covenant that he will not break.

572
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:24,020
 In fact, make some eye contact so I can say this to you.

573
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:26,020
 I don't care how you came in tonight,

574
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:29,020
 Jesus knew what he was buying on the cross.

575
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:31,020
 I don't care what's in your past.

576
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:33,020
 Jesus knew what he was buying on the cross.

577
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:38,020
 He didn't die on the cross and now that he sees you in 3D, full of regret.

578
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:40,020
 That's not the way this works.

579
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:43,020
 The cross is so grotesque and so heinous

580
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:46,020
 so that you'd be able to look to it and believe

581
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:48,020
 that he paid your price in full.

582
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:51,020
 This is the new covenant, and the writer of Hebrews says

583
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:55,020
 that God has sworn by his own name to keep this covenant

584
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:59,020
 because there wasn't anything else that he could swear by that had more power.

585
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:00,020
 Right?

586
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:02,020
 Like you and I can swear to the Lord,

587
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:04,020
 we can swear by our moms, we can swear by--

588
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:07,020
 God can't swear by anything other than himself.

589
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:13,020
 And so he swears to himself that he'll keep his covenant promise to us.

590
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:16,020
 The blood atones for our sins.

591
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:22,020
 All of them, follow me, past, present, and future.

592
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:26,020
 So here's what I know is in the room, and I got to keep an eye on the time.

593
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:31,020
 There are some of you that when you became a Christian,

594
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:34,020
 man, it was euphoric.

595
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:37,020
 And you felt free, and you couldn't believe God loved you,

596
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:39,020
 and you were on it, man.

597
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:43,020
 And then a year later, six months later, two years later,

598
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:45,020
 you stumbled and fell, and you screwed up,

599
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:47,020
 and now you just can't believe he loves you.

600
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:50,020
 So he loved you when you were at your worst,

601
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:54,020
 but now that you're a son or a daughter, you screwed up and he hates you?

602
00:28:54,020 --> 00:29:00,020
 And then this starts, I think, the kind of bondage and enslavement

603
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:02,020
 I experience with so many of God's people

604
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:04,020
 because you refuse to believe the gospel that you believed

605
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:06,020
 when you first believed.

606
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:07,020
 And the gospel is what?

607
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:09,020
 That all of your sins, past, present, and future,

608
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:12,020
 are fully, freely, and forever forgiven.

609
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:17,020
 Yeah, this is Paul's point in Romans chapter 5.

610
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:21,020
 When he's saying, if he loved you when you were at your worst,

611
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:27,020
 when you were his enemy, how much more then does he love you now

612
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:31,020
 that you're his son or his daughter?

613
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:36,020
 No, no, no, the blood of Jesus covers us from all unrighteousness.

614
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:37,020
 It provides this salvation.

615
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:39,020
 It redeems those who would believe.

616
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:43,020
 It cleanses our consciences.

617
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:45,020
 How does it cleanse our conscience?

618
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:47,020
 Let me tell this story.

619
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:49,020
 Years ago, I was preaching down--

620
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:54,020
 So I graduated from Texas City High School down by Galveston Island,

621
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:57,020
 and I had been gone a long time.

622
00:29:57,020 --> 00:30:00,020
 And, man, I did some scandalous stuff when I was there

623
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:02,020
 before I became a Christian.

624
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:04,020
 And I was preaching in Clear Creek, which is right north.

625
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:06,020
 And so I thought, you know what would be cool?

626
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:09,020
 I'm going to go down, and I'm going to take pictures of my old houses

627
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:11,020
 and all this stuff so I can show my kids when I get home.

628
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:14,020
 And I had that experience where, you know when you thought

629
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:18,020
 that you were climbing some giant oak, and then you get there

630
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:22,020
 because you were like 7 or 8, 9 or 10, and it was like a bush?

631
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:24,020
 It wasn't even a tree. You didn't even climb a tree.

632
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,020
 It was like a bush.

633
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:28,020
 And so as I'm driving into town to kind of take pictures of these,

634
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:30,020
 I pass this field.

635
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:36,020
 And in this field, I got in a fight with a kid named Sean.

636
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:41,020
 And, man, I just sucker-punched him, and there was nobody there to pull me off.

637
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:46,020
 And I just beat--I just shamed and embarrassed him in front of everyone.

638
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:51,020
 And I have to believe, unless God did some kind of gracious work in his life,

639
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:54,020
 wherever he is right now, he hates me.

640
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:57,020
 The thought of me, the thought of my name, the thought of that moment,

641
00:30:57,020 --> 00:31:00,020
 that's the kind of crap that will follow a man the rest of his life.

642
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:02,020
 And so I was like, "Oh, God."

643
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:04,020
 And then I kept driving. I was going to the first house,

644
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:08,020
 and I passed by this other house, Holly's house, that was a party,

645
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:12,020
 and there were some grotesque, wicked, sinful things that happened

646
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:15,020
 in that house that I was a part of.

647
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:17,020
 And then I was like, "Oh, my gosh."

648
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:20,020
 And then rounded out this other house as I went to the second house

649
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:24,020
 that we lived in in that area, and another house where there was another party.

650
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:28,020
 And I just--wherever I went in that town, I started feeling immense shame.

651
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:31,020
 And then I'm driving up to preach the gospel to a room full of pastors,

652
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:34,020
 and there's this little voice in my head about what those people

653
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:37,020
 would think about me if they knew I was preaching the gospel,

654
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:42,020
 and how shameful my life had been and how gross my life had been.

655
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:44,020
 And I'm telling you, maybe you're freer than I am.

656
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:48,020
 I felt physically nauseous driving back up.

657
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:50,020
 And then I remembered.

658
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:54,020
 And then I remembered that the book of Galatians says

659
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:56,020
 that I have been crucified with Christ.

660
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:59,020
 It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me.

661
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:03,020
 And the life I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God

662
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:05,020
 who loves me and gave himself up for me.

663
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:07,020
 So that moment for me was a cleansing of my conscience,

664
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:12,020
 because that Matt Chandler was a piece of crap, and that Matt Chandler's dead.

665
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:15,020
 That Matt Chandler went to the cross with Christ,

666
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:20,020
 and part of the brutality of the cross was old Matt Chandler,

667
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:26,020
 for all his scandalous wickedness, not being able to condemn me anymore.

668
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:31,020
 That's how the blood of Jesus cleanses our consciousness.

669
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:35,020
 So if we think about this kind of along the biblical arc,

670
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:38,020
 here's what's happening.

671
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:43,020
 The blood of Jesus covers us in such a way,

672
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:45,020
 gives us righteousness in such a way,

673
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:50,020
 takes our sin away in such a way, so completely,

674
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:55,020
 that when God looks upon us, the Bible uses this kind of language,

675
00:32:55,020 --> 00:33:03,020
 that we are spotless.

676
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:09,020
 I have been spotless today, but you know who calls me spotless?

677
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:13,020
 God. How in his holiness can he call me spotless?

678
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:16,020
 Because of the blood of Jesus.

679
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:19,020
 Because the blood of Jesus has cleansed me from all unrighteousness

680
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:23,020
 in my past, in my present, and all that I've got waiting for me tomorrow.

681
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:27,020
 So that frees me up to go where? To run to him, not from him.

682
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:32,020
 To cling to that grace, not run from that grace.

683
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:34,020
 In fact, I've tried to say at The Village for 20 years,

684
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:37,020
 I'll know what you actually believe about the gospel,

685
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:40,020
 not by how you act when everything's going your way,

686
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:44,020
 I'll know by how you act when you blow it.

687
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:47,020
 And if you blow it, and you go farther than you ever thought you would,

688
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:51,020
 and you feel that rod of shame in your chest,

689
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:55,020
 and you run to him, then you get the gospel.

690
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:59,020
 And if you run from him, you're still stuck in some sort of

691
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:03,020
 moral-based theism, that you might as well pray that,

692
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:06,020
 that prayer that we read at the beginning.

693
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:10,020
 No, no, no. The grace of God covers our unrighteousness

694
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:12,020
 through the blood of Jesus.

695
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:15,020
 It's why we sing about it. It's why we talk about it.

696
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:18,020
 It's why us and the heavy metalers, we get together and we write

697
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:21,020
 melodic scream songs about the blood of Jesus,

698
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:24,020
 because it covers us from righteousness.

699
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:29,020
 The perfection of the law had to be dealt with, or God's not just.

700
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:34,020
 In his holiness, if God just went, "Hey, that rebellion, don't worry about that,"

701
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:37,020
 now means God's not just.

702
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:42,020
 So, to satisfy the just requirements of the law,

703
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:47,020
 the second person of the Trinity, the Son of God, condescended,

704
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:52,020
 put on flesh and blood, dwelt among us, was tempted in every way we would be tempted,

705
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:54,020
 and yet stayed true to Christ.

706
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:57,020
 And then he imputes that righteousness to us,

707
00:34:57,020 --> 00:35:01,020
 after he takes on all of our sin on the cross,

708
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:05,020
 and resurrects to reveal that the bill's been paid in full.

709
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:09,020
 If he's still in the ground, I'm still in debt, because he was risen,

710
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:13,020
 then death and sin have been defeated for all who put their faith in him.

711
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:18,020
 Now, the invitation then to you and to me

712
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:23,020
 is to receive from God this holiness that he wishes to lavish upon us.

713
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:29,020
 It's to receive from him what we can never earn through our striving.

714
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:37,020
 Given by his grace something that all our moral improvement can never bring about.

715
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:43,020
 To be reconciled to God through Christ in a way that we're transformed from the inside out.

716
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:49,020
 Not white-knuckled, navel-gazing, trying to get morally, morally pure, more and more and more.

717
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:56,020
 I think what I have found, if that's your thing, is you're going to run out of gas.

718
00:35:56,020 --> 00:36:00,020
 You're going to run out of gas, and you're going to punt, and you're going to say stupid stuff,

719
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:02,020
 like this Jesus stuff doesn't work.

720
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:06,020
 I'd like to just say, that's stupid. You never tried Jesus.

721
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:09,020
 You tried you really hard.

722
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:15,020
 And the Bible's pretty clear that you really hard doesn't work.

723
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:21,020
 So if your answer to your life's problems is to me even harder,

724
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:29,020
 friend, you're like on a treadmill, you're running, but you're not going anywhere.

725
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:32,020
 No, no, no. The way out is the way in.

726
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:35,020
 To receive from God his holiness.

727
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:44,020
 To accept from God the free gift of grace that was poured out on the cross at Calvary.

728
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:48,020
 Now, how do you respond to this? How should you respond?

729
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:54,020
 Well, let me read one more passage to you, and I want to talk about that.

730
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:57,020
 There's this great passage that Christians in particular, they know,

731
00:36:57,020 --> 00:37:00,020
 and sometimes they'll quote it. They haven't really read the rest of the chapter,

732
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:04,020
 but it's fine. Not my point tonight.

733
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:09,020
 Where Isaiah, in the year that King Uzziah died, it was a big year.

734
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:11,020
 It was a big year.

735
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:14,020
 Uzziah had brought all sorts of reform. He kind of flamed out at the end,

736
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:17,020
 but he had done a lot of good stuff for Israel.

737
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:21,020
 But he ends up becoming strong in his own heart, rebels against God,

738
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:26,020
 and gets leprosy, dies. God's holy.

739
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:33,020
 And in the year that he dies, Isaiah, our boy, Isaiah, good man, upright man.

740
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:37,020
 This is what we know about him. He goes into the temple to worship.

741
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:39,020
 So he certainly is a God-fearer.

742
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:43,020
 And when he goes in there, he has this vision of the Lord.

743
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:48,020
 What's funny is it looks very similar to what I described in Revelation 4.

744
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:54,020
 It was God enthroned in his temple, and the robe filled his temple.

745
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:59,020
 And when Isaiah sees him, he says this,

746
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:05,020
 "Then I said, 'Woe is me, for I am ruined,

747
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:10,020
 because I am a man of unclean lips, and live among a people of unclean lips,

748
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:15,020
 and because my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of armies.'"

749
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:17,020
 Now, here's something I've always wondered.

750
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:23,020
 Did Isaiah know when he walked in there that he was a man of unclean lips,

751
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:26,020
 and that he lived among a people of unclean lips?

752
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:33,020
 Or did seeing God rightly for who he is, enthroned in his holiness,

753
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:37,020
 expose in Isaiah his lack of holiness,

754
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:41,020
 that cut him to the quick, that led him to repent?

755
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:44,020
 Personal experience.

756
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:48,020
 When God shows up, you see things rightly,

757
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:54,020
 and that rarely gives you swagger, and most frequently gives you tears.

758
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:56,020
 Now, they can be tears of joy,

759
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:59,020
 because conviction's a sweet gift of God's grace.

760
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:03,020
 Conviction's always an invitation into greater intimacy with God.

761
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:05,020
 You should never despise it.

762
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:09,020
 God's not in the guilt business, but he is in the conviction business,

763
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:15,020
 because the conviction is reminding you that he has filled that gap.

764
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:19,020
 Why are you trying to create it again?

765
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:24,020
 Step into the intimacy that I've purchased by my blood.

766
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:27,020
 And so what should be our response if God is holy,

767
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:30,020
 and God doesn't care about your opinion of him,

768
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:33,020
 and how you think he should behave or not behave,

769
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:36,020
 or how you think he should act or not act,

770
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:42,020
 and that even God's love is informed by his moral perfection,

771
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:44,020
 so that all the commands of God in the Bible,

772
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:47,020
 every "thou shalt" and "thou shalt not"

773
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:50,020
 are woven into the fabric of creation for human flourishing,

774
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:55,020
 and to try to step outside of that tapestry

775
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:58,020
 is great rebellion against the holiness of God,

776
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:02,020
 and it's a willingly putting yourself in the position

777
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:05,020
 obliterated by his holiness when all is said and done.

778
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:08,020
 This is why the Bible says that at the second coming of Christ,

779
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:13,020
 the mountains flee before him.

780
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:16,020
 I'm guessing if the mountains are trembling at his coming,

781
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:19,020
 you're not going to be standing with your chest out.

782
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:22,020
 I'm guessing you're going to want to try to catch up to those mountains.

783
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:25,020
 In fact, the Bible says that people cry out for the mountains to fall on them,

784
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:28,020
 to try to hide from the coming of the Lord.

785
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:34,020
 So those of us in Christ, those of us who are covered in his blood,

786
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:40,020
 spotless, blameless, delighted in, rejoiced over,

787
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:44,020
 sung over, sons and daughters.

788
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:48,020
 No, no, no, we don't run on that day.

789
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:51,020
 The Bible says we get caught up.

790
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:53,020
 I love that.

791
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:58,020
 Anybody else running, we're caught up? I'll take that.

792
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:01,020
 Caught up to what? Caught up to reward?

793
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:04,020
 An ever-increasing life for eternity.

794
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:09,020
 Ruling and reigning alongside King Jesus in a remade heaven and earth,

795
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:13,020
 not some spiritual, ethereal plane where we're playing harps

796
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:15,020
 and hanging out in some ghosty space.

797
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:19,020
 No, no, no, physical, literal place and physical, literal bodies,

798
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:21,020
 reigning and ruling alongside Christ forever.

799
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:26,020
 All of that purchased by his blood, given to his children,

800
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:31,020
 invited in to participate in the very life of the Trinity forevermore.

801
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:34,020
 And so what should be our response?

802
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:35,020
 Well, here's the first thing.

803
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:38,020
 If you've never said yes to Jesus,

804
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:44,020
 I would just say Christ has made a way for you.

805
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:45,020
 Like, it doesn't matter.

806
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:48,020
 I know this script, guys. I remember it.

807
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:51,020
 Like, you've just done some things.

808
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:53,020
 And so when you hear somebody talk like I talk,

809
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:56,020
 the way your brain starts to talk to you,

810
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:58,020
 I don't think it's just your brain talking to you,

811
00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:01,020
 but you're talking yourself out of this being true for you

812
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:04,020
 because of this thing back here.

813
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:07,020
 Like, we witness this at the village all the time.

814
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:11,020
 We baptized a girl last year that had had an abortion in college,

815
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:14,020
 and every time we preached the gospel in her head,

816
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:15,020
 she was like, "This is so awesome,

817
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:19,020
 but it can't be for me because I killed that baby."

818
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:24,020
 And I'm just saying there is no sin with more power than the cross of Jesus Christ.

819
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:27,020
 Like, guys, are you reading your Bible?

820
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:28,020
 I say this a lot.

821
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:32,020
 No one in the Bible could get hired at the village.

822
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:35,020
 Their background check's going to show up some shady stuff,

823
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:37,020
 and we're not going to hire him.

824
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:39,020
 Like, we already mentioned Moses.

825
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:41,020
 Dude had a deep rage issue

826
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:45,020
 even after he had face-to-face encounters with Christ.

827
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:49,020
 Dude would just freak out, smash stuff with his staff.

828
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:53,020
 David? You think I'm hiring David?

829
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:54,020
 I mean, best worship leader ever.

830
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:57,020
 Bible said he'd play his harp and demons would flee.

831
00:42:57,020 --> 00:43:00,020
 I'd love some of that at the village, but my wife's an attractive woman.

832
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:03,020
 That brother might have me killed.

833
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:06,020
 I can't bring him on.

834
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:07,020
 Who else? Who else you got?

835
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:08,020
 You ain't going to find them.

836
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:11,020
 You got Daniel and Jesus.

837
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:15,020
 Everybody else, scandalous.

838
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:16,020
 So look at me.

839
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:21,020
 You're the guy, you're the gal that's out sinning the grace of God?

840
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:23,020
 Not Saul of Tarsus.

841
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:25,020
 Seriously, get over yourself.

842
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:26,020
 I know what happens.

843
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:30,020
 So maybe today is the day that you say yes to Jesus.

844
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:31,020
 That's why I'm here.

845
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:33,020
 I'm not here to shame you.

846
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:35,020
 I'm here to tell you the best news in the universe,

847
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:38,020
 that the one that sits at the center of reality

848
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:40,020
 has made a way for you to be whole,

849
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:42,020
 has made a way to reconcile you to God,

850
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:45,020
 has made a way to free you from all your striving

851
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:49,020
 and into the rest of being a son or daughter of God.

852
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:52,020
 And then another way we respond, Christian,

853
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:55,020
 where are you all locked up with him right now?

854
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:58,020
 Where are you delaying obedience?

855
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:03,020
 Where is it clear to you that you know God is asking this of you

856
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:05,020
 and you are either saying no

857
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:07,020
 or you're doing that delayed obedience thing,

858
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:10,020
 which is just disobedient?

859
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:16,020
 So what is it like to fear the Lord rightly as the Bible commands us?

860
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:18,020
 If it's the beginning of all wisdom,

861
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:22,020
 then repentance is the ongoing ethic of his people.

862
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:24,020
 So where are you--I just want to be straight.

863
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:27,020
 Where are you treating Jesus like he's your homeboy?

864
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:29,020
 Where are the commands of Scripture

865
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:32,020
 crashing against what you actually want to do in your life?

866
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:36,020
 Where is God refusing to be used by you as a genie in a bottle

867
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:40,020
 and you're growing in resentment towards him?

868
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:43,020
 Where have you just decided that your sexual compulsions

869
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:48,020
 or whatever, your addiction, he's just got to be cool with that.

870
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:52,020
 Where are you trying to sin all the more so that grace may abound?

871
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:57,020
 Don't forget the next sentence in Romans 6, "May it never be."

872
00:44:57,020 --> 00:44:59,020
 What does it look like for you to lay that down tonight,

873
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:03,020
 to confess it tonight, to step into obedience tonight?

874
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:06,020
 The holiness of God demands it.

875
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:11,020
 The sacrifice of Christ covers us in and through repentance,

876
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:16,020
 through faith, in the grace made available to us through the blood.

877
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:17,020
 So I want you to do--you know what, I'm not going to--

878
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:19,020
 don't bow your heads, don't close your eyes.

879
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:21,020
 I think if you won't do it in this room, you won't do it anywhere.

880
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:26,020
 If you're here tonight, you're like, "Man, I've got some repenting that I need to do.

881
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:31,020
 I have lived, behaved, and navigated this thing."

882
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:35,020
 Not like God is holy, but like I'm free to do whatever,

883
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:38,020
 and Christ is just cool with me despite these areas of my life

884
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:40,020
 that I refuse to surrender to him.

885
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:42,020
 Is that anybody in the room?

886
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:46,020
 Anybody stuck in some serious sins, some besetting sins?

887
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:48,020
 Anybody--yeah, it should be all over the room,

888
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:51,020
 or I need to preach my next sermon online.

889
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:54,020
 Yeah, this is--okay, so, hey, great news. Thank you.

890
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:56,020
 That's courageous.

891
00:45:56,020 --> 00:46:00,020
 The invitation for you is to come lay it down, and maybe lay it down again,

892
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:04,020
 and then keep laying it down until it's dead.

893
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:08,020
 And so I'm going to pray for us, and then we're just going to respond to the Lord.

894
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:10,020
 I don't know what you need to do, but you know.

895
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:13,020
 There'll be prayer team people up here if you need to pray.

896
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:15,020
 Here's what I would tell you.

897
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:20,020
 If God's convicting your heart, tell someone.

898
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:23,020
 Move some way.

899
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:27,020
 You're not going to make it out of the parking lot with just your inner conviction,

900
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:32,020
 which is why the command's always repent and confess, or confess and repent.

901
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:35,020
 It's not just internally, "Okay, I won't do it ever again."

902
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:38,020
 Yeah, okay, well, I'll give you three weeks depending on your discipline level.

903
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:42,020
 If you let it out, darkness loses its power.

904
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:46,020
 So what if we kind of do some damage against darkness tonight?

905
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:51,020
 You're allowed to boldly approach the throne of grace with confidence.

906
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:53,020
 I'm going to pray for us.

907
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:54,020
 Prayer team members will be up.

908
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:55,020
 We're just going to respond.

909
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:58,020
 We're going to sing a little bit, I think, and there'll be people here if you need somebody to pray

910
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:00,020
 or somebody to confess to.

911
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:04,020
 I'm just encouraging you, don't harden your heart against the holiness of God

912
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:06,020
 and the work he's doing in your spirit right now.

913
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:10,020
 This will cost more 10 years from now.

914
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:13,020
 It will cost more 10 years from now.

915
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:16,020
 Father, I bless these young men and women in the name of Jesus.

916
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:18,020
 I thank you for how you love us.

917
00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:24,020
 I thank you that you solved the problem in our lives that we cannot solve.

918
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:27,020
 Thank you that you call us holy.

919
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:28,020
 It's crazy.

920
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:30,020
 It's hard for me to get my mind around.

921
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:34,020
 That despite me, despite my past, despite my present compulsions

922
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:39,020
 and all the screw-ups that are coming for me tomorrow and moving forward,

923
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:46,020
 that you have made a way, that you will not grow weary in moving towards me in love.

924
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:50,020
 So I pray even as you do that tonight that we would not create space from you,

925
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:57,020
 but that we would move towards you and receive from you this grace.

926
00:47:57,020 --> 00:48:01,020
 That we would receive from you this love that you are love.

927
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:03,020
 You want to give us that.

928
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:10,020
 And so would you overpower our stubbornness tonight for the fame of Jesus.

929
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:13,020
 We need you. We love you. Thank you.

930
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:15,020
 It's for your beautiful name I pray. Amen.

931
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:17,020
 Why don't you stand up and respond.

932
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:20,020
 I wouldn't argue with yourself too long. Just come on up and get prayed for.

933
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:22,360
 (whooshing)
