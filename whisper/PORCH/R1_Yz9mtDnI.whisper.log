[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.660]   (phone ringing)
[00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:03.640]   (phone dialing)
[00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:06.440]   - You have seven unheard messages.
[00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.120]   - Hey, sorry I haven't texted.
[00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.200]   I'm just not really sure what I'm feeling right now.
[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.320]   - Hey yo Danny, where you at bro?
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.120]   I'll see you soon, all right?
[00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.240]   - Hey, so I have moved on,
[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.600]   but I feel like the Lord keeps putting you back
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:20.880]   on my heart for a reason.
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.520]   So please call me back.
[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.880]   - Hey bro, hey, I know you're going through it right now,
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.200]   but listen, I found another girl at the farmer's market now.
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.360]   She's not a farmer, but she is on the market.
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.120]   Okay, so hit me back, love you bro.
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.880]   - No, I'm sure this is the right number,
[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.800]   but last night was a mistake.
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.720]   I was just hoping we could keep that between us.
[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:41.920]   - Hey, just wanted to say,
[00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.720]   I don't think I can make it tonight.
[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.040]   Yeah, I've just been thinking about us a lot lately
[00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.480]   and we need to talk.
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:56.480]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.280]   - Porsch, how we doing?
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.040]   We doing okay tonight?
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.920]   It's great to see you.
[00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.240]   You're here for a good one.
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:05.960]   We're really excited for where we're going
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.640]   over the course of the evening.
[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.080]   So thanks for making the time to be here.
[00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.360]   Dallas, love that you're in the room as always.
[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.080]   We never take that for granted,
[00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.240]   but special shout out also to everyone
[00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.640]   that's tuning in online.
[00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.040]   We love everyone that would choose to give us
[00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.480]   a little moment of their evening to be a part
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.120]   of what God is doing in this room and rooms all over,
[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.280]   particularly our Porsch Live locations.
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.680]   Shout out Porsch Live, Greater Lafayette, Fresno,
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:30.520]   and Scottsdale.
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.280]   We all give it up for everybody tuning in online right now.
[00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:39.000]   Well, hey, if you were to survey my college roommates
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.360]   and myself, what you would find is we had a lot in common.
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.920]   You see, we were all business majors
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.800]   and we were serving in the same organizations.
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.160]   There we go.
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.800]   We all played sports in high school,
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.840]   which meant we were overly competitive in college
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.080]   and well past our prime at that point.
[00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.600]   But it didn't slow us down.
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:57.960]   We were all followers of Jesus.
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.400]   Like we loved reading his word and engaging with his people
[00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.440]   and doing the best that we could to be faithful to him.
[00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.920]   And we were single,
[00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.040]   meaning that we knew little to nothing
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:10.480]   about the opposite sex.
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:13.080]   And yet, even though we were single,
[00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.040]   we were like-minded in the sense that
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.520]   we really wanted to find love.
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.040]   So over the course of our college career,
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.760]   we all had our fair share of attempts.
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.740]   We took our shots and we miserably failed
[00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.040]   over the course of our four-year experience.
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.560]   You see, we had so much in common,
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.040]   but the minute you injected us with a little bit of love,
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.560]   we found is we did really dumb things.
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.760]   We all went a variety of directions
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.720]   because love makes people crazy.
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.300]   So just to give you some perspective,
[00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.640]   maybe you'll relate to some of this.
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.280]   One of my roommates, he was the hometown heartthrob.
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.480]   Like the guy, he looked good, he smelled good,
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.480]   he had great hair.
[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.080]   That's not weird, I shared a bathroom with him.
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.260]   We, he had straight, perfectly white teeth.
[00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.780]   He was an athletic guy, built real well.
[00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.600]   There was not a girl that he would ask on a date
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.000]   that would not say no to him
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.920]   because, hey, he was worth a shot.
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.080]   And yet, he was a hopeless romantic.
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.380]   He didn't play the field much
[00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.300]   because he had an ideal that he wanted to find.
[00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.880]   So he didn't fall often, but when he fell,
[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.160]   he fell very hard.
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.480]   You know this guy.
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.620]   Another one of my roommates.
[00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.320]   He was the perennial date party favorite.
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.080]   He was the guy that girls loved to take to date parties
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.580]   because he had the most disarming personality
[00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.000]   and they just had an incredible time.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.400]   It was such a blast always having him with them.
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.920]   And yet, nothing ever really materialized from that evening.
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.140]   The reason why is because he's a pretty chill kind of guy.
[00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.280]   Romance never really rocked him much.
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.360]   Another roommate of mine, well, he was clueless.
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.440]   So clueless, in fact, that he found himself
[00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.240]   stringing along not one, but two girls at the same night,
[00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.000]   completely unbeknownst to him.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   He didn't realize that they were bringing baked goods,
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.500]   cookies and brownies and muffins
[00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:59.640]   as a sign of their affection.
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.280]   He just thought that they were being friendly,
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.920]   but they had a very different perspective
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.680]   on it all together.
[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.840]   The fourth of my roommates, he was the classic party guy.
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.200]   Like he never took anything seriously except his grades,
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.960]   meaning he never took a dating relationship serious,
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.500]   but for some reason, he was the one that figured it out
[00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:18.880]   because lo and behold, one day we looked up
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.160]   and he was in a relationship.
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.600]   And then there was me.
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.080]   And I was confusing, to say the least,
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.480]   probably because I was confused.
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.400]   I had commitment issues.
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.960]   My heart would tell me one thing,
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.000]   but my mind would tell me something different.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.040]   You see, when you injected us with love,
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.200]   what we realized is we were a dizzying array
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.160]   of different directions.
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.120]   And yet, we all wanted it.
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.620]   What was wild is we were a reliable group of dudes.
[00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.540]   We were consistently kind to people.
[00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:52.060]   We were trustworthy with our word.
[00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.800]   We tried to move with an honorable approach
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:55.740]   towards other people.
[00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.700]   And yet, the minute we found ourselves falling,
[00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:02.940]   we started crushing or catching feelings.
[00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:04.740]   We were anything but predictable.
[00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.620]   Sound like anybody you know?
[00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:11.020]   You see, love has a polarizing and powerful effect
[00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:12.780]   on the lives of people.
[00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.080]   In this room alone, there are dozens of different reactions
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.800]   to just the screen behind me.
[00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.520]   You hear that we're in a dating series,
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.040]   and some of you, you rolled up tonight because of it,
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.520]   that you cannot wait for what's coming in the weeks ahead.
[00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:25.740]   You've already blocked off your calendar
[00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.040]   because you don't know where we're going,
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.200]   but you wanna be here for every single week.
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.280]   And yet, some of you, you did not roll up because of it.
[00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.120]   You rolled your eyes
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.240]   because it's just another dating series at the porch.
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.520]   Others of you, you get the idea of,
[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.600]   man, I identify with that hopeless romantic.
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.520]   I'm hoping that I can find the perfect person.
[00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:41.520]   Maybe they're down the aisle.
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.360]   While others of you are not hopelessly romantic,
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.460]   you're cautiously optimistic.
[00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.360]   Maybe there's something over the course of these weeks
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.600]   that you'll learn that you have not known before.
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.640]   Regardless of where you fall within the spectrum
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:58.640]   on romantic relationships or finding love,
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:03.640]   we all go a different and dizzying direction
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:08.240]   whenever it comes to this specific topic.
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.480]   Some of you, you adopt traditional relationships.
[00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.160]   Others, you move into polyamorous dating.
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:18.280]   Some of you, you're deep-liking somebody at the office,
[00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:20.920]   while others are sitting in a situation ship
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.280]   where you're reaping all the benefits,
[00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.420]   but you're not actually making any of the commitment.
[00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:25.560]   Others, you've downloaded
[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.400]   whatever dating app there is this month,
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.000]   and you're scrolling your way along,
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.400]   trying to filter out who will
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.440]   and who will not earn your affection.
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.180]   We go a smattering of different ways
[00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:36.240]   when this thing comes up.
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:40.200]   And yet, the truth is,
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:43.400]   we all have an intrinsic longing for this thing.
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:47.260]   You are like me and my roommates from school.
[00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:53.840]   And so this series is meant to be a service to you.
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.040]   I'll be really clear.
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.360]   I'm not diving into this
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:58.840]   because I just want to generate a bunch of likes
[00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:00.880]   or clicks or approval.
[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:01.720]   That's not our desire.
[00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:03.360]   We genuinely want to be helpful
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:04.640]   over the course of this series.
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.160]   And we think the way that we've crafted it,
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.440]   will be so for you.
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:11.480]   We know that people want to find relationships.
[00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:15.220]   There's a deep desire within you individually,
[00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:17.700]   more than likely to find love,
[00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:20.400]   no different than ourselves.
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:21.280]   And the reason I know that
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:22.760]   is because the statistics back it up.
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:24.680]   I'm not going to bore you with a bunch of research.
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.640]   Trust me, I have done it.
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.640]   I did not want to stand on this stage
[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:30.080]   and talk about this topic
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:32.720]   and not have any credibility in the conversation,
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:35.360]   but to spare you all of the data,
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:36.960]   I'll share a couple of things,
[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:38.160]   just so you know,
[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:40.880]   this is something we broadly want together.
[00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:43.080]   You see one survey found,
[00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:46.360]   that within young adults, 85% believe,
[00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:49.740]   I don't need a long-term relationship
[00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:51.440]   to find fulfillment in my life.
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:52.440]   I don't need that.
[00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:55.240]   85%, that's like the majority of this room.
[00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:58.680]   And yet within that same survey, 83%.
[00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:01.040]   So virtually the exact same number said,
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:01.880]   you know what?
[00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:04.580]   I do anticipate tying the knot at some point in my future.
[00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:07.100]   That feels wildly confusing.
[00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:08.680]   What are we saying when we read that survey?
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:10.060]   What we realize is people are saying,
[00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:10.900]   you know what?
[00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:12.740]   I don't need love,
[00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:13.900]   but it sure would be nice to snuggle up
[00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:14.740]   to someone every single night
[00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:16.620]   and spend the rest of my life with them.
[00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:22.260]   Another survey told us, according to Tinder,
[00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260]   which is the most downloaded dating app
[00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:25.340]   among young adults,
[00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:29.180]   that Gen Z signaled within their relationship goals
[00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:30.600]   on their profile,
[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:32.980]   more than any other intent,
[00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:35.580]   that they wanted long-term relationships.
[00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:36.820]   Why is that surprising?
[00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:39.120]   Because Tinder's not the place
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.980]   where you look for long-term relationships.
[00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:43.060]   Like their interface is all about hot or not, right?
[00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:45.220]   Like you swipe depending upon what they look like
[00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:46.500]   and what their first line is.
[00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:48.480]   It is not the place to look for long-term relationships.
[00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:51.220]   And yet even people on Tinder are saying,
[00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:52.860]   no, that's what I want,
[00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:55.380]   to bring it outside of the world and into this room.
[00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:56.980]   We surveyed you.
[00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:59.540]   And what we realized is that 70% of you
[00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:01.180]   identified as single.
[00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:03.060]   Not to out you like that,
[00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:04.340]   I don't know how it leaves you feeling,
[00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:06.940]   but what you need to know is that you also said
[00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:09.620]   the one serious topic we want to learn about
[00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:12.140]   is we want to learn about romance in relationships.
[00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:13.260]   Which you put those things together
[00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.220]   and what you realize is I'm single and I want love.
[00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:19.380]   Help me figure out the way forward on this.
[00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:20.500]   It's clear.
[00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:23.300]   We want relationships.
[00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:25.460]   We want to find love.
[00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:29.420]   And yet, as you observe the romantic landscape of our day,
[00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:31.540]   what you see is that although we want to be
[00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:35.580]   in a relationship, we are more romantically disconnected
[00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:39.460]   and discouraged than any other group in history.
[00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:45.060]   According to Pew Research, 42% of young adults,
[00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:48.220]   people like you, 42%,
[00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:50.620]   have never been in a committed relationship.
[00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:56.540]   Now, that excludes camp crushes and summer flings
[00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:59.060]   because a committed relationship would be one
[00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:00.820]   that stands the test of time,
[00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:04.020]   that says I'm in this for the long haul.
[00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:08.180]   Roughly half have never found themselves in that spot.
[00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:11.260]   And yet, despite the fact that that's true,
[00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.700]   we know that nearly half of those would say
[00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:16.060]   I would commit to a long-term relationship
[00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:19.740]   upwards of driving three hours if I could find love today.
[00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:22.980]   Like that's how deep the desire goes.
[00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:25.060]   In the US Census Bureau, maybe you've heard this before
[00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:26.420]   because this is passed around a lot
[00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:27.860]   when it comes to your generation,
[00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:29.540]   but what you hear is that the average age
[00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:31.940]   of first marriage has moved further and further
[00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:33.540]   and further down the timeline.
[00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:36.460]   At one time, it was 23, 25 years old,
[00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:40.780]   and yet now it's 28 for girls, and some odd change,
[00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:43.500]   and 30 for guys, meaning it has grown
[00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:46.180]   increasingly later in life.
[00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:47.460]   Why is that?
[00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:48.860]   Like it begs the question.
[00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:51.620]   If we have a desire for marriage,
[00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:54.500]   but there's a delay in that commitment,
[00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:55.980]   what's the issue?
[00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:57.260]   What's the reason?
[00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:01.940]   Well, I think it's pretty plain.
[00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:06.420]   While we want to find love, we do not know where to look.
[00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:11.020]   Like that's the summary of those two ideas together.
[00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:12.940]   And let me just say, like that's not your fault.
[00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:14.500]   Like I'm not looking at you and pointing at the finger
[00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:16.340]   and being like, man, everybody in a bygone era,
[00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:17.180]   they figured this thing out.
[00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:18.380]   How come you haven't figured it out?
[00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:19.700]   That's not what I'm saying.
[00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:21.500]   You have been dealt an interesting hand.
[00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:24.740]   You live at a time amidst the advent of technology
[00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:26.500]   and the globalization of society,
[00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:29.820]   which has created a really sophisticated dating dynamic.
[00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:31.740]   It's interesting, particularly with Gen Z.
[00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:33.620]   I know we've got millennials in the room as well,
[00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:35.500]   but Gen Z is kind of being identified
[00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:37.660]   as the contradictory generation
[00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:40.340]   because the day in which we live is confusing.
[00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:41.780]   It's difficult.
[00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:44.780]   And yet, though that is true,
[00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:47.380]   and you can't change the circumstances of your life,
[00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:49.020]   what's going on in our world,
[00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:51.260]   it is helpful for us to discern.
[00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:54.540]   If I have a desire for romantic connection,
[00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:57.820]   why then is there a delay in my romantic commitment?
[00:11:57.820 --> 00:11:59.180]   So I wanna share a few reasons with you
[00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:00.860]   that I think could be helpful.
[00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:04.420]   The first reason is there's a tendency
[00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:07.740]   to set unrealistic expectations.
[00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:09.380]   We paint a picture in our minds,
[00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:11.100]   make a checklist of all the different things
[00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:12.660]   that we wanna find in our perfect somebody.
[00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:14.260]   He'll be this tall, he'll have this hair,
[00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:15.500]   he'll look this good.
[00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:18.740]   And yet what we realize is that we're often waiting
[00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:21.820]   for that person to magically appear in our lives.
[00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:23.420]   For you ladies, you're looking for someone
[00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:24.860]   that is ruggedly handsome.
[00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:30.780]   You want him to be emotionally mature,
[00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:34.620]   charmingly convincing.
[00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:36.140]   And yet what you're looking for
[00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:38.020]   is you're looking for someone that looks like Glenn Powell,
[00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:39.700]   talks like Harry Styles,
[00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:41.580]   and processes like Timothee Chalamet.
[00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:44.220]   And I'll break it to you, you're not gonna find him.
[00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:45.500]   Like that guy does not exist.
[00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:48.180]   He for sure is not in this room, nor is he in any room.
[00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:49.740]   Because the truth of the matter is,
[00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:53.980]   that is a unicorn and those do not exist.
[00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:57.060]   Guys, you're much easier.
[00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:59.180]   You're looking for a Christian Sidney Sweeney.
[00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:00.300]   You know, like that's kind of the thing
[00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:01.540]   that you're hoping to find.
[00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:04.420]   You laugh because you know it's true.
[00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:07.740]   And yet we have set unrealistic expectations.
[00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:09.260]   And the truth of the matter is,
[00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.420]   we're holding people to standards
[00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:13.060]   that we're not willing to hold ourselves
[00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:14.620]   to the same standard of.
[00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:16.740]   And because of it, we are delaying our ability
[00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:18.020]   to commit in relationship.
[00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:19.220]   I see some guys out there patting each other
[00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:21.980]   on the shoulder like, yeah, man, that's you.
[00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:23.460]   The second reason for others of us
[00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:24.820]   is we're training for variety.
[00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:26.220]   It's you right there, man.
[00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:28.180]   We're training for variety.
[00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:30.620]   We live in a day where you can,
[00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:32.060]   by just the pull of your phone,
[00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:34.460]   you can peruse through thousands
[00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:36.820]   of different romantic suitors
[00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:38.660]   with just the swipe of your hand.
[00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:40.700]   And the thing is, you can do it at any time
[00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:41.900]   and in any place you want.
[00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:42.980]   You can do it in an Uber,
[00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:44.780]   you can do it first thing in the morning when you wake up.
[00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:45.660]   I don't recommend that.
[00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:46.900]   You can do it when you're at the gym,
[00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:48.620]   sitting at the office, don't recommend that one either.
[00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:50.420]   Or, and we know this has actually happened,
[00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:51.780]   you can do it here in this room.
[00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:54.700]   We have seen people match with people
[00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:56.020]   at the porch on a Tuesday night
[00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:58.020]   that they've passed by 100 times before
[00:13:58.020 --> 00:13:59.220]   and yet they did not have the courage
[00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:00.380]   nor boldness to walk up to
[00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:03.100]   and actually ask them for their number.
[00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:04.900]   I'm not pointing fingers,
[00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:06.800]   but the evidence would say,
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:08.860]   long gone are the days, the dangers
[00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:10.620]   of walking up to someone because you know what?
[00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:13.980]   They might be worth initiating with face to face.
[00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:17.780]   Instead, we're worried that might be too cringe.
[00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:20.860]   And so we choose to avail ourselves
[00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:22.140]   to all of the endless options
[00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:23.780]   and we swipe our way along,
[00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:25.460]   looking at different people and evaluating
[00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:27.300]   whether or not they're worth my time.
[00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:28.820]   And we give power to our preferences
[00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:30.380]   over the dateability of someone.
[00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:31.620]   And ultimately what we're doing
[00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:35.560]   is we never commit for fear of missing out on someone better.
[00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:39.060]   But these are just a couple of reasons.
[00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:41.340]   Another one would be that we're waiting
[00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:43.780]   until you're financially settled,
[00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:46.180]   which I get, like getting married and settling down
[00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:47.900]   and having kids and buying a house.
[00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:50.780]   That's all expensive to do.
[00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:53.420]   And the reality is you're not unwise
[00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:55.940]   for wanting to be financially prepared for marriage.
[00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:56.780]   That's a good thing.
[00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:58.580]   You should be financially prepared.
[00:14:58.580 --> 00:14:59.620]   But the issue is we're not waiting
[00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:00.460]   to be financially prepared.
[00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:04.300]   We're waiting to be financially prominent.
[00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:05.300]   So many of you,
[00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:07.140]   you're not making yourself romantically available
[00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:09.900]   because what you want is you want to get that job
[00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:11.940]   or be in that department or move into that neighborhood
[00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:14.460]   or have this kind of car or take those specific trips.
[00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:18.860]   And while you want to be dating and married at some point,
[00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:22.780]   man, that is really inconvenient to my ambitions in life.
[00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:24.460]   So I'm just going to wait.
[00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:27.480]   Others of you, you're indulging sexual desire
[00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:29.860]   and you're not doing it within the confines of marriage
[00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:31.140]   as God would ordain.
[00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:33.800]   Instead, you're doing it outside.
[00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:35.240]   Now, let me be clear.
[00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:40.740]   You're not typically associated with the hookup generation.
[00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:42.700]   That was Gen Xers
[00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:44.620]   and even millennials defended that themselves.
[00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:46.660]   But what you need to know
[00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:50.980]   is you are still considered sexually positive.
[00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:55.420]   One specific researcher quoted that Gen Z specifically
[00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:57.420]   is the kinkiest generation yet.
[00:15:57.420 --> 00:16:01.820]   From hentai pornography to paranormal romance novels
[00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:03.580]   to friends with benefits.
[00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:08.580]   Sex is as much on the rise as it has always been.
[00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:11.200]   People would say, but there's a sex recession.
[00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:14.700]   There's not a lust recession
[00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:16.620]   that is still as much an issue today
[00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:18.740]   as we have seen in decades past.
[00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:21.300]   Others of you, you're living in a post-pandemic society.
[00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:22.180]   We all are.
[00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:25.860]   Like, can we just acknowledge COVID changed things?
[00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:27.820]   Like, I know that it's weird to talk about
[00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:28.820]   because that happened back then
[00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:30.780]   and we don't really like to look in the rear view.
[00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:33.100]   But the truth is it changed everything
[00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:34.900]   about the way you live your day.
[00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:38.260]   It changed so much of what we do
[00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:41.980]   and where we work and where we live.
[00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:44.460]   Today, there are more remote work arrangements
[00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:45.540]   than ever before.
[00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:48.460]   Hours spent gaming and young adults
[00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:51.340]   living with their parents than in times past.
[00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:53.180]   I'm not making an enemy out of any of that
[00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:54.260]   to be abundantly clear,
[00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:56.180]   but I just think it's important for us to acknowledge
[00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:59.380]   the fact that as we've seen an increase in those realities,
[00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:01.580]   there's likely a correlation
[00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:02.980]   between the increase of those things
[00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:04.540]   and an increase we're also seeing
[00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:07.060]   between individualization,
[00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:09.980]   sexual dormancy, and friendlessness.
[00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:14.700]   We're seeing that as we find fewer and fewer opportunities
[00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:18.340]   to engage with other people and meaningfully connect,
[00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:23.020]   so too are we losing the skillset to socialize
[00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:25.660]   in a way that will lead to relationship.
[00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:31.380]   Others, you're adopting alternative relationship structures.
[00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:33.500]   Things like poly dating and ethical non-monogamy
[00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:36.420]   and open relationships are more prevalent now than ever.
[00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:40.780]   And while it seems to make logical sense
[00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:42.900]   and get a fuller sexual experience,
[00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:46.700]   you're able to explore a variety of different forms of love,
[00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:49.420]   you're less pressured to fulfill your partner,
[00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:51.580]   what happens is when people spread themselves
[00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:53.980]   between their social circle,
[00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:55.820]   they find that they are losing the ability
[00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:59.300]   to commit and care for an individual person
[00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:00.780]   and serve their soul.
[00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:05.540]   These are just some of the reasons
[00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:09.940]   why we're seeing a desire for a romantic connection
[00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:14.060]   ultimately met with a delay in romantic commitment.
[00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:17.980]   I don't know how that leaves you feeling.
[00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:19.700]   I know that as I processed it,
[00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:21.420]   read all the articles, looked at all the data,
[00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:24.660]   studied the statistics, and I did a lot of that,
[00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:28.740]   I realized that while we're looking for a good
[00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:30.060]   and a right thing,
[00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:34.900]   we are looking at a bad in a wrong way.
[00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:40.860]   So tonight, before we dive into all the hard questions
[00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:43.140]   that we're going to investigate in this series,
[00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:44.700]   things like why am I still single
[00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:46.700]   and is dating supposed to be this hard
[00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:47.980]   and why does this keep happening to me
[00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:49.780]   and how far is too far?
[00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:51.580]   As we look at all those questions,
[00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:53.900]   I think that before we get into any of them,
[00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:56.980]   we need to answer a preliminary question first.
[00:18:56.980 --> 00:19:01.380]   And that question is, will I ever find love?
[00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:02.660]   Will I ever find love?
[00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:05.740]   Because the reality is, as we look at the romantic landscape
[00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:08.420]   it does not look encouraging.
[00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:11.460]   When you consider where people are seeking instead,
[00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:15.260]   it doesn't look like anyone is ultimately discovering.
[00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:19.060]   And so tonight I want to help you find it.
[00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:20.260]   I want you to find love.
[00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:22.020]   I think it's possible.
[00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:25.380]   But we have to look in the right place.
[00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:27.300]   And so to help us figure out where that place is,
[00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:29.700]   you can turn with me to Genesis chapter two.
[00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:32.580]   It's the second page of your Bible.
[00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:33.860]   I know that was a lot of setup.
[00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:35.260]   We'll get into the scripture now.
[00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:37.820]   I just want to make sure we make a really good case for this
[00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:39.220]   before we get in.
[00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:41.820]   While you're turning there, let me just say this.
[00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:44.540]   Fundamental to everything we just walked through,
[00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:47.620]   all that myriad of reasons for why we're doing
[00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:51.060]   the things we're doing is actually a fundamentally
[00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:54.460]   good reason to seek love.
[00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:56.060]   And it's three things.
[00:19:56.060 --> 00:20:00.180]   Number one, we have a desire for connection
[00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:01.500]   and not just casual connection,
[00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:03.260]   but meaningful connection to other people.
[00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:05.460]   We want to link arms with someone
[00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:08.020]   and journey through life, through the highs and the lows.
[00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:11.380]   We want to race forward and find great companionship.
[00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:13.820]   Secondly, we want fulfillment.
[00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:16.260]   Not just that someone makes me happy,
[00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:18.460]   but we want someone that can come alongside us
[00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:21.780]   and help us achieve and develop and grow and succeed
[00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:23.900]   in the things that we think we've been called to.
[00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:25.380]   If you're a believer, particularly the things
[00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:27.500]   that God has called you to.
[00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:29.540]   And then thirdly, we want intimacy.
[00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:33.380]   Like we want someone to accept us
[00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:36.380]   and not just us on our best day, but us on our worst day.
[00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:38.980]   We want people to move near to us.
[00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:41.060]   We want people to know us.
[00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:42.860]   We want to be loved.
[00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:45.060]   And these are good things to desire.
[00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:47.060]   But more than that, they're not just good reasons
[00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:50.380]   to seek love, they're God reasons to seek love.
[00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:52.660]   We see that in the very beginning of the Bible
[00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:55.540]   as he starts talking to the very first relationship
[00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:59.220]   in human history, he unpacks for them
[00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:02.060]   the very reasons why he has brought them together.
[00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:04.380]   And it's these reasons, this is what we're gonna see
[00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:07.300]   in that first relationship as man and woman
[00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:09.460]   find love together, what they're going to also see
[00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:12.140]   is they particularly find a love with God.
[00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:13.420]   And so here's what we'll do.
[00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:15.700]   We'll look at a handful of verses in Genesis 1 and 2.
[00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:17.900]   We'll start in two, and you can just kind of track
[00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:19.020]   with me as we go.
[00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:22.980]   We're gonna look at verse 18 first, Genesis 2, 18.
[00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:26.820]   This is what it says.
[00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:30.740]   "Then the Lord God said, 'It is not good
[00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:32.100]   that man should be alone.
[00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:34.860]   I will make a helper fit for him.'"
[00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:39.420]   Let me just ask, don't you just feel so seen by God
[00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:40.940]   when you read that?
[00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:42.220]   It's not good for man to be alone.
[00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:44.260]   Thank you, God, I agree.
[00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:45.780]   Please send someone soon.
[00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:48.940]   Like this scripture is certainly speaking
[00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:51.220]   to your longing for relationship.
[00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:52.500]   That's not a bad thing.
[00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:54.900]   But what you need to know is that in Genesis 2,
[00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:58.660]   what's in view here is actually bigger than marriage.
[00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:00.740]   What God is speaking to is he's speaking
[00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:03.940]   to something more significant that's not just available
[00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:06.980]   for the select few who find themselves
[00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:10.460]   in covenantal relationship, but for all his people
[00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:12.420]   that find themselves in God's family.
[00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:17.420]   Because that word man in Hebrew is the word human,
[00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:20.420]   which means it's not good for human to be alone.
[00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:24.580]   God is not saying it isn't good for a guy to be single.
[00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:28.340]   He's saying it isn't good for a person to be lonely,
[00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:32.020]   which many of you hear that and you're like,
[00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:33.820]   yeah, man, I get that.
[00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:35.860]   That makes complete sense to me
[00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:38.300]   because in this room right now,
[00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:40.940]   we are here for yes, a smattering of different reasons.
[00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:42.540]   Some of you are here 'cause you wanna see your community
[00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:43.500]   and others of you are here
[00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:44.660]   because you're serving here tonight.
[00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:45.500]   Others of you, you're here
[00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:47.260]   because you want to meet someone new.
[00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:48.500]   Others of you are here because you wanna meet
[00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:50.420]   that special person that's gonna be new.
[00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:51.580]   You're trying to stoke the fire.
[00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:54.140]   You know, like you're trying to make moves in this space
[00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:57.940]   and the reality is whatever your reasons may be,
[00:22:57.940 --> 00:23:00.740]   we are all here more than likely
[00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:03.480]   because we want to meet other people,
[00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:04.980]   engage with other people.
[00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:08.300]   We want to connect to other people.
[00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:10.180]   And God says, hey, that's a good thing.
[00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:11.860]   You want meaningful connection to other people.
[00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:14.700]   I want you to have a meaningful connection to other people.
[00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:16.160]   When you read this account,
[00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:17.780]   particularly when you go back to Genesis 1
[00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:18.900]   and you look at the creation account,
[00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:22.100]   what you see is God gets into kind of a rhythm
[00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:23.980]   for how he's creating the world.
[00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:25.580]   He creates day one, day two, day three,
[00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:27.940]   and every single day, it's good.
[00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:31.320]   He makes light and dark and it's good.
[00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:32.700]   He makes sea and sky and it's good.
[00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:34.540]   He makes land and vegetation and it's good.
[00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:38.040]   But when you get to the end of his creation narrative,
[00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:40.940]   what you find is that he looks upon Adam
[00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:43.240]   and he says for the very first time, that's not good.
[00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:45.780]   It's not good that man is alone,
[00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:48.060]   which begs the million dollar question.
[00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:50.660]   What makes something good?
[00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:54.540]   It's relationship.
[00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:57.780]   It's togetherness.
[00:23:57.780 --> 00:24:01.860]   And the reason we know that is because as God creates,
[00:24:01.860 --> 00:24:03.780]   you can go and track this.
[00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:06.620]   As he creates, he creates everything
[00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:09.120]   with a corresponding companion.
[00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:12.800]   He creates light and dark and to them,
[00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:15.380]   he gives sun, moon, and stars.
[00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:17.580]   He creates sea and sky and to it,
[00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:19.740]   he gives fish and birds of the air
[00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:23.300]   to land and vegetation.
[00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:26.660]   He gives beasts of the field and humanity itself.
[00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:28.700]   And yet when you get to Genesis two and you zoom in,
[00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:31.460]   you see that God, he looks at upon Adam
[00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:34.140]   and he realizes there's something not good here.
[00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:39.360]   And it's the fact that there's no good companion for him.
[00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:41.700]   So he makes Eve.
[00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:42.900]   You ever thought about that?
[00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:45.640]   Like why did God make Eve for Adam?
[00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:50.120]   Like there's a whole world of created beings,
[00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:51.940]   other creatures that Adam,
[00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:53.900]   I mean, he kind of swipes left all the way through
[00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:55.820]   and he realizes none of these are suitable for me.
[00:24:55.820 --> 00:24:57.780]   And what he realizes is that man,
[00:24:57.780 --> 00:25:00.980]   God could have set him up with a horse,
[00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:02.380]   you know, cowboys, they use horses.
[00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:03.460]   That's a good partner animal.
[00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:06.040]   Or, you know, maybe he wasn't a dog person.
[00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:07.780]   You know, I guess that man's best friend
[00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:09.380]   wouldn't really work as a suitable helper.
[00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:10.220]   It begs the question,
[00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:12.780]   what was the reason for which he needed a companion?
[00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:16.460]   Well, we see it in Genesis one,
[00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:18.700]   we get the answer, verse 26.
[00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:23.700]   And then God said, let us make man in our image
[00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:26.820]   after our likeness.
[00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:28.220]   So God created man in his own image.
[00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:31.220]   In the image of God, he created him male and female.
[00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:32.340]   He created them.
[00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:35.140]   It's interesting when you read the creation account,
[00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:38.220]   you see God, he speaks everything into being,
[00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:40.940]   but then he slows down when he comes to man
[00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:44.180]   and he actually makes man himself.
[00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:46.440]   To dignify the ladies in the room,
[00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:48.940]   everything is a voice or dust,
[00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:53.180]   but when he makes her, he fashions her from Adam.
[00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:59.060]   You see, God, he desires an intentional relationship with us
[00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:03.900]   and the reason why he brings us to one another
[00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:06.540]   is because he knows what we need to know,
[00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:11.060]   which is we reflect God's love when we connect to others.
[00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:13.860]   We reflect God's love when we connect to others.
[00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:17.080]   Like one person cannot reflect God alone.
[00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:19.200]   We need each other for that purpose.
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:21.180]   It's through a relationship to someone
[00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:22.200]   that this is possible.
[00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:23.440]   If you think about it, God,
[00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:26.360]   he is three co-equal, co-eternal persons
[00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:28.080]   and yet he is one in essence all at the same time.
[00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:30.720]   He is father, son, and Holy Spirit.
[00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:33.880]   And yet what he is doing is he brings Adam to Eve,
[00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:36.440]   is he brings not three in one, but two to one.
[00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:39.320]   And he says, I want you to experience the same depth
[00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:42.560]   and meaning of relationship that I myself experience,
[00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:45.880]   the kind of loving union I have in my own person
[00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:48.200]   because I want you to relate to me.
[00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:50.960]   I stand in the altar of weddings all the time.
[00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:53.360]   I get the privilege of officiating different couples
[00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:55.200]   that are tying the knot.
[00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:57.320]   And it's one of my favorite things to say to them,
[00:26:57.320 --> 00:27:00.500]   hey, what you're doing today is so significant
[00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:01.940]   for a variety of reasons.
[00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:04.700]   And yet one of the biggest reasons it's so significant
[00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:06.200]   is the two of you come together,
[00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:09.720]   you're actually getting to taste a little piece
[00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:12.340]   of what God experiences within himself.
[00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:17.140]   You see, God, he is consisting of deeply meaningful
[00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:19.280]   and intimately connected relationships.
[00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:20.600]   And that's what you get to be a part of
[00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:23.740]   whenever you find yourself in marriage.
[00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:29.060]   You see, that's why if you want to find love,
[00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:31.000]   you have to find God.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.680]   If you wanna find love, you gotta find God
[00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:37.000]   because he made it.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.120]   I don't know if you've thought of that,
[00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:39.960]   but he's actually the one that came up with the idea.
[00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:41.620]   It's not just that he created love.
[00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:43.200]   You actually read that God is love.
[00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:44.080]   Three times in the scriptures,
[00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:46.480]   you see that God identifies as something,
[00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:49.840]   that his very essence is something, love, light, and spirit.
[00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:51.760]   And yet when he says, I am love,
[00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:54.880]   he's saying, as I've created all things,
[00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:58.620]   I have woven love into the fabric of it all.
[00:27:58.620 --> 00:28:00.520]   And so if you want to find love in your life,
[00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:01.800]   you need to find him.
[00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:04.840]   Like, if your car breaks down,
[00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:07.880]   you're probably not just gonna pop the hood
[00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:10.680]   and just start tinkering around
[00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:12.300]   if you don't actually know what's going on.
[00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:13.140]   Why?
[00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:14.520]   Because that could be consequential.
[00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:16.320]   It could actually set you back more money
[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:18.140]   than if you just opened the user's manual
[00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:20.780]   and asked the people that actually knew what was going on.
[00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:23.300]   That's what we have to do with love.
[00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:25.460]   God is hardwired into your heart,
[00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:27.680]   this longing for connection.
[00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:29.580]   And the reason he did is he wants you
[00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:33.140]   to experience what he experiences.
[00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:34.580]   Isn't that amazing?
[00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:36.720]   How kind of God is that?
[00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:38.760]   Now, as I say that,
[00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:41.020]   I know what some of you are wondering, Kylan,
[00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:43.540]   but I'm single.
[00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:45.620]   So are you telling me that I'm never gonna be able
[00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:47.360]   to understand the love of God
[00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:49.880]   because I don't have a spouse?
[00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:53.420]   No, that's not what I'm saying.
[00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:55.900]   Because what we realize is this is, again,
[00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:58.940]   it's not just mainly about marriage,
[00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:01.020]   it's about relationship.
[00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:05.500]   And in Christ, we have found not just a salvation from sin,
[00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:07.420]   but a salvation to one another.
[00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:10.620]   We have been intimately acquainted to one another.
[00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:15.620]   We've been united by his blood to other people.
[00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:16.700]   He's given you relationship,
[00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:19.460]   meaningful connection to other believers,
[00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:22.260]   which means, as Paul says in Galatians 3:28,
[00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:25.160]   "There's neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free,
[00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:30.020]   "male nor female, for you are all one in Christ."
[00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:33.740]   Meaning, yes, marriage is one way
[00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:35.900]   of being meaningfully connected to someone,
[00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:38.300]   but it's not the only way
[00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:40.340]   of being meaningfully connected to someone.
[00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:42.200]   So listen to me,
[00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:47.200]   you don't have to lower your standards to feel accepted.
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:49.820]   You don't have to rush to the altar with the wrong person,
[00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:51.540]   which some of you are doing right now,
[00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:53.820]   just so you can feel loved.
[00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:55.620]   You don't need to move in with your boyfriend
[00:29:55.620 --> 00:29:56.620]   or your girlfriend,
[00:29:56.620 --> 00:29:59.340]   that way you can feel like you're finally adulting.
[00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:01.860]   You certainly don't need to indulge a situationship
[00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:03.560]   just to get your emotional needs met.
[00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:06.060]   That's a proliferate problem in the church.
[00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:11.240]   Because with Jesus, you're not alone.
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:15.240]   You have us.
[00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:18.320]   Like Jesus is gathering a people to himself,
[00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:22.760]   and we're diverse, different languages,
[00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:25.200]   and different colors, and different personalities,
[00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:27.280]   and different occupations, and different backgrounds,
[00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:29.000]   and he's pulling us together,
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.160]   not just so we can be with him,
[00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:31.840]   but so we can be with one another.
[00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:33.960]   There's meaningful connection right here.
[00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:37.140]   You can relate to the love of God
[00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:40.900]   because you can relate to our love.
[00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:44.160]   You don't have to search for it in a spouse
[00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:47.700]   because you can seek it right here.
[00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:49.580]   That's the first thing.
[00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:51.420]   And it's an amazing thing,
[00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:53.140]   but God doesn't stop there.
[00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:55.060]   Because while we see God's plan for meaningful connection,
[00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:58.060]   we also see that he has a purpose for that connection.
[00:30:58.060 --> 00:31:00.900]   You see, Adam had a job to do,
[00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:02.420]   and yet he couldn't do that job alone.
[00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:03.600]   He needed a partner,
[00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:05.420]   which he doesn't find without a fair bit of effort,
[00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:06.260]   mind you.
[00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:08.380]   Again, God set that guy up,
[00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:10.380]   he who was single for less time
[00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:12.180]   than anybody else in all creation,
[00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:13.900]   and God was like, "Hey, you better get to work, man.
[00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:14.940]   "Name all these animals."
[00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:16.020]   And he did it.
[00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:17.260]   Like he seized the moment.
[00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:19.340]   He wasn't just pining away about what might be.
[00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:21.600]   He literally, he leveraged his singleness
[00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:22.980]   to do what God was asking.
[00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:24.580]   He knew I have a purpose in my life right now,
[00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:25.780]   and I'm gonna go fulfill it.
[00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:27.380]   And yet as he did it, he realized,
[00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:30.800]   "But God, I've searched everywhere, and she's not here.
[00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:32.160]   "Please help me, God.
[00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:33.980]   "There's no one to support me, partner with me,
[00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:35.500]   "actually serve as my companion
[00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:37.020]   "on this mission that you've given me."
[00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:40.800]   And so God, ultimately, he brings him in Eve.
[00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:42.460]   Now, what does he bring him Eve for?
[00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:46.860]   Well, we learn in Genesis 1, 28, it says this,
[00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:49.580]   "And God blessed them after making both Adam and Eve.
[00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:52.240]   "And he said to them, 'Be fruitful and multiply,
[00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:53.320]   "'and fill the earth and subdue it,
[00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:55.100]   "'and have dominion over the fish of the sea,
[00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:56.100]   "'and the birds and the heavens,
[00:31:56.100 --> 00:32:00.620]   "'and over every living thing that moves on the earth.'"
[00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:04.700]   You see, not only did God make man and woman in his image,
[00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:08.240]   but he made man and woman with his mission.
[00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:14.700]   God wants us to relate to his love
[00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:18.620]   through our union to one another,
[00:32:18.620 --> 00:32:21.740]   but he also wants us to cultivate his love
[00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:25.180]   on mission to this world.
[00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:27.100]   That's what God has invited us to be a part of.
[00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:30.100]   But here's the thing, in order to achieve that mission,
[00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:33.300]   we need someone else.
[00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:38.660]   That's why it says that Adam needed a helper fit for him.
[00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:41.540]   You see, he needed someone to help him
[00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:45.300]   not just experience God's love, but express God's love,
[00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:46.900]   which is your second point.
[00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:48.680]   When we experience the love of God,
[00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:50.340]   we express the love of God.
[00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:54.960]   And so Adam, he gets a helper.
[00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:57.400]   Now, ladies, don't bristle at the idea of helper.
[00:32:57.400 --> 00:32:59.620]   I don't have time to unpack this in depth,
[00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:02.140]   but what you need to know is the Hebrew there,
[00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:04.060]   which is etzer kenegdo is used 21 times
[00:33:04.060 --> 00:33:06.620]   in the Old Testament, 16 of which are used of God himself.
[00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:08.580]   He's a rescuer, deliverer.
[00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:11.000]   He is a savior to his people, and he is a helper.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.100]   So you are on par with the Lord's own self-identification
[00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:17.400]   in this moment, meaning that she is not above Adam
[00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:19.740]   nor below Adam, she is side by side with Adam
[00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:22.620]   'cause she is equal in dignity,
[00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:26.020]   yet distinct in nature or role.
[00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:29.140]   So it's kind of like when you go and you put up a tent.
[00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:30.740]   Anytime you start the process of putting up a tent,
[00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:32.240]   what do you do?
[00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:34.940]   We pull all the poles out, you put them together,
[00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:38.900]   and then you identify those first two cross beams
[00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:42.220]   because you know those two beams together provide structure.
[00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:45.380]   If you didn't have them both, what would you have?
[00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:47.540]   Not a tent, probably a sail,
[00:33:47.540 --> 00:33:49.260]   which isn't useful for providing shelter
[00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:50.620]   or structure for anyone.
[00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:52.460]   You need both.
[00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:55.780]   You need not just one, but two
[00:33:55.780 --> 00:34:00.780]   that are equally long and equally strong
[00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:02.620]   for the job at hand.
[00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:05.780]   And so that's what God has done in giving Adam Eve.
[00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:09.260]   He has given him someone that is opposite of him,
[00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:14.260]   but equal to him, distinct, but equal,
[00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:15.820]   because the potential of one
[00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:17.780]   depends on the presence of the other.
[00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:20.460]   Adam's potential depends on the presence of Eve.
[00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:21.740]   Now, let me be clear.
[00:34:21.740 --> 00:34:23.420]   His potential depends on her,
[00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:25.700]   not in the sense that she exists to fulfill him.
[00:34:25.700 --> 00:34:26.820]   That's a crazy idea,
[00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:29.980]   this thought that I must find her so she will complete me.
[00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:32.380]   That is not at all what this is talking about,
[00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:34.540]   and nor should it be any sort of expectation
[00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:35.380]   on your life, ladies.
[00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:37.300]   If you have a man in your life that is looking at you
[00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:39.260]   and saying, "You must complete me.
[00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:42.060]   "You must awaken all the dormant desire within my soul.
[00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:43.820]   "You must curb every craving that I have,"
[00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:46.780]   get away from that guy, please,
[00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:48.940]   because that is an unbearable expectation
[00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:50.820]   to put on another person.
[00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:52.380]   You cannot bear it,
[00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:54.900]   and so you will ultimately disappoint him.
[00:34:54.900 --> 00:34:56.860]   That's not what this is talking about.
[00:34:56.860 --> 00:35:00.420]   This is not talking about helping fulfill someone's being,
[00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:03.420]   but helping fulfill someone's calling.
[00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:05.660]   Adam had a calling on his life,
[00:35:05.660 --> 00:35:08.500]   and so God gives him Eve so that way he can fulfill it.
[00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:09.420]   That's what she's doing,
[00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:10.980]   and that's what we do for one another,
[00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:12.820]   not just as husbands and wives,
[00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:15.260]   but as brothers and sisters to each other in Christ.
[00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:16.360]   This is the amazing thing.
[00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:19.700]   This is not solely reserved for whenever you find love,
[00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:21.540]   whenever you say, "I do,"
[00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:23.260]   whenever you hear the wedding bells
[00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:24.740]   and you march forward into marriage.
[00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:26.620]   This is not reserved for that moment.
[00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:29.660]   You see, we have received Christ's love,
[00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:32.980]   and so now we can share that love with the world.
[00:35:32.980 --> 00:35:34.980]   Like, we can continue the work
[00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:36.740]   of our first father and mother.
[00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:38.900]   We can cultivate the earth.
[00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:40.700]   We can take our classrooms,
[00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:42.380]   and we can make them into environments
[00:35:42.380 --> 00:35:44.220]   where children actually flourish.
[00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:46.420]   We can make our nursing rounds,
[00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:50.400]   and as we go, we can really carefully see the people
[00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:52.300]   that we're taking care of.
[00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:55.640]   We can hop on Zoom for that one-on-one or that team meeting,
[00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:56.900]   and we can make sure that there's time,
[00:35:56.900 --> 00:35:59.060]   not just for feedback, but for encouragement.
[00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:01.060]   We can organize our teams,
[00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:03.620]   and we can make sure that within our team environments,
[00:36:03.620 --> 00:36:05.540]   there's time for celebration as well.
[00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:09.100]   We want to be people who have received love and share love,
[00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:11.700]   who have experienced love and now express that love
[00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:14.720]   and bring forth flourishing into the rest of the world.
[00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:16.700]   This is what God's calling you into,
[00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:17.900]   and yet so many of us,
[00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:20.660]   we're waiting for that partner to come along into our lives
[00:36:20.660 --> 00:36:23.820]   so that way we can ultimately do what's fulfilling,
[00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:25.460]   feel fulfilled, and yet God's saying,
[00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:26.980]   "You don't have to wait for that.
[00:36:26.980 --> 00:36:28.940]   "You already have people around you
[00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:30.900]   "that can help you in that work."
[00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:34.340]   You see, you don't have to pair off with a person
[00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:35.820]   to feel fulfilled,
[00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:37.500]   because God has already united you
[00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:40.220]   into a purpose that is fulfilling.
[00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:41.940]   You tracking with that?
[00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:43.340]   That's his story.
[00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:46.340]   Like, the world was absent of love,
[00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:48.880]   and yet Christ came to give that love,
[00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:50.280]   not just so we could hoard that love
[00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:51.260]   but so that we could keep that love,
[00:36:51.260 --> 00:36:52.540]   but so that way we could extend that love,
[00:36:52.540 --> 00:36:55.060]   we could share it to other people.
[00:36:55.060 --> 00:36:57.580]   That way, they would feel meaningfully connected to us
[00:36:57.580 --> 00:36:59.140]   the same way we are to one another,
[00:36:59.140 --> 00:37:02.420]   and they could begin to be a part of the mission
[00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:05.160]   which we ourselves have been assigned to.
[00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:09.180]   Now, as I say all of that, here's the thing.
[00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:12.540]   I know some of you are here,
[00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:13.940]   and you're like, "Brother, I thought this was
[00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:15.140]   "a dating series.
[00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:21.260]   "This feels like a bait and switch."
[00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:25.120]   Like, I showed up expecting you to give me practical help
[00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:27.780]   on how to fix what's going on over here,
[00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:31.780]   or quick solutions so that way I could find someone special.
[00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:33.180]   This isn't what I thought it would be.
[00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:35.520]   And listen, I don't necessarily disagree with you,
[00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:38.260]   but I am somewhat discontent with this.
[00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:40.700]   Sure, meaningful connection with other people
[00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:41.940]   and not particularly with one only person,
[00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:43.620]   sure, I'm okay with that.
[00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:44.440]   Well, you know what, man?
[00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:45.280]   Yeah, you know what?
[00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:46.100]   It is crazy for me to think
[00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:47.660]   that one person will ever fulfill me.
[00:37:47.660 --> 00:37:49.220]   God probably has a purpose for my life
[00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:50.340]   that is going to be more fulfilling.
[00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:52.340]   I agree to that, but here's the thing, Kylan,
[00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:53.180]   before you move to this third one
[00:37:53.180 --> 00:37:54.780]   and you start talking to me about intimacy,
[00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:57.060]   what you need to realize is I don't just want that
[00:37:57.060 --> 00:38:00.400]   spiritually speaking, I want that romantically, please.
[00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:07.320]   God gets that, because that's where the passage ends.
[00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:10.920]   He's not diminishing your desire for love.
[00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:14.820]   You're longing for romance.
[00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:19.580]   As he continues, he actually shows you a picture of intimacy
[00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:25.640]   the likes of which we should all hope be true of our lives.
[00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:30.260]   We see it in Genesis 2, 24, 25.
[00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:32.300]   Like after God creates Eve,
[00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:36.180]   he brings her down the aisle of that very first wedding
[00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:40.240]   and he hands her over to the groom, Adam,
[00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:44.060]   and the wedding bells sound and they go on their merry way.
[00:38:44.060 --> 00:38:46.500]   And we read this,
[00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:48.340]   that a man shall leave his father and his mother
[00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:49.420]   and hold fast to his wife.
[00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:51.380]   That is romantic.
[00:38:51.380 --> 00:38:56.360]   And they shall become one flesh, more romantic.
[00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:58.020]   And the man and his wife were both naked
[00:38:58.020 --> 00:38:59.060]   and were not ashamed.
[00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:03.100]   That's about as intimate as it gets.
[00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:06.260]   They were naked and unashamed.
[00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:09.180]   What a beautiful picture.
[00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:13.260]   They're fully exposed to one another.
[00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:14.560]   They have nothing to hide.
[00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:18.220]   And they're fully embraced by the other.
[00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:20.780]   They have nothing to regret.
[00:39:20.780 --> 00:39:23.500]   Don't you want that?
[00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:28.540]   It lasts all about one page for this couple.
[00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:35.100]   They don't make it very far into the marriage
[00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:38.940]   before they realize that they're not enough.
[00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:42.340]   Perfect relationship.
[00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:45.660]   Perfect connection to each other.
[00:39:45.660 --> 00:39:48.340]   A perfect purpose to fulfill with one another.
[00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:50.620]   Perfect intimacy to enjoy together.
[00:39:50.620 --> 00:39:57.520]   And yet it ultimately falls to pieces around them.
[00:39:57.520 --> 00:39:59.460]   Why?
[00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:04.140]   Because they forgot God's love
[00:40:04.140 --> 00:40:08.280]   and they found self-love.
[00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:14.060]   And when they did, sin entered into the world
[00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:15.260]   and it broke everything.
[00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:19.820]   It took their connection and it shattered it.
[00:40:19.820 --> 00:40:23.860]   It took their purpose, all the fulfillment
[00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:27.020]   they were going to find, and it stole it.
[00:40:27.020 --> 00:40:30.060]   And it took their intimacy,
[00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:32.260]   that beautiful picture of what we just read,
[00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:34.820]   and they lost it.
[00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:44.100]   If we don't find a love with God,
[00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:49.440]   then we will not find a love like we want.
[00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:51.700]   We have to start with Him.
[00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:53.180]   That's where we have to begin.
[00:40:53.180 --> 00:40:55.760]   And that's why we've started here this evening.
[00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:58.420]   I remember years ago,
[00:40:58.420 --> 00:41:01.360]   when I was working in a different young adult ministry,
[00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:02.860]   we would have these prayer and worship nights,
[00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:04.740]   and there was one evening in specific
[00:41:04.740 --> 00:41:07.460]   where we looked at the room, a room of about 500 people,
[00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:10.220]   and we said, "Hey, we want you to just write down
[00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:11.900]   "whatever you need to confess to the Lord,
[00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:14.040]   "something you need to surrender to Him here tonight.
[00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:15.620]   "Maybe you haven't told Him, you can just write it down.
[00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:16.500]   "You don't have to say it out loud.
[00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:18.740]   "You can just say it to Him and you can leave it here
[00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:20.140]   "and you can actually move forward.
[00:41:20.140 --> 00:41:21.660]   "Maybe it's the first time of honest confession
[00:41:21.660 --> 00:41:22.500]   "in your life."
[00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:23.820]   And so we watched people write them down
[00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:24.860]   and leave these behind.
[00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:28.780]   And as we took them and we prayed and privately processed,
[00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:31.140]   what we found was heartbreaking,
[00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:35.420]   because what we saw written on these confession cards
[00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:41.420]   were sins of lost love, broken trust,
[00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:46.900]   lustful addiction, and hurting heart.
[00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:49.820]   And what was wild about it, so overwhelming to me,
[00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:54.500]   is it more than doubled the second most confessed sin
[00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:56.340]   that people left behind.
[00:41:56.340 --> 00:42:00.100]   People had been hurt in their pursuit of love.
[00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:05.140]   I don't want you to experience the same.
[00:42:05.140 --> 00:42:07.980]   The truth is, many of you have.
[00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:09.700]   The truth is, many of you will.
[00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:15.660]   And yet, if you want to find love, you must find God.
[00:42:15.660 --> 00:42:18.220]   You have to find Him yourself.
[00:42:18.220 --> 00:42:20.700]   And you gotta find somebody that's found Him too.
[00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:26.460]   We have to look for love where we forgot love.
[00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:27.540]   That's the final point.
[00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:29.860]   You find love where you forgot love.
[00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:33.180]   We forgot it.
[00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:36.140]   In that we forgot God, the giver of it.
[00:42:36.140 --> 00:42:38.940]   We left Him in the garden.
[00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:40.860]   We chose our own way.
[00:42:40.860 --> 00:42:45.820]   And as we forgot Him, we lost everything.
[00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:49.020]   And yet God, in His gracious kindness,
[00:42:49.020 --> 00:42:52.740]   He looks at us and says, "I'll come for you again."
[00:42:52.740 --> 00:42:57.300]   I know that this may not have been the start to the series
[00:42:57.300 --> 00:42:59.140]   that you were thinking it was gonna be,
[00:42:59.140 --> 00:43:02.100]   but it's the place that we need to be.
[00:43:03.100 --> 00:43:05.660]   We're gonna get to how to date and who to date
[00:43:05.660 --> 00:43:08.060]   and how to break up and how to move on.
[00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:10.580]   All of that stuff will come.
[00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:14.780]   And it will be easy if we get this right.
[00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:19.780]   We have to find love, and we find it by finding Him.
[00:43:19.780 --> 00:43:22.100]   And the reason we know that is because
[00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:24.980]   when we had forgotten about God before,
[00:43:24.980 --> 00:43:28.020]   God did not forget about us,
[00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:30.660]   in that He sent Christ to come get us.
[00:43:30.660 --> 00:43:34.900]   He sent our husband, our King, to come after us,
[00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:39.900]   to fight for us, to die for us, and to rise for us.
[00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:42.740]   So that way, we might not live a life
[00:43:42.740 --> 00:43:44.420]   where we're meaningfully disconnected,
[00:43:44.420 --> 00:43:48.740]   but meaningfully connected, both to Him and to one another.
[00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:50.620]   That we might step into a reality
[00:43:50.620 --> 00:43:53.420]   where our world is one filled with fulfillment
[00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:56.140]   because we live a life that is bigger than that of ourselves.
[00:43:56.140 --> 00:43:58.740]   We're racing towards the things of God instead.
[00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:04.940]   And because of Christ, we know that we can find love again
[00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:07.700]   because love has found us.
[00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:12.980]   Have you found Christ?
[00:44:12.980 --> 00:44:19.060]   If you do not, then the rest of this is useless.
[00:44:19.060 --> 00:44:25.420]   You have to begin with Him if you want to end with love.
[00:44:25.420 --> 00:44:29.700]   Let me pray that you would.
[00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:32.460]   God, thank you for tonight, for your word,
[00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:35.580]   and the sufficiency of it, the truth of it,
[00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:39.100]   the fact, God, that it meets us where we are,
[00:44:39.100 --> 00:44:42.540]   but it pushes us, God, where we need be.
[00:44:42.540 --> 00:44:45.620]   That's how gracious you are, Jesus.
[00:44:45.620 --> 00:44:49.460]   You're full of compassion that you meet us right here
[00:44:49.460 --> 00:44:54.460]   in whatever sort of circumstance we walked in with tonight.
[00:44:54.460 --> 00:44:56.620]   You're not disappointed, you're not angry,
[00:44:56.620 --> 00:44:58.020]   you're not mad nor upset.
[00:44:58.020 --> 00:45:00.100]   You see us where we are and in compassion,
[00:45:00.100 --> 00:45:02.540]   you stoop to meet us.
[00:45:02.540 --> 00:45:07.220]   And in your care, you take us from that place
[00:45:07.220 --> 00:45:09.180]   and into one that's better.
[00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:11.500]   You move us into your likeness.
[00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:13.820]   You lead us into your love.
[00:45:13.820 --> 00:45:16.140]   And so it's to you, Jesus, that we say,
[00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:17.420]   before we do anything else,
[00:45:17.420 --> 00:45:20.020]   before we actually pursue a relationship with someone else,
[00:45:20.020 --> 00:45:22.220]   we wanna pursue a relationship with you.
[00:45:22.220 --> 00:45:23.380]   We've gotta get this right
[00:45:23.380 --> 00:45:25.180]   if we're gonna get anything else right.
[00:45:25.180 --> 00:45:28.420]   And so, God, we humbly sit here and say,
[00:45:28.420 --> 00:45:32.420]   it's you that we want.
[00:45:32.420 --> 00:45:37.060]   We have found our love again.
[00:45:37.060 --> 00:45:41.140]   And it's to you that we worship.
[00:45:41.140 --> 00:45:46.100]   We're grateful, God, that in you we have all we need.
[00:45:46.100 --> 00:45:52.300]   And we're expecting, God, that in you we'll find more
[00:45:52.300 --> 00:45:53.940]   than we could ever want.
[00:45:53.940 --> 00:45:56.180]   It's in your name we pray, amen.
