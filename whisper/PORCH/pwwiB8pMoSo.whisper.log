[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.480]   All right, how we doing, Porch, tonight?
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.800]   Porch, Houston, Porch, Austin, Porch, Cincinnati, Porch,
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.560]   Northwest Arkansas, and welcome, of course,
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.720]   to my friends tonight here at Porch Dallas.
[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:41.840]   Let's do this.
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.000]   We are in night four of fortune telling,
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.800]   where if you haven't been tracking with us,
[00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.280]   we are not telling you your fortune.
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.240]   We cannot do that.
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.280]   But we are looking at words from the past,
[00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.360]   a.k.a. what we've said is God's word, the only reliable words,
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.040]   and what they have to say about your fortune or your future.
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.400]   Because there is only one person,
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.240]   one being who knows what your future holds,
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.080]   and his name is God.
[00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.080]   And that's who we're pointing you to tonight.
[00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.200]   So we sit around and we ask, hey,
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.480]   what do we think people would want to know right now?
[00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.040]   So before I get to tonight's question,
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.800]   like I do every week, just a little bit of public shaming,
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.480]   it was summer of 2013.
[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.440]   There I was with my best friends, my bros,
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.080]   staying in our college town,
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.240]   which if you've ever stayed in your college town
[00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.600]   during the summer, it is just such a dream.
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.520]   The place is empty, becomes a ghost town.
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.560]   I went to SFA, Axum Jacks,
[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.600]   and Nacogdoches doesn't have much to offer,
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.440]   but if you're with the right people, it's kind of a good time.
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.680]   So I'm in Nacogdoches, Texas.
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.640]   We are sitting there and a family from church said,
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.020]   hey, y'all can live up at our second story,
[00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.200]   make it a bachelor pad.
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.320]   There was a ping pong table.
[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.480]   The mom was like, I'll cook for y'all every single night,
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.000]   an East Texas home cooked meal.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.640]   We're like, score, this is amazing, rent-free,
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.720]   best summer ever, until it wasn't.
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.360]   It was Memorial Day, the first official day of summer.
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.680]   We all decide, let's go out to the lake, Lake Nacogdoches.
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.260]   And it was there and the nasty knack
[00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.660]   that we go tubing for a few hours.
[00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.280]   We get back to the lake house and this guy,
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.200]   I mean, he is such a character.
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.040]   He's like, I built me my own zip line,
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.160]   y'all see it up there?
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.320]   And I'm like, oh, that's nice.
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.040]   I want nothing to do with that.
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.600]   And he was like, y'all should give it a try.
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.880]   And they're like, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.280]   And I should let you know that my friends this summer
[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.480]   had to all be in town
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.960]   because they were all football players at SFA.
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.440]   I was the video guy for the team, that was my job.
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.200]   And so I'm not like them,
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.640]   but they're all like, yeah, this is awesome.
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.480]   But I want to tell you, this is like redneck one-on-one
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.960]   zip line, this is not strap in,
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.760]   like click, check, check, check, sending them,
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.320]   it's not that, it is handlebars on a cable.
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.800]   And at the bottom are three tennis balls
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.640]   and you go up about a 15 foot bank,
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.780]   shallow water, ground underneath,
[00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.140]   and then you climb a ladder.
[00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.680]   And when you get to the top of the ladder,
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.840]   the top step that it says, do not get on the top step,
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.320]   you get on that top step and then you grab the handlebars
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.040]   and then you are expected to hold on for dear life
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.040]   until you make contact with the tennis balls at the end.
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.400]   And then it propels you and sends you
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.960]   into the deep end of the water.
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.160]   Okay?
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.080]   So I'm sitting here and I'm like, that ain't me,
[00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.920]   I'm not doing that.
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.840]   I'm in the boat still and I'm like, you guys go.
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.240]   So the first guy goes, he's like, he's insane.
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.320]   He's like an Olympic trial athlete.
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:30.640]   And he gets up there and does like the thing
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.600]   where he's like, all right, knees up,
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.640]   like cowabunga dude at the end,
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.400]   back flips, lands it perfectly.
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.000]   Everyone's like, there's 10, you know,
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.720]   the whole of the car just say 10 on it.
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.920]   And then everyone looks around, they're like, that's awesome.
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.760]   Then they're like, JD should do it.
[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.240]   And all these guys are like, yeah, JD, get up there.
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.440]   And I'm like, oh my gosh, I have to prove myself.
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.280]   And so I'm getting up there, I'm sweating.
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.200]   Again, my arms are weak 'cause the three hours of tubing,
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.200]   just want to keep affirming that, that my arms were weak.
[00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.600]   And so, 'cause of the tubing.
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:03.600]   So I get up there, the climb is already terrifying enough.
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.800]   And then I grab, you know, they get this like stick
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.720]   and they bring the bars back up to you.
[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.140]   And the whole time the cable is like not working.
[00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.000]   And I grab it and I'm like, yeah.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.440]   And I'm looking down and I'm like,
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.240]   hey, I don't think I should do it.
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:21.120]   And they're all like, come on, you can do it, JD.
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.800]   The worst nightmare for a guy like me.
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.920]   And so they're all going, all eyes are on me.
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.780]   And in the middle of all the chanting,
[00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.520]   I hear the mom of the house scream,
[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.640]   hey JD, I thought God hasn't given us a spirit of fear.
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:39.840]   And I'm like, Geronimo.
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.120]   And I go off, but it wasn't like one of those cool,
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.440]   like go off, it was like one of those,
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.840]   like, you know, like you go off.
[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.360]   And let's just say I was not prepared, my arms lock.
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.840]   I let go, I fall 22 feet, land in a foot of water.
[00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.520]   Because remember, you're supposed to go out to the deep end.
[00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.280]   I go unconscious, the water wakes me up.
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.520]   And suddenly I am hearing screaming all around me.
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:02.440]   I'm like, what's going on?
[00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:03.480]   It's like a bomb went off.
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.740]   I looked down and my toes should be facing up like this.
[00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.160]   They were facing over there.
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.480]   And I'm like, is that my, you know, whatever.
[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:16.480]   So that happens on the first day
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.680]   of what was supposed to be the best summer of my life.
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.200]   I know, it's sad.
[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:24.440]   You don't always get your colored summers.
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.460]   And that day went from a very high to a very low.
[00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.560]   That was me.
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.880]   And that guy right there,
[00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.360]   he was faking it till he was making it.
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.320]   You can take that off, you can get off.
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.600]   'Cause that was a low, low.
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:44.560]   And what an unexpected tragedy that was.
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.520]   But I think a lot of us are like that guy.
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.200]   I think a lot of us go through life
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.640]   and something hits us unexpectedly.
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:54.200]   And we're walking in here tonight
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.960]   and there's so many different things represented.
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.040]   We have so many different backgrounds and stories
[00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.200]   and jobs and gifts and talents
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.760]   and all the things that uniquely make you.
[00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.320]   But one thing we all share in common
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.680]   is every person is walking in here tonight
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.940]   had experienced an unexpected tragedy.
[00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:13.240]   Having experienced something that hurt them,
[00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.800]   something that has seemed broken or off.
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.120]   You have had something in your life take place
[00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.980]   that man, that was so sad.
[00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:21.760]   And it was this storm in your life
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:23.080]   that you did not know what to do with.
[00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:25.340]   And I know all of you have experienced unexpected storms
[00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:27.480]   because look at last week.
[00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.440]   I mean, talk about an unexpected storm.
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.920]   And I think a lot of us are like that guy.
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:33.960]   We're walking here tonight and we're like, thumbs up.
[00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.160]   Foot is facing the other way.
[00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.820]   We're like, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm really fine.
[00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:39.040]   Although we're not fine.
[00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:43.820]   Because when things come in life that we don't expect
[00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:47.180]   and when we lose control, we start to freak out.
[00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:48.420]   We do not know what to do.
[00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:50.200]   We are not necessarily prepared.
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:53.500]   And I would be naive to think that a lot of you,
[00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:57.540]   even just with, I mean, literally what happened last week
[00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:58.980]   as I was sitting in this like,
[00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:01.380]   watching what started off as a fun snow day
[00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:03.780]   turned to so much devastation.
[00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:05.820]   And tonight, I bet some of you are still experiencing
[00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:07.700]   the ramifications of what took place.
[00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:09.560]   Some of you still may not be back in your home
[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:12.080]   or back in your office or back in your work.
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:13.700]   And you weren't ready for that.
[00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:15.740]   Texas sure as heck wasn't ready for that.
[00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:20.600]   And so that's why tonight we're answering the question,
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:22.820]   will this storm ever cease?
[00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:26.920]   Will this storm ever cease?
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:29.440]   Because last week I was sitting there alone asking,
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:32.960]   God, what do you want me to speak to your people tonight?
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.420]   And I was going down one path,
[00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:36.620]   but as I was sitting in the middle of this house
[00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:38.360]   with no water, my power is out of my house,
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:41.060]   I'm staying at a friend's house, I'm sitting there.
[00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:43.160]   I was like, man, what an unexpected storm.
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:48.080]   And I bet a lot of people coming out of 2020,
[00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:51.560]   coming into 2021, COVID still going on,
[00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:56.060]   mask still being worn, the Fort Worth pile up.
[00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:58.140]   I mean, talk about unexpected.
[00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:00.700]   That was just a normal day for those people.
[00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:03.820]   And as I sat there and watched the tragedy of those videos
[00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:05.600]   of trucks just piling and piling,
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.440]   those people were just going to work.
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:11.620]   And I bet they're asking,
[00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:13.540]   what do I do when the storm comes like this?
[00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:14.380]   That family was going,
[00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:16.460]   what do I do when this unexpected tragedy hits?
[00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:17.560]   What do we do?
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:21.740]   When pipes are bursting, when COVID cases are rising,
[00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:23.540]   will this storm ever cease?
[00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:26.660]   And so tonight I wanna look at God's word
[00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:28.400]   and see what it has to say to inform us
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:29.820]   about our storms in life.
[00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:33.900]   Because the reality is, this is important.
[00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:34.740]   This is why every single one of you
[00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:36.060]   need to lean in tonight.
[00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:39.780]   Take it from me, take it from God's word,
[00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:41.020]   take it from people here.
[00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:43.420]   You are either walking into a storm,
[00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:46.580]   you're walking through a storm,
[00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:48.600]   or someone is coming out of a storm.
[00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:52.120]   But storms will be a part of your life.
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:53.940]   How do I know that?
[00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:58.100]   God's word says in John 16, 33,
[00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:02.380]   in this world, you will have trouble.
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.160]   Second Timothy 3, 12 says,
[00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.840]   "Indeed, all who desire to live a godly life
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:11.400]   in Christ Jesus will be persecuted."
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:16.400]   Key word there, will, not maybe, not if, will.
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:19.240]   Will be persecuted.
[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:21.040]   They will have trouble.
[00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:22.360]   Why?
[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:24.920]   If God is the all knowing God, the sovereign God,
[00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:26.040]   the God who's in control,
[00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:28.280]   why does he allow storms to come in our life?
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:34.360]   Sin, the moment that it entered into our world
[00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:35.680]   in the beginning of the Bible,
[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:38.560]   sin came, destruction followed,
[00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:40.120]   brokenness came.
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:41.240]   The storms in your life,
[00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:44.220]   the things that we see are a result of man,
[00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:46.000]   what we call man's depravity,
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.400]   or the fall of man.
[00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:49.320]   And ever since that original sin
[00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:51.560]   in the Garden of Eden at the beginning of your Bible,
[00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:54.840]   we have just watched more and more and more storms come
[00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:55.660]   because God's like,
[00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:58.400]   "This is what happens when you don't choose me.
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:00.840]   This is what happens when you choose yourself,
[00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:02.120]   when you choose your flesh,
[00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:04.060]   you're gonna experience trouble."
[00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:07.920]   And more and more storms are gonna come.
[00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:10.480]   So just to start off right off the bat,
[00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:13.460]   what, will this storm ever cease?
[00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:16.060]   If right now each of you could come to me and go,
[00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:18.080]   "Hey, here's the storm I'm walking through currently,
[00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:19.920]   when do you think it will end?
[00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.080]   I experienced a breakup,
[00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:23.760]   when will the heartbreak stop?
[00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:28.160]   Or, hey, my friend got cancer and then ended up dying,
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:29.720]   like when will that pain go away?
[00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:31.340]   When will this storm cease?"
[00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:34.140]   And I just wanna start off the bat giving you the answer.
[00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:36.240]   The answer is,
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:39.000]   I'm not gonna give you an emotionally satisfying answer
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.240]   because I don't know.
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:46.320]   I don't know, I'm searching God's word
[00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:51.200]   and I don't know on this earth when your storm will cease.
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:54.760]   Tonight, I'm not giving you a yes or no answer.
[00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:57.800]   I can tell you that Revelation 21 verse four
[00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:00.920]   talks about the hope we have in Jesus and his return
[00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:03.600]   when he comes back to claim his church, you and I,
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.840]   where he says, "On that day when Jesus returns,
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:08.040]   there'll be no more weeping, no more mourning,
[00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:10.560]   no more pain, no more sickness,
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:12.400]   and we will be in heaven, we will be in perfection."
[00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:15.260]   And that is our hope, that is what we are striving for,
[00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:16.660]   that is what we are looking to,
[00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:19.080]   that is how we get through the storms that we currently face.
[00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:22.760]   But I don't know on earth when your storm will end.
[00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:24.880]   And God's word does not say,
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:27.520]   "Hey, this is when your storm will end."
[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:30.520]   But what it is full of,
[00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:36.440]   full of is guidance, wisdom principles,
[00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:40.720]   and a lot of ways that shows you God's heart for you
[00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:42.040]   in the midst of your storm
[00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:44.200]   and how you can get through your storm.
[00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:47.480]   So tonight I'm redirecting the question,
[00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:49.360]   will this storm ever cease?
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:51.760]   And I know you want the answer.
[00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:53.240]   I know some of you tonight are like,
[00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:56.400]   "Man, I just wanna know, this has to end,
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:58.440]   this has to let up.
[00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:00.480]   Will this pandemic ever end?
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.920]   I wanna see the light at the end of the tunnel."
[00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:06.200]   And I'm redirecting that question
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:07.880]   to not when will the storm end,
[00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:10.960]   but rather how can we weather the storm?
[00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:16.160]   When the storms in life come, how can we weather the storm?
[00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:19.040]   And I wanna do that through looking at a story
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:20.120]   in the book of Matthew,
[00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:22.360]   a story that I have read many times,
[00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:24.320]   and maybe you have, you've heard about,
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:27.760]   about a disciple who experienced a storm.
[00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:32.760]   In chapter 14, we're gonna see the heart of Jesus for you
[00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:36.600]   in the midst of your storm, starting in verse 22.
[00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:37.440]   Here we go.
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:43.040]   "Immediately he made the disciples get into the boat
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:45.400]   and go before him to the other side,
[00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:47.760]   while he," being Jesus, "dismissed the crowds."
[00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:49.960]   He had just fed the 5,000 people
[00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:52.200]   with the fish and the loaves.
[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:53.880]   "And after he dismissed the crowds,
[00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:56.400]   he went up to the mountain by himself to pray."
[00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:01.160]   So Jesus is up on this mountain, praying by himself to God,
[00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:02.280]   and he sends the disciples.
[00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:03.120]   Normally he goes with them,
[00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:06.160]   but he sends them off to cross the sea on a ship.
[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:10.280]   "And when evening came, he was there alone,
[00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:13.400]   but the boat by this time was a long way from the land,
[00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:17.000]   beaten by the waves, for the wind was against them.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.960]   And in the fourth watch of the night,"
[00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:21.060]   which is about somewhere between three and 6 a.m.,
[00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:22.400]   very dark, very early,
[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:26.040]   "he came to them walking on the sea," casual.
[00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:29.880]   "But when the disciples saw him walking on the sea,
[00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:32.720]   they were terrified and they said, 'It is a ghost!'
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:34.040]   And they cried out in fear.
[00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:36.440]   But immediately Jesus spoke to them saying,
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:40.440]   'Take heart, it is I. Do not be afraid.'"
[00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:42.480]   And Peter, and I love Peter.
[00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:45.360]   Every interaction with Peter in the books of the Bible,
[00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:47.400]   I'm just like, I love Peter, he's my guy.
[00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:51.080]   "But Peter answered him, 'Lord, if it is you,
[00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:54.160]   command me to come to you on the water.'
[00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:57.740]   And he said, 'Come.'
[00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:00.660]   So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water
[00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:01.560]   and came to Jesus.
[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:04.720]   But when he saw the wind, he was afraid and began to sink.
[00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:06.240]   He cried out, 'Lord, save me!'
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:08.440]   And Jesus immediately reached out his hand
[00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:10.140]   and took hold of him saying to him,
[00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:12.680]   'Oh, you of little faith, why did you doubt?'
[00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:15.720]   And when they got into the boat, the wind ceased.
[00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:17.600]   And those in the boat worshiped him saying,
[00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:20.200]   'Truly you are the son of God.'"
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:22.680]   So number one, how do we weather the storm?
[00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:25.560]   Know who is in control of the storm.
[00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:28.840]   Know who is in control of the storm.
[00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:30.200]   I want you to look at this part of the story.
[00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:32.920]   We're gonna just try to dissect it and go piece by piece.
[00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:34.400]   But when the disciples, in verse 26,
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:37.140]   "When the disciples saw him walking on the sea,
[00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:40.000]   they were terrified and said, 'It is a ghost.'"
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   At this point, they don't know,
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.880]   they can't see through the fog who's walking towards them.
[00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:44.640]   They just see a figure like you and I,
[00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:46.720]   if I saw someone walking on the sea, I'd be like,
[00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.500]   hold up, y'all see that?
[00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:50.120]   There's this figure walking towards them on the sea
[00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:51.360]   and they say, "It is a ghost."
[00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:52.600]   And they cried out in fear,
[00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:54.480]   but immediately Jesus spoke to them saying,
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:57.800]   "Take heart, it is I, do not be afraid."
[00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:59.300]   And Peter answered him,
[00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:00.560]   "Lord, if it is you,
[00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:02.480]   command me to come to you on the water."
[00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:04.000]   And he said, "Come."
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.200]   So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water
[00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:08.520]   and came to Jesus.
[00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:10.560]   I mean, can you imagine this moment?
[00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:13.040]   Winds are picking up, waves are crashing.
[00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:14.220]   They cannot see ahead of them.
[00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:16.100]   It is three to six in the morning
[00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:19.900]   and suddenly a man is walking on water
[00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:20.860]   towards them.
[00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:26.200]   And Jesus says, "Hey, it's I, do not be afraid."
[00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:27.680]   First off, I want you to notice something.
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:31.160]   He did not say, "It is I, Jesus, do not be afraid."
[00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:33.800]   He just said, "It is I, do not be afraid."
[00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:37.080]   I would be like, "Excuse me, who are you?
[00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:39.000]   'Cause I can't see you."
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.480]   And they're kind of just like, Peter's just assumed.
[00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:43.960]   He's like, "Lord, if it's you, command me to come out."
[00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:45.840]   And I'm like, "Peter, I would need a little more than that.
[00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:46.980]   I'm about to jump into the sea like that.
[00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:48.640]   I need a little more assurance, it's Jesus."
[00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:50.740]   But that's the point I wanted to tell you.
[00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:53.620]   Why was Peter so confident?
[00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:57.060]   How did Peter know it was Jesus?
[00:15:57.060 --> 00:15:59.220]   'Cause Jesus never explicitly says,
[00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:02.360]   "It is I, Jesus, do not be afraid."
[00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:09.400]   It's because Peter knew Jesus.
[00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:14.100]   Peter had been with Jesus.
[00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:16.580]   Peter had seen Jesus move in his life.
[00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:19.740]   Peter had seen Jesus perform miracles.
[00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:22.560]   Peter had just seen Jesus feed 5,000 people.
[00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:25.520]   Peter knew the power that Jesus possessed.
[00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:27.620]   Peter saw Jesus as Lord.
[00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:30.980]   Peter had a right view of Jesus.
[00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:33.340]   Peter saw Jesus as in control.
[00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:34.220]   How do I know that?
[00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:35.780]   Look what he says.
[00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:39.680]   "Lord, if it is you, command me."
[00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:45.220]   Don't ask me, "Command me to come to you on the water."
[00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:47.660]   And the Lord simply said, "Come."
[00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:51.640]   And we see Peter get out of the boat.
[00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:56.480]   What courage that must have taken.
[00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:59.140]   We've all jumped into a body of water before.
[00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:00.940]   We know what it feels like to jump into a pool
[00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:03.180]   and fill the water, go all around us
[00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:04.100]   and form around our body,
[00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:05.780]   'cause that's what water does, it's not solid.
[00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:07.900]   Imagine what it must have been like.
[00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:10.580]   Like, was Peter like this?
[00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:11.700]   Did he jump?
[00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:12.820]   Did the disciples hold his arm?
[00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:13.780]   Did he lean?
[00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:15.720]   Like, I think I would have been more like one of these,
[00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:17.120]   you know, like feeling it.
[00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:24.100]   But something, something gave him the courage
[00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:27.740]   to step out of that boat and onto those waves.
[00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:30.780]   And there's only one answer.
[00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:34.420]   He knew who was in control of those waves.
[00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:35.980]   He knew Jesus.
[00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:38.940]   And Jesus didn't even have to say clearly, "It is I,"
[00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:41.340]   because Peter knew the sound of his voice.
[00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:43.680]   Because Peter had been with him,
[00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:45.080]   he recognized him.
[00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:47.380]   He trusted him.
[00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:50.080]   I was just thinking during worship,
[00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:52.820]   it was like when my dad would lose me and my brother,
[00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:55.260]   like say we're at a fair or, that sounds like a bad dad.
[00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:56.240]   When my dad would like, you know,
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:57.780]   let us go off in the distance,
[00:17:57.780 --> 00:17:59.900]   and when we were getting too far,
[00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:01.220]   he had this like, I don't know if it's like
[00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:02.380]   an East Texas thing, but like,
[00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:04.300]   he would like whistle with both his fingers in his mouth.
[00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:05.420]   I can't do it.
[00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:09.220]   But it was so loud in the midst of all of these people,
[00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:11.860]   I would somehow hear it immediately stop like a lab
[00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:12.720]   and turn around.
[00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:14.700]   And he loved it.
[00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:16.780]   He was like, you know,
[00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:19.180]   he loved it.
[00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:22.580]   Because he loved kind of having this thing with his sons
[00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:23.780]   or it was like our thing, like,
[00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:25.660]   hey, if you're getting too far off,
[00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:28.120]   hear the sound of my whistle, come back.
[00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:29.660]   I didn't have to question.
[00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:31.380]   I didn't think, oh, there's some other dad out there
[00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:32.620]   who knows how to whistle like that.
[00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:34.580]   I'm like, that's my dad.
[00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:36.100]   That is my dad's whistle.
[00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:39.220]   And I better turn around and get back to him.
[00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:40.420]   'Cause I knew my dad.
[00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:42.720]   I knew his call.
[00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:48.980]   The same way Peter knew who was in control.
[00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:50.240]   He knew his Jesus.
[00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:51.320]   He knew his friend.
[00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:52.600]   He knew his Lord.
[00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:55.520]   And when you know Jesus,
[00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:59.880]   when you see Jesus as in control of the storm around you,
[00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:01.400]   you start to have a different response
[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:02.820]   to the storms in your life.
[00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:05.880]   Because no longer are the storms
[00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:08.040]   dictating your view of Jesus.
[00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:10.700]   Jesus is dictating your view of your storms.
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:14.380]   And when Jesus dictates the view of your storms,
[00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:16.460]   your response to the storms in your life
[00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:17.600]   start to look a lot different.
[00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:19.580]   No more are you sitting back on your heels going,
[00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:20.940]   I hope the next thing doesn't hit.
[00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:22.580]   Oh my gosh, what if something else happens?
[00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:24.600]   What if this pandemic just keeps on going and going?
[00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:26.140]   What if another snow storm hits?
[00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:28.100]   Oh my gosh, what if I get cancer?
[00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:29.140]   Or what if something happens to me?
[00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:30.260]   Or what if, what if, what if?
[00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:31.240]   You don't have to live like that
[00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:33.580]   because you know who's in control of the storm.
[00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:37.300]   You don't have to sit back in the boat and hide and say,
[00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:39.260]   oh my gosh, I'm afraid, I'm afraid.
[00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:40.420]   It's a ghost, it's a ghost.
[00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:41.300]   So much is happening.
[00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:42.780]   Why is there a ghost walking on the water?
[00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:43.860]   What is going on?
[00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:44.860]   It is too early for this.
[00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:45.680]   You're not like that.
[00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:48.980]   You're like, Lord, if it's you, command me out.
[00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:50.900]   And if it's really you, I'm coming.
[00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:57.300]   Peter was willing to step out of the boat
[00:19:57.300 --> 00:19:59.700]   because he knew who was in control of the storm.
[00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:03.140]   Psalm 34, 19 says,
[00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:05.500]   "Many are the afflictions of the righteous,
[00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:09.540]   "but the Lord delivers him out of them all."
[00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:12.300]   Many are the afflictions, many are the storms,
[00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:13.980]   many are the persecuting things,
[00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:15.620]   many are the sufferings that we face,
[00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:16.740]   the trials that we face.
[00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:17.660]   They are many.
[00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:19.180]   This world is very, very broken.
[00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:20.260]   I don't need to remind you of that.
[00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:21.580]   You can see it everywhere,
[00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:24.540]   but the Lord delivers him out of them all.
[00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:26.140]   Peter was like, sink or swim,
[00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:27.900]   if it's you, Lord, and you call me out,
[00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:30.580]   I'm going because I know you're in control.
[00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:34.140]   How?
[00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:37.820]   How could he know?
[00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:42.860]   How, I mean, how can he know that he knows
[00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:45.780]   that he knows that Jesus will show up?
[00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:48.780]   That he'll actually be able to walk on water?
[00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:50.860]   How can we know that in the storms of life,
[00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:52.740]   Jesus will actually show up?
[00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:56.780]   Maybe because something happened to you
[00:20:56.780 --> 00:21:00.580]   and you prayed and prayed and prayed,
[00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:03.220]   like, God, would you take away that sickness?
[00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:04.940]   Or God, would you heal them from the cancer?
[00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:06.620]   Or God, would you show up in this way?
[00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:07.740]   And you prayed and prayed and prayed
[00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:10.100]   and he didn't seem to show up in your life,
[00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:13.020]   so you don't know how to trust him anymore.
[00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:16.420]   Or maybe you went through something really, really hard,
[00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:18.180]   right after you surrendered your life to Christ,
[00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:19.340]   and started doing the whole God thing,
[00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:20.780]   maybe you went through an extreme breakup
[00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:21.860]   or you lost a lot of friends,
[00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:22.700]   and you're like, man,
[00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:24.260]   if this is what looking like to follow Jesus,
[00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:25.420]   I don't want any part of it.
[00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:26.340]   Jesus doesn't show up.
[00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:27.180]   He leaves you there.
[00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:28.540]   He drowns you.
[00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:30.240]   I'm not stepping out of that boat.
[00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:34.980]   How did Peter know?
[00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:37.740]   (pages rustling)
[00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:42.780]   The answer is Peter had faith.
[00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:44.740]   I wanna talk for a second about faith.
[00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:47.900]   'Cause I think there are so many questions
[00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:50.220]   that hold us back from seeing
[00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:53.040]   that Jesus is in control of the storm.
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:54.180]   We want to take control
[00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:57.420]   because we don't actually know the Jesus who's in control.
[00:21:57.420 --> 00:21:59.420]   And what about this?
[00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:00.900]   And what if I don't make enough money?
[00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:02.140]   I have to pick the right job
[00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:04.180]   and I have to find the right person.
[00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:05.980]   I have to find the one because this and that,
[00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:07.100]   and then I have to get the house,
[00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:08.360]   and then I wanna have security,
[00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:09.900]   and then this and that, and the 401k.
[00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:10.860]   And what if, what if, what if,
[00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:11.700]   take control, K through 12?
[00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:13.140]   'Cause I don't really actually know
[00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:15.740]   that the Jesus that's in control.
[00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:19.300]   I don't know what it's like to have faith.
[00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:20.880]   Therefore I operate in fear.
[00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:23.380]   So what is faith?
[00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:25.920]   Because I think faith is the answer
[00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:28.780]   that allowed Peter to step out of that boat.
[00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:31.620]   And here's what Hebrews says, Hebrews 11, one.
[00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:35.300]   "Now faith is confidence in what we hope for
[00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:39.580]   and assurance about what we do not see."
[00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:44.100]   Peter could not clearly see Jesus.
[00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:46.640]   Therefore it required this thing called faith
[00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:49.660]   to step out of the boat and respond to the call on his life.
[00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:52.700]   In the same way, when the waves are crashing in your life,
[00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:54.300]   when the unexpected takes place,
[00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:56.020]   when the storm takes place in your life,
[00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:58.860]   you may not be able to clearly see what Jesus is doing,
[00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:01.900]   but that's where faith gets to intersect with your reality.
[00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:04.980]   And a person of great faith is a person of great action.
[00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:07.100]   They say, "I'm coming out because I have faith
[00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:08.620]   that you are who you say you are."
[00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:10.640]   And Jesus, if it's you, you,
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:11.980]   the one who's in control of this storm,
[00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:13.620]   if it's you calling me out of this boat,
[00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:16.180]   I will come every single time
[00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:19.700]   because faith is the assurance of what we hope for.
[00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:21.580]   We place all of our hope in you, Jesus,
[00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:22.740]   the one who's in control.
[00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:25.920]   And it's the assurance of the things that we do not see.
[00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:30.040]   Therefore, I do not focus on the things that I can see.
[00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:33.100]   The storm raging around me, my circumstances,
[00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:34.780]   all of those hard things that you're going through,
[00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:36.000]   we can't focus on that.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.820]   We have to focus and place our faith and hope in Jesus
[00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:41.680]   'cause he's the only one who can get us through.
[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:43.280]   If you try to step out of that boat
[00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:44.840]   and onto your storm with anything else,
[00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:46.020]   you are sure to sink.
[00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:48.780]   You can't do it.
[00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:50.320]   No money can do it for you.
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:51.680]   No job can do it for you.
[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:53.300]   No person can do it for you.
[00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:55.140]   You will sink eventually.
[00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:59.420]   The only thing that can allow you to walk on water
[00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:01.060]   in the midst of your storm
[00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:04.540]   is to know the one who's in control and it's Jesus.
[00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:05.780]   And I want to wrap up this point with saying,
[00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:07.080]   I think a lot of us,
[00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:11.140]   what holds us back, we get to the boat,
[00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:13.460]   we see the storm and we see, we're like, okay,
[00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:15.380]   is that Jesus?
[00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:16.940]   Is that Jesus in the middle of the storm?
[00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:17.860]   Can I really trust him?
[00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:19.580]   Can I really step out and be with Jesus
[00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:20.980]   in this really hard thing?
[00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:22.760]   'Cause it's really, really hard.
[00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:25.700]   Is he really gonna show up?
[00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:30.540]   And I think a lot of us are actually afraid to ask Jesus,
[00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:31.600]   hey, if it's you,
[00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:33.660]   command me to come out of the boat and walk to you
[00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:36.420]   because we are afraid that he might actually say, come.
[00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:41.340]   He might actually ask you to do it.
[00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:44.540]   A lot of us want the storm.
[00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:47.280]   We don't want Jesus to tell us to come to him in the storm.
[00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:50.260]   We want Jesus to just to get rid of the storm.
[00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:51.080]   And that tells me,
[00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:54.720]   if you just want Jesus to get rid of the storm,
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:56.220]   you don't wanna be with Jesus in the storm,
[00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:57.560]   you have a wrong view of the storm
[00:24:57.560 --> 00:24:59.200]   because Jesus is in control of it
[00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:00.640]   and wants to use it in your life.
[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:03.080]   He uses storms for a greater purpose.
[00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:06.000]   He uses that really hard thing for a greater purpose.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.560]   He's just wanting you to come.
[00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:09.520]   You have to get out of the boat
[00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:10.400]   if you're gonna see the way
[00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:12.240]   that he wants to use that storm in your life.
[00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:14.240]   If you wanna walk on water in faith,
[00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:17.080]   you have to be willing to get out of the boat of comfort,
[00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:21.500]   the boat of fear, the boat of anxiety.
[00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:24.480]   You have to step out and say, if it's you, tell me to come.
[00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:26.440]   And when he says, come, you have to go.
[00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:29.960]   If you wanna see a great work,
[00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:32.640]   if you wanna see Jesus move in your life,
[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:34.880]   you have to be willing to get out of the boat.
[00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:37.440]   And I think a lot of us are afraid.
[00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:41.720]   He might call you to give up that addiction in faith.
[00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:45.840]   He might call you to break up with that person in faith.
[00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:47.640]   He might call you to stay in that storm
[00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:48.520]   and that really hard thing
[00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:50.900]   to have a greater dependency on him in faith.
[00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:56.680]   He might call you to move somewhere or to quit that job
[00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:59.000]   or to join a church and become a member.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.320]   He might call you to do that thing.
[00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:02.580]   So a lot of us sit back and we're like,
[00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:04.560]   I think I'm okay in the boat.
[00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:06.460]   Even if that's Jesus, I don't want him
[00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:09.520]   because you're afraid of the cost.
[00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:13.240]   You're afraid of what he'll do with you in that storm.
[00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:15.680]   You're afraid that he might actually say, come,
[00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:17.760]   step into the storm and I am with you
[00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:22.020]   because we don't actually know the Jesus who's in control.
[00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:26.540]   But if you would trust,
[00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:29.520]   if you would put your faith in that Jesus
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:33.080]   and say, sink or swim, I'm coming, watch what he will do.
[00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:34.760]   You will walk on the water.
[00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:37.680]   You will see him move.
[00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:41.280]   Your pain will start to turn to a greater purpose.
[00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:42.800]   He works all things for good
[00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:45.260]   for those who are called according to his purpose.
[00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:47.840]   That's what he does, that's who he is,
[00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:50.280]   but he needs you to move in faith,
[00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:53.800]   to trust him, to see that he is in control
[00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:55.060]   and watch what he'll do.
[00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:58.100]   Thank you.
[00:26:58.100 --> 00:27:01.600]   Which leads me to point two.
[00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:05.940]   When you step out in faith,
[00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:07.100]   when you start to walk on water,
[00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:09.720]   it does not mean that the storm will cease.
[00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:11.420]   It does not mean that the storms of life will stop.
[00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:12.640]   He does not promise you that.
[00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:14.000]   "The storms did not stop for Peter,"
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.280]   'cause what we see next in the chapter.
[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:16.640]   "How to weather the storm," number two,
[00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:19.600]   "Keep your eyes on Jesus, not on the storm."
[00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:21.640]   Keep your eyes on Jesus.
[00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:23.300]   Don't just see Jesus and then come,
[00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:24.940]   but keep your eyes on Jesus
[00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:26.480]   and do not focus on the storm.
[00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:28.760]   Verse 30, "But when he saw the wind,
[00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:31.280]   he was afraid and beginning to sink,
[00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:33.320]   he cried out, 'Lord, save me!'
[00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:35.560]   And Jesus immediately reached out his hand
[00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:37.360]   and took hold of him, saying to him,
[00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:40.240]   'Oh, you of little faith, why did you doubt?'
[00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:42.080]   Or, 'Why did you fear?'"
[00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:43.840]   And I want you to notice something key here.
[00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:46.920]   It says, "But when he saw the wind,
[00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:52.800]   he was then afraid, and then he began to sink."
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:54.280]   Part of the reason why you feel like
[00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:56.320]   your storms are overbearing
[00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:57.440]   and that you'll never see the end
[00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:00.720]   and you feel like you're drowning in the pit of despair
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:02.880]   and that you are enslaved to something
[00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:05.060]   and you have no control, you see no light,
[00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:07.280]   you are just drowning further and sinking deeper
[00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:09.400]   and deeper and deeper,
[00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:13.720]   is because at some point, you forgot who was in control
[00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:17.760]   and you got back in the driver's seat of your life.
[00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:20.280]   And like I said, it never works.
[00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:23.060]   And at some point, something happened to you.
[00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:27.240]   That old person popped back up in your DMs,
[00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:28.560]   took your eyes off Jesus,
[00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:32.860]   looked at them, sinks.
[00:28:32.860 --> 00:28:37.480]   At some point, you lost your job unexpectedly.
[00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:39.480]   What was once a thriving and abiding relationship with Jesus
[00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:41.280]   suddenly, I don't think Jesus is very good.
[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:44.080]   Eyes off Jesus, you begin to sink.
[00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:45.580]   It doesn't happen overnight.
[00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:51.720]   But at some point, you stopped seeing Jesus as in control
[00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:53.240]   and you took your eyes off Jesus
[00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:55.320]   and you gave control to something else in your life
[00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:58.500]   and the result is that you have been drowning ever since.
[00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:02.280]   You can't just have this aha moment of faith
[00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:04.200]   and one day pray a sinner's prayer and be like,
[00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:06.440]   "Okay, I'm stepping out in faith."
[00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:08.400]   And then walk and walk and then just fall off
[00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:10.600]   and go back into your world, you will sink.
[00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:16.420]   And so how do we remain in this posture with Jesus?
[00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:20.940]   John 15, five would say, do this.
[00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:25.680]   I am the vine, you are the branches.
[00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:27.720]   Whoever abides in me and I in him,
[00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:29.820]   he it is that bears much fruit.
[00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:34.280]   For apart from me, you can do nothing.
[00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:37.240]   Apart from me, you can do nothing.
[00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:40.680]   I remember when I first became a Christian
[00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:42.080]   after my freshman year of college,
[00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:44.560]   I was on this mountain high, stepping out of the boat,
[00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:46.400]   walking on water experience
[00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:48.360]   and then some waves started to go in my life
[00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:49.400]   and I was like, "Wait, wait, wait,
[00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:51.880]   I thought following God meant #blessed,
[00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:55.000]   love, peace, mercy, freedom, all this crap.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:55.960]   Why is this still happening?
[00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:58.240]   'Cause boom, God called me to change my major,
[00:29:58.240 --> 00:29:59.320]   lost my scholarship.
[00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:01.600]   Boom, girlfriend of two years, we got to break up.
[00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:03.200]   Boom, dad gets terminal cancer.
[00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:06.680]   Boom, boom, boom, storm, wave, wave, wave.
[00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:08.160]   And at some point I began to think,
[00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:10.480]   "You know what, God, you're clearly not in control
[00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:12.600]   of my life, therefore I'm taking back the reins
[00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:13.440]   of my own life."
[00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:16.900]   And I began to sink and drown and drown and drown.
[00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:20.000]   'Cause at some point I believed
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.520]   that he was no longer in control,
[00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:23.640]   but you have to keep the faith.
[00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:27.120]   The same faith that called you out of the boat
[00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:29.320]   is the same faith that keeps you above the water
[00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:32.680]   because that faith is fixed on Jesus.
[00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:35.520]   It does not look to the left or to the right,
[00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:37.040]   it looks at Jesus.
[00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:39.040]   And so how do we do that?
[00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:41.300]   It looks like daily abiding.
[00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:46.300]   If you abide in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit.
[00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:49.380]   But apart from me, when you look away from me,
[00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:52.040]   you can do nothing, you're sure to sink.
[00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:55.480]   And so guys, we say this all the time, but I forget it.
[00:30:55.480 --> 00:31:01.320]   Abiding daily with Christ, waking up, praying.
[00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:03.240]   Don't go to social media and scroll, scroll, scroll
[00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:04.480]   and start to fill your mind with comparison
[00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:05.320]   and all that junk.
[00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:08.480]   Wake up, pray, begin to open up God's word
[00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:11.560]   and daily read it, learn from it,
[00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:13.920]   be around God's people, abiding and talking
[00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:15.960]   about the things of God.
[00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:18.520]   Ask yourself right now, just do a self-examination.
[00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:20.980]   Where are my eyes?
[00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:23.960]   Where am I abiding?
[00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:25.600]   Am I walked in?
[00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:27.320]   Am I on mission?
[00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:28.640]   Am I doing the things of Christ?
[00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:32.360]   Does my life bear the fruit and the aroma of Christ?
[00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:36.920]   Or does it look like you're drowning?
[00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:38.520]   Do you feel like you're sinking?
[00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:43.880]   At what point, at what point did you believe
[00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:45.560]   that he was no longer in control?
[00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:49.160]   At what point did you believe that you no longer needed him?
[00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:52.080]   Because I think a lot of times we start to walk on water,
[00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:53.980]   we start to feel ourself like Beyonce.
[00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:58.600]   We're walking out, we're like, look at me.
[00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:00.960]   A man of faith, I've got this.
[00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:05.280]   And then boom, boom, boom, unexpected pregnancy, boom.
[00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:07.920]   Lost my job, boom.
[00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:09.460]   Parents divorce, boom.
[00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:12.080]   That ex popped back up, boom.
[00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:13.200]   That person broke up with me.
[00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:15.600]   Storm, storm, storm.
[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:17.640]   Oh gosh, this isn't what I signed up for.
[00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:22.100]   Back to my old ways, sink, sink, sink.
[00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:24.480]   And you might need to be here tonight to hear this.
[00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:27.200]   You have been drowning and trying to hold yourself
[00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:29.000]   above water for far too long.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:33.980]   And it's time to remember the same Jesus
[00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:35.840]   who called you out of the boat
[00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:37.560]   and into a relationship with him
[00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:40.760]   is the same Jesus who was with you in the storm
[00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:42.100]   and he wants you back.
[00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:44.760]   But you gotta abide with him.
[00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:46.740]   You gotta keep your eyes fixed on him.
[00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:53.560]   When following Christ, we are called to gaze at Jesus
[00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:54.940]   and glance at our storms.
[00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:57.260]   You don't have to act like they're not there.
[00:32:57.260 --> 00:32:59.020]   You can look at him and say, Jesus, I'm trusting you.
[00:32:59.020 --> 00:33:00.340]   You see the waves and the winds picking up,
[00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:01.260]   I'm trusting you.
[00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:07.020]   But where we get in trouble is when the storms come in life,
[00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:09.640]   we start to gaze at our storms and glance at Jesus.
[00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:13.140]   Okay, yeah, I'll read a Devo every now and then,
[00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:15.140]   but let me go focus on this over here at my own agenda now.
[00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:15.980]   I'm in control again.
[00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:17.440]   Okay, yeah, I'll pray or I'll go to the porch
[00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:19.160]   every now and then.
[00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:20.000]   That's not it.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.340]   You gotta keep your eyes on Jesus.
[00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:25.980]   That's how you weather the storm.
[00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:28.200]   And I'll wrap up with this.
[00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:32.400]   The beauty of this story is that we are the Peter.
[00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:37.540]   We are the men and women who at one point,
[00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:38.660]   and maybe this isn't you tonight,
[00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:40.500]   but at one point, you might've been the disciples
[00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:41.440]   who stayed back on the ship,
[00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:44.300]   but at one point, a lot of us in here tonight
[00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:46.060]   said I'm making that step of faith.
[00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:49.980]   But the reality is, is every single one of us tonight
[00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:51.940]   at one point have taken our eyes off Jesus.
[00:33:51.940 --> 00:33:55.060]   And you will again take your eyes off Jesus
[00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:57.780]   and you will sink and you will get it wrong
[00:33:57.780 --> 00:34:00.340]   because you're sinful.
[00:34:00.340 --> 00:34:03.540]   I'm gonna get it wrong because I'm sinful.
[00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:06.780]   But the story does not end here.
[00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:07.940]   Let's finish the story.
[00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:13.440]   But when Peter saw the wind,
[00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:16.820]   he was afraid and began to sink.
[00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:18.860]   He cried out, "Lord, save me."
[00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:20.860]   And Jesus immediately reached out his hand
[00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:23.100]   and took hold of him saying,
[00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:26.940]   "Oh, you of little faith, why did you doubt?"
[00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:29.500]   And when they got into the boat, the wind ceased.
[00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:31.020]   And those in the boat worshiped him saying,
[00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:34.300]   "Truly, you are the son of God."
[00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:38.660]   The beauty of this story is that it's yours and I's story.
[00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:42.200]   This is the story of our savior.
[00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:45.900]   This is the story of what we call the good news, the gospel.
[00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:47.820]   I want you to think about this moment.
[00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:51.760]   Peter comes and is walking on water.
[00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:53.860]   The winds begin to rise, like I said,
[00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:57.220]   and he looks over, begins to sink.
[00:34:57.220 --> 00:34:58.640]   And I think a lot of us,
[00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:01.300]   when we don't read our Bible anymore,
[00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:03.260]   we go back to that ex who's no good for us.
[00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:04.540]   And when we make that mistake again,
[00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:06.140]   or we go back to our pornography,
[00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:07.580]   or we have that really bad night
[00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:09.020]   that we said we'd never do again,
[00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:10.300]   and we'll begin to sink,
[00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:13.620]   we think that God is like, "Told you so.
[00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:15.660]   What did I tell you?
[00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:18.020]   Yeah, stay down, learn your lesson."
[00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:22.420]   "I told you, man, you got to keep your eyes on me.
[00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:24.020]   Don't you remember I'm the one in control.
[00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:24.860]   What are you doing?"
[00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:25.840]   That's how we think God is.
[00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:27.380]   But that's not what we see here.
[00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:28.940]   That's not the heart of our savior.
[00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:29.940]   That's not the heart of Jesus.
[00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:31.140]   What does he do?
[00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:35.180]   The moment Peter begins to sink, he says, "Lord, save me."
[00:35:35.180 --> 00:35:36.420]   And it says, immediately,
[00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:38.680]   Jesus reached out his hand and picked him up.
[00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:40.880]   And he saved him.
[00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:47.120]   Peter didn't have to walk on shifty ground or solid ground.
[00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:50.460]   He got to be held in the arms of Jesus.
[00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:52.780]   Jesus was the one walking.
[00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:54.980]   Peter needed to be carried back to the boat.
[00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:57.340]   And that's our story.
[00:35:57.340 --> 00:36:02.600]   We were all born in this world on this ship,
[00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:06.660]   floating on the sea of sin.
[00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:10.680]   Sin everywhere,
[00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:15.260]   coming to us like a storm, crashing against us.
[00:36:16.980 --> 00:36:20.840]   And then Jesus comes down from heaven onto earth.
[00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:22.940]   And a lot of us are like, "What is that?"
[00:36:22.940 --> 00:36:25.380]   The disciples were like, "It's a ghost."
[00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:26.220]   We're like, "Who is this?
[00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:27.600]   What's this relationship with Jesus?
[00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:29.560]   Who's this person that's powerful enough
[00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:33.440]   to walk on the storms, walk on sin, defeat sin?"
[00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:34.440]   Because that's what Jesus did.
[00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:37.000]   He came down on earth and he died on the cross.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:37.960]   We've talked about this before.
[00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:39.500]   He paid for the sins of the world.
[00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:42.000]   He lived a perfect life, making him the perfect sacrifice
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.120]   in a way that you and I never could
[00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:45.180]   because our sin deserved death.
[00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:48.880]   But Jesus came and died so that we could live.
[00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:52.120]   We bring our nothing and get everything because of Jesus.
[00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:54.800]   But we're the Peter.
[00:36:54.800 --> 00:37:00.000]   Jesus invites us to come, come in your sin.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:01.440]   Come join me, I'm with you.
[00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:02.560]   This is why I'm here.
[00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:05.060]   And we begin to walk and step out
[00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:06.580]   into relationship with him.
[00:37:06.580 --> 00:37:10.860]   And we look at Jesus and we're like, "This is amazing."
[00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:12.560]   But then that habit creeps back up,
[00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:13.800]   that sin creeps back up.
[00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:15.740]   And even though Jesus was so faithful,
[00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:17.400]   and even though there were such sweet moments,
[00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:20.480]   and even though we remember kind of how good it felt
[00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:23.740]   to take that step and to feel the solid ground
[00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:25.200]   that was following Jesus in the midst
[00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:27.180]   of such a stormy life.
[00:37:27.180 --> 00:37:28.900]   You remember that high experience at that camp.
[00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:30.720]   You remember what it was like to trust Jesus.
[00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:31.860]   You remember what it's like to be a part
[00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:33.460]   of that Bible study, that thing.
[00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:34.940]   And if you haven't,
[00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:40.120]   beginning that step is the best decision you could ever make.
[00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:42.060]   But here's the reality, we're gonna get it wrong
[00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:43.460]   and eventually your sin is gonna come
[00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:45.320]   and you're gonna take your eyes off Jesus.
[00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:48.700]   But the beauty of the cross, the beauty that Jesus died,
[00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:51.600]   and then three days later rose again, made him,
[00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:57.460]   made his blood, the atonement, the payment for our sin.
[00:37:57.460 --> 00:38:00.780]   So that way, when we sin,
[00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:02.500]   and we're heading towards death and drowning,
[00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:05.540]   we get to say, "Jesus saved me."
[00:38:05.540 --> 00:38:08.340]   And he is there every time to pick us up.
[00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:12.580]   And tonight he's asking us the same question he asked Peter.
[00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:14.780]   "Oh, you of little faith, why did you doubt?
[00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:17.980]   "You've seen me move.
[00:38:17.980 --> 00:38:20.680]   "Don't you remember when I called you out of the boat?
[00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:23.200]   "Don't you remember when I showed up in your life
[00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:24.260]   "and I was faithful?
[00:38:24.260 --> 00:38:25.480]   "Why are you running?
[00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:29.300]   "Why are you settling and drowning?
[00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:30.360]   "Quit trying to take control.
[00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:32.980]   "You know you don't have control."
[00:38:32.980 --> 00:38:36.260]   And he's picked you up and he's carried you back.
[00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:37.940]   And the beauty of this story
[00:38:37.940 --> 00:38:39.660]   is that it's not about the storm.
[00:38:40.540 --> 00:38:42.500]   It's not about the faith of Peter
[00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:45.540]   or the fear that led Peter to drown.
[00:38:45.540 --> 00:38:47.880]   It's about the goodness of Jesus.
[00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:52.840]   Because Jesus is the hero of this story.
[00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:57.020]   Peter sunk, Jesus saved.
[00:38:57.020 --> 00:39:00.380]   He picked him up and he carried him back.
[00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:03.180]   And if you would let your story be that story tonight,
[00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:05.980]   I'm honestly the guy who gets it wrong.
[00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:07.860]   I'm the girl who's gonna make mistakes.
[00:39:07.860 --> 00:39:09.380]   I'm the control freak.
[00:39:09.380 --> 00:39:11.340]   I'm the one that takes my eyes off Jesus.
[00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:12.580]   But listen, that's the point.
[00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:14.340]   Jesus is there to pick me up every time
[00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:16.140]   and carry me back to the boat.
[00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:17.580]   If you would let that be your story
[00:39:17.580 --> 00:39:19.420]   and stop trying to convince the world that you're fine
[00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:21.700]   when you're drowning and you know it,
[00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:24.860]   the world's gonna look at that and be like, "What is that?"
[00:39:24.860 --> 00:39:28.940]   The same way the disciples looked at Peter
[00:39:28.940 --> 00:39:31.220]   as Jesus brought him back to the boat,
[00:39:31.220 --> 00:39:35.260]   sat him down and calmed the storm.
[00:39:35.260 --> 00:39:36.340]   And what did they do?
[00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:40.580]   They fell on their knees and they worshiped.
[00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:46.300]   And they said, "Truly, you are the son of God."
[00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:51.340]   When Jesus came into the scene,
[00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:54.820]   we hear him referred to as, "Behold, the son of God
[00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:58.140]   who takes away the sins of the world."
[00:39:58.140 --> 00:40:02.380]   When the disciples saw Jesus
[00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:03.940]   who was in control of the storm
[00:40:06.340 --> 00:40:09.100]   and the Jesus who was willing to pick up Peter
[00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:10.780]   though he took his eyes off of him
[00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:15.520]   and carry him back to safety and cause the storm to cease,
[00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:17.260]   their response was to worship.
[00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:22.780]   And tonight, may our response be the same.
[00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:26.820]   In your storms of life, your response can be the same,
[00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:28.340]   not because you stepped out of the boat,
[00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:29.940]   but because Jesus is there to save you
[00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:31.040]   when you get it wrong.
[00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:33.740]   That's why we worship.
[00:40:33.740 --> 00:40:35.460]   That's why we gather to remind each other
[00:40:35.460 --> 00:40:37.780]   that we need Jesus.
[00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:41.420]   When will the storm cease?
[00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:42.320]   I don't know.
[00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:48.220]   But I do know that Jesus is in control of the storm
[00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:50.260]   and he is with you in the storm
[00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:53.300]   and he is working your storm out for a greater good
[00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:55.180]   and for a purpose unique to you,
[00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:57.220]   for your story to declare to the world,
[00:40:57.220 --> 00:41:00.460]   "Don't look at me, look at Jesus carrying me, saving me."
[00:41:00.460 --> 00:41:02.760]   And the response to that should be to worship.
[00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:04.820]   Let's pray.
[00:41:05.020 --> 00:41:07.060]   (gentle music)
[00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:10.180]   Father, we worship you for being
[00:41:10.180 --> 00:41:14.260]   the one who's in control.
[00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:18.180]   And when we think we have control and we begin to sink,
[00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:20.840]   you are the one who picks us up every time.
[00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:25.920]   May that character of you,
[00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:29.140]   that you don't leave us to drown on our own,
[00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:31.380]   but you pick us up and you carry us back
[00:41:31.380 --> 00:41:34.660]   although we're imperfect and although we're unworthy,
[00:41:34.660 --> 00:41:36.740]   you say, "Hey, that's why I'm here.
[00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:38.220]   "That's why I've called you,
[00:41:38.220 --> 00:41:40.480]   "so you can greater see your need for me,
[00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:42.580]   "so you can greater understand your need for me
[00:41:42.580 --> 00:41:44.260]   "to pick you up time and time again.
[00:41:44.260 --> 00:41:46.640]   "And I'm always gonna be here with you in the storm.
[00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:48.500]   "You don't have to worry when the storm will end
[00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:50.940]   "because whether the storm ends or whether it begins,
[00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:53.660]   "I am the same, I am with you, I am here.
[00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:56.260]   "I am the Jesus who is in control."
[00:41:56.260 --> 00:42:01.280]   And may that understanding of the control that you possess
[00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:03.680]   lead to such a faith in this room that we say,
[00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:04.900]   "I don't wanna stay in the boat.
[00:42:04.900 --> 00:42:06.860]   "I just wanna be where Jesus is."
[00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:09.580]   And we step out of the boat
[00:42:09.580 --> 00:42:14.180]   and we'd be people, men and women of faith.
[00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:18.260]   It says, "Jesus, whatever it looks like, I'm ready.
[00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:20.580]   "If you say come, I'm going, I'm jumping in.
[00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:26.660]   "But when I sink, I know, I know, I have faith
[00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:29.060]   "that you will pick me up every single time."
[00:42:32.860 --> 00:42:37.620]   Thank you for being that kind of Lord for us tonight
[00:42:37.620 --> 00:42:38.980]   and every night.
[00:42:38.980 --> 00:42:40.720]   It's your name that I pray, amen.
[00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:50.720]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
