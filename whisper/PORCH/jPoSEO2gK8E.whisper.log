[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   [Music]
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   Well, what's up, Porch? How are we doing tonight?
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   [Cheers]
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   Hey, it's good to see you. Great to be with you.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   Hope all is well. Thanks for trusting us with your Tuesday night.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   If this is your first time ever with us, thank you for trusting us.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   And I hope that this place feels comfortable and like home for you.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   I do want to give a shout-out to all of our Porch Live locations watching tonight.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   Like you, Porch Live Boise, and Porch Live Dayton, Porch Live Scottsdale.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   Thank you for tuning in. I hope that all is well with you guys.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   Some of you have heard me share this before, but several years ago,
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   some of my closest friends, Sterling and Natalie, they bought this older home.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   And this older home had this one room at the back of the house.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   And that one room had its own air conditioning unit.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   You're like, "Why are we talking about HVAC?" Well, let me tell you.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   The previous owners had bought an air conditioning system for this one room
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   that was just too big for the room. And I don't know all the ins and outs of HVAC,
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   but what my friend told me was happening was that this system was short-cycling,
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   which means that it was overproducing.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   So without my friends Sterling and Natalie knowing it,
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   there was moisture that was forming on the inside of the unit without them knowing,
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   and it was causing mold to build up in the unit.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   The problem is that my friend Natalie has a condition where her body
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   struggles to eliminate toxins. She's had this struggle for about two decades.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   And so I want you to think about what was happening.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   Without them knowing it, this air conditioning unit was quietly operating
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   in the background of their lives every single day,
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   and it was blowing air through their home,
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   which was actually poisoning Natalie's body and sabotaging her health.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   The reason I tell you that is because tonight we're going to talk about our past failures.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   We're talking about that moment or that season in your past
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   that you could just slap the label on, "What was I thinking?"
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   For some of you, it was like college. It was like, "Well, what part of college?"
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   College. "What was I thinking?" Not going to it, but what you did in college.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   Some of you all were like it was freshman year of college,
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   or for others it was like it was the relationship with that girl
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   or that guy or that choice I made in my first job or that abortion.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   It was that choice in my past that when you look back on it,
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   it just causes shame, regret.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   And without us realizing it, our past failures can be a lot like
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   my friend's air conditioning unit.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   Our past failures can quietly operate in the background of our lives,
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   blowing shame and regret through our souls like air through a house.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   And that shame and regret can poison our souls, and it can lead to all sorts of issues.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   It'll impact your relationship with God. It'll impact your relationship with others.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   It'll impact your future marriage and the way that you parent your kids.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   Like, our shame and regret has to be dealt with.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   And so I don't know what you think of when I ask you, "What is it?
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   What is it from your past?"
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   So when you look back on it, you just think, "What was I thinking?"
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Like, if you could have a do-over, if you just could hit a button
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   that would cause things to loop back and you could just try it again
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   or do it differently, what would it be for you?
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   I just want you to know that this talk is deeply personal for me,
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   and I've shared my story here at the porch a lot, but if you're new here,
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   the reality is during my young adult years, I was here in Dallas.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   I was going to Dallas Seminary like I was getting a degree in Jesus.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   And at the same time, I was working at a church with high school students,
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   and I was telling high school students one way to live.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   And then at the same time, in my private life, I was doing the opposite,
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   and I was living a compromising life.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   I was making compromising decisions, and those compromising decisions
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   led to major consequences in my life.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   It all boiled up to a point where I had to sit with about 50 or 60 staff members
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   at the church I was working at and share with them my sin.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   And I had to step out of all forms of leadership in ministry.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   And when that happened, man, shame and regret moved in
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   and made themselves at home, and my failures began to quietly operate
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   in the background of my life, and my past failure began to blow shame
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   and regret through the soul, through the house of my soul,
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   like air through my friend's house.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   And it impacted me in so many ways, so many ways.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   Like I remember going to that church, and whenever I would go to that church,
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   it was like everyone--I just thought everyone was looking at me
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   like I began to believe everyone saw me for my sin,
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   or if I saw someone out in public from that church, I just began to think,
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   "Well, they probably, when they see me, they just think about what I've done."
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   Or when I started dating my wife, Catherine, she just had a cleaner past than me.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   And so I felt unworthy of God's good gift of Catherine in my life.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   I just didn't believe that I deserved her.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   Like I deserved something less because of my past.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   Or when I got back into ministry and I became a student pastor,
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   I felt so ashamed to be in ministry with the past that I had
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   because I thought that I was unqualified.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   Let me change that wording because we're all in some ways unqualified for ministry.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   I felt unfit. I felt unusable by God.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   And then I also operated with this mentality that I just wanted to get
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   as far away from my failure as quickly as possible
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   because the more distance I could put between my failure and my present,
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   the more God would like me.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   Can you resonate with any of this?
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   Like, do you know what I'm talking about when I talk about shame?
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   What I'm really talking about is, you know what shame does?
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   Shame attacks your identity.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   Like something happens where you move from "I failed" to "I'm a failure."
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   And so you might not lead with that.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   If you're out at lunch and someone's like, "Hey, tell me about yourself.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   Let me start out. I'm a failure. I like college football. How about you?"
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   Like, maybe you don't lead with it.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   Maybe that's not even what you think on a regular basis.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   But if you were to just kind of zoom out and look at your behavior,
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   you operate as a failure.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   Like, it's in your wiring. It's your mentality.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   It's the difference between your identity and activity.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   I did fail. That's my activity. I did fail.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   And yet my activity became my identity.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   And what I had done became who I was.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   I was a failure.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   And so I just wonder how many people here, like if you were honest,
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   if you were to somehow just in the quietness of your own heart,
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   or when you're laying in bed at night and you finally turn the phone off
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   and all you are left with is your thoughts,
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   I wonder how many people just live under the crushing weight
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   of the banner over your life that you have put there.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   And that banner reads "failure."
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   You know what's interesting is I talked to Sterling and Natalie
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   about that messed up air conditioning unit.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   You know what they told me?
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   They said, "You know, before we understood what was going on,
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   we tried a bunch of different things to help Natalie with her health."
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   And so she would try different things,
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   and certain things would work for a short period of time.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   So she might have a good day here or a good day here,
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   but ultimately her health would tank.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   And it's because they weren't treating the problem.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   So ultimately what they had to do was they had to identify the source of the problem,
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   and someone had to come in and rip out that busted system
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   and put in something new.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   I tell you that just to say, you know what,
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   we have all sorts of ways of dealing with our shame.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   All sorts of ways.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   Like if you know what it feels like to fail,
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   you're like, "Man, if I could just have a do-over."
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   If you can look back and you can pinpoint something,
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   I wonder what you've done to kind of manage that shame.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   Some of us, we make promises to God.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   "God, I'm never going to look at porn again.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   Mark the calendar, mark the day, this is it, never looking at porn again.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   God, if you will just give me another girlfriend or another boyfriend,
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   I promise you I will never do anything bad again.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   I will never do anything impure again.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   I promise I am never going to do this again or that again."
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   We just make promises
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   because we think that if we can perform for God,
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   He will provide for us.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   That's actually karma, do good, get good.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   Or we don't make promises, we just compare.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   Like we go out and we look for someone who has failed worse than we have,
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   and they just make us feel better about ourselves.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   It's like, "I know I failed, but I didn't fail like that.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   Like at least it wasn't that bad."
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   Or you know what we do is we punish ourselves.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   Like we deprive ourselves of good gifts from God
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   because we think that if we can kind of pay for our failures,
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   like we can balance the scales in our own lives.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   The reality is just like Sterling and Natalie needed someone to step in
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   and intervene and rip out the broken and busted air conditioning of their house,
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   Jesus Christ wants to step into our lives tonight
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   and rip out the busted failure
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   that is blowing shame and regret through the house of your soul,
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   poisoning your life and distorting your identity.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   Jesus is going to show us what he wants to do with our past failure
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   by allowing us to see what he did with Peter's past failure.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   And so if you have a Bible, I want you to turn with me tonight
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   all the way to the end of the book of John.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   John chapter 21.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   If you've been with us over the last several weeks,
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   we've been in this series called Glory.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   The glory of God is the supreme goodness of God.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   It is everything praiseworthy and good about God.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   And God's glory, his goodness, has been demonstrated and displayed to us
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   in the person of Jesus Christ.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   And so every week that we've been in the book of John,
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   we've just been looking at one activity of Jesus that displays the glory of God.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   And today we're going to see Jesus as Restorer.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   Jesus Christ is the Restorer of our souls.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   If you're new to the Bible and you're not very familiar with Peter,
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   Peter was one of Jesus' 12 closest friends, but it was even more than that.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   Like Jesus had three that he spent even more time with.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   Peter was one of those.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   Like he was super tight with Jesus.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   Jesus gave Peter a new name.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   Peter's original name was Simon, and Jesus gave him the name Peter.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   Like when you give someone a nickname, that means you're tight with them.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   That was Peter.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   But if you're familiar with the Bible, then you know what Peter's greatest failure was.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   What was it?
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   Yeah, he denied Jesus three times.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   On the night that Jesus was betrayed and arrested.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   So listen to the wording before we get to John 21.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   Listen to the wording of Luke 22, which tells us what happens right after Peter denies Jesus for the third time.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   It says this in Luke 22, verse 61.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   It says, "And the Lord turned and looked at Peter, and Peter remembered the saying of the Lord,
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   how he had said to him, 'Before the rooster crows today, you will deny me three times.'
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   And he went out and wept bitterly."
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   Like this is in the Bible.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   Like I don't know what you think is in the Bible.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   If you've never taken time to read it, this is not just some like mythical world of larger than life people who never struggle.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   It's the opposite.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   It is real down to earth people who have real problems.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   And one of Jesus' closest friends denied him three times after he said he wouldn't.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   And so what was the result?
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   He actually locks eyes with Jesus.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   And in that moment, he sees a sin for what it is, and he goes out and he weeps bitterly.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   Now think about it.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   If you're God, and one of your closest friends just betrays you, you've got options.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   Right?
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   Like you're in charge of that guy's story.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   That guy's story could be like, "And Peter was never heard from again."
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   Or like, "The ground split open and swallowed Peter whole, and he was never heard from again."
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   Like, there's options.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   And yet we turn to John chapter 21, and it says this, verse 1.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   It says, "After this."
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   After what?
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   After Jesus went to the cross.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   After Jesus bore our sin and shame.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   After Jesus on the third day walked out of the tomb victoriously, conquering Satan, sin, and death.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   After that.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   After this, Jesus revealed himself.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   What's the next word?
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   This isn't a trick.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   Like, what's the next word?
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   Again.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   You're like, "You want to highlight that word?"
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   Yes.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   He reveals himself again to the disciples, which included Peter, by the Sea of Tiberias.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   And he revealed himself in this way.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   Here's why I highlight again.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   Like, Jesus could have done anything he wanted with Peter.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   And yet he reveals himself to Peter, not just once, not just twice, but in John 21, this is him revealing himself again.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   Because it's the third time that he has shown up in Peter's life.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   You know what's interesting is when we think about Jesus being betrayed and arrested, we only think about Judas and Peter.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   Judas is the guy who betrayed Jesus, and Peter is the guy who denied Jesus.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   But have you ever read the verse, Matthew 26, 56, which says this about the rest of the disciples?
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   It says, "Then all the disciples left him and fled."
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   Have you ever thought about that?
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   It wasn't just Judas.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   It wasn't just Peter.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   All of them, all 12, deserted Jesus Christ in his hardest hour.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   So again, if you're God, and all 12 of your closest friends desert you, what are you going to do?
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   I'd probably just get a new crew, because I could.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   I'm God.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   I'd be like, "These guys are jokers.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   They're dead to me, and they're just dead, period.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   And I'm going a new way."
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   And yet Jesus' actions communicate that the relationship with Peter and everyone else was still on schedule.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   It was on his schedule.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   The disciples' compromise didn't change Jesus' commitment.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   So the first truth that I need you to know when dealing with your past failure is this.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   Your compromise doesn't change Jesus' commitment.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   Your compromise, whatever it was, it doesn't change Jesus' commitment.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   Some of you all need to hear this tonight.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   Don't miss it.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   His commitment can withstand our greatest compromise.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   Your relationship with Jesus has never and will never rest on the strength of your character.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   It has always and will always rest on the strength of his.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   And so I'm just going to ask everyone to look at me.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   I promise this isn't elementary school where it's like I need all of your eyes on me.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   But I'm asking for your eyes, because I don't want you to miss this.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   Some of you need to hear this tonight.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   Jesus Christ isn't even close to giving up on you.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   Not even close.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   Jesus Christ isn't even close to giving up on you.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   And you're like, "Well, yeah, but you don't know what I've done."
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   I don't need to know what you've done.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   One of Jesus' best friends denied him three times.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   It's probably not worse than that.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   He's not even close.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   He's not even close to giving up on me.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   That was one of the most beautiful realities for me to come to grips with,
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   to be on a walk with the Lord one night, to just be walking around the neighborhood
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   and to come to this realization that after all of my sin, after all of my life,
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   Jesus has never once considered giving up on me.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   Never once.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   And you're like, "Well, you're a pastor." Of course not.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   Well, let me just go through my list of sin.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   After all of my self-sufficiency, after all the times I've prioritized other things above Jesus,
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   after all the careless and hurtful words towards others,
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   after the bitterness and the gluttony and the lust and the pride
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   and the manipulation and the selfishness and the attempts to use God for my glory,
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   not once has he ever considered giving up on me,
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   and not once has he withheld his love from me, and not once has he given up
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   or withheld his love from you.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   So, just where we have to start, that your compromise does not change his commitment.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   Second truth that we have to deal with when we're talking about our past failures is this.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   Jesus is the author of new starts.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   He's the author of it.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   So I don't know what you brought into this place tonight, but I've got great news for you.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   A new start is possible with Jesus Christ.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   Why? Because he's in the business of giving clean starts to messy lives.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   He is the author of new starts.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   I want you to see what happens.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   Follow along in John 21.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   We're going to cover a lot of ground.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   There's no way that we have time to unpack everything that's going on.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   I'm just going to hit the highlights.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   But I want you to see what happens.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   Verse 1, it says, "After this, Jesus revealed himself again to the disciples by the Sea of Tiberias,
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   and he revealed himself in this way.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   Simon Peter, Thomas, called the twin, Nathaniel of Cana and Galilee, the sons of Zebedee,
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   and two others of his disciples were together.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   Simon Peter said to them, 'I'm going fishing.'
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   They said to him, 'We will go with you.'
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   And they went out and got into the boat, but that night they caught nothing.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   Just as day was breaking, Jesus stood on the shore, yet the disciples did not know that it was Jesus.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   Jesus said to them, 'Children, do you have any fish?'
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   And they answered him, 'No.'
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   He said to them, 'Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some.'
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   So they cast it, and now they were not able to haul it in because of the quantity of fish."
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   Okay.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   Don't miss what's happening here.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   If you're familiar with the Bible, this story should sound familiar to you.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   But here's what you need to understand.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   This story happens twice in the Bible.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   It happens when Jesus first calls Peter to be his disciple, and then it happens right here.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   So what I'm trying to show you is that Jesus kind of hits the reset button on Peter's life.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   When did Jesus first call Peter to be his disciple?
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   It was three years prior to this.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   Where was Jesus when he first called Peter to be his disciple?
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   He was by the Sea of Galilee.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   Where are they now?
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   They're back at the Sea of Galilee.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   Sea of Tiberias, that's just another name for the Sea of Galilee.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   What had Peter been doing the night before Jesus showed up and called him to be his disciple?
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   Do you know what Peter did?
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   He stayed up all night fishing and didn't catch anything.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   Jesus shows up three years prior to this story, and Jesus says, "Hey, put your nets on the other side of the boat."
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   They do, and they catch so many fish that it begins to tear their nets.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   So do you see what Jesus is doing here?
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   He's kind of starting over with Peter.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   He's like, "All right, let's just go back to it. They're at the Sea of Galilee. Great. Check."
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   Okay? Peter stays up all night fishing, catches nothing. Check.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   Insert Jesus. Jesus shows up.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   "Hey, put your nets on the other side of the boat. You guys caught anything?"
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   "No."
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   "Great. Put it on the other side."
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   And what do they do?
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   They catch 153 fish.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   The only difference between this story and what happened three years earlier is that this time the nets don't begin to tear.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   It continues in verse 7. Look at what it says.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   "That disciple whom Jesus loved therefore said to Peter, 'It is the Lord.'"
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   "When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put on his outer garment and pulled a forest gump.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   He was stripped for work and threw himself into the sea."
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   Lieutenant Dan!
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   "The other disciples came in the boat, dragging the net full of fish, for they were not far from the land but about a hundred yards off.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   When they got out on land, they saw a charcoal fire in place with fish laid out on it and bread.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   Jesus said to them, 'Bring some of the fish that you have just caught.'
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   So Simon Peter went aboard and hauled the net ashore full of large fish, 153 of them.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   And although there were so many, the net was not torn.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   Jesus said to them, 'Come and have breakfast.'
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   Now none of the disciples dared ask him, 'Who are you?'
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   They knew it was the Lord. Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   And so with the fish."
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   This was now the third time that Jesus was revealed to the disciples after he was raised from the dead.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   There's so much going on here. I just want to highlight two things.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   So remember, Jesus has brought Peter back to the Sea of Galilee.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   Peter's just stayed up all night fishing, caught nothing.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   Jesus is doing exactly what he did with Peter three years earlier.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   Now what's interesting is Jesus brings them, brings Peter and the other disciples to a charcoal fire.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   When's the last time Peter was around a charcoal fire?
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   On the night he betrayed Jesus.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   The only other thing I want you to see is that Jesus already had fish on the fire,
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   which is pretty baller.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   Because they just caught 153 fish,
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   it's as if Jesus is saying, "Y'all don't have anything that I need.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   And I have everything in myself.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   And yet I delight to have you with me and to share it with you."
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   Which is really beautiful.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   Now watch this.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   Verses 15 through 17.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   "When they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter,"
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   look at what he calls him, Simon,
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   when's the last time Jesus called him Simon?
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   I don't know when the last time was,
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   but what did Jesus call him the first time?
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   He called him to follow him?
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   He called him Simon.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   "Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?"
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   He said to him, "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you."
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   He said to him, "Feed my lambs."
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   He said to him a second time, "Simon, son of John, do you love me?"
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   He said to him, "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you."
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   He said to him, "Tend my sheep."
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   He said to him the third time, "Simon, son of John, do you love me?"
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, "Do you love me?"
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   And he said to him, "Lord, you know everything.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   You know that I love you."
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   Jesus said to him, "Feed my sheep."
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   How many times did Peter deny Jesus around that charcoal fire?
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   Three times.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   So what does Jesus do?
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   He brings him to another charcoal fire,
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   and he asks him the same question three times, "Do you love me?"
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   Why does he ask him it three times?
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   So that each denial could be replaced with an affirmation of Peter's love for Jesus.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   See what Jesus is doing?
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   He's just saying, "Let's start over.
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   Let's just start over.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   Let's just go back.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   Sea of Galilee.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   Up all night fishing.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   You catch a bunch of fish.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   I bring you to a charcoal fire.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   I call you Simon."
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   And now, each denial is replaced with an affirmation.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   Jesus is giving him a new start.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   Why?
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   Because Jesus is the author of new starts.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   That's what he does.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   What Jesus is doing here, don't miss it,
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   is he is exchanging Peter's story of failure for his story of forgiveness.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   That's what Jesus is doing, is he is taking Peter's failure
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   and replacing it with forgiveness and favor.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   Do you want to know why this moment between Jesus and Peter was possible?
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   Do you want to know why Jesus was able to forgive Peter in this moment and restore him?
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   It's because sandwiched in between the two charcoal fires was the cross of Jesus Christ.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   And on that cross, what did Jesus do?
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   He bore all of Peter's sin and shame.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   Like the three denials, Jesus died for those denials.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   When Jesus walked out of the tomb, he was conquering Peter's denials.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   The apostle Paul explains really well what Jesus accomplished on the cross for you and for me.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   Listen to his wording in Colossians 2, 13 and 14.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   Paul says, "You were dead because of your sins."
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   So if you're not a Christian in here,
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   you need to know that you might be physically alive,
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   but in God's eyes, you are spiritually dead.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   You're not spiritually bad, you're spiritually dead.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   And it's impossible for dead people to do something pleasing for a holy God.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   You were dead because of your sins and because your sinful nature was not yet cut away.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   Watch this.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   "Then God made you alive with Christ."
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   That's what Christianity is about.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   Christianity isn't about us coming together to figure out what we need to do for God.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   It's us coming together to realize that when we could do nothing, God did everything.
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   "Then God made you alive with Christ, for he forgave..."
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   What's the next word?
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   Now I want you to say it like you believe that the Bible is true.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   "He forgave..."
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   "All."
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   "All."
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   All of our sins.
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   All of them.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   He canceled the record.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   The record.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   He canceled the entire record of your sins.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   He canceled the record of the charges against us.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   And he didn't just cancel it and look at what he did.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   He took it away by nailing it to the cross.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   So this is where you have to get your theology right.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   Either Jesus has forgiven all of your sins or none of your sins.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   Period.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   Either all of them or none of them.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   You choose what you believe.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   But the reason that shame and regret will have their way in our lives is because we believe that Jesus forgives the sins that are easy to forgive,
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   but he really struggles to forgive the significant sins.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   So this is where you have to realize that when Jesus went to the cross, he went to deal with the entire record.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   The entire record.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   All of your failure.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   It's either all of your sin or none of your sin.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   And you know what he's done is he has taken away...
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   So if you're not a Christian, I hope that you leave here truly understanding what's on the table for you tonight.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   Complete forgiveness of all your failures is on the table tonight.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   But here's the good news is Jesus doesn't just take away the record of your sin.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   Do you know what Jesus does?
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   Is he gives you his record of righteousness.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   Which is amazing.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   So that when a holy and perfect God looks at you, do you know what he sees?
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   He doesn't just see that Jesus has taken away your sin.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   He sees that Jesus has given you his righteousness.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   So when a perfect God looks at you, you know what he sees?
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   He sees Jesus in you.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   So everything that God the Father feels towards Jesus his son, he now feels towards you.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   Like you get to experience the love and the delight that God the Father has for Jesus.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   Why? Because you are now, according to the scriptures, through faith you are in Christ.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   Which is amazing news.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   So I tell you this just to say the cross must always be bigger than your failure.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   Always.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   Now, if you've wronged someone, go seek forgiveness.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   Go make it right.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   And I'll tell you this, like you don't have to forget about your past.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   You just have to put your past in the right place.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   Your past no longer has the right to remind you of what you've done.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   It only has the right to remind you of what Jesus has done.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   Your past failure's only responsibility now is to display the beauty and the greatness of God's grace.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   The third thing that I want you to know is this, your life can still glorify Jesus.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   That's amazing news.
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   Your life can still glorify Jesus.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   Look at what it tells us about Peter, verses 18 and 19.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   So Jesus has just said three different times, "Do you love me?"
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   Peter says, "Yes." He's like, "Feed my sheep. Tend my lambs."
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   Do you know what he's telling him?
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   He's saying, "Peter, go play a significant role in the building of my church."
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   Not a building, but a people.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   So you fast forward to the book of Acts, and you know what you see?
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   You see Peter is the leader.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   Like, he's the one who stands up, and when he gives a sermon like I'm doing right now,
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   3,000 people trust Christ just like that.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   So what Jesus is saying when he says, "Hey, go feed my sheep," he's saying, "Go, go lead.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   Go do something for my glory."
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   Now watch what he says in verse 18.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   Jesus says, "Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were young,
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   you used to dress yourself and walk wherever you wanted.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   But when you are old, you will stretch out your hands,
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   and another will dress you and carry you where you do not want to go."
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   Verse 19, don't miss it.
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   "This he said to show by what kind of death he was to glorify God.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   And after saying this, he said to them, 'Follow me.'"
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   Do you know what this is a reference to?
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   Jesus right here is referring to the death Peter was going to die.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   Peter was going to die by crucifixion.
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   Tradition tells us that he was even crucified upside down.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   But I want you to see the wording.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   This is Jesus himself saying, "Look, right now I'm just talking about the death
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   that you are going to die to glorify me."
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   Jesus himself is saying, "It is still possible for you, Peter, to glorify me."
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   And you know what's amazing is when you do go and read the book of Acts,
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   you know what the story of Peter's life becomes?
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   Peter's story isn't, "I failed."
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   Peter's story was, he was imperfect but faithful.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   Like he went out and he led for Jesus, and yet he still sinned.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   He still struggled.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   Like there's a story where Paul has to call Peter out.
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   But the label of his life was not failure.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   It was imperfect but faithful.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   And I'll just tell you this.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   Like I've got a wife and three kids.
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   And when I die at my funeral, the greatest thing that anyone could say about me
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   is for my wife or my kids or my friends to stand up and say,
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   "You know what, Timothy Atik, he was an imperfect person.
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   He was very imperfect."
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   I want my wife to stand up there and say, "You know what, he was too moody sometimes.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   He was imperfect, but he was faithful.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   He was faithful to follow Jesus.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   He was faithful to love his spouse.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   He was faithful to love his kids.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   He was faithful to love God's church.
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   He was imperfect but faithful."
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   There's nothing--there's not a bigger compliment that I could receive
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   or that you could receive.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   I'd just tell you this to say your life can still glorify Jesus.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   Don't let your limited perspective tell you what a limitless God can and can't do
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   in and through you.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   You can still glorify God in dating.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   You can still glorify God in marriage.
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   You can still glorify God as a parent.
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   You can still glorify God as a co-worker.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   You can still glorify God as a boss or an employee.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   I don't say this to minimize our sin.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   I just say it to maximize the power of God's grace.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   And so you know what?
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   Like you've heard me--if you've been at the porch for a while,
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   you've heard me share about my story of how I lived a compromising life
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   and I was working at a church and I had to step off of staff.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   For the new people in the room, do you know what church that was?
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   Watermark Community Church.
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   It was this church that I had to sit with a room full of 50 to 60 staff
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   and just tell them about my sin.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   It was at this church that I was asked to leave staff
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   and to step out of leadership for a period of time because of my sin.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   And now God in his kindness and in his grace has brought me back.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   Why? Because he wasn't done with me.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   And so the reason I share my story is that I don't have a story to hide.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   I have a story to tell.
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   Because my story now, it's a trophy of God's grace.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   And I've told my story now to tens of thousands of people.
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   I've gotten to sit one-on-one with young adults
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   and talk to them about my failures during that season.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   And I don't have to do it with shame in my heart.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   I do it free of shame.
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   Because now my past's only responsibility
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   is to remind me of just how great God's grace has been in my life.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   It is a trophy of God's grace that I can stand up here tonight
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   and say, "I don't have a story to hide. You can know my past."
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   Because Jesus has restored me from my past.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   He has redeemed me from it.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   And the cross of Jesus Christ is capable to deal with all of our sin.
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   I hope you believe that tonight.
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   [applause]
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   So I just want to close by talking about how you respond to a message like this.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   Here it is.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   Peter ran to Jesus instead of running from Jesus.
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   You know what I love about Peter is that he denied Jesus three times,
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   and then when John looks at him and they're on the boat,
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   and he's like, "Hey, that's Jesus."
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   You know what Jesus--Peter does?
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   He flings himself into the water and just is like,
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   "I don't have time to wait for us to paddle there.
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   I want to get to Jesus now."
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   Instead of running from him, he ran to him.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   And here's what I love. When Peter came to Jesus,
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   what was the question that Jesus asked Peter?
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   "Do you promise you're never going to deny me again?"
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   It wasn't that question.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   Now, Peter, you're committed to going to church every week from here on out, right?
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   That's part of the deal.
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   It wasn't that question either.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   Peter, you're not going to embarrass me and screw up again, right?
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   Not that question either.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   What was the question?
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   "Do you love me?"
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   That's the question on the table for you tonight.
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   It's not, "Do you promise?"
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   It's not, "Can you find someone that screwed up worse than you?"
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   It's not, "How are you going to punish yourself to make things right?"
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   It's, "Do you love me?"
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   So here's the deal.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   If you're here tonight and you don't have a relationship with Jesus Christ,
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   you are not a Christian.
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   If that's you, I just want you to know that when we talk about knowing Jesus,
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   what we're talking about is we're talking about knowing the one
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:15.000]   who left heaven and came to earth and lived a perfect life
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   because we have lived very imperfect lives,
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   and he died the death that we all deserved to die for our sin.
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   But when he died, what he was doing, he was taking all of the punishment
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   that our failures deserved.
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   And then we believe that this Jesus, he walked out of the grave
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   as a demonstration that he was victorious over all of our failures.
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   So tonight, his victory can be your victory.
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   Your life does not have to be defined by your failures.
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   It can be defined by his forgiveness and his favor towards you.
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   But it's only possible through faith.
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   It's only possible by you coming to a place where you talk to God
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   and you say, "Jesus, everything he's talking about, I want that to be true for me.
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   God, I give my life to you.
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   You can be in charge of my life.
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   Would you just come in? Would you be my Savior?
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   Would you be my King? Would you rule in my life?
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   I give my life to you. If that is possible, if it's possible
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   for you to not just forgive me, but to give me the righteousness of Christ.
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   God, I want that.
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   If that's you, would you come to him tonight?
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   If you're here and you are a Christian, but you're running from Jesus right now
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   because you're running in your shame,
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   you're living under the banner of failure,
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   stop running. Stop running.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   God in his love for you has brought you here
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   so that he could just ask you this question, "Do you love me?"
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   All you have to do is say, "I do love you, God. Forgive me."
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   And then you know what? If you've sought God for forgiveness
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   and yet you're still living in shame, let me just tell you what needs to happen.
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   You need to begin to agree with God about your sin.
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   Because Jesus is saying tonight, "I canceled the record."
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   And yet when we let shame rule, you know what we're saying back to God?
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.000]   We're saying, "Yeah, but what about my record?"
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   He's like, "I canceled it." It's like, "Yeah, but what about that sin on the record?"
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   He's like, "Yeah, I took it away." "Yeah, but I don't know about that sin."
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   We have to agree with him. You canceled the record.
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   Because you, Jesus, are greater than my sin, and I trust you.
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   So would you come to him tonight?
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   Whatever it is, would you run towards Jesus,
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   and would you experience his grace and his forgiveness?
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   Would you allow him to trade your story of failure
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   for his story of forgiveness and favor?
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   Let's pray together.
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   I just want to ask, if you're here tonight, and you're not a Christian,
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   but everything I said just a minute ago makes sense,
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:19.000]   and you're sitting there saying, "Yes, I want to begin a relationship with Jesus Christ tonight.
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   I want everything that you just said to be true to me."
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   If that's you, with eyes closed, would you slip up your hand real quick,
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   just so I know who I'm talking to in this place tonight?
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   Great. Awesome.
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   Then if that's you, I just encourage you right now to pray and say,
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   "Lord Jesus, I want everything he just said.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   Would you come into my life?
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   Would you forgive me of all of my sins?"
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   Just tell him, "Thank you." Say, "Thank you, Jesus, that you died for me.
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   Thank you that you rose from the dead for me.
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   Would you save me?
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   And would you lead me in a new life?"
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   And then if you're here tonight, and you are a believer that's just been walking in shame,
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:20.000]   like we sang a song earlier,
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   talking about witnessing the faithfulness of God,
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   and telling of his faithfulness, that's what I've done tonight,
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   is I've stood up here and I've told you,
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   I've witnessed the faithfulness of God in my own life to restore me from my sin,
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   and so I've testified about it to you.
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   And I want that for you.
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   So maybe you just sit there and you thank God for his faithfulness
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   to cancel the record of your sins.
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   And then maybe you stand and you sing and you testify of his goodness
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   and his faithfulness in your life,
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   but don't just run out of here.
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   Do business with the Lord now.
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   God, you are good.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   Thank you for your kindness in our lives.
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   That you don't give up on us.
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   That you're not even close to giving up on us.
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:10.000]   You still love us.
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   You still pursue us.
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   I pray for people who carried shame in,
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   may they not carry it back out.
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   May they leave it here
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.000]   and leave free.
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   We need you. We love you.
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   Amen.
