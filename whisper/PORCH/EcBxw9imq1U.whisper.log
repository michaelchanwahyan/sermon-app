[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.460]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:20.000]   Hey, it's so good to see you.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.280]   I hope that all is well.
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.400]   If this is your first time ever with us,
[00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.240]   thank you so much for trusting us with your Tuesday night.
[00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.800]   My name is Timothy Atik.
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.640]   I'm one of the teaching pastors here at the porch,
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.960]   as well as on Sunday mornings at Watermark.
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.640]   And I'm so glad you made it.
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.840]   I want to give a big shout out to all of our Porch Live
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.560]   locations that are joining us tonight
[00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.160]   in different parts of the nation.
[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.000]   Hope all is well with you.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.040]   And I'm so glad that you are worshiping with us.
[00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.840]   Tonight, it's a sweet moment for me,
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.060]   because I get to introduce you to one
[00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.400]   of my very close friends.
[00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.560]   And you're going to have the opportunity
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.400]   to hear from him tonight.
[00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.520]   My good friend, Kylan Perry, is here
[00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.000]   to communicate the word of God.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.200]   And he's here from Houston, Texas,
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.880]   if there's any Houston people here.
[00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.200]   What you need to know about Kylan
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.600]   is that he went to Texas A&M University, which
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.240]   is kind of important.
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.400]   But the way Kylan and I know each other
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.400]   is that we served together at Breakaway Ministries
[00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.800]   for over three years.
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.280]   And what I really loved about Kylan
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.560]   is that he gave his 20s to Jesus.
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:40.320]   And now as he steps into his 30s, nothing has changed.
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:46.120]   And so when I think about young adults in my world
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.200]   that are leveraging their lives for the sake of the gospel,
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.840]   Kylan is the one that comes to mind.
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.280]   And what I love about Kylan is that now he
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.680]   is the director of Houston Metro, which
[00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.800]   is a Bible study that meets on Tuesday nights.
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.160]   So just like we are gathering here tonight,
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.040]   there is a group of young adults meeting at Houston's First
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.480]   Baptist Church in Houston right now.
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.600]   And they are lifting up the name of Jesus together.
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.880]   And I'm so glad that Kylan is here
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.400]   to do that with us tonight.
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.680]   So in just a moment, he's going to come up.
[00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.600]   But before he does, I just want to pray.
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.600]   And I want to give you an opportunity
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.400]   to prepare your heart to hear the word of God taught.
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.800]   And so would you just take a second and pray for yourself
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.120]   and just say, God, would you speak to me tonight?
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:52.520]   [SILENCE]
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.000]   And then would you take a second and pray for Kylan
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.880]   and just say, God, would you speak mightily
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.000]   through Kylan tonight?
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.240]   Lord Jesus, you know how much I enjoy hearing
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.720]   Kylan teach the word of God.
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.000]   And I think he is just one of the most gifted, authentic
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.720]   communicators of truth.
[00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.760]   And so I'm so glad that these friends
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.600]   get to hear him tonight.
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.280]   But more than anything, more than they
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.440]   get to hear from Kylan, I pray that they would just
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.840]   hear from you, that you would speak through Kylan
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.800]   to your people.
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.000]   Would you use him for your glory?
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.800]   But would you speak directly to our hearts?
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:40.760]   May we hear from you.
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.320]   We thank you that you've given us your word
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.680]   so that we might hear from you.
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.960]   We love you in Jesus' name.
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:48.440]   Amen.
[00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:49.920]   Would you guys welcome Kylan Perry?
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.680]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:54.960]   What's up, porch?
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.720]   So good to be with you this Tuesday night.
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.360]   TA just introduced me, but I'll do it just for the sake
[00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.720]   of making friends with the room.
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.480]   I'm Kylan, a young adult pastor in Houston, Texas.
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.600]   I heard some friends from Houston are in the room.
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.040]   [CHEERING]
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:08.560]   It's good.
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.680]   Glad you guys made it.
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.680]   It's also so fun to be in Dallas.
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.680]   And I'm not just saying that because I
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.640]   need to make alliances with y'all real fast in order
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:16.840]   for you to like me.
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.200]   I'm saying that because I have a lot of love for the city
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.720]   because the city has meant so much to me.
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.760]   First and foremost, my wife is from Dallas,
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.600]   and I get to carry a piece of this town with me 24/7.
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.960]   So I love the chance to know that.
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.120]   And then I have a lot of love for Dallas
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.320]   because the ministry that I lead is from here.
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.040]   Like we are in Houston, and yet we were a porch live location.
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.520]   And then as we just started to see God doing something really
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.680]   unique in our city, similar to what he's doing here,
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.240]   we just started processing with a team, with Josiah.
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.120]   And we just started talking about, man, God,
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.720]   would you do something like what you're
[00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:50.920]   doing in Dallas and Houston?
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.080]   And so we set off.
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.600]   They commissioned us well, and we're seeing God do it.
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.040]   He's doing something really unique in our generation.
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.480]   And then I'll say this.
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.360]   I have so much love for Dallas because I
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.520]   have a lot of love for TA.
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.520]   TA has-- and I'm not just paying empty compliments.
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.560]   I was really judicious about thinking through this
[00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.240]   before walking up here and paying this.
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.240]   He has single-handedly marked my leadership more than anybody
[00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.920]   else that I know of.
[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:21.640]   And he is quite possibly one of the most faithful people I know.
[00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.240]   And so, Porch, you're in really good hands.
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.720]   And I'm grateful to see what God does over the course of his
[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:28.960]   time here with all of you.
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.720]   I'm excited to dump into the word with you,
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.000]   but before we do that, can I tell you a story?
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.800]   So a few years ago, Halloween was rolling around,
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.560]   and I had a group of friends that they
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.040]   were wanting to throw a murder mystery party.
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.640]   Anybody been to a murder mystery party before in here?
[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.560]   So they've got a murder mystery party going on.
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.560]   And I'm not going to lie.
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:45.880]   I'm pretty skeptical about it.
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:46.560]   I don't really know.
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.480]   OK, we're going to dress up, put on costumes,
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.240]   and get some sort of identity that we're
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.360]   supposed to act out over the course of the evening.
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:53.680]   Like, I'm not a thespian, so I'm not
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.440]   real sure how this evening is going to go.
[00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:00.520]   And yet, I show up, and people were all in, like mobsters,
[00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:01.000]   flappers.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.640]   It's 1920s themed.
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:06.320]   And so everybody is acting the part to the full.
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:07.920]   And they're not just looking the part.
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.400]   Like, they're genuinely acting it.
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.840]   With every single person came an envelope
[00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.760]   that gave a unique identity.
[00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.200]   And in that envelope, as you read
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.120]   through the characteristics of your unique identity, what
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.000]   you found is it carried with it things that would
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.320]   be typical of your normal life.
[00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.520]   It would tell you about who your alliances are,
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.920]   and who your enemies are, and what your job struggles have
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:28.080]   been.
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.280]   It was all the regular details of normal life.
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:33.320]   And so everybody in the room, they are dressed to the nines.
[00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.800]   They have envelopes with information
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.760]   about who they're supposed to be that evening.
[00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:40.360]   And everybody is full tilt. They are all the way
[00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:44.080]   in, wanting to play this game as well as possible.
[00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:46.680]   And so I walked in skeptical, but man,
[00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.920]   I don't play to participate.
[00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:49.720]   I'm here to win.
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:52.040]   And so they flash the lights, guy falls out,
[00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.960]   and next thing you know, the murder's happened.
[00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.360]   And I'm a police chief.
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:56.920]   Like, that was my role the night of.
[00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:59.080]   And so I'm out there doing my due diligence.
[00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:00.040]   I'm collecting evidence.
[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:01.040]   I'm conducting interviews.
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:02.600]   I'm making sure that I'm going to get
[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.280]   to the bottom of whoever this murderer is.
[00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:06.920]   I am going to win the evening.
[00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:08.840]   And then intermission happens.
[00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:10.600]   We make it a couple hours into the game,
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.800]   and the lights come back up, and everybody
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.040]   breaks character for a moment and gets a sip of water.
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.280]   And what we find out is that there's more information
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:18.080]   for us to learn.
[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.840]   And so I get a new envelope, which
[00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:23.560]   contains four very important words that
[00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:26.600]   changed the entire course of my evening.
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:29.800]   You are the murderer.
[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:33.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:34.200]   Exactly.
[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.560]   So you can imagine what happened to me in this moment.
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:39.840]   Literally, the entire time that I've been playing this game,
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:41.640]   I have been angling in one direction.
[00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:44.240]   But in this moment, everything changed for me.
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:47.320]   Like, I had to absolutely adapt to the fact
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:49.520]   that I could not be who I had been.
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:51.480]   Like, I knew in that instance, I had
[00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:53.400]   to be different things to different people.
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:56.320]   I had demands that I had to satisfy,
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:59.600]   because I wasn't safe with anyone.
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:04.040]   If people found out who I was and I was exposed,
[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:07.440]   it would mean the end of my night.
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:08.960]   And why do I tell you that?
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:10.320]   For a couple of reasons.
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:13.200]   Number one, to brag about the fact that I never got caught.
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:15.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:19.280]   And number two, to demonstrate how similar this
[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:22.320]   is to the way so many of us live,
[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:24.400]   except we're not in a game.
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:27.880]   So many of us feel like we have to be different things
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:30.280]   for different people because we're not safe being
[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:32.920]   the real us with anyone.
[00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:35.360]   Like, the world is propagating this message.
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.280]   Like, hey, you do you, bro.
[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:41.560]   And yet, too often, we realize, like, me being me
[00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:43.960]   isn't quite enough.
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:47.960]   And so we start contorting ourselves.
[00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:50.880]   We contort ourselves professionally, and socially,
[00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:52.520]   and romantically, and even spiritually,
[00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:54.920]   because we're just trying to be enough for everybody
[00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:58.120]   out there, and to the point that we've contorted ourselves
[00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:02.240]   so much that we don't even recognize ourselves anymore.
[00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:04.040]   Does this sound like you?
[00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:06.040]   This is my story.
[00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:08.600]   And the reason why I wanted to unpack this scripture tonight
[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:09.680]   that we're going to be walking through
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:12.320]   is because this is the greatest lesson God has taught me
[00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:14.000]   in the last three years, 2 and 1/2 years,
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.480]   that I've been in the city of Houston.
[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:19.080]   And so I want you to learn from my experience.
[00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:21.080]   And it's not only a story that's personal to me.
[00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:23.360]   It's a story personal to the guy that we're actually
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:25.160]   going to be looking at together tonight.
[00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:27.640]   We sang about him tonight, the God of Jacob.
[00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:29.520]   We're going to look at Jacob's life.
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:30.640]   And so if you have a Bible, you can turn with me
[00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:32.080]   to the book of Genesis.
[00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:33.960]   That's book number one, so you won't have to work hard
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:35.160]   to find it.
[00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:39.200]   But what you'll find is that as we come to meet this guy named
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:42.480]   Jacob, he is one of the patriarchs in the Bible.
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:43.880]   He is a hero of the faith.
[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:46.320]   And he is absolutely a scoundrel.
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:49.840]   Like, the guy is a con artist, man.
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:53.200]   Like his name, Yaakov, say Yaakov with me, Yaakov.
[00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:55.600]   Congrats, he just spoke Hebrew.
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:59.000]   Yaakov means usurper or supplanter.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.520]   Like his identity is one that says, man,
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:05.440]   I am going to swindle my way into getting whatever it is
[00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:06.280]   that I want.
[00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:07.840]   And as you read over the course of his life,
[00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.160]   which we're not going to do together tonight,
[00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:10.440]   but you can take my word for it.
[00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:13.600]   As you read his story, you find that's exactly what he does.
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:16.360]   Like he finesses his way into getting everything
[00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:17.200]   that he wants.
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:20.240]   He becomes whatever he needs to become to achieve whatever
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:22.280]   he wants to achieve.
[00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:24.340]   Because he's really just not happy with the way
[00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:25.240]   that God made him.
[00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:28.200]   And so we're going to look at his story tonight.
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:31.600]   And what we find as we read along is that he's in a moment
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:36.080]   where all of his identity issues are about to be confronted
[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:38.720]   because God shows up.
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:40.860]   And so it's in Genesis chapter 32,
[00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:43.120]   as all of you turn there,
[00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:46.520]   that we read these words,
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:52.200]   verses 22 through 24.
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:56.840]   It says this, and you can catch it on the screens as well.
[00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:59.760]   "The same night he arose and he took his two wives,
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:01.880]   his two female servants and his 11 children.
[00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:03.840]   And he crossed the Ford of the Jabbok.
[00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:05.880]   He took them and sent them across the stream
[00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:07.640]   and everything else that he had.
[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:10.300]   And Jacob was left all alone."
[00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:12.360]   So we can't see it in these verses
[00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:14.000]   because we were really catching this movie
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.400]   in the middle of its showing.
[00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:17.480]   And yet what we need to know is that the context
[00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:20.080]   around this story, it is critical in order for us
[00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:21.920]   to understand what exactly is going to happen.
[00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:24.840]   How is God going to confront all of Jacob's
[00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:26.000]   identity problems?
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:26.920]   What's he going to do?
[00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:28.560]   Well, we have to understand the context here
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:31.360]   is that Jacob is really in a moment where he's trying
[00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:33.080]   to preserve his life.
[00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:34.680]   He's doing what Jacob does.
[00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:36.520]   He's angling and maneuvering,
[00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:38.760]   and he's trying to make sure that he can keep everything
[00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:41.440]   that he's worked so hard to accumulate.
[00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:44.880]   Because his brother Esau is on his way to meet him,
[00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:46.640]   which sounds like a nice family reunion.
[00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:48.840]   And yet the truth of the matter is that's not exactly
[00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:49.760]   what's going to happen.
[00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:52.760]   Jacob is the brother that he swindled out of all
[00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:53.640]   of his inheritance.
[00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:55.480]   He was the firstborn, Esau,
[00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:59.400]   and yet Jacob convinced his father to give him
[00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:01.120]   the blessing instead.
[00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:02.040]   He deceived him.
[00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:03.160]   He lived up to his name.
[00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:05.200]   And what we know is because of that,
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:09.280]   Jacob has inherited all sorts of wealth and property
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:11.560]   and just prominence in the region
[00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:14.920]   that deservedly belonged to Esau.
[00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:16.640]   And so Esau's on his way to meet his brother.
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:19.080]   They haven't talked since Jacob stole everything
[00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:20.440]   and snuck out the back door.
[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:22.440]   And Esau's on his way, not by himself,
[00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:24.840]   but with 400 armed men.
[00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:27.800]   What do you think is playing through Jacob's mind right now?
[00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:30.160]   Payback, like this guy is about to come get
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:31.600]   his pound of flesh.
[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:34.400]   Like he wants to take me out and take everything
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:35.600]   that I took from him.
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:38.440]   And so what does he do?
[00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:43.440]   It says he starts trying to buy his brother off.
[00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:45.840]   He sends over all of his possessions,
[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:48.560]   all of his property, even his own family,
[00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:51.920]   until he's at a point where he is totally left by himself.
[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:53.980]   He is all alone.
[00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:57.440]   And then that's when God shows up.
[00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:01.080]   Like it's not coincidental that God will only confront
[00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:06.080]   Jacob's identity issues when Jacob is at last alone.
[00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:08.480]   And the same is true for you and I.
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:09.840]   That if you want to get to the bottom
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:13.700]   of your identity crisis, your problem, your issues,
[00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:14.960]   then the first thing you need to know
[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:17.560]   is that you have to stop hiding behind other things.
[00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:20.280]   You have to stop hiding behind other things.
[00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:22.520]   This is the way that God will work in our lives
[00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:24.840]   as he tries to establish and affirm
[00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:26.860]   his God-given identity to us.
[00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:30.280]   It isn't until we're truly alone with God
[00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:32.440]   that we're truly available to God.
[00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:34.400]   Then until we separate ourselves from the various things
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:35.600]   that we find our identity,
[00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:36.680]   and I don't know what it is for you,
[00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:39.760]   but I know for myself, like before I worked in ministry,
[00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:42.760]   I found my identity in my job and in my relationship status
[00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:44.000]   and how much money I was making
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.560]   and what my friends thought of me.
[00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:48.820]   Every one of us is identifying with something other
[00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:52.680]   than God himself to find some sense of security
[00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:53.660]   in this life.
[00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:54.700]   So what's it for you?
[00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:58.280]   But it's only after all of those things
[00:13:58.280 --> 00:13:59.800]   are rid from your presence,
[00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:01.560]   when everything is removed from you,
[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:05.400]   that you become available for God to actually fix.
[00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:09.320]   You see, you have to be vulnerable to become fixable.
[00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:13.440]   Anybody work in the medical field here?
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:15.160]   Yeah, they're quiet.
[00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:16.160]   They don't speak up.
[00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:19.880]   What they would tell you is that you have to,
[00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:22.640]   in order to properly clean a wound, to dress a wound,
[00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:25.160]   you have to properly expose the wound.
[00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:26.840]   I remember I was 14 years old,
[00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:28.680]   hooping in the driveway with my best friend.
[00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:29.920]   We're doing what boys do.
[00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:31.240]   Like we're out there, we lower the rim
[00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:33.680]   and we start yamming it because we want to feel big,
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:34.720]   you know, and I'm out there and I'm like,
[00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:35.800]   okay, I've got a one up my buddy.
[00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:38.040]   And so I decided to do Vince Carter's famous,
[00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:39.920]   like arm through the rim dunk.
[00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:44.280]   And so I go up and I stuff myself on the rim.
[00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:46.200]   I fall to the asphalt.
[00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:48.600]   And as I hit the asphalt, I break my elbow.
[00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:50.080]   So we get up, we drive to the hospital.
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:53.160]   And as we're on our way to the hospital, we pull in.
[00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:55.300]   I'm devastated, trying to hold it together,
[00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:57.880]   but certainly having a difficult time with it all.
[00:14:57.880 --> 00:14:59.640]   And so we walk in and they begin to prepare to set it.
[00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:01.280]   But before they can set my elbow,
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:05.520]   they have to clean it because it was full of black asphalt.
[00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:08.920]   And so my nurse, this mountain of a man from East Texas,
[00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:11.800]   walks in with a little bitty scrubby brush
[00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:13.400]   and he just starts working my elbow.
[00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:16.320]   Like he is working so hard to clean the wound.
[00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:19.580]   And he told me, hey, I have got to properly clean the wound.
[00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:21.440]   I have to expose the wound in order for us
[00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:24.380]   to dress this thing and set it correctly.
[00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:27.020]   The same is true with your identity.
[00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:28.280]   It has to be exposed.
[00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:31.920]   We have to be exposed if God is going to fix
[00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:33.520]   that which needs to be fixed in our life.
[00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:35.940]   We must remove anything that we would normally find security
[00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:38.960]   in until we are vulnerable enough for him to do his work.
[00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:41.240]   And from Jacob's example,
[00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:42.760]   we learned that we typically find security
[00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:44.240]   in one of two places.
[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:46.640]   We didn't read it, but if you go and you look at verses 13
[00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:48.840]   to 21 in this chapter, you see that Jacob,
[00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:51.880]   it lists out all the things that he owns and sends away.
[00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:56.080]   And it falls into two categories, trophies and titles.
[00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:56.920]   Trophies and titles.
[00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:57.740]   What are trophies?
[00:15:57.740 --> 00:15:59.920]   Trophies are the possessions that we acquire
[00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:01.220]   by adapting our identity.
[00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:04.280]   These are the things that your paycheck purchases for you.
[00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:06.200]   What your money goes to at the end of the day,
[00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:08.680]   the car you drive, the place you live in,
[00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:10.040]   the clothes you wear, whatever it is
[00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:10.920]   that you spend your money on.
[00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:13.520]   Like these are the trophies that you want to,
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:16.320]   you want to be associated with in your life.
[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:20.960]   For Jacob, this was his property, his servants.
[00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:22.840]   This is all of his wealth.
[00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:25.080]   Like he sends all of this stuff to his brother
[00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:27.080]   because he doesn't want his brother to come
[00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:29.620]   and do poorly with him.
[00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:31.840]   In the same way, we find so much of our identity
[00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:34.020]   in the things that we own, but it's not just that.
[00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:36.900]   It's also in titles, the positions that we acquire
[00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:39.140]   by adapting our identity.
[00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:42.100]   For Jacob, because he stole from his brother
[00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:44.420]   and he was trying to angle his way into security,
[00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:45.260]   what did he find?
[00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:47.580]   He became a husband and a father and an employer
[00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:49.360]   and a property manager.
[00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:52.200]   For you, it's going to be, man, I work in this job
[00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:53.900]   or I'm the most popular amongst my friends.
[00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:55.160]   I'm the best looking in the room.
[00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:56.500]   I don't know what title it is for you.
[00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:57.940]   And yet it's in trophies and titles
[00:16:57.940 --> 00:16:59.200]   that we find our security.
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:02.960]   God will take all of it away to fix you.
[00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:07.380]   He wants to pull all of it out of your life.
[00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:09.960]   That way you are vulnerable enough
[00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:13.240]   to at last be fixable as he wants.
[00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:14.420]   This is the first thing we see
[00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:16.420]   as God comes to confront our identity problems,
[00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:17.580]   but it's not the last thing.
[00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:20.700]   The second thing we see is in verses 24 through 25.
[00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:24.160]   And Jacob was left alone in a man, spoiler alert,
[00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:27.960]   God wrestled with him until the breaking of the day.
[00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:31.140]   And when the man saw that he did not prevail against Jacob,
[00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:32.680]   he touched his hip socket.
[00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:35.380]   And Jacob's hip was put out of joint
[00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:37.320]   as he wrestled with him.
[00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:39.960]   So we can admit, like this story is weird, right?
[00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:41.420]   Like there's nowhere else in the Bible
[00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:43.560]   that you're going to see God show up in human form
[00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:44.980]   and wrestle another guy down.
[00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:45.900]   Like that just doesn't happen.
[00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:48.440]   And yet whenever the Bible puts a story
[00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:51.360]   that is uniquely distinct from the rest of the scripture,
[00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:53.560]   it's there for good reason.
[00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:55.260]   And so it begs the question,
[00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:57.400]   why is this story in our scripture?
[00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:59.940]   What is God trying to communicate?
[00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:03.520]   Well, think about Jacob's situation.
[00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:05.220]   What's he trying to avoid?
[00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:07.160]   A fight.
[00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:11.060]   And so that's exactly what God brings to him.
[00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:15.300]   Jacob is doing everything in his manipulative power
[00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:18.140]   to get away from fighting his brother.
[00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:20.940]   But it's only then that the real fight begins.
[00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:22.460]   He has nothing to hide behind.
[00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:24.180]   He's all alone, which is pretty profound.
[00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:25.400]   He has nothing.
[00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:27.360]   And then at that moment that God shows up
[00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:30.040]   and begins to work him out.
[00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:31.320]   Because you see, friends,
[00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:36.320]   God loves you too much to not confront your identity issues.
[00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:38.120]   He loves you too much.
[00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:39.960]   Like he doesn't want to leave you
[00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:41.680]   wrestling with whatever insecurities
[00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:42.560]   you feel about yourself,
[00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:45.300]   whatever anxiety hangs over you about those things
[00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:47.700]   that you wish you could change yet you cannot change.
[00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:50.220]   God wants to tackle that stuff head on.
[00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:52.900]   Like he wants to confront it directly.
[00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:55.640]   And yet too often we don't want this for ourselves.
[00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:58.380]   But God's a good dad in doing so.
[00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:04.020]   It says in the book of Hebrews, chapter 12, verse seven,
[00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:07.860]   it's for discipline that you have to endure.
[00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:12.120]   God is treating you as sons, daughters.
[00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:14.500]   For what son is there whom his father does not discipline?
[00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:17.460]   For the moment, all discipline seems painful
[00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:19.260]   rather than pleasant.
[00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:22.760]   But later it's productive.
[00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:26.080]   It yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness
[00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:27.980]   to those that have been trained by it.
[00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:31.060]   If you are God's son in the room,
[00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:33.340]   if you were God's daughter in the room,
[00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:36.120]   he will discipline you because he loves you.
[00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:40.140]   And yet rather than let God deal with our insecurities
[00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:43.820]   and resolve our issues, we try to do it on our own.
[00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:46.100]   Like we often try to take care of our own problems
[00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:48.620]   and deal with our own securities our own way
[00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:50.060]   because we don't trust him.
[00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:51.540]   We trust ourselves instead.
[00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:53.180]   And so we do it in a couple of different ways.
[00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:55.980]   Like oftentimes what I see as I work with young adults
[00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:57.540]   is when it comes to their insecurities,
[00:19:57.540 --> 00:19:59.980]   what they do is they try to suppress them.
[00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:03.100]   They try to just squeeze them down as much as possible,
[00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:05.580]   minimize them to the point that you cannot see them.
[00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:06.600]   They try to avoid them.
[00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:07.740]   They try to ignore them.
[00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:10.260]   They try to do what I did to my truck in college.
[00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:11.700]   Like I tried to ignore the fact
[00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:14.100]   that my truck had some steering issues
[00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:18.560]   until eventually the point I couldn't ignore it anymore.
[00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:20.940]   Like the steering column came loose from the front axle
[00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:23.860]   and I needed to turn left and we are barely straight on.
[00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:27.040]   Like I am stuck in a moment of absolute crisis
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:30.100]   because I didn't trust there's someone who knows better
[00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:31.300]   who can actually fix it.
[00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:33.940]   I ignored the problem.
[00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:35.340]   I suppressed it.
[00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:37.300]   Or we obsess over it.
[00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:40.060]   Like we're so insecure.
[00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:42.220]   And so we spend hours in front of the mirror
[00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:44.180]   just trying to make this work.
[00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:46.000]   Or we spend hours at the gym
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.980]   just trying to get the bicep to peak a little bit more.
[00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:52.780]   Or we just spend hours thinking about the conversations
[00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:54.460]   that man, I wish I hadn't said that.
[00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:57.820]   Or why did I, stupid, like why did I say that one thing?
[00:20:57.820 --> 00:20:59.420]   Like what are they thinking about right now?
[00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:01.000]   We obsess over the fact
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.220]   that we have deep rooted insecurities.
[00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:08.220]   When rather than just suppress them or obsess over them,
[00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:09.380]   we should confess them.
[00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:12.900]   Should just tell them.
[00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:17.560]   God knows, he made you.
[00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:19.480]   Like he literally put you together.
[00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:22.800]   He knows exactly the things that you feel embarrassed by,
[00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:24.660]   that you wish you could change.
[00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:25.960]   Those aspects of your identity
[00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:27.680]   that you're working so hard to contort
[00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:29.400]   and just make sense to the rest of the world.
[00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:33.000]   He's like, no man, like just come to me with it.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.840]   I'll fix it for you.
[00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:36.760]   I can fix that.
[00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:39.640]   You see, the difference in who you are today
[00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:41.360]   and who you become tomorrow
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:44.280]   is found by way of wrestling with him.
[00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:47.500]   And so we don't avoid the fight.
[00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:48.600]   We don't run from it.
[00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:51.980]   He wants to engage with us.
[00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:54.940]   And so we engage with him.
[00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:58.500]   And we trust him to deal really kindly with us
[00:21:58.500 --> 00:21:59.740]   because that's his heart.
[00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:03.180]   And what we find
[00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:07.320]   is that it's not a very pleasant experience.
[00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:09.020]   I don't know what you're expecting,
[00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:12.220]   but if you've ever wrestled before,
[00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:14.580]   wrestling is anything but easy.
[00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:16.660]   And they don't just wrestle.
[00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:19.860]   They do it all night long.
[00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:23.980]   This is going to be difficult.
[00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:25.260]   And like as a peer to you, man,
[00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:26.660]   I just want to look at you and say,
[00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:29.660]   if you're signing up for this, it is for your good.
[00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:33.500]   Yet it will be really difficult, but it's worth it.
[00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:35.540]   This is what we're called to do
[00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:37.820]   because on the other side of it, there's blessing.
[00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:38.780]   That's where it goes on.
[00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:40.220]   As we read along, he says in verse 26,
[00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:42.740]   and then he said, "Let me go, for the day is broken."
[00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:43.580]   Come on, bro.
[00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:44.580]   Like this is sensible, man.
[00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:45.820]   We've been at this all night.
[00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:48.420]   Let me go, for the day is broken.
[00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:53.260]   But Jacob said, "I will not let you go unless you bless me."
[00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:58.700]   And he said to him, "What's your name?"
[00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:01.900]   Do you hear the question about identity?
[00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:09.020]   And Jacob, for the first time in his life, answers honestly.
[00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:11.420]   You see, if you read Jacob's story,
[00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:13.540]   what you find is that there's two moments
[00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:16.380]   where he's asked, "Who are you?"
[00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:19.420]   The first time, he flat out lies.
[00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:21.380]   He says that he is Esau.
[00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:23.620]   He calls himself by his brother's name,
[00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:26.020]   because again, he wants to become something he isn't
[00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:27.580]   to get something he can't.
[00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:31.700]   And yet in this moment, he finally just fesses up.
[00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:35.220]   He says, "No, man, I'm Jacob.
[00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:36.180]   "This is who I am.
[00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:37.900]   "I've got nothing else to hide behind,
[00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:39.660]   "and I've been wrestling with you all night long.
[00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:42.220]   "What more do I have to lose?
[00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:43.060]   "I'm Jacob."
[00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:45.060]   And he answers honestly for the first time.
[00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:47.260]   And what we see is it makes all the difference,
[00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:49.700]   because he realized he can't become something he isn't
[00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:51.740]   to get something he can't.
[00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:54.460]   I remember my first year working for Breakaway,
[00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:57.060]   when T and I first started out together.
[00:23:57.060 --> 00:23:58.780]   We would every year do this gathering.
[00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:00.220]   It was men's and women's Breakaway.
[00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:01.820]   It would be a worship gathering for the boys,
[00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:03.140]   and a worship gathering for the girls.
[00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:05.420]   And we'd bring in equally great guest speakers
[00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:07.340]   for both groups.
[00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:09.220]   And so I'm a guy on staff,
[00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:10.860]   and so I'm likely not gonna be with the ladies.
[00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:13.020]   I make my way to hang out with the boys at night.
[00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:15.060]   And so we're doing worship, and it's amazing.
[00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:16.220]   I'm sitting with our guest speaker.
[00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:17.260]   I'm kind of hosting him for the night,
[00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:19.260]   making sure that he has everything he needs.
[00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:22.340]   And then as I'm serving the room, just looking around,
[00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:23.820]   I noticed there are two guys,
[00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:26.740]   like sitting like three quarters of the way in the back,
[00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:28.580]   kind of like where y'all are back there.
[00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:29.580]   And they're just far enough
[00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:31.120]   that I can't make out what they look like,
[00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:32.500]   but they're sitting there,
[00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:33.780]   and they've got hats pulled on,
[00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:36.780]   hoodies over the hats, and sunshades on in a worship center,
[00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:38.460]   which is just suspicious behavior.
[00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:39.380]   You know, can we admit,
[00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:42.020]   why do you need shades on when the lights are out?
[00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:43.100]   It makes no sense whatsoever.
[00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:46.440]   And so I do what any sensible person would do.
[00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:47.460]   I go to investigate.
[00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:49.900]   And so I make my way over, I sneak around the back.
[00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:51.740]   I get close to where they're sitting,
[00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:54.660]   and you'll never guess what I found.
[00:24:54.660 --> 00:25:01.020]   Not two guys, but two girls.
[00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:03.420]   Sitting in the men's worship gathering.
[00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:05.580]   Are you in here by chance, the two ladies that did this?
[00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:07.220]   I would love to know if it's you.
[00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:12.060]   These two ladies are sitting in our worship gathering
[00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:13.220]   with all the boys.
[00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:14.740]   And so I had to ask them, I'm like,
[00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:16.420]   what are y'all doing in here?
[00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:18.780]   We just love this speaker.
[00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:23.660]   You see, they became something they weren't
[00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:25.780]   to get something they couldn't.
[00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:28.100]   (audience laughing)
[00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:29.540]   And that's exactly what Jacob does.
[00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:31.980]   And so many of us do this too.
[00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:33.780]   Like so many of us, we become things we're not
[00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:34.940]   to get things we can't.
[00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:36.740]   When instead, in our third step,
[00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:39.660]   towards working through our identity problems
[00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:41.860]   is we just need to start admitting who we are.
[00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:43.840]   We gotta start admitting who we are.
[00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:44.680]   That's what Jacob does.
[00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:47.420]   He finally owns the fact that his name is Jacob.
[00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:49.540]   And he's not Esau.
[00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:52.000]   Which is big, because this guy,
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.180]   he's built his entire life and his wealth and his family.
[00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:57.340]   His entire existence has revolved around the idea
[00:25:57.340 --> 00:26:00.460]   of being someone else that he thought had a better advantage,
[00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:02.380]   a better first step in life than he did.
[00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:05.260]   He built his whole existence on this reality
[00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:06.820]   that he was someone else.
[00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:08.940]   And yet in this moment, he finally just fesses up
[00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:11.780]   and owns that's not me, I'm someone different.
[00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:14.200]   And it's in that moment that finally, guess what?
[00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:17.700]   He gets what he's always wanted, a blessing.
[00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:20.060]   He lied to his dad.
[00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:22.660]   He deceived his brother to get the blessing
[00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:26.020]   that God always intended to give to him.
[00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:29.080]   If he would just be willing to own the fact
[00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:31.020]   that he is who God made him to be.
[00:26:31.020 --> 00:26:33.980]   Friends, God has a blessing for you.
[00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:37.700]   And I'm not saying what that blessing is.
[00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:40.100]   It doesn't mean that you're gonna get some fat check,
[00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:41.020]   that you're gonna be able to cash
[00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:42.780]   and go buy whatever you want.
[00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:44.340]   It doesn't mean that you're gonna get the dream job
[00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:45.420]   that you've always aspired for.
[00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:46.500]   It doesn't mean that you're gonna meet that guy,
[00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:48.760]   that girl this year, hate to break it to you.
[00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:53.200]   What it does mean though, is that God knows better
[00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:55.540]   what's intended for your future than you do.
[00:26:56.540 --> 00:26:58.020]   You can trust him with it.
[00:26:58.020 --> 00:26:59.660]   That's what this all boils down to,
[00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:01.820]   is a lack of trust in God.
[00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:03.700]   That God, you don't know what I need.
[00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:05.260]   You don't know as well as I do.
[00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:07.900]   I know me, you don't know me like I know me.
[00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:09.140]   And he's sitting here saying,
[00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:12.780]   if only you would trust me and admit the fact
[00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:16.740]   that I've made you as you are, I'd lead you into places
[00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:19.580]   the likes of which you'd never dream you'd go.
[00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:21.800]   I would take you towards a blessing
[00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:23.540]   that you've always wanted for.
[00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:27.700]   But you gotta stop relying on yourself.
[00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:29.460]   This is what he's doing with Jacob.
[00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:32.660]   And he wants us to admit the same.
[00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:34.500]   This is a really hard thing to do.
[00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:36.900]   Nothing about this talk is easy.
[00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:39.300]   Wrestling with God, that sucks.
[00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:40.780]   It's a really hard thing.
[00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:41.780]   I've been there.
[00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:43.980]   And admitting the fact that you're not as awesome
[00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:45.860]   as you try to make everyone else think you are,
[00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:47.780]   that's difficult too.
[00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:50.660]   It takes a great deal of humility
[00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:53.940]   to sit in front of God himself as well as others and say,
[00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:56.540]   I don't have it all together like you think.
[00:27:56.540 --> 00:27:59.540]   But it's in that place that God says,
[00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:02.500]   exactly, and I can work with that.
[00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:04.160]   I've made you as you are.
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:05.860]   Stop trying to be something you're not.
[00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:07.860]   Stop faking it, finessing it,
[00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:10.820]   to put on some sort of facade that fools the world
[00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:13.780]   into thinking you're much more than I've actually made.
[00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:14.980]   No, if you would just trust me,
[00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:17.220]   I will make you all of that and more.
[00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:21.020]   You see, we have to reckon with the reality that God,
[00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:23.880]   he didn't misassemble the parts when he designed you.
[00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:28.220]   Like you didn't fall into the defective pile.
[00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:31.260]   You're exactly as he wants.
[00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:33.740]   That's what Psalm 139 tells us.
[00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:35.220]   It says in verses 13 through 16,
[00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:38.860]   "For you, God, you formed my inward parts.
[00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:42.900]   "You knit me together in my mother's womb."
[00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:47.320]   Do you see like God's own hands were on your life.
[00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:49.820]   This isn't in my notes.
[00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:52.700]   Whatever the thing is that you hate about yourself,
[00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:56.860]   God's own hand was put to it.
[00:28:56.860 --> 00:29:00.300]   The fact that you don't like the way you look,
[00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:02.480]   the social quirks that you have,
[00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:04.460]   the way that you talk,
[00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:06.940]   that you're not as tall as you, whatever it is, man.
[00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:10.340]   Like God made you like that.
[00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:14.140]   The greatest commandment is love the Lord your God
[00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:17.020]   with your heart, soul, mind.
[00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:18.760]   Heart, we can figure out.
[00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:20.080]   That makes sense.
[00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:21.460]   Mind makes sense.
[00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:22.800]   Okay, let me fix my attention on you.
[00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:24.340]   Got affections and attention.
[00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:27.260]   But what is the point with loving God with your soul?
[00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:28.380]   How does that work?
[00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:30.580]   Anybody, have you ever wondered love God with your soul?
[00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:32.480]   I don't know, like that feels crazy.
[00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:36.700]   It means to love God exactly as he's designed you to be.
[00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:42.180]   That word for soul in Hebrew, it's the word nefesh.
[00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:46.260]   And it literally, it can be translated as well as breath,
[00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:51.260]   that God breathed into you a God-given identity
[00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:53.480]   and you cannot love him fully
[00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:56.040]   until you live into that fully.
[00:29:56.040 --> 00:30:01.760]   He's given you a very specific design.
[00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:02.800]   He formed your inward parts.
[00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:04.120]   He knit you together in your mother's womb.
[00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:06.560]   I praise you God for I'm fearfully and wonderfully made.
[00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:08.380]   Wonderful are your works.
[00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:11.920]   My soul, nefesh, knows it well.
[00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:13.840]   My frame was not hidden from you.
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:16.160]   When I was being made in secret, intricately woven
[00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:17.220]   in the depths of the earth,
[00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:20.780]   your eyes saw my unformed substance.
[00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:23.440]   In your book were written every one of them,
[00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:25.140]   the days that were formed for me,
[00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:28.460]   when as yet there was none of them.
[00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:33.060]   Friends, I don't know if anyone's ever told you this,
[00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:36.900]   and I don't know how easy this will be to receive,
[00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:38.300]   and yet you need to know,
[00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:43.060]   you have been so intentionally
[00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:46.420]   and so beautifully designed by God.
[00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:50.000]   And I'm telling this to you
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.860]   as a guy that needed someone to speak it to me,
[00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:58.040]   that wanted so badly for the approval
[00:30:58.040 --> 00:30:58.880]   and acceptance of others,
[00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:01.000]   I would do anything to get it,
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:07.260]   when in reality, I am already all that God wants.
[00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:11.220]   I'm exactly as he intrinsically designed.
[00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:13.640]   Who you are intrinsically is from God,
[00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:17.600]   but catch this, who you become eventually is for God.
[00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:20.680]   This is not a license to sin.
[00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:22.680]   This is not an opportunity to say,
[00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:24.220]   well, God made me this way, so deal with it.
[00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:26.480]   Like that's not what I'm communicating here.
[00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:29.480]   This is an acknowledgement that God,
[00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:31.880]   you've made me in your image,
[00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:34.040]   and you have designed me for your purposes.
[00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:38.380]   And when we reckon with that, we can admit who we are.
[00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:39.520]   That's the third step.
[00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:42.240]   The fourth step we find in verses 28 through 30.
[00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:45.140]   Then he said, "Your name shall no longer be called Jacob,
[00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:49.520]   "but Israel, for you've striven with God and with men
[00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:50.360]   "and have prevailed."
[00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:52.200]   And then Jacob asked him, "Please tell me your name."
[00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:55.400]   But he said, "Why is it that you ask my name?"
[00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:56.720]   And there he blessed him.
[00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:58.160]   I love that God asks him that.
[00:31:58.160 --> 00:31:59.760]   Why are you asking me?
[00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:02.360]   I just threw your hip socket out with the touch of a finger.
[00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:04.320]   It's pretty obvious.
[00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:05.240]   And he gets it.
[00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:06.800]   So Jacob called the name of the place,
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:10.680]   Peniel saying, "For I have seen God face to face,
[00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:12.720]   "and yet my life has been delivered."
[00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:14.800]   What does God say to Jacob in this moment?
[00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:18.320]   Like after all the frustration and the fighting,
[00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:20.260]   God looks at Jacob and he says,
[00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:22.660]   "You want a new identity?
[00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:26.560]   "You can't give it to yourself.
[00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:28.760]   "You want a new future, a new destiny?
[00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:31.300]   "You can't find that either.
[00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:33.320]   "I can give it to you.
[00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:35.040]   "I'm the one that gives new identity.
[00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:36.580]   "I'm the one that gives new destiny.
[00:32:36.580 --> 00:32:37.680]   "You want a new purpose?
[00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:38.920]   "Then come here.
[00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:40.200]   "Stop trying on your own.
[00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:42.380]   "Stop wrestling it out on your own grit.
[00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:45.260]   "Like just come to me and we can work together.
[00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:46.700]   "I've got great plans.
[00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:48.140]   "I'll lead you to them.
[00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:49.320]   "Just come here."
[00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:51.600]   He does.
[00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:53.900]   And you know what he finds?
[00:32:53.900 --> 00:33:00.080]   A name that to this day still describes the people of God
[00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:02.800]   according to our scriptures.
[00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:05.760]   The nation of Israel were the children of Israel.
[00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:10.040]   And to this day, as God has sent his own son,
[00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:12.720]   we have all been invited into his family.
[00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:14.880]   Jacob not only got a new name,
[00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:17.720]   a greater identity than he could ever find on his own,
[00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:19.640]   but he got a greater destiny.
[00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:22.080]   He got to live towards something
[00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:23.920]   that would be a blessing to everyone.
[00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:26.840]   And the same can be true for you.
[00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:29.520]   How?
[00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:36.600]   When you have seen God face to face and yet been delivered.
[00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:39.920]   When you meet Jesus Christ,
[00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:42.200]   who is God in the flesh,
[00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:43.960]   face to face with you and me
[00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:46.040]   and wanting to give away new identity,
[00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:48.920]   wanting to call you by a new name,
[00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:50.680]   wanting to invite you into new purpose,
[00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:52.800]   wanting to assign you to a new destiny.
[00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:55.560]   That's what happens whenever we come into,
[00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:57.080]   whenever we place our faith in God
[00:33:57.080 --> 00:33:58.440]   and we enter into his family,
[00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:01.920]   what we find is everything changes.
[00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:03.480]   You want stuff to change?
[00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:07.320]   All you have to do is believe.
[00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:09.600]   And (snaps) that fast.
[00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:11.560]   It's all different.
[00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:14.960]   You see, when you place your faith in Jesus,
[00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:16.560]   what 2 Corinthians tells us
[00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:20.160]   is that God gives you a new identity.
[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:23.200]   He gives you a new identity.
[00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:25.760]   Therefore, if anyone is in Christ,
[00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:26.760]   he is a new creation.
[00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:27.680]   The old has passed away.
[00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:29.200]   Behold, the new has come.
[00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:33.320]   That once you place your faith in Jesus,
[00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:35.480]   he gives you a new destiny, 1 Peter 2, 9.
[00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:38.160]   But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood,
[00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:40.720]   a holy nation, a people for his own possession,
[00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:44.040]   that you may proclaim the excellencies of him
[00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:47.200]   who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.
[00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:48.320]   This is available to you
[00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:50.520]   if you do the fourth and final step,
[00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:53.680]   if you at last start accepting what God says about you,
[00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:58.240]   that I've got a new name and I've got a new purpose.
[00:34:58.240 --> 00:34:59.880]   I can give you new identity.
[00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:01.360]   I can give you new destiny.
[00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:03.240]   Just come to me.
[00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:05.040]   And the reason we all know it's true
[00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:10.000]   is because God has sent his own son
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.640]   to change you in ways the likes of which
[00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:14.240]   you could never change yourself.
[00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:19.680]   So friends, stop hating your hardwiring.
[00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:22.600]   Stop indulging your insecurities.
[00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:24.440]   Instead, embrace the fact
[00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:26.460]   that your story is forever different
[00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:29.120]   because Jesus, the son of God,
[00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:31.480]   the long-proclaimed Messiah,
[00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:35.320]   entered into our story and he changed it forever.
[00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:38.480]   You see, Jesus, when he came in the flesh,
[00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:40.080]   the son of God became the son of man.
[00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:41.520]   When he stepped into our world,
[00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:45.760]   what we knew is that Jesus never once hid who he was.
[00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:48.360]   Like, he always made perfectly clear,
[00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:51.200]   "Hey, I am who I say I am.
[00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:52.800]   "I'm perfect, I'm totally secure.
[00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:54.120]   "I'm unafraid of anything."
[00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:56.280]   Sure, sometimes he would veil it,
[00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:58.480]   but it was to accomplish God's greater good.
[00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:01.400]   But when it mattered, at the final moment,
[00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:03.280]   he didn't hide at all,
[00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:06.640]   but he bore his identity fully
[00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:09.240]   that the world might find their own,
[00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:11.480]   that we might not hide any longer.
[00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:14.160]   Jesus, he never ran from the fight.
[00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:18.240]   Like, every single one of us enslaved to our sin.
[00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:21.320]   We were bound and captive, led into darkness,
[00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:23.280]   and yet Jesus Christ, he didn't run away
[00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:26.000]   from what was a really terrifying situation.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.040]   He ran straight into it.
[00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:29.360]   He entered into the fray.
[00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:31.200]   He crossed the halls of heaven
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:34.440]   and the corridors of history to get to you and me.
[00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:37.640]   And he did it because he wanted you for himself.
[00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:40.200]   He wanted to give you a new identity.
[00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:43.720]   Like, he never once concealed who he was,
[00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:44.880]   but he admitted it.
[00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:47.600]   By way of living the perfect life
[00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:49.440]   and doing what we could not, dying the death
[00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:52.200]   we all deserve, the wages of sin is what?
[00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:53.480]   It is death.
[00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:56.360]   That's what we deserve, eternal separation from God.
[00:36:56.360 --> 00:37:00.360]   Jesus stepped into the story, not concealing himself,
[00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:02.640]   but admitting who he is,
[00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:05.000]   that by his life and his death,
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.400]   and then on his resurrection, he could declare,
[00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:11.520]   I am who I say I am,
[00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:15.960]   and any that would place their faith in me
[00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:17.360]   shall follow me where I go.
[00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:21.960]   And amazingly,
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.440]   Jesus never rejected what God said about you and me.
[00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:32.800]   In his life, despite the way that people treated him,
[00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:35.080]   despite the sinfulness of us all,
[00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:40.960]   Jesus knew God has called you sons and daughters,
[00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:44.040]   and so I will look upon you
[00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:46.200]   and call you brothers and sisters.
[00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:50.600]   When you scorn me, I'll serve you.
[00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:54.960]   When you mock me, I'll still meet with you.
[00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:58.880]   When you hate me, I'll love you.
[00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:03.200]   This is the heart of our God for you.
[00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:06.680]   You want a new identity?
[00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:08.920]   You got problems with the way things are?
[00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:13.120]   Stop trying to do it on your own,
[00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:17.520]   because there is infinite blessing,
[00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:21.560]   better identity, and greater destiny with him
[00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:23.520]   than you'll find anywhere else.
[00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:24.480]   Let me pray for us.
[00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:30.160]   Father,
[00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:47.720]   as I just consider God the implications
[00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:49.080]   of a message like this,
[00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:51.680]   (gentle music)
[00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:57.480]   a talk, God, from the truth of your word,
[00:38:57.480 --> 00:39:08.840]   so consequential, Lord, that I fear any would miss it.
[00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:10.640]   As I think about that, God,
[00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:14.960]   I just genuinely want you, God, to come and move amongst us,
[00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:16.160]   and that's been the heart all night,
[00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:17.640]   and yet, God, now in this moment,
[00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:22.120]   people reckon with the things they dislike about themselves,
[00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:26.240]   the insecurities, God, they try and stuff down
[00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:28.040]   or compensate for on their own.
[00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:33.640]   As they consider God what may feel deficient in their life,
[00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:38.440]   distressing even, I pray, God, we would know.
[00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:43.280]   You're here, and you're saying, "Come to me."
[00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:48.240]   For some, God, it's going to require a fight.
[00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:50.320]   It's gonna require a wrestling match.
[00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:51.800]   God, that's what it required from me.
[00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:53.880]   Like, I had to fight with you, Lord,
[00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:56.440]   and yet I'm so much better on the other side of it.
[00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:59.520]   And I know they will be, too.
[00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:01.640]   Some here tonight, God, they have reached
[00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:03.680]   the end of themself.
[00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:05.360]   They have bottomed out.
[00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:09.960]   And it's now, God, that you wanna work.
[00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:16.800]   I pray they know, Lord, though they may have been laid low,
[00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:19.280]   you, God, will raise them high
[00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:21.680]   because you pull them to yourself
[00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:23.280]   and you make them like your son.
[00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:27.280]   Others, God, they have not reached that place,
[00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:29.320]   but they're here tonight, and they know, man,
[00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:32.720]   like I'm watching these things, listening to these things,
[00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:34.840]   saying these things, thinking these things,
[00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:37.240]   going these places, behaving like this,
[00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:39.440]   all because I do have some insecurities,
[00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:41.920]   things about myself that I don't like.
[00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:43.360]   I'm mismanaging my money.
[00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:45.440]   I'm mismanaging my calendar.
[00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:47.800]   I'm being foolish in my conduct
[00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:50.800]   because I just want people to like me.
[00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:52.680]   I just, God, want others' acceptance.
[00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:54.280]   I just want to be enough.
[00:40:54.280 --> 00:41:03.520]   By the shed blood and body of your son,
[00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:07.320]   you have already declared to all, you're enough.
[00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:14.360]   If that's you tonight, stop striving and start surrendering.
[00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:17.800]   We're gonna move to a time of worship now,
[00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:21.840]   and it's a chance for you to stand and engage honestly
[00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:25.200]   in a moment with the Lord, to take off the mask,
[00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:29.240]   to stop saving face, and to engage with him
[00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:33.080]   right where you are, to not hide behind things,
[00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:36.840]   to not run from the fight, but to admit who you are
[00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:39.240]   and accept what he says.
[00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:43.000]   You're forgiven, you're loved, you're mine.
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:47.120]   It's in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:49.180]   you
