1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:27,300
 - Ports, how we doing?

3
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,660
 (audience cheering)

4
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:30,760
 (audience applauding)

5
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:34,620
 If you're joining us from somewhere else in the country,

6
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,260
 we are so glad that you are.

7
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:39,760
 Dallas, I love you, so excited to be with you this evening.

8
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,260
 That bumper you just heard and watched

9
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:44,660
 means that we are back in this series,

10
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:47,580
 or still in this series, asking for a friend.

11
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:50,140
 And the question tonight is,

12
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:54,020
 what does it mean to be a strong woman in the church?

13
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,380
 Come on.

14
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:00,980
 Okay, so yeah, so some guys just thought,

15
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:02,700
 okay, well, I see your face.

16
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,220
 You're like, why did I show up?

17
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:05,540
 Okay.

18
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:07,180
 And here's why you showed up.

19
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:10,120
 God in his providence and his sovereignty has you here

20
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,020
 because guys, we have some work to do.

21
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:18,360
 And let me tell you how I found that out.

22
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:23,360
 And so we do this podcast called Views from the Porch.

23
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,180
 If you, yeah, check it out.

24
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:26,940
 David's very excited about it.

25
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:29,860
 David, you're a little red in the face

26
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:31,140
 during an announcement of sunburn.

27
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,660
 I know he was sunburned, if you were wondering.

28
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:34,580
 Yes.

29
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:37,780
 And so Views from the Porch, everybody listening,

30
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:38,620
 is like, who, yeah.

31
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,340
 Anyway, Views from the Porch.

32
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:44,300
 And so, you know, we talked about biblical womanhood

33
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,360
 a couple of weeks ago,

34
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,220
 and we re-recorded that a little while back,

35
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,500
 and that went live.

36
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,940
 And I know that a lot of you haven't heard that.

37
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:55,180
 And so about 11 o'clock the other night,

38
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,580
 I guess Monday night, I was going to bed

39
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:01,180
 and I got an email from a friend that I really trust.

40
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:04,060
 And she just said, "Hey, JP, I think you missed

41
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:07,100
 "an opportunity to encourage women."

42
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,140
 And he goes, "She said so much so

43
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:13,380
 "that I would consider pulling the podcast down."

44
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,180
 And I prayed about that and I thought,

45
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:19,500
 "Okay, I really trust this friend of mine."

46
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,660
 And then I got an email from another trusted friend

47
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,580
 that said something really similar.

48
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:27,980
 And I didn't have time, it was 11.30 now, okay, at night.

49
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,660
 That's past my bedtime.

50
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,660
 And so I'm thinking, "Okay, I'm not gonna go back

51
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,560
 "and listen to that this evening,

52
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,740
 "but Lord, I'm just gonna trust

53
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:38,040
 "that you sent some servants to care

54
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,960
 "and ask that that be taken down that evening."

55
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,820
 And I went back and I listened to it.

56
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:45,900
 And if I'm completely transparent with you,

57
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:46,920
 there was just some like, I'm like,

58
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,220
 "Yeah, you know, that's a conversation."

59
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,740
 And so there's always things like,

60
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,420
 I really wish I would have said that better.

61
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,260
 I wish I'd have been tighter.

62
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:56,660
 I wish that would have been clearer,

63
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,940
 you know, where I'm a verbal processor,

64
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,220
 so I'm kind of all over the map.

65
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,240
 But at the end of the day, I'm just like,

66
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,420
 "You know what, that could have been better."

67
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,700
 But also there was some confusion in my heart.

68
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,260
 And so when I have hurt friends

69
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:12,820
 and I don't fully understand why,

70
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:17,340
 I assume that I have something to learn, okay?

71
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,820
 And when I've hurt someone,

72
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,100
 someone is hurt by me or they're hurt,

73
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,380
 and I can't, and I'm listening to them,

74
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,700
 and I don't fully understand why,

75
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,620
 I assume that there's some work

76
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,200
 the Holy Spirit wants to do in my heart and mind

77
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,060
 to listen and to learn from friends.

78
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:35,060
 And what I've learned through this process

79
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:39,220
 is that there are a lot of women who are hurt

80
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,180
 just by what's going on right now.

81
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,780
 And that really grieved me.

82
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,060
 When I say what's going on right now,

83
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,300
 I just mean in our culture,

84
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:49,460
 like maybe you feel oppressed or lesser than in any way.

85
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:52,540
 And I hate that because I don't see that in God's Word.

86
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,780
 And if I'm reading that or if I've ever communicated

87
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:57,020
 anything that could be interpreted that,

88
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:00,860
 then I've missed the mark by such an incredible chasm.

89
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:03,400
 And so as we talk about what does it mean

90
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,980
 to be a strong woman in the church,

91
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,980
 I thought that I don't know if you guys know this, okay?

92
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:11,500
 But let me just be transparent about something.

93
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,100
 I'm not a woman, okay?

94
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,380
 (congregation laughing)

95
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,820
 And so even furthermore, to put a punctual,

96
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,840
 an exclamation point on the idea

97
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,380
 that I have a lot to learn on this topic,

98
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,000
 but I thought that I would invite

99
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,380
 one of the strongest women in the church I know.

100
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:30,220
 Would you please welcome to the stage my friend, Jenny Allen.

101
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,900
 Jenny Allen is with us this evening.

102
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:35,400
 (congregation applauding)

103
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,100
 Friend, I'm so excited you're here.

104
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,740
 Thank you for joining us.

105
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:43,500
 And so you, you're welcome to go there.

106
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,980
 You get a microphone.

107
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:48,580
 And so you've been someone that has sharpened me.

108
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,300
 I mean, you even in talking to me,

109
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:53,500
 just where I've missed it and helped me see

110
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,360
 in some of those conversations.

111
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,660
 So I'm really, I just appreciate,

112
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,680
 I wanna thank you and your husband, Zach,

113
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,720
 for you guys stewarding your time in this way.

114
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,820
 I'm excited to learn from you.

115
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:07,740
 My heart is to listen as well this evening

116
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,220
 and just thank you for being with us.

117
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:12,040
 And so if you don't know,

118
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:16,620
 Jenny leads one of the strongest movement

119
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:19,540
 of discipling women right now in our day

120
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,700
 called If Gathering.

121
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,900
 And could you just tell us a little bit more about that?

122
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,500
 - Yeah, are there any If girls out here?

123
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,900
 Okay, a few of you.

124
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,220
 A lot of you may not have heard of it.

125
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:31,020
 So it's beautiful movement of God

126
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,380
 where women all across the world said,

127
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:35,660
 "Hey, I wanna lead in my local church, in my community

128
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:38,100
 "for the good of people and for the glory of God."

129
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,620
 And so it's a discipleship movement.

130
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:42,580
 We provide tools for women all over the world.

131
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,740
 We reach 120 something countries.

132
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:48,260
 We reach over a million women every year

133
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,420
 when we live stream.

134
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:52,380
 And what we're trying to do is truly

135
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,540
 raise the value of discipleship.

136
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,740
 We believe that's how Jesus changed the world.

137
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:00,380
 And life on life, face to face, over coffee,

138
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,460
 this is how the world still can change.

139
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:05,620
 And so we put tools in the hands of women

140
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:07,660
 in their local churches to make disciples

141
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:10,300
 and to reclaim that value of discipleship.

142
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,980
 - Let's just a little bit more about who you are.

143
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,180
 And so you live here in Dallas,

144
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,020
 you and your family just recently moved here.

145
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,140
 And so I think we have a picture of your family,

146
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,900
 if we can put that up there.

147
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:20,740
 There's your crew.

148
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,380
 - Team Allen right there, yeah.

149
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,380
 So yeah, my kids are growing up.

150
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:26,100
 It's amazing.

151
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,260
 Some of them actually, one of them just started at SMU.

152
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,740
 And so he's a freshman.

153
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,820
 So I don't know if college kids are allowed

154
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:35,420
 to show up at the porch, but he might make a showing.

155
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:38,620
 And then our youngest, we have 18 down to 10.

156
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:41,180
 And our youngest, Cooper,

157
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:44,180
 obviously I did not bring him into the world.

158
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,300
 He is adopted from Rwanda.

159
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,860
 And our house is awesome.

160
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:51,780
 And I love this conversation because I'm raising two men

161
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,820
 and I'm raising two women.

162
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:57,620
 And so we talk a lot about these issues at our house too.

163
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:00,340
 So I know, and I was thinking, JP,

164
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:02,420
 so when the podcast aired, I'm gonna give you some credit

165
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,260
 because he actually asked me

166
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,380
 before the podcast was taken down.

167
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:07,580
 And that was a little bit of a mess.

168
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:09,580
 He asked me weeks before that.

169
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:12,180
 And so he had a heart for this to happen

170
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,540
 and for us to have this discussion.

171
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:17,940
 And what I know to be true is that,

172
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,300
 the reason that I don't say yes to things like this

173
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,700
 because I have a really clear mission.

174
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:26,940
 It is to teach this book, to preach the gospel.

175
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,740
 I actually believe life is really short

176
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,220
 and we're all gonna be in heaven really soon.

177
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:32,220
 And some of you are so young, you don't think that way yet,

178
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,180
 but you will because you'll watch your children grow up

179
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:36,380
 before your eyes and they'll be your age in a minute.

180
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:40,180
 And so I feel like life goes really fast.

181
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:42,380
 And so when I'm, I just stick to this.

182
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:44,300
 I stick to the book and I stick to Jesus

183
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,540
 and I want people to be saved.

184
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,540
 And that's how I spend my life.

185
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:49,260
 And when JP asked me before I even knew about the podcast,

186
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:54,260
 I was like, I don't know, this is a little bit loaded.

187
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,220
 This is a little bit loaded

188
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:59,420
 because I think we could get derailed here

189
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,820
 from just preaching the word.

190
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:04,140
 And if we get too caught up on our differences,

191
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,340
 but this is what I thought about

192
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:07,360
 when I decided if I was gonna do it or not.

193
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,980
 The first thing I thought about was all the women I meet

194
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:12,100
 as I travel and speak all over the world.

195
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:17,100
 And so many of those women are in some way holding back

196
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,700
 with their gifts for the glory of God.

197
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,460
 In some way, they have set on something.

198
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,220
 They are not leading like they could.

199
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,540
 They don't wanna appear too strong.

200
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,900
 They don't wanna appear too prideful.

201
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,820
 And you'll hear in a minute, that's some of my story,

202
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,700
 but in some way they're holding back.

203
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,660
 And I'm thinking to myself, holy crud,

204
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:34,220
 that's half the church.

205
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:37,860
 Like this should bother us more than half the church.

206
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,540
 If half the church is sitting on their gifts,

207
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:41,380
 so I just want you to raise your hand if you're a female,

208
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:44,140
 and in any way you have held back on your gifts

209
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:47,740
 or passions or personality or felt like I'm too much,

210
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,500
 any women in the room.

211
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,980
 - Yeah, it's a lot of hands.

212
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:54,980
 - So that's half the church that's holding back.

213
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:57,100
 And I'm not talking about with opinions

214
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,620
 or ideas or on Twitter.

215
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,820
 I'm talking about in your heart for the glory of God,

216
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:04,140
 for the gospel to go forward, for the kingdom to be built,

217
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,660
 you're holding back in some way.

218
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,700
 And then we have another half of the church,

219
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,420
 'cause I'm knowing, okay, this isn't just women.

220
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,260
 I'm gonna talk to you.

221
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,540
 I speak to a lot of women.

222
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:12,580
 This is men too.

223
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:15,600
 And then I'm thinking about you and I'm thinking,

224
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,440
 you know what?

225
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:21,120
 Almost every guy I have ever met is for me.

226
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,080
 They're for me.

227
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,340
 They're for women.

228
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,300
 They love women.

229
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,660
 They were birthed by women.

230
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:31,860
 - We need women for sure to live.

231
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:32,900
 - Yes.

232
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,680
 And so I have felt,

233
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,620
 I've been privileged to feel a lot of support by men.

234
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,100
 I'm gonna talk about my marriage and men.

235
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,980
 I have a great husband who believes in me and supports me.

236
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:45,200
 And he has actually pushed me out further

237
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,220
 than I would wanna go or be comfortable with.

238
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,660
 And so I've seen men before women.

239
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:52,920
 I'm thinking that when I look out at most of you,

240
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,180
 most of you want to make women happy.

241
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:57,300
 True?

242
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,860
 I know because I can smell cologne from right here.

243
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:03,200
 (congregation laughing)

244
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,740
 So the goal, when I'm making the decision

245
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,700
 and I'm praying about it and I'm thinking,

246
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:12,060
 you want me to come kick what hornet's nest with you JP?

247
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,920
 I'm thinking to myself, you know what?

248
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,980
 This matters.

249
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,700
 Because if there's this much division,

250
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,300
 there's a reason for it.

251
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:23,320
 And if it's the church, then guess what the reason is?

252
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,780
 The enemy.

253
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,580
 Like if there's division and confusion

254
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,780
 and women are holding back and men are confused

255
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:31,580
 and clumsy over what it looks like to support strong women

256
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:35,060
 and to help build strong women and believe in strong women,

257
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,540
 then there's a problem.

258
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:39,780
 So I said yes, and then the podcast.

259
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:42,020
 And then, you know what I see right now

260
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:44,300
 is just this beautiful opportunity for us

261
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,900
 to talk about what this looks like.

262
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:49,980
 And it's not easy and it's not always black and white.

263
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,340
 And there's different personalities

264
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,320
 and there's different gifts

265
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,380
 and there's different ways this flushes out.

266
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:58,140
 But I get excited because I think it's needed.

267
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,940
 - I love God and his beauty and providence

268
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:02,380
 because just to make this clear in case it's not,

269
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:04,220
 this is not in response to the podcast.

270
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,500
 This was on the calendar long before

271
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,780
 we ever even recorded that podcast

272
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:11,060
 just as we were moving through the series asking for friends.

273
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,500
 This is the number one question

274
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,420
 that gotquestions.org gets.

275
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,720
 If you don't know about that resource,

276
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,180
 it's an incredible resource.

277
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,500
 I commend it to you.

278
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,920
 And so you mentioned your husband.

279
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,700
 I wanna talk about Zach in a minute.

280
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,820
 I'm a big fan.

281
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:28,820
 He's been a really just incredible voice of the Lord.

282
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:32,780
 I think has come into my life at such a really key time.

283
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,780
 I wanna talk about Zach in just a minute

284
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,060
 and more about your family.

285
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,420
 But before we do, so you're traveling the world.

286
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,740
 You're seeing, you're exposed to lots of different churches,

287
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:41,820
 lots of different gatherings.

288
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,480
 You're discipling women.

289
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,260
 You're seeing women being discipled

290
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,780
 and really unleashed in the body of Christ.

291
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,420
 Did you always think that you would do this?

292
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,140
 Has that always been the plan?

293
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:50,980
 - Not at all.

294
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:54,740
 In fact, I was probably one of the shyest kids ever,

295
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:56,620
 which is funny now,

296
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:59,680
 but I was just, I wanted to make people happy.

297
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,220
 I had an idol of approval

298
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,660
 and it was very important to me

299
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,120
 to please the people around me.

300
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,780
 It probably started with my dad

301
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:10,180
 and it really bled into every part of my life.

302
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:13,140
 And so, you know, if you have strong gifts

303
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:15,140
 or you have a strong personality in any way

304
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:19,300
 or a passion to, a deep passion to see, you know,

305
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:23,020
 God move around you and all that comes out and bubbles over,

306
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,500
 you're gonna get in trouble sometimes.

307
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,820
 And so early on, I think I learned like,

308
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,220
 hey, don't be strong.

309
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:31,580
 Like put that back in and don't have too crazy of dreams

310
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,460
 and don't have too much passion

311
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,260
 and just put that in your back pocket.

312
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:38,240
 And so I did, and I did for a long, long time.

313
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,900
 And I remember I grew up in a church

314
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:40,940
 that was super conservative

315
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:43,780
 and I didn't have a lot of role models of women

316
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,940
 that were using their gifts to,

317
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:48,100
 in a big way to impact the kingdom.

318
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,540
 And when I say big way, I just mean in a full way.

319
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,180
 I don't mean like, I don't think everyone

320
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:54,020
 should go start a movement or an organization

321
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,220
 or write books.

322
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:58,540
 I think that we should all be about using,

323
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:00,100
 well, one, living out the good works

324
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:02,440
 that God prepared in advance for each of us to do.

325
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,940
 So we know that the Bible promises that.

326
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:08,060
 And then two, we should be faithful to the gifts

327
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,140
 and the talents he gave us.

328
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:12,300
 In fact, if we aren't, that's bad stewardship.

329
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,420
 And we know Jesus told a parable about that

330
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,540
 and it didn't go well for the people

331
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,400
 that didn't steward that well.

332
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,860
 So we've got to steward our gifts

333
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:20,140
 and we've got to use that to the fullest of our ability.

334
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:23,940
 But when I was younger, I think it was intimidating to me

335
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:27,980
 to, I think down deep, I knew I was holding back,

336
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:31,560
 but I didn't know what it looked like to love God,

337
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,100
 to have courage, to do hard things,

338
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:39,100
 to have passion for God and to still be tender and kind.

339
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:42,300
 I just didn't know what it looked like

340
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,940
 to have all these big gifts

341
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:49,460
 and to not cause so much trouble was the bottom line.

342
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:52,380
 And so as I moved forward in college,

343
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,900
 I just began to exercise those gifts

344
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,160
 and people started being saved.

345
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,540
 I would teach the Bible to a group of eight or 10 girls

346
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,980
 and people would be like, I want to know Jesus.

347
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,380
 And so we'd pray to receive Jesus.

348
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,020
 And I just saw fruit and I kept going

349
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:06,300
 and I kept using my gifts, but I had this rule.

350
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,140
 Well, it's funny.

351
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:09,860
 So I actually, I wasn't saved until I was about 17 years old

352
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,660
 at Canna Cut Camps.

353
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,620
 And yeah, yeah.

354
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,540
 And y'all know the crosses at the end.

355
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,780
 I had seen them every year

356
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:17,860
 'cause I'd gone most of my life.

357
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:20,580
 In my last summer, I was 17 years old

358
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:21,980
 and I looked at the crosses

359
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,700
 and for the first time I saw my sin.

360
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,660
 And I went home immediately from that

361
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:29,160
 and I wanted to teach my Bible.

362
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,780
 And so I started doing it to my friends

363
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,340
 and they were so annoyed

364
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:34,220
 and they were like, you need to chill.

365
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,680
 And so I got a bunch of freshmen girls

366
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,860
 'cause I was a junior and they would think I was cool.

367
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,900
 And I put them in a room and there wasn't Beth Moore.

368
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:43,260
 Like, I mean, Beth Moore wasn't on the scene then.

369
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:46,460
 And there weren't role models of women with teaching gifts.

370
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:49,500
 And so I start teaching them the, you ready for this?

371
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,380
 I was a brand new Christian.

372
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:52,180
 The book of Revelations, that's where I opened.

373
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:54,380
 - Nice, you chose the easy one.

374
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,220
 - Smart. - That's where

375
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,140
 everybody starts.

376
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,180
 - Haven't ever taught it since

377
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,020
 and since I've been to seminary.

378
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:02,580
 So I start teaching my Bible because that's just,

379
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:03,420
 that was my gift.

380
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,380
 That's what God made me to do.

381
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,580
 I didn't know that women could do that.

382
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:07,820
 I just didn't know they couldn't.

383
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,380
 So I just started teaching my Bible

384
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,820
 and making disciples with that gift.

385
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:13,420
 And so as it went, I would get affirmed and say,

386
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,260
 "Hey, that's your gift.

387
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,420
 "You need to do more of that."

388
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:16,580
 And so I kept doing it.

389
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:21,580
 Well, then I realized, oh gosh, I would very much like a man.

390
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:25,460
 And I don't know if a man is gonna respond

391
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,580
 to all of this.

392
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:30,820
 And so I just, I remember just being really insecure

393
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:32,220
 that I was just too much.

394
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,380
 I was too much for people.

395
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:38,380
 And so I constantly was editing myself and that's godly.

396
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,900
 Let me make a clarification.

397
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:45,260
 We are not talking about ungodly strength.

398
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:49,460
 We're talking about God-given holy strength

399
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,020
 that he's given us.

400
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:51,860
 Sin.

401
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:54,260
 And this book spells it out, right?

402
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:56,960
 And we were talking a minute about Philippians 2.

403
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,620
 And it spells it out.

404
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:01,440
 It's like, are we doing this for the good of others, y'all?

405
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,900
 For the most part, I was doing it for the good of others.

406
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,940
 I didn't know you could get famous doing that.

407
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,700
 I didn't know you could publish books doing that.

408
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,760
 I just loved God and I wanted to tell people about him.

409
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,580
 And so in that strength, and in,

410
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:16,420
 but then God opened doors and things began to grow

411
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:19,180
 and all of a sudden, before we knew it,

412
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,220
 but I do meet a man.

413
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:23,780
 And I meet a man and he actually, it's interesting,

414
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:25,940
 fell in love with all my strength and my passion.

415
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:27,380
 It's good, check.

416
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:31,980
 And then, can I go into marriage just a little?

417
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,460
 See, I'm being a strong woman.

418
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,400
 - Yeah, go for it.

419
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,700
 Is it all right if we talk about marriage?

420
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,540
 Is that okay?

421
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:39,360
 Okay, good.

422
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,820
 - Does anybody wanna get married in here?

423
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:43,300
 (congregation cheering)

424
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,860
 You know, Paul was funny about that.

425
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:46,300
 He actually said, it's better if you don't.

426
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,280
 I don't know.

427
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:52,300
 I'm just saying, but I love,

428
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:56,740
 I love that God brought me this man

429
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,520
 and we had to grow up together a little bit.

430
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:02,420
 I was in a place of fear and insecurity

431
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:05,180
 'cause I was in my 20s, y'all.

432
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:07,780
 20s, fear and insecurity, they go together.

433
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,060
 It's just, it's part of it.

434
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:11,940
 So if you feel that, you're not alone.

435
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,260
 It is just part of these years.

436
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:15,980
 And so we had to grow up together as a couple now.

437
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,500
 And it was funny, when we got married,

438
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,140
 all of a sudden, all the things he loved about me

439
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:20,980
 became a threat.

440
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:25,240
 And now my strength was very threatening to him.

441
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,340
 And he's sitting right here

442
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:28,860
 and he tells the story way better than me.

443
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:31,300
 But it shut me down.

444
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,460
 And 'cause you know what?

445
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,540
 I wanted to be a good wife

446
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:34,860
 and I didn't wanna cause trouble

447
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:39,860
 and I wanted, I wanted him to love me.

448
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:43,460
 And so I sat on my gifts, I put it away,

449
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:46,020
 and I sat on my passions and I held back.

450
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:50,300
 And what's interesting is a woman I really respect,

451
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,020
 after about five years of marriage,

452
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:54,980
 really challenged me on it.

453
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:57,820
 And she said, "Jenny, this is idolatry.

454
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,700
 "There's a name for this, it's idolatry.

455
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:03,180
 "Like you're choosing your husband

456
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:05,240
 "over God of the universe.

457
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:08,000
 "You're saying I care more what my husband thinks of me

458
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,400
 "than being faithful and obedient to this whole book."

459
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,940
 Because I wasn't seeking something ungodly,

460
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:18,220
 I was just seeking to use the gifts God given me,

461
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:21,980
 make him known, and it became unhealthy.

462
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:25,340
 And so anyway, in our marriage,

463
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:26,660
 we ended up in counseling,

464
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:29,140
 and in our, you know, about five or six years in,

465
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:33,420
 and it was the best thing that we ever went through

466
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,380
 because all of a sudden we could hear each other.

467
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:38,140
 And what my husband heard from me was,

468
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:42,580
 my wife has strong gifts and strong passion for God

469
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:47,580
 and she wants to serve him, and she's not because of me.

470
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:53,660
 And I think this conversation is so big

471
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:56,600
 because what if that were true of your wife,

472
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,980
 of your daughter?

473
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,620
 What if that storyline were true?

474
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:05,140
 Like if the women in your life would say,

475
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,540
 "I'm not fully serving God

476
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:10,500
 "because I think that you won't find me attractive."

477
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:14,420
 Or, "I think that I'm too much

478
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:18,740
 "and these strengths are going to cause you to get insecure."

479
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:19,960
 - Can I say something right there?

480
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,620
 So I think, 'cause one of the things

481
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,740
 that my friend said to me in that was,

482
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:27,620
 "Hey, I feel like you communicated

483
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:31,420
 "that you don't value a woman

484
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:36,740
 "being, you know, excelling in the workplace

485
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:39,940
 "or leading or even being a CEO."

486
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:43,460
 And gosh, I would never want to communicate that,

487
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:46,480
 and so I would want to clarify that publicly right now.

488
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,940
 I'm a dad of two daughters whom I love very much.

489
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:54,860
 I can't imagine just loving something

490
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,260
 as much as I love my two daughters.

491
00:19:56,260 --> 00:20:00,980
 And if one of them grows up to,

492
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:05,980
 you know, gets married and has kids and stays at home

493
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:08,740
 and, you know, is what we think of

494
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,500
 when we think of a homemaker, or, you know,

495
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:14,000
 words will fail me, but if that's what she does,

496
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,580
 I will be incredibly encouraged by that.

497
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,580
 And I think, man, that's fantastic.

498
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:20,460
 And likewise, and equally so,

499
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:23,780
 and I mean it when I say equally so,

500
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:27,420
 if one of them, you know, advances through a corporation

501
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:32,420
 and leads the company, I would be so encouraged by that.

502
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:36,820
 And in Titus 2, verse 10, chapter two, verse 10,

503
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:40,440
 it says that we're to work with excellence

504
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:44,620
 so that the teachings of Christ our Savior is attractive.

505
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:48,900
 And I don't think that's just a verse to men, it's women.

506
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,540
 Whatever you do professionally,

507
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,820
 I hope you're amazing at it

508
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:57,220
 so that whenever a promotion comes about,

509
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:01,380
 that your boss or supervisor, who may also be a woman,

510
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:04,680
 is choosing someone that you're the clear and obvious choice

511
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,940
 that, hey, this is who should be promoted.

512
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:09,860
 Like that, I hope all of you, everyone listening,

513
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:13,460
 is the hardest working employee for the glory of God,

514
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:15,940
 both men and women, that that would be true.

515
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:18,060
 So I just, you know, just to clarify that,

516
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,820
 insert that there.

517
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:24,380
 Okay, so I wanna actually say right now too

518
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:29,380
 that sometimes, I would say most of the time,

519
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:33,100
 that we're thinking that we're limited

520
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,840
 or we're thinking we need to sit on our gifts

521
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,380
 or we're thinking we can't do the thing

522
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:38,340
 that God wants us to do.

523
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:41,000
 It's not because someone told us we couldn't,

524
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,380
 it's because we've believed in our mind we shouldn't.

525
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:46,300
 And so, so much of this tension

526
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,140
 and why I believe it's of the enemy

527
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,260
 is there's so much unsaid.

528
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:52,120
 We never talk about these things.

529
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,860
 Like I love that you just taught me, JP,

530
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,180
 like, hey, I just wanna clarify

531
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,180
 in case some of you out here have these aspirations,

532
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,420
 these aren't ungodly,

533
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:01,020
 because I think sometimes we just get confused.

534
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,800
 We get confused about what it means to be a man

535
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,360
 or what it means to be a woman in the church.

536
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:07,180
 And so when we don't talk about it, it gets confusing.

537
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,660
 And I would say that represents a lot

538
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,740
 of what was going on with me.

539
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,820
 As I was setting my own boundaries,

540
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:14,260
 I just thought I was too much for my friends

541
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,980
 my junior year and I'm too much for my husband

542
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:17,140
 and I'm just gonna sit on all this

543
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:19,300
 and I don't know what else to do.

544
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,540
 But I wanna say too, I just,

545
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,200
 I wouldn't be here if I didn't see it happening

546
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,620
 for so many women.

547
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:26,760
 And I don't think it's all guys' faults.

548
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,460
 I think a lot of it's our faults, girls.

549
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:30,480
 Like I think we do this in our own minds sometimes,

550
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,140
 that we limit ourselves.

551
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:34,260
 And I know the obvious question

552
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,740
 that everybody wants to know the answer of is,

553
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:38,260
 what about roles and positions in the church, right?

554
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:41,260
 Like that's the loaded part.

555
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:46,140
 But I think we oftentimes get so distracted by that,

556
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:48,900
 that, and we find ourselves sitting on our gifts

557
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,000
 and our passions and our abilities,

558
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,740
 that we are missing all the work that God has for us.

559
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:58,320
 And my view on that is every local church

560
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,140
 is gonna have a different opinion about that.

561
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:02,140
 Every local church in Dallas, Texas just about,

562
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,660
 has a different opinion about that.

563
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:07,340
 So wherever you go, scripture just says, don't be divisive.

564
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:09,280
 You know, like if you commit and submit to that church,

565
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,900
 then be all there and be humble about that

566
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:14,340
 and understand that those elders have prayed about that

567
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,380
 and they're not anti-women.

568
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:17,500
 They just, you know, this is where they landed.

569
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,300
 But that's not the biggest issue

570
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:22,260
 when I'm thinking about men and women and using our gifts.

571
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:25,660
 The bigger issue to me is the way we view each other,

572
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:27,620
 the way we value each other.

573
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:32,180
 And I think what Zach heard with a third party present was,

574
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:35,140
 gosh, my wife feels like she can't be

575
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:36,740
 all that God made her to be with me.

576
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:40,720
 And so what began to happen is we,

577
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,980
 I mean, our marriage just went to a different level

578
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:46,740
 and we began to just pray together and say,

579
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:49,340
 God, we wanna just serve you with everything we have,

580
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:52,340
 anything that you want from us, we wanna do it.

581
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:54,260
 And so what that took the form of for a long time

582
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:56,400
 was a church plant in Austin, Texas

583
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,820
 that went on to become the West Campus of Austin Stone.

584
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,700
 And we led that church

585
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,900
 and my husband led that church beautifully.

586
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,220
 And then, you know--

587
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,780
 - Can I say this about Zach real quick?

588
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:11,100
 So, because you're a strong woman,

589
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,640
 but Zach is no shrinking violet.

590
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,580
 I mean, Zach is a strong man.

591
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:17,780
 He is a strong voice in my life.

592
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:19,940
 And so I want, I know you're talking

593
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:20,860
 and taking us on a journey,

594
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:23,780
 but I wanna hear about now what it looks like

595
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:27,120
 to co-labor through this platform

596
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,300
 that God has entrusted to you guys.

597
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,980
 And I do, you know, Zach was pastor in church

598
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:35,020
 and has an incredible ministry himself, so.

599
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:37,300
 - Yeah, and that went on for about 10 years.

600
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:41,060
 And about 10 years into it was when everything shifted

601
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:44,460
 and that co-laboring shifted in a way

602
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:45,620
 that we never would have foreseen.

603
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:48,020
 And my husband actually handed off leadership

604
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,100
 of the church to Austin Stone

605
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:52,140
 and we became members there.

606
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:53,520
 He's in private equity now,

607
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,300
 which is an odd thing for a pastor to move into,

608
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,300
 but that's what he did.

609
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,340
 And he's a starter, basically.

610
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:00,380
 He started a church because he's a great starter.

611
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:02,660
 And then he starts companies because he's a great starter.

612
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,060
 He's a great entrepreneur.

613
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:05,140
 And so he moved into that.

614
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,380
 Well, at the same time,

615
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:09,740
 the same time God was opening doors for me to use my gifts.

616
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:12,900
 I'd been teaching my Bible more and doors were opening

617
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:13,740
 and things were happening.

618
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:14,840
 And all of a sudden I was given more

619
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:17,020
 and more and more opportunity.

620
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:19,720
 And I remember coming home after I had received

621
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:22,980
 the opportunity to publish several things

622
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,120
 with a publishing house.

623
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,900
 And he had sent me on this publishing retreat

624
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:30,140
 and I came home and it was more than just one little book.

625
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:33,120
 It was like a career that they were kind of offering me.

626
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,820
 And I came home and I did not know if I wanted to do this.

627
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,700
 I had been a stay at home mom for years

628
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,980
 and I didn't know if I wanted to enter all this.

629
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:42,580
 And I brought it to him and he was quiet.

630
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:44,180
 'Cause he thought, okay, I don't know

631
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:45,860
 what that's gonna be like if my wife goes out

632
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:48,500
 and has a platform and leads all these people,

633
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,580
 what's that gonna be like?

634
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:53,900
 And then I'm here, what's gonna happen?

635
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:56,800
 And for three days, he prayed about it and wrestled.

636
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,420
 And then he came to me and I'll never forget this.

637
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:01,100
 He said, "Jenny, one day I'm gonna stand before God

638
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,060
 "and I'm gonna be accountable for your gifts.

639
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,820
 "And I'm gonna be accountable for how our family

640
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:06,060
 "built the kingdom of God.

641
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,900
 "And if this is the best way for us

642
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,820
 "to build the kingdom of God right now, I'm all in."

643
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:17,540
 And the years that have followed, he has meant that.

644
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:22,700
 I would say there's barely been a day that he has not said.

645
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:26,420
 And I want you to know, the dude is way stronger than me.

646
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:28,620
 He tells me no all the time.

647
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,980
 All the time.

648
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:35,980
 And it is, we're figuring that out.

649
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:38,820
 What that looks like to, but you know what?

650
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:41,460
 It isn't hard because here's the thing.

651
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:42,660
 We love this book.

652
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:43,620
 We love our God.

653
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:45,060
 We're a team on a mission.

654
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:48,500
 And how this book says marriage looks is laid out

655
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:51,760
 and we live it in that way.

656
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,660
 But it also tells us how to be believers.

657
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:56,380
 Like the whole book just talks about what it looks like

658
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:58,820
 to co-labor together and to build the kingdom of God

659
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:01,820
 together and it's constant humility.

660
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:04,580
 It's constant laying down our lives for each other

661
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:06,580
 and for the good of other people in the world.

662
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:09,780
 And so we're figuring that out together.

663
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:10,980
 - Yeah, I love that.

664
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:11,820
 I love that.

665
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:14,340
 So let me ask you, as you think about marriage,

666
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,540
 I'm gonna ask you a loaded question.

667
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:16,380
 - Okay.

668
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:17,900
 - So that's just a heads up on this.

669
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:20,060
 I'm gonna mention the S word, okay?

670
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:20,940
 - What S word?

671
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:25,100
 - So what does submission look like?

672
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,540
 Or what does submission mean?

673
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:27,780
 - Yeah, that word to me?

674
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:28,620
 - That's, yeah.

675
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:34,500
 - Okay, so here's the thing about that word.

676
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,140
 Tell us the thing about that word.

677
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:37,980
 - I'll tell you the thing.

678
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:38,820
 (congregation laughing)

679
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:41,140
 I'm gonna say something that you're probably not expecting.

680
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:43,780
 It is one of my favorite words.

681
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:46,860
 It is the greatest protection in my life.

682
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:49,700
 As a strong woman who is doing her best to please God,

683
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:52,540
 who is trying to raise four kids and not screw them up,

684
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:55,460
 I like you, I love them.

685
00:27:55,460 --> 00:28:01,240
 I don't care if you follow Christ nearly as much as I care

686
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,180
 that my kids follow Christ.

687
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:07,460
 So I don't wanna sacrifice my kids on an altar of ministry.

688
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:10,100
 I don't wanna be responsible for all the decisions

689
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:12,820
 of do I take this speaking event or do I,

690
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:14,380
 what do I do with all these different things?

691
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:15,620
 I love submission.

692
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:16,760
 Submission protects me all the time.

693
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,860
 So I bring things to Zach and I say,

694
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:20,340
 "Hey, what do you think?"

695
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:21,700
 And then he decides.

696
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,220
 And then he's accountable before God.

697
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,420
 It's gonna be awesome.

698
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:27,760
 (congregation laughing)

699
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:32,820
 I can't wait.

700
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:36,020
 Jenny, you shouldn't have done this, his fault.

701
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:36,860
 (congregation laughing)

702
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:38,980
 And I believe that.

703
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:40,740
 - He's gonna say, "But the woman you gave me."

704
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:43,260
 - Yeah. (laughing)

705
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:46,420
 - Heard that, I read that somewhere.

706
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:52,420
 - But I tell you what, I also know,

707
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:55,340
 I've talked to women all over the world

708
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:59,640
 that that word has been used like a pistol to their heads.

709
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:04,460
 It has been used where they feel threatened all the time,

710
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:07,820
 where they don't feel safe in their relationships,

711
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:09,080
 they don't feel safe with men,

712
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,740
 they don't feel safe with their dads,

713
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:13,020
 they don't feel safe with their boyfriends,

714
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:14,280
 they don't feel safe with their husbands.

715
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:18,460
 I hear this story all the time.

716
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:23,140
 So the fact that that word has a bad rap makes sense to me.

717
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:26,900
 It makes sense to me because here's the problem, guys,

718
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,660
 we're divided, but there's reasons on it

719
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:30,060
 for both sides, right?

720
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:34,100
 Where men have used submission as control.

721
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,420
 - Can I say something here?

722
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:36,260
 - Yep. - I wanna ask you guys

723
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:38,820
 a question, so not rhetorical, let me ask a question.

724
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:44,820
 According to the Bible, should women submit to men,

725
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:46,620
 according to the word?

726
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,340
 Some guys nodding their head.

727
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:49,180
 - I thought you were asking this.

728
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:53,900
 - Okay, so I wanna make it abundantly clear what it says,

729
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:57,540
 and the answer to the question is no.

730
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:00,860
 It's a resounding no with this follow-up.

731
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:04,080
 Ephesians 5, chapter five, verse 22,

732
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,960
 says wives submit to your husbands.

733
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:11,720
 Not women submit to men, that's different, okay?

734
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:15,000
 And so this is not like you're not coming

735
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,680
 as a single woman thinking, okay, now,

736
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:20,680
 the Bible says I have to submit to all men.

737
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,200
 That's not what the scripture says.

738
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,640
 In fact, it goes on to say,

739
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,920
 as they mutually submit to each other,

740
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:28,000
 so there's even further context given there.

741
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 And so a question that we're asked all the time,

742
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,900
 that I get all the time, what does it mean, from guys,

743
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,900
 what does it mean to lead in a relationship?

744
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:37,100
 And I'll give you a really simple answer,

745
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,620
 and I want you both to hear it.

746
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:41,460
 I want both sexes to hear the answer to this question.

747
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:43,740
 It means lead in purity.

748
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:46,420
 It means protect.

749
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:50,100
 What God has said is important,

750
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,860
 that you would flee sexual immorality.

751
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:54,960
 All other sins a person commits are outside the body,

752
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,180
 but whoever sins sexually sins against their own body.

753
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:59,460
 Do you not know that your body is a temple

754
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:00,440
 of the Holy Spirit who is in you,

755
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,400
 whom you've received from God, you are not your own?

756
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,800
 You've been purchased by a price, the blood of Jesus.

757
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:09,000
 Therefore, honor God with your body.

758
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,880
 And so as you're in a dating relationship, men,

759
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:15,180
 you're looking out in all ways that you can

760
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:17,240
 to her best interest.

761
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,840
 And I know we talk about and joke about in the church

762
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,080
 what it means to guard your heart,

763
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,040
 but it means that you guys are progressing,

764
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,720
 that you're both aware of where you're going,

765
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,540
 that there's not manipulation.

766
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:31,820
 Romans 12 says love must be sincere,

767
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:34,220
 that you're not playing games hard to get,

768
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:38,160
 trying to manipulate each other.

769
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,340
 That's not love.

770
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:41,300
 That's a counterfeit love.

771
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:46,300
 And so just as you consider, should women submit to men?

772
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:48,060
 The answer is no.

773
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:51,220
 The scripture says wives submit to their husbands

774
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:54,620
 and goes on to say there's a mutual submission there

775
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:55,620
 in the covenant of marriage.

776
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:56,700
 I'm sorry to interrupt you.

777
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:59,060
 - No, that's so, so clear and important

778
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:01,540
 because I do think that all these myths, right?

779
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:03,620
 We have built on the words of God.

780
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:05,060
 We have added to the words of God

781
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:06,140
 and we've gotten so confused

782
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,300
 and we wonder why we're confused.

783
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:10,060
 And we put godliness attached to things

784
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:13,540
 that Jesus would be appalled at.

785
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:14,380
 You know what I mean?

786
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:16,180
 Abuse, attaching submission to abuse.

787
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:20,740
 I mean, these are not things that the writers of the Bible

788
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:21,700
 and that God meant.

789
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:26,580
 This is where we have taken things and caused hurt.

790
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:29,100
 And I think that's why this does feel loaded sometimes

791
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:31,300
 is there has been so much hurt.

792
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:35,280
 And so I was reading in Philippians 2 this morning

793
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,020
 and I just thought this was so perfect for today.

794
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:39,060
 It says, 'cause this is just true for all of us.

795
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:41,220
 It says, "Complete my joy," this is Paul,

796
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:43,180
 "Complete my joy by being of the same mind,

797
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:45,980
 "having the same love, being in full accord

798
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:47,100
 "and of one mind.

799
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,660
 "Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit,

800
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:51,940
 "but in humility count others more significant

801
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:52,860
 "than yourselves.

802
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:55,460
 "Let each of you look not only to his own interests,

803
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:57,080
 "but also to the interests of others.

804
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,680
 "Have this mind among yourselves,

805
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,380
 "which is yours in Christ Jesus,

806
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:02,520
 "who though he was in the form of God

807
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:06,420
 "did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped,

808
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:09,280
 "but emptied himself by taking the form of a servant,

809
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,020
 "being born in the likeness of men

810
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:12,580
 "and being found in human form.

811
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:14,720
 "He humbled himself by becoming obedient

812
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,040
 "to the point of death, even death on a cross.

813
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,700
 "Therefore God has highly exalted him

814
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:22,380
 "and bestowed on him the name that is above every name."

815
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:24,780
 But this is the mind we're to have, whether we're,

816
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:27,340
 and I think sometimes when we're talking about men and women

817
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,820
 we look at these very few verses

818
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:29,860
 that address men and women,

819
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:33,800
 rather than the whole Bible that addresses Christians.

820
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,860
 And above our identity of our gender

821
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:38,780
 is our identity in Christ.

822
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:41,180
 And so whenever, however you treat women,

823
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:43,820
 whether it's, I mean, I think about the issue of pornography

824
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:46,020
 if we truly believe these are our sisters,

825
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:49,140
 these are image bearers beside us,

826
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:51,940
 like it changes the way you view that,

827
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:54,180
 the value of women, how you esteem women,

828
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:57,220
 how you see them as your sisters,

829
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:59,420
 co-laborers, co-workers,

830
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:00,780
 building the kingdom of God together.

831
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:03,620
 It changes the way you live.

832
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:04,900
 It changes the way you do everything.

833
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:07,500
 And that gets me excited,

834
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,660
 because I think what if we haven't even come close

835
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:12,500
 to realizing that as a church yet, you know?

836
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,100
 And I think for women, a lot of women

837
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:17,020
 end up feeling more valued at the workplace

838
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:18,860
 than they do at the church.

839
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:22,300
 And as these conversations happen,

840
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:24,540
 I'm seeing this little light in women's eyes

841
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:25,840
 where they're like, hey,

842
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,700
 so you think I have something to contribute.

843
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:28,780
 You think I can play.

844
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:30,220
 You think I can help here.

845
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:32,100
 And it's happening.

846
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,060
 I mean, it's happening.

847
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:34,460
 - Yeah, I would just say here,

848
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:38,320
 I know that a significant of you don't go to church here,

849
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,500
 and a lot of you do here at Watermark.

850
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:43,660
 And so just was recently tasked by the elders.

851
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:46,820
 They said, hey, as you think about these opportunities,

852
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:50,420
 I want to make sure that the women here in this body

853
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:53,820
 have every opportunity to use their gifts in this body.

854
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:55,020
 And so that's something that our elders

855
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:58,300
 are constantly thinking about and praying about.

856
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:01,660
 But I wanna say this to what you said,

857
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:05,700
 because this has spurred on a lot of conversations

858
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:06,540
 in the podcast.

859
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:11,220
 And one thing that I miscommunicated

860
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:15,500
 and was not clear on was a statement.

861
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:18,940
 And in the context, I was talking about the fallen world.

862
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:22,820
 And I said, I think that there are a lot of guys

863
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:26,300
 that are intimidated by a strong woman.

864
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:28,120
 And something that you've said

865
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,260
 and other friends have said to me

866
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:32,180
 is I think that's a huge fear of women is,

867
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:35,600
 hey, if I exercise strength or demonstrate strength,

868
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:39,460
 then I'm not gonna be seen as attractive by men.

869
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:44,060
 And if that's true, it's the result of sin in the world

870
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:46,740
 that I hope men would look for a strong woman

871
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:49,020
 like you talked about, Zach,

872
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:51,020
 that they wouldn't be intimidated by that.

873
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:52,980
 But I think just to talk to the men for a minute,

874
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:57,180
 the reality is a problem that every man,

875
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:58,780
 every man I know,

876
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:03,660
 attraction, what they view as attractive,

877
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,940
 is tainted by sin.

878
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:07,460
 Okay, and I don't wanna be accused

879
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:09,100
 as overstating something.

880
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:13,260
 So let me clarify what I mean when I say every man I know.

881
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:16,180
 What I mean is every single male

882
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:18,600
 I've ever met in my entire life, okay,

883
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:24,180
 what they are attracted to is tainted by sin,

884
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:29,140
 especially if you have viewed pornography,

885
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:32,180
 which is the vast majority of you.

886
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:34,580
 And so you have to understand that,

887
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:37,260
 that there needs to be this earnest prayer

888
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:41,020
 going on in your life that you would be asking God,

889
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:44,580
 help me to be attracted to what you're attracted to,

890
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:46,700
 that God who looks at the heart

891
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:50,220
 and would love, would love a woman

892
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:52,580
 to represent Him well in the workplace,

893
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:57,300
 to be strong in the workplace or in life in general,

894
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:00,620
 that you would be attracted to what God is attracted to,

895
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:03,820
 not intimidated in any way by that.

896
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:06,580
 And so that's what I meant,

897
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:09,100
 but I'm not sure that that was clear, so.

898
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,380
 - Well, and it's why it's so,

899
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:12,140
 it's great to have these conversations.

900
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:13,460
 And our hope is that you're gonna go out

901
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:15,300
 and have these conversations together.

902
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:20,020
 And I would just recommend men listen, listen,

903
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:21,100
 because I think sometimes,

904
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,400
 in fact, I've talked to so many women,

905
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,580
 even preparing for this night,

906
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:26,380
 who said, I always have opinions,

907
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:28,700
 but I don't wanna seem too strong.

908
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:30,880
 I don't wanna be combative.

909
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,740
 I don't wanna come off as prideful or arrogant.

910
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:36,460
 And I'm thinking, do you guys really just want duds?

911
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:37,460
 Like, what do you want?

912
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:40,500
 Like, you want people that think and that have opinions

913
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:43,620
 and that have feelings and that will push you

914
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:44,980
 and that will make you better.

915
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:47,540
 And I'll tell you what, let me tell you,

916
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:49,780
 let me tell you where our marriage is now.

917
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:53,600
 We are so madly in love.

918
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,260
 I feel like you need to come up here and affirm this truth.

919
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:58,700
 (congregation laughing)

920
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:00,620
 I mean, I'm not kidding.

921
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:05,620
 I feel like our marriage, like every, I'm gonna brag.

922
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:07,700
 I think every single one of you should aspire

923
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:10,580
 to the marriage I have because it is that good.

924
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:12,340
 My daughter, my 16 year old is like,

925
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:14,100
 mom, I need to go to counseling

926
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,700
 and because you all love each other too much.

927
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:18,300
 Like, that's what she wants to tell her counselor.

928
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,140
 I'm like, good luck.

929
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:21,180
 I'm sure they're gonna feel very sorry for you.

930
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:22,780
 (congregation laughing)

931
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:25,620
 But we are like, we are madly in love.

932
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:26,440
 And you know why?

933
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,660
 Not because everything is easy.

934
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:31,220
 In fact, can you imagine these two really strong people

935
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:32,060
 married to each other?

936
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:34,140
 It's really messy, a lot.

937
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:39,140
 But it's because we are absolutely single-mindedly focused

938
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:41,980
 on building the kingdom of God together.

939
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:44,620
 And it is the most fun way to live.

940
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:46,520
 And we're not competing.

941
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,460
 And I look at all these movies right now.

942
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:50,060
 I mentioned this on Instagram recently.

943
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:51,340
 I'm watching movies and I'm thinking,

944
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:56,260
 why is every movie based on people that are cranky

945
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:58,260
 because someone in their family succeeded?

946
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:00,260
 You know, incredible, like there's all these movies

947
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:01,500
 right now that are coming out.

948
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:02,420
 (congregation laughing)

949
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:04,180
 And like people are at home like crying

950
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:06,220
 'cause some, they're like, it could be a man

951
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:07,860
 or a woman or a child.

952
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:10,740
 And what I, I had to post something

953
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:13,420
 'cause I was like, guys, family doesn't have to be that way.

954
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:16,160
 It could be that if somebody in your family wins,

955
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,200
 you feel like you all won

956
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,580
 because you were a part of it, literally.

957
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:21,100
 I mean, tonight my daughter got,

958
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:24,420
 my youngest daughter got locked in the bathroom.

959
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:26,000
 And I think she might still be there

960
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,540
 because both of us are here.

961
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:28,540
 (congregation laughing)

962
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:29,660
 She's still in the bathroom?

963
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:30,500
 Are you serious?

964
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:32,780
 - What?

965
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:34,220
 - He said, we'll address it later.

966
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:37,820
 (congregation laughing)

967
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:39,300
 Hey, we'll wrap this up.

968
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:40,420
 We'll wrap this up.

969
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:44,760
 - But here's the beauty is he fed them dinner tonight.

970
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:48,060
 And one of them is locked in the bathroom,

971
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:53,060
 but besides that, and I think we're a team on a mission

972
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:55,060
 and I know right now my daughter is regretting

973
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,700
 that she signed up for this mission,

974
00:39:56,700 --> 00:40:00,260
 but in life, like this is how we work.

975
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:04,540
 If somebody wins, if my son wins the state championship,

976
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:05,980
 that was a picture from the state championship

977
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:06,820
 in Texas this year.

978
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:07,900
 If my son wins the state championship.

979
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:08,780
 - No big deal.

980
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:10,180
 - It's big deal.

981
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:11,740
 (congregation laughing)

982
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:13,740
 Then our whole family thinks

983
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:16,020
 they won the state championship.

984
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:17,220
 And that's how this should be,

985
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:19,100
 is that we're building the kingdom of God together,

986
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:21,840
 co-laboring men and women across the church,

987
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,900
 doing the best we can to pour out our gifts,

988
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:27,540
 to see each other succeed, to see the other one.

989
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:28,940
 And if there's anything holding them back,

990
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:30,180
 it should bother us.

991
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:31,500
 And so anyway.

992
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:34,820
 - Yeah, so what you said, you mentioned this,

993
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:39,820
 you just said, JP, guys don't want a passive, insecure girl.

994
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:40,700
 They want a strong girl.

995
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:43,020
 And I just said, here's how I would respond to that,

996
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:45,740
 honestly, is by my observation,

997
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:48,660
 this is my opinion now based on my observation,

998
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:53,660
 some guys do because of their own brokenness and sin

999
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:55,420
 and their own spiritual journey,

1000
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:57,380
 and they haven't gotten to this place

1001
00:40:57,380 --> 00:41:00,420
 where the Lord has sanctified them

1002
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:03,980
 to be attracted to what he's attracted to.

1003
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:05,780
 And I think it is a result.

1004
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:08,860
 I'm so passionate about just this idea

1005
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:10,860
 of what pornography is doing to dating.

1006
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:12,580
 I would just tell you, if you're listening

1007
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:13,500
 and you're looking at porn,

1008
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:16,780
 I know more than half of you are, you gotta stop.

1009
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:18,620
 It's ruining your marriage

1010
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:20,840
 long before you even found your prospect.

1011
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:23,900
 I'm talking to guys and girls alike, men and women alike.

1012
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,460
 If you're looking at pornography,

1013
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:29,140
 the enemy is using it to ruin you.

1014
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:31,460
 And you have to stop.

1015
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:33,820
 And I'm not trying to put guilt and shame on your shoulders.

1016
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:35,740
 And I'm not just saying stop, go figure it out.

1017
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:38,460
 I'm saying, hey, we as the church, we are here.

1018
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:41,280
 We wanna help you come forward.

1019
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,860
 In a minute, there'll be folks up here that you can talk to.

1020
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:46,660
 Please come and talk to them.

1021
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:51,220
 But guys, I want you to go home and beg God,

1022
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:54,460
 beg him to give you eyes to be attracted to,

1023
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:58,300
 to see what he sees as beautiful, that you would do that.

1024
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:01,660
 Just beg him, say, Lord, would you please answer this prayer

1025
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:06,380
 that I would see as attractive what you see as attractive,

1026
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:08,900
 what you see as beautiful, God.

1027
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:12,960
 Because I will tell you, the other greatest frustration

1028
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,540
 in leading a young adults ministry over the past 12 years,

1029
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:19,040
 especially in talking about believers,

1030
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:24,040
 is just so many amazing women who guys aren't asking out.

1031
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:27,840
 And you're not taking initiative.

1032
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:31,320
 And so please, I just, please reject passivity, men,

1033
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,320
 and initiate, so.

1034
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,520
 - That's good.

1035
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:37,620
 Yeah, I think about what's possible.

1036
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:38,960
 This is how I'm wired.

1037
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,700
 One of the ways I'm wired is I always picture

1038
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:43,080
 things in a big swath.

1039
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:45,580
 So I picture even this room, and I think about Dallas,

1040
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:47,120
 and I think about all of you.

1041
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:49,840
 And the reason I risked kicking this little hornet's nest

1042
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:54,020
 a little is because I feel like if this whole room

1043
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:58,880
 was unleashed to use their gifts to be for each other

1044
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,120
 instead of in any way using each other

1045
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,960
 or competing with each other or putting each other down

1046
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,820
 or posturing against each other,

1047
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:09,040
 but you literally saw each other until there was,

1048
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:12,600
 you know, something more that in general,

1049
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:14,360
 you just assume we're co-laboring.

1050
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:16,300
 At a minimum, we are co-laboring.

1051
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:18,840
 And maybe we should make babies together one day

1052
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:19,720
 and I should put a ring on it.

1053
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:23,320
 But in the meantime, we are co-laboring.

1054
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:25,720
 And I just think the damage that a room like this

1055
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:27,280
 could do for the kingdom of God.

1056
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,880
 - And not in that order, by the way, I just wanna say,

1057
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:32,920
 put a ring on it and make babies together.

1058
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:33,760
 - I second.

1059
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:34,680
 - Yeah.

1060
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:37,660
 - So that is our hope.

1061
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:39,720
 I mean, JP and I talked a lot about this

1062
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:41,000
 before we got up here.

1063
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,360
 And both of us just, we want you guys

1064
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:46,320
 to be brothers and sisters in Christ.

1065
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,840
 We want you to be for each other

1066
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:52,000
 and we wanna see the kingdom of God built through your gifts

1067
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,520
 and wherever that's being held back,

1068
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:57,840
 we don't, we wanna pray against it and fight it.

1069
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:59,480
 - Any other hopes for the church

1070
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:02,000
 as you think of men and women in our generation?

1071
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,920
 Any closing thoughts around that?

1072
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:09,320
 - You know, I have these four kids that,

1073
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:11,920
 I mean, I can't pick if I like boys or girls better

1074
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,200
 'cause God gave me two of both.

1075
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:16,760
 And I love them so much.

1076
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:19,240
 And I'm watching my 16 year old grow up

1077
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:24,960
 and she would say, "Mom, I worry sometimes

1078
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,720
 "that she felt like, gosh, things took away

1079
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:29,220
 "from my childhood, like ministry

1080
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:31,480
 "or you were gone some or whatever."

1081
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:32,860
 And she said, "Mom, don't you know the reason

1082
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:33,940
 "I wanna help people in life

1083
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:35,880
 "is because I watched you help people in life."

1084
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:39,080
 And so we've gotta realize that these little people

1085
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:39,920
 that we're gonna raise one day,

1086
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,480
 and some of you can't imagine that,

1087
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:44,460
 but the day will come faster than you know,

1088
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:46,540
 that a generation is coming and they're watching us

1089
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:48,240
 about what it looks like to be godly,

1090
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,320
 about what it looks like to obey this book,

1091
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,160
 about what it looks like to be co-laborers,

1092
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,440
 about what it looks like to be married

1093
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,200
 or what it looks like to be single.

1094
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,400
 And this book says, you know what?

1095
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:01,720
 It looks like running our guts out,

1096
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:03,440
 deferring to each other's needs.

1097
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:06,280
 It looks like caring about this kingdom that's coming

1098
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:09,520
 and not ourselves and not looking to our own interests,

1099
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,580
 but to look to the others and to remember

1100
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:13,300
 that this is all going somewhere.

1101
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:15,440
 This is all going somewhere and it matters.

1102
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:18,280
 And so what I see in this room is not a bunch of singles

1103
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:20,520
 or a bunch of young adults.

1104
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:24,340
 I see co-laborers that I want to build the kingdom of God

1105
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:27,560
 because it matters and your lives matter.

1106
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:29,760
 And I think we are better together.

1107
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,080
 I know we are better together.

1108
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:35,280
 And so, you know, I thought about how to end the night too.

1109
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,480
 And I was thinking about all the guys

1110
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:40,060
 and I just wanna say one more thing to you,

1111
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:43,440
 that in so many ways, you're doing a great job.

1112
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,960
 In so many ways, you have fought for your sisters,

1113
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:49,880
 you have fought for the girls you care about in your life.

1114
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:53,160
 And I think largely, and we were talking about this backstage

1115
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:58,160
 I think largely, you really do want the women in your lives

1116
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:00,660
 to thrive and to win.

1117
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:01,500
 Is that true?

1118
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:05,520
 Say something 'cause all the women would love to hear it.

1119
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,480
 (congregation cheering)

1120
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:10,800
 Yeah, I think that's real women.

1121
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:13,840
 And I think sometimes we just get to smile

1122
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:16,000
 and assume the best and run hard.

1123
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,400
 And when it is time, if it is time for you to meet that man,

1124
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:20,240
 you know what?

1125
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:21,360
 He's gonna be running.

1126
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:22,440
 I mean, remember the old story?

1127
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:24,300
 He's gonna be running right beside you.

1128
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:25,760
 You're gonna see that and you're gonna find out

1129
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:26,720
 you can be teammates together.

1130
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:31,720
 And it's complicated, but it's also super simple.

1131
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:37,760
 Seek ye first, the kingdom of God,

1132
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,360
 and all these other things will be added to you.

1133
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:41,440
 And I'm not necessarily talking about marriage.

1134
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:44,640
 I just mean, you will get to live the works,

1135
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:47,320
 the good works that God prepared in advance for you to live.

1136
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:50,120
 - It's a verse I respond, I go back to.

1137
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:51,980
 And in fact, I've gone to my community group

1138
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:54,660
 and I know you and Zach are in community as well.

1139
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:57,080
 And I've just told the guys in my group, I said,

1140
00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:00,640
 "Hey, I struggle with discontentment at times.

1141
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:03,100
 "And I just need you, guys, I'm gonna bring to you

1142
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:05,400
 "just my discontentment, my junk.

1143
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:08,060
 "And I just need you to just show me this verse,

1144
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:10,080
 "rub my nose in this verse."

1145
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:12,280
 Matthew 6, 33, I need to see it.

1146
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:14,120
 I thought I'd end just with this verse.

1147
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:17,680
 It's in the first book.

1148
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:20,580
 It's actually the first chapter of the first book,

1149
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:22,440
 probably the first page of your Bible.

1150
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:24,100
 It's Genesis chapter one.

1151
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:26,640
 In verse 26, God says, "Then God said,

1152
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:29,340
 "let us make mankind in our image and our likeness

1153
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:32,120
 "so that they may rule over the fish in the sea

1154
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:34,720
 "and the birds in the air, or the birds in the sky, rather,

1155
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:37,280
 "over the livestock and all the wild animals

1156
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:40,000
 "and over all the creatures that move along the ground."

1157
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,040
 And this is 27 I want you to pay attention to.

1158
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:46,840
 It says, "So God created mankind in his own image.

1159
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:49,820
 "In the image of God, he created them,

1160
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:54,000
 "male and female, he created them."

1161
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,720
 And so I want you to know, women,

1162
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:01,320
 that you have infinite value because you have been created

1163
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:04,160
 in the image of God himself.

1164
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:07,240
 And men, I want you to know the same,

1165
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:08,360
 that you have infinite value.

1166
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:13,120
 Life, humans, mankind has infinite value

1167
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:16,440
 because we have been created in the image of God.

1168
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:20,900
 And there has to be a respect that happens for each other.

1169
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:22,840
 We didn't even have time, we're out of time,

1170
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:25,360
 we're past time, and we didn't even talk about

1171
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,800
 just the abuse that is happening

1172
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:29,680
 in the context of relationships.

1173
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:32,160
 And in 1 Thessalonians chapter four,

1174
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:36,320
 it says that God is the avenger of such things.

1175
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:39,240
 And I'm not trying to scare you,

1176
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:41,000
 except for I believe the fear of God

1177
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,920
 is the beginning of wisdom.

1178
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:46,200
 And so as you consider how you date and treat each other,

1179
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:48,800
 how you treat the opposite sex,

1180
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,320
 just understand that the scripture says,

1181
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:54,600
 "God is the avenger of such things."

1182
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:55,920
 And we're talking about this

1183
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:58,000
 because we love you guys so much,

1184
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,280
 and it's just a joy to journey with you.

1185
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:01,880
 And this is a place, you know,

1186
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:04,640
 one of the things that happened that just really grieved me,

1187
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,520
 probably the thing that caused me the most grief

1188
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:08,720
 over the podcast, is a friend said,

1189
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:12,200
 "Well, you know, I think people come to me

1190
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:14,860
 "because they don't feel like they can approach you,

1191
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:16,760
 "or there's not a place."

1192
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:19,760
 Man, can I just say, David and I,

1193
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,720
 and Garrett, and whoever has taught,

1194
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:24,500
 but David and I sit up here,

1195
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:26,880
 and if you come on Sundays, Todd does the same thing,

1196
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,400
 and we stay here 'til the last person.

1197
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:32,300
 I mean, we stay here until this place is shut down,

1198
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:34,200
 trying to talk to people.

1199
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:36,680
 I get dozens of emails a week,

1200
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:40,520
 and I never want there to be a wall between us and you,

1201
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:42,560
 that if you ever have a question,

1202
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:45,320
 or you're wrestling with a verse,

1203
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:48,020
 you know, start with your community group, I hope,

1204
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:49,640
 but especially if it's something that we said

1205
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:50,720
 that you would come to us,

1206
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,240
 and we would have that conversation,

1207
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:53,480
 and invite you into that.

1208
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:55,880
 I want you to know you are invited into that.

1209
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:57,080
 I love you guys.

1210
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:59,640
 Jenny, would you pray for us?

1211
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:01,200
 - So I thought it'd be cool

1212
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:04,880
 if the guys prayed over the women tonight,

1213
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:07,560
 and just lift your hands up if you're a guy,

1214
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:09,400
 and women, receive this,

1215
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:13,460
 because they're for us.

1216
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:15,400
 Largely, they are for us.

1217
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:18,060
 So, God, we pray.

1218
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:23,420
 We pray that in your kindness, and in your love, God,

1219
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:26,600
 that you would heal the brokenness

1220
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:30,080
 that perhaps in many ways each one of us has caused,

1221
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:33,200
 and God, we pray for any division that has separated us.

1222
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:36,680
 God, we pray that there would be nothing

1223
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:38,060
 that would stop your gospel

1224
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:40,200
 from going out through your church,

1225
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:43,560
 that we would in all ways count each other's interests

1226
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:44,660
 higher than our own,

1227
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:47,580
 and that, God, we would take whatever privilege

1228
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:49,400
 we've been given and give it away.

1229
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:51,360
 I just thank you for all the men

1230
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:52,880
 with their hands lifted high, God,

1231
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:55,280
 and you know their hearts, you know each one of them.

1232
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:58,360
 I thank you for the ways that they have,

1233
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:02,040
 they will, and they can advocate for these women,

1234
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:03,840
 and God, I pray.

1235
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:05,260
 I pray that this would become,

1236
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:06,700
 the church would become the safest place

1237
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:08,280
 in the world for women,

1238
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:10,640
 that women would be able to run freely

1239
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:11,640
 with the gifts they've been given,

1240
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:15,080
 and together, we would cause a lot of good

1241
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:16,640
 for your kingdom, God.

1242
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,440
 That's ultimately what we want.

1243
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:20,900
 We want, God, your kingdom to come,

1244
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:24,660
 your will to be done on earth as it is in heaven.

1245
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:26,400
 In Jesus' name, amen.

1246
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:27,640
 - Amen.

1247
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:28,480
 Thank Judy Allen.

1248
