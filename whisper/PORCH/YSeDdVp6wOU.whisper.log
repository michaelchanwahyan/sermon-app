[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.460]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:22.780]   Hey, guys.
[00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:23.520]   How's it going?
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.000]   [CHEERING]
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.280]   It's great to see you.
[00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:28.780]   Awesome.
[00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:29.160]   OK.
[00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:29.680]   All right.
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.880]   Well, hey, it's good to be back in Texas.
[00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.440]   My name's Ben, if we haven't met.
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.960]   [CHEERING]
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.280]   I am the pastor of Passion City Church, Washington, DC.
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.800]   [CHEERING]
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:43.760]   OK, you've heard of it.
[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:44.560]   Awesome.
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:45.840]   Come visit sometime.
[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.080]   But part of the bigger family of Passion,
[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.080]   led by my pastor, Louis Giglio.
[00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.880]   And it's awesome to be a part of Passion,
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.720]   awesome to be leading a church in Washington, DC.
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.600]   A third of the people who live in DC
[00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.600]   are between the ages of 20 and 35.
[00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.000]   And so if you feel like you're just not meeting
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.920]   the right people in Dallas, there's
[00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.920]   a lot of single people running around your age back in DC.
[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.120]   You live your life, but I'm just giving you options.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.240]   But I'll say this.
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.160]   I want to jump in to what God asked for us,
[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.000]   because I'm excited about it.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.200]   But I do just want to say, it's always fun to be back here.
[00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.760]   The pastor of Watermark, Todd Wagner,
[00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.000]   has been an incredible friend to Louis and to myself.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.920]   And come up several times to encourage me in DC,
[00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.240]   which has been amazing.
[00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.040]   And to see what David and his team is doing here
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.040]   is absolutely incredible.
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.800]   I think you really can, in Texas,
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.240]   sometimes get used to this, things like this.
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.000]   Oh yeah, several thousands of single people
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.840]   all get together and study and try
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.720]   to figure out what God's doing in our lives.
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:48.760]   That's a normal thing.
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.920]   It's extremely not.
[00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.320]   And so just know that you're in the midst of something special.
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.960]   And you're being led by some pretty remarkable people.
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.160]   And that's a gift.
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.000]   It's awesome.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.040]   And it's fun to be here with you.
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.080]   So thrilled to be here.
[00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.920]   Mike's here with me.
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.360]   And we just love being back in Texas.
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.240]   Haven't had barbecue yet, so that's kind of messed up.
[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.560]   But it's great to see all of you.
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.560]   So let me read to you a couple verses.
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.280]   We're in this series about moods,
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.880]   and we're gonna talk about one.
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.840]   And I believe God's gonna help us
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.400]   navigate a real issue in our lives.
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.640]   And I'm gonna read you a couple verses
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.720]   out of Philippians chapter four.
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.040]   And if you've got a copy of your scriptures
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.480]   I'm gonna read along Philippians four.
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.400]   If you don't, just listen.
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.760]   I'm gonna read it, we'll pray, and then jump in.
[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.400]   But Philippians chapter four,
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.880]   beginning in verse four, says this.
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:41.400]   Rejoice in the Lord always.
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.440]   Again I say rejoice.
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.040]   Let your reasonableness be known to everyone.
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.040]   The Lord is at hand.
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.280]   Do not be anxious about anything.
[00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.400]   But in everything by prayer and supplication
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.240]   with thanksgiving, let your request be made known to God.
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.720]   And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding,
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.000]   will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.080]   Finally, brothers, whatever's true, whatever's honorable,
[00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.760]   whatever's just, whatever's pure, whatever's lovely,
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.200]   whatever's commendable, if there's any excellence,
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.120]   if there's anything worthy of praise,
[00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.400]   think about these things.
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.320]   And what you've learned and received and heard
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.440]   and seen in me, practice these things.
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.440]   And the God of peace will be with you.
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:27.600]   Now let me pray for us.
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.880]   Well, Lord, I wanna thank you for everybody in this room,
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.560]   whether they just love you and knew the words of every song
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.400]   and love singing 'em, or whether they're just really unsure
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.100]   if they can trust you and if this is worth their time.
[00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.360]   I think a lot of us in here are God.
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.320]   Anxiety is our reality and peace is distant
[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.000]   and unattainable, but if the peace of God
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.300]   could land in our hearts, this would be a night
[00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.680]   that's truly special, and if the God of peace
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.440]   could sit with us, boy, the difference that could make.
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.360]   And so, Lord, rescue us from just attending a thing,
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.800]   but I pray even now you'd speak to us through your word.
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.180]   And I don't feel in any way powerful enough
[00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.440]   to communicate what I think you want
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.080]   in the lives of your people, so we're asking you to help.
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:20.140]   But I just wanna invite you guys, if you're willing,
[00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:21.720]   to take a moment and you talk to God
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.280]   and ask him if you're up for this,
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.180]   say, God, please teach me tonight.
[00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:31.640]   And then if you would, please pray for me,
[00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.280]   that the Lord would use me and I'd be helpful to you.
[00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:42.840]   Well, Father, we love you and we trust you.
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.560]   Use this time, and we pray that in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.640]   Well, over and over again in the scriptures,
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.800]   we're told this one simple, beautiful truth,
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.720]   that you and I exist to know and enjoy God,
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.160]   that all things are made by him and for him,
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.840]   that in his right hand are pleasures forevermore,
[00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.320]   that nearness to him is our good.
[00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.160]   In this passage, it says, rejoice in the Lord always.
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.880]   I say it again, rejoice.
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.360]   You and I exist to pursue our joy in God,
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.900]   to rest and delight in his love.
[00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.720]   We are meant to pursue intimacy with the Almighty.
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.200]   That's why you're here.
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.520]   And I would imagine many of you in here know that.
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:27.960]   You go, I wanna know God.
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.660]   That's why I'm in a place like this.
[00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.600]   But if I was to ask you, you would say, intimacy with God,
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:36.440]   enjoyment of him is something I struggle to experience
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.320]   in the regular day.
[00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:39.160]   Why?
[00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.280]   Well, if we have an enemy, spiritually,
[00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.920]   and the Bible says we do, I would say his goal
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:49.680]   for most of us is not to convince you that God's not real
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.880]   or that God doesn't exist or pursuing him's not important.
[00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.400]   He's not trying to convince you of that.
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.140]   He says, if you wanna chase after that, man, you go for it.
[00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:00.120]   Just make sure you look good while you're doing it.
[00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.360]   And make sure you go to the right college
[00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.600]   and get the right major so you can get a good job
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.440]   and get the right internship so you can get
[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.940]   on the right team and get a promotion
[00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:11.480]   so you can take over the world.
[00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.360]   But first, you gotta move to the big city
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:14.960]   and cities are expensive.
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.640]   You gotta get an apartment and you need a roommate
[00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:19.120]   and you realize it's real expensive,
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:20.600]   so you need a lot of roommates.
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.120]   And now you got roommate drama.
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.320]   One just got married.
[00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.720]   (congregation laughing)
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.080]   But in the middle of all that drama,
[00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.420]   you realize, man, I gotta let people know what's going on,
[00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:31.880]   that I look good, and so I gotta look good on Instagram
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:33.280]   and I gotta look good on Twitter
[00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:36.080]   and I gotta look good on Facebook and on Snapchat,
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.080]   and meanwhile, I'm gonna be out here doing this
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:39.320]   and then I meet somebody.
[00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:43.120]   (congregation laughing)
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.280]   And we go on a date.
[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:48.000]   And then we go on another date.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.920]   And we go on another date and I meet their friends
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:53.560]   and I meet their family and they gotta meet my friends
[00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:54.920]   and they gotta meet my family.
[00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:56.080]   And then we're like, are we doing this?
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:56.920]   Let's get engaged.
[00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:57.840]   Are we gonna get married?
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:58.900]   And then we go on a honeymoon.
[00:06:58.900 --> 00:06:59.740]   Where are we gonna go?
[00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:00.560]   Where are we gonna live?
[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:01.440]   Are we gonna live in the city?
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:02.800]   Are we gonna live in the suburbs?
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:03.640]   Are we gonna have kids?
[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:04.520]   How many kids?
[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:05.360]   Public school?
[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:06.440]   Are we gonna go to private school?
[00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:07.280]   How's this gonna work?
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:08.280]   And on and on it goes.
[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:09.600]   All right, all right, all right.
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.800]   (congregation laughing)
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:17.640]   And in none of this, at any point did we suddenly go,
[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:19.680]   hey, God's dead.
[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.480]   The scriptures don't matter.
[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:26.520]   But just, we lost him somewhere along the way.
[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:29.400]   And for many of us, you hear that and you go,
[00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:30.440]   well, Ben, what are you trying to say?
[00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:32.200]   Like, well, the trick is you gotta never have kids.
[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:33.240]   You just gotta get 'em out of here.
[00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:34.160]   Is that what you're saying?
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.200]   Or you're saying, what's the deal, man?
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:37.560]   Or are you saying, what, am I supposed to just
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:39.200]   move into the hills and wear all linen?
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:40.080]   Like, what are you trying to say?
[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:40.920]   I got a job.
[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:42.120]   Like, what do you want from me?
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:43.180]   Well, let me say this.
[00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:48.180]   For many of us, our problems are not our major problem.
[00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:52.900]   It's our anxieties about our problems that's the problem.
[00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:54.420]   Let me say that again, 'cause it's important.
[00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:57.060]   For many of us in here, your problems
[00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:58.820]   are not the real problem.
[00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:03.140]   Your anxiety about your problems is your problem.
[00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:06.300]   That's what Jesus' argument in Matthew chapter six.
[00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:09.480]   He said, don't be anxious about anything.
[00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:10.320]   Saying, what am I gonna eat?
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:11.160]   What am I gonna drink?
[00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:11.980]   What am I gonna wear?
[00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:12.940]   He said, the nations do that.
[00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:15.420]   Those are real things, but don't be anxious about them.
[00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:19.340]   He says, but seek first the kingdom of God.
[00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:21.820]   And notice, he makes those a contrast.
[00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:24.260]   He said, you're either gonna seek God,
[00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.140]   or in your anxiety, you're gonna seek
[00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:28.260]   to handle a bunch of things.
[00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.540]   And Jesus presents your anxiety
[00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:33.980]   as one of your greatest impediments
[00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:36.460]   to pursuing your God-given destiny.
[00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:37.600]   Don't miss that.
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.380]   There's more at stake here.
[00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:42.420]   That your God-given destiny, who you're meant to be,
[00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:45.980]   is not gonna be reached if you are tied down by anxiety.
[00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:48.580]   And so one of the enemy's greatest strategies
[00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:50.940]   to keep you from your God-given destiny
[00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:53.060]   is to fill you up with anxiety.
[00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:54.860]   And for many of us, that's our reality.
[00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:56.500]   And what scares me about that
[00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:59.660]   is what Jesus warned us about in Luke chapter eight.
[00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:01.340]   As he was telling this beautiful story,
[00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:02.780]   he was talking about the word of God.
[00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:04.380]   And he says, let me tell you what I'm here to do.
[00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:06.260]   I wanna take the words of God,
[00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.540]   and I wanna plant 'em like a seed
[00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:10.780]   deep into the soil of your heart.
[00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:13.380]   And when they go in there, they're not just words on a page.
[00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:14.740]   It is the word of life,
[00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:17.860]   and that seed is gonna burst forth into life.
[00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:19.860]   And it's gonna become a big plant
[00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:22.780]   that is teeming with life and bears fruit
[00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:24.140]   and blesses others.
[00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:27.380]   That's what I wanna do in your life through my word.
[00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:29.360]   But he says, but there's gonna be threats
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.220]   to the word doing that in your life.
[00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:32.440]   And one of the threats, he says,
[00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:34.260]   when that little plant begins to grow,
[00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.900]   he said a weed is gonna come up and choke it.
[00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:39.660]   And his disciples asked him later, what's the weed?
[00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:42.940]   And he says, the weed is the worries of this life
[00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:45.500]   that many of us, if we're honest,
[00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:48.060]   you don't experience the power of God in your life.
[00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:50.040]   Your life really doesn't look that different
[00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:51.460]   from any of your coworkers.
[00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:53.260]   And the reality is you're not experiencing
[00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:54.860]   the power of God in your life
[00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:57.620]   because the word of life is being choked out
[00:09:57.620 --> 00:09:59.520]   by the worries of this life.
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:02.940]   And anxiety is keeping you from your God-given destiny.
[00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:06.100]   And that scares me for you 'cause God wants much for us,
[00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:07.620]   and this is a threat to us,
[00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:09.740]   and we're an anxious generation.
[00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:11.280]   Something about modern life
[00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:13.920]   is not conducive to human flourishing.
[00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:15.800]   We are relatively more safe
[00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:18.060]   than any generation that's existed,
[00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:20.060]   and yet anxiety is killing us.
[00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:21.820]   And that's what concerns me
[00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:24.700]   is it's not just missing out on what God has for us.
[00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:27.500]   Anxiety is a condition of the heart
[00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:30.980]   that brings forth many sinful states of mind.
[00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:35.980]   That anxiety about grades can lead you to be dishonest.
[00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:38.700]   There was a study at Rutgers of 32 universities
[00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:41.820]   that found that 74% of business students
[00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:44.700]   and 68% of all other students
[00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:46.620]   admitted to some form of cheating,
[00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:49.100]   which I don't know why business students
[00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:51.040]   were so much a higher percentage.
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:53.180]   I don't know if they're just more honest, you know,
[00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:54.780]   if they were like, "Well, of course I cheat.
[00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:57.500]   "That's how I get ahead," you know, or what?
[00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:01.320]   Anxiety about your schedule
[00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:03.320]   will lead you to break commitments.
[00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.940]   Anxiety about dating will get you to compromise.
[00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:07.540]   Anxiety about finances
[00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:09.420]   will lead you to make unethical decisions.
[00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:11.020]   Anxiety about being liked
[00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:12.500]   will lead you to embellish stories
[00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:14.160]   and act really weird at parties.
[00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:17.460]   (congregation laughing)
[00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:20.040]   Anxiety for many of us
[00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:23.780]   leads you to seek comfort and refuge in addictions,
[00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:25.660]   and those become a whole 'nother set of problems
[00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:26.940]   in your life.
[00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:27.980]   And then here's my fear.
[00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:30.860]   Anxiety, it will literally kill you.
[00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:33.620]   I remember when I was in college,
[00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:35.980]   I was taking a shower one day,
[00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:38.620]   and suddenly I felt like there was this pain in my chest,
[00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:41.620]   and it felt like someone was trying to like cave in my chest
[00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:42.820]   like I was having trouble breathing,
[00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:44.060]   and I was like, "What is going on?"
[00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:46.300]   I thought I was dying there in the shower.
[00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:48.020]   And I remember just thinking like, "Oh my God,
[00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:49.660]   "like what is happening to me right now?"
[00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:51.740]   And then I was like, "Is this heartburn?"
[00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:52.860]   Like I'd never had heartburn before,
[00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:55.220]   and I was like, "Was it the barbecue?"
[00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:58.180]   'Cause I'd been eating off the same plate of barbecue
[00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:00.180]   in the fridge for like a week and a half.
[00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:03.300]   And I was like, "Oh my God, like,
[00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:05.140]   "no, like what a stupid way to die."
[00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:05.980]   And I was praying, I was like,
[00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:07.300]   "God, I don't wanna go like this.
[00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:09.520]   "Like my roommate's gonna find me in the shower,
[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:11.660]   "and then at my funeral, they're like, 'How'd he die?'"
[00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:12.820]   And I'm like, "It was the barbecue, man.
[00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:14.800]   "He just kept eating on it,
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:16.940]   "way past what was appropriate or safe."
[00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:19.020]   And I was like, "I don't wanna do that."
[00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:20.660]   But I made it out of the shower.
[00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:23.460]   I made it to a doctor,
[00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:25.100]   and he ran a series of tests on my heart,
[00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:26.340]   and he was like, "Hey man, do you drink?"
[00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:27.180]   I said, "No."
[00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:28.000]   He said, "Do you smoke?"
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:28.840]   I said, "No."
[00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:29.740]   He said, "Are you stressed?"
[00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:30.580]   I said, "Well, I don't know.
[00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:31.420]   "I'm not certain what I'm gonna major in,
[00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:32.740]   "because I'm not sure what I'm gonna do with my life,
[00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:33.580]   "and I don't know where I'm gonna go,
[00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:34.400]   "and where do I live, what do I do,
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:35.400]   "and I'm dating a girl, I'm not sure if she's the one.
[00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:36.240]   "I'm scared to stay with her,
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:37.080]   "but I'm scared to break up with her,
[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:37.900]   "'cause I don't wanna be alone."
[00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:39.020]   And he's like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:40.420]   "Okay, yeah, you're stressed."
[00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:42.740]   He's like, "Man, you need to calm down."
[00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:46.340]   And here's what's crazy about that.
[00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:50.580]   Preoccupation with hypothetical situations
[00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:52.000]   was literally killing me.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.500]   And for many of you,
[00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:58.500]   your stress about hypothetical situations
[00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:00.340]   is actually killing you.
[00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:02.140]   And it's not meant to be like that.
[00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:04.140]   And particularly for the people of Jesus,
[00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:05.500]   it's not meant to be like that.
[00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:07.180]   We are meant to be different.
[00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:08.420]   And let me say this.
[00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:10.180]   The world is not impressed
[00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:12.780]   when we sing about the Prince of Peace,
[00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:15.180]   but live a reality of stress.
[00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:17.420]   It's meant to look different.
[00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:20.140]   That's what Jesus was saying in Luke chapter 12,
[00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:21.340]   when he told his disciples,
[00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:23.940]   "Don't be anxious about anything."
[00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:26.660]   He says, "The pagans do that."
[00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:30.220]   He says that my disciples should be characterized
[00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:32.060]   by a lack of anxiety.
[00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:36.540]   So in the book, "The Cities and Bishoprics of Phrygia,"
[00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:38.040]   which I know you've read,
[00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:39.360]   but by way of review,
[00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:43.020]   as it's talking about inscriptions
[00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:44.860]   in the ancient city of Phrygia,
[00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:46.460]   there's one where there's a guy's name
[00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:47.860]   that worked in Phrygia,
[00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:50.820]   and his name was Titideas Amirimnas.
[00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:53.060]   And scholars all agree that Amirimnas
[00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:55.140]   was not a normal name in that culture in that time.
[00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:57.540]   They say that was his baptismal name.
[00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:59.100]   That was very common in those days.
[00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:00.340]   They say, "When you got baptized,
[00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:02.020]   "I'm associating with Jesus.
[00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:03.780]   "I'm buried with him in the grave.
[00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:06.220]   "And when he rose, I rise into a new life."
[00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:08.260]   When you were baptized, they give you a new name
[00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.380]   that was a mark of, "I now belong to Jesus."
[00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:11.860]   So in the book of Acts, Barnabas,
[00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:13.000]   that wasn't his real name.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.580]   That's the name they gave him later,
[00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:16.580]   son of encouragement, 'cause that's what he was like.
[00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:18.860]   And they say, "Titideas Amirimnas."
[00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:21.820]   Ah is a negative, like ah, theist,
[00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:24.700]   is someone who doesn't believe in theos, in God.
[00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:26.580]   Amirimnas means doesn't,
[00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:28.940]   and marimnas means worry about stuff.
[00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:33.060]   So literally, when he came to know Jesus,
[00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:35.420]   they said, "Your name is Titideas,
[00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:37.820]   "takes no thought of the morrow.
[00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:39.620]   "I'm not worried about stuff."
[00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:43.340]   That Jesus came not just to rescue you
[00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:47.500]   from sin and condemnation, but from your anxiety too.
[00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:48.860]   Did you know that?
[00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:51.460]   And there's some complexity in anxiety medically.
[00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:53.820]   I know that, and so I'm not gonna cover every issue
[00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:55.460]   that all of us are dealing with tonight,
[00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:58.640]   but I wanna show you a path that God has given us
[00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:00.420]   that's gonna help us live the life
[00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:04.420]   that God built us to live, and you got it in this text.
[00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:05.940]   And that's why in verse six it says,
[00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:08.460]   "Don't be anxious about anything,"
[00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:11.480]   or be anxious for nothing, which I love that,
[00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:13.740]   because there's just permission in that.
[00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:17.560]   There is no thing you're supposed to be anxious about.
[00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:20.140]   Can that just settle on somebody tonight?
[00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:23.140]   There is never a thing you are obligated
[00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:25.180]   to get stressed about.
[00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:26.380]   And by saying that, I don't mean
[00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:27.940]   that you don't care about stuff.
[00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:29.220]   I'm not saying that there aren't things
[00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:31.600]   you're supposed to carry that are meaningful and matter.
[00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:34.260]   You're supposed to, but that shoulder-tensing,
[00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:37.180]   scalp-drying, chest-compressing anxiety
[00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:38.940]   that you think you're supposed to just soldier
[00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:40.820]   through life with, God doesn't want you
[00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:43.380]   to carry what he gives you like that.
[00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:46.100]   You're not meant to carry it that way.
[00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:48.140]   The root of the word anxiety is the word
[00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:50.740]   to be drawn in different directions, to distract,
[00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:52.580]   that I can't focus on one thing
[00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:54.580]   'cause I'm caught up in many things.
[00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:56.660]   And many of us live there, and you're not meant
[00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:59.500]   to live there because that preoccupation,
[00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:01.980]   it impedes good decision-making.
[00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:04.260]   We're not moving forward in a healthy way
[00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:05.820]   'cause we're too caught up with anxiety
[00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:07.380]   about so many other things.
[00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:09.960]   So we're not meant to be anxious about anything.
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:12.300]   There's no thing we're obligated
[00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:14.200]   to lay up at night stressing about.
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:19.420]   But in everything, by prayer and supplication
[00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:22.420]   with thanksgiving, let your request be made known to God.
[00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:24.020]   Do you see the parallel there?
[00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:29.020]   Be anxious about no thing, but pray about everything.
[00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:31.600]   So anytime there's a thing in your life,
[00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:33.540]   you go, should I worry about this?
[00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:35.860]   No, nothing goes there.
[00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:37.660]   I need to pray about this.
[00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:39.480]   That's what we're meant to do.
[00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:41.320]   Now, before I unpack the specifics of that,
[00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:42.740]   let me just say, 'cause I know there's people in here
[00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:44.920]   that you're like, oh, okay, so I shouldn't worry at all.
[00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:46.380]   I should just pray more like that?
[00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:48.140]   Thanks, man, I got real-world problems.
[00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:49.160]   Like, hey, pray more?
[00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:52.020]   Just doesn't really feel like that's gonna solve it for me.
[00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:52.860]   But let me tell you something.
[00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:55.340]   Before you knock this theory, let me ask you,
[00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:56.800]   how's yours working for you?
[00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:59.900]   Before you slam on this one,
[00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:02.020]   if we were reading your text, what would it say?
[00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:04.380]   Be anxious about nothing, but in everything,
[00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:06.980]   just pound a lot of carbs for comfort, right?
[00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:07.820]   Like, is that it?
[00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:09.660]   And let me tell you something.
[00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:11.940]   I'm not knocking on you 'cause I get it.
[00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:14.380]   When I first moved to DC, a new place, new town,
[00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:16.500]   somebody was having a conversation
[00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:17.940]   with my wife and I about health,
[00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:19.300]   and they asked us, what are you eating?
[00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:21.700]   And my wife, without hesitation, was like, our feelings.
[00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:23.500]   And we were like, yeah, that sounds about right.
[00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:24.620]   Yeah, I get that.
[00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:27.180]   That you're nervous about something,
[00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:28.280]   you're not even thinking about it,
[00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:30.380]   but you're realizing, yeah, anytime something comes up,
[00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:32.580]   I don't take it to prayer, I just take it to the pantry,
[00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:33.500]   and that's what I do.
[00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:35.400]   And that's not solving things for you.
[00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:38.140]   Or others of you, when you have a decision
[00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:40.340]   you're stressed about, something that's uncomfortable,
[00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:41.340]   you don't know how to deal with,
[00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:42.860]   you just go for your phone, like, ah,
[00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:44.700]   and you just start flipping through social media
[00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:46.620]   and feed more of that insecurity
[00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:49.400]   and create a whole different set of problems.
[00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:51.360]   Or for some of us, to just numb the pain
[00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:53.420]   or escape into a refuge,
[00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:55.980]   we launch into all manner of addictions, we do.
[00:17:55.980 --> 00:18:01.420]   But it's interesting, I've read so many recent studies
[00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:02.980]   about how to cope with anxiety,
[00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:04.320]   'cause it's the issue of our day.
[00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:05.560]   And here's the fascinating thing,
[00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:08.440]   so many of these scholarly academic studies are saying,
[00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:10.800]   you know the secret to dealing with your anxiety?
[00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:12.720]   And they're saying things like meditation
[00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:16.760]   and practicing gratitude, that modern-day scholars
[00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:19.640]   are stumbling upon an ancient path
[00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:23.120]   that's been ours for centuries, if you understand it.
[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:25.720]   And so I wanna show you the path God gave us.
[00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:27.320]   And before I give you the specifics again,
[00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:29.940]   let me just say this, 'cause I love the tense of the verb,
[00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:30.920]   I know, but it says,
[00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:33.120]   "But in everything by prayer and supplication,
[00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:35.680]   "let your request be made known to God."
[00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:38.460]   I love that it's in a passive voice,
[00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:41.440]   that it's not an active command, make your request known.
[00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:44.760]   It's passive, let your request be made known.
[00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:47.600]   It carries the idea that they wanna get out,
[00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:48.840]   you just need to let 'em.
[00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:51.640]   That for many of us, if we're honest,
[00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:55.480]   if your soul is like a tank of water,
[00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:57.920]   I don't know how you wake up in the morning,
[00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:01.020]   but I doubt many of us, it's just a calm, placid lake.
[00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:02.560]   I mean, some of you are maybe like that.
[00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:03.960]   When you wake up in the morning, you're like,
[00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:05.400]   (inhales deeply)
[00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:07.000]   (congregation laughing)
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.720]   A chance to worship my Savior, fantastic.
[00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:11.840]   (congregation laughing)
[00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:13.960]   And off you go into the world.
[00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:17.920]   For many of us, there's this whole world of stress,
[00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:22.160]   of loneliness and finances and conflict
[00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:25.280]   and dating somebody and not dating somebody
[00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:28.680]   and will I date somebody and status
[00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:31.320]   and all these things that are just waiting for us
[00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:34.440]   in our soul as soon as we wake up.
[00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:36.320]   And for many of us, they're there,
[00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:38.320]   and you go, "What do I do with these?"
[00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:40.400]   And what many of us do is rather than dealing with them,
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:42.480]   we go, "Hey man, I gotta get to work."
[00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:43.800]   And so what my secret is,
[00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:46.600]   is I just stuff them down deep inside.
[00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:48.560]   I just bury them down deep.
[00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:50.680]   And then when I get around people
[00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:51.840]   and they ask me how I'm doing, I'm like,
[00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:54.760]   "Great man, fantastic, it's awesome.
[00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:56.160]   "No, it's good."
[00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:57.320]   You show up in places like this, they say,
[00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:58.160]   "How you doing?"
[00:19:58.160 --> 00:19:59.000]   "I'm doing great, man.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.120]   "God is good all the time, blessed.
[00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:03.360]   "Not today, Satan."
[00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:04.560]   All right, and that's us.
[00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:07.240]   (congregation laughing)
[00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:09.480]   And meanwhile, just before under the surface,
[00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:11.360]   we're wondering if we're gonna make it,
[00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:12.400]   if we're gonna break.
[00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:15.200]   And what I love about this text is it's telling you
[00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:18.080]   it's not heroic to pretend like you don't have problems.
[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:20.080]   It's not heroic to pretend you're not concerned,
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:21.040]   and you're certainly not meant
[00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:22.520]   to stuff them down deep inside.
[00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:25.600]   What you're supposed to do is let 'em rise.
[00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:27.440]   Let 'em come up.
[00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:30.840]   And I love that it says, "By prayer and supplication,
[00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:33.120]   "with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God."
[00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:35.640]   That word prayer is to create space with God.
[00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:39.440]   It's just a generic term for creating space with God.
[00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:42.160]   And many of you say, "Well, Ben, I'm too busy for that."
[00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:43.000]   Well, let me tell you something.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   If we're honest, I think for many of us,
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.720]   we're not just too busy, we're inefficient.
[00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:51.040]   I mean, there's a statement in the military culture,
[00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:55.560]   sharpshooters, that slow is smooth, and smooth is fast.
[00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:57.760]   That if you're trying to rush in shooting,
[00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:00.200]   you'll drop a clip, you won't aim, you'll miss your target,
[00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:03.200]   and you'll end up being less efficient at your goal.
[00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:04.800]   And many of us, when we get up in the mornings,
[00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:06.120]   we go, "Oh, I don't have time to pray
[00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:07.280]   "and offer these to God."
[00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:08.800]   So you just carry them into your day,
[00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:09.720]   and what happens?
[00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:12.040]   You're inefficient in the way you treat people.
[00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:14.160]   That these things become the default mechanism
[00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:15.520]   by which you speak to your roommate,
[00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:17.380]   talk to your people, make decisions.
[00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:18.680]   That it's all being driven by this
[00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:19.560]   'cause you didn't deal with it.
[00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:21.200]   And so you're good at being busy,
[00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:22.760]   but you're not good at being effective.
[00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:24.800]   You're like an octopus on roller skates.
[00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:28.640]   Lot of movement, but hopelessness is setting in
[00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:31.120]   'cause you're not moving forward.
[00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:32.800]   And there's a better way than that.
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:34.680]   We're meant to slow down.
[00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:35.920]   Make it an appointment.
[00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:39.040]   For me, first thing in the morning helps with that,
[00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:41.280]   that I have an appointment with God.
[00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:42.800]   And so if someone asks me to meet them,
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:43.840]   I say, "I'm sorry, I can't.
[00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:44.680]   "I have an appointment."
[00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:46.280]   I don't tell them, "With the Almighty."
[00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:47.440]   They don't need to know,
[00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:49.240]   but I'm not gonna break it for them.
[00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:52.200]   That I'm gonna sit with the Lord
[00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:55.120]   and give myself that space to be with Him.
[00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:57.040]   And it says, "By prayer and supplication."
[00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:59.240]   That word supplication is more specific.
[00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:00.720]   It's specific requests.
[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:02.480]   That I create space with God,
[00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:05.160]   and then what I do is I pull out a piece of paper
[00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:06.480]   and I write at the top of it,
[00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:07.640]   "How do you feel?"
[00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:10.360]   And you say, "Why do you write that?"
[00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:13.280]   Because I don't often know how I feel.
[00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:15.200]   I know that's confusing to some people in the room,
[00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:16.840]   maybe a lot of ladies that are very in touch
[00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:17.680]   with your emotions.
[00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:18.800]   You're like, "What do you mean you don't know how you feel?"
[00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:20.520]   What I mean is, I don't know.
[00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:23.200]   So I have to write it.
[00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:24.160]   How do you feel?
[00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:29.160]   And I'm like, "Uh, sad, confused, scared, alone."
[00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:34.120]   It's often a lot of negative feelings.
[00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:34.960]   And in that moment,
[00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:36.840]   I'll do what the psalmist taught us to do.
[00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:38.720]   Why are you downcast, O my soul?
[00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:40.120]   I'll start asking that.
[00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:42.840]   What's behind that?
[00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:44.160]   And before I walk out the door
[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:46.240]   and start operating out of all those insecurities,
[00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:47.240]   I start letting them come up and go,
[00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:49.200]   "Why do I feel that way?"
[00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:50.720]   Well, I'm insecure about this meeting.
[00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:51.560]   Why?
[00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:52.800]   Because I want that person to like me.
[00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:53.640]   Why?
[00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:54.880]   Because I want them to give me what I want.
[00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:55.720]   Why?
[00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:56.640]   Because I can get to the place I want.
[00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:57.480]   Why?
[00:22:57.480 --> 00:22:58.440]   So that I'll feel important.
[00:22:58.440 --> 00:22:59.280]   Whoa.
[00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:02.280]   Business meetings aren't about making you feel
[00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:03.240]   like you're somebody.
[00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:04.920]   That's a spiritual issue.
[00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:07.080]   You don't need to carry that into that.
[00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:09.960]   And so for me, I've given myself the permission.
[00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:11.840]   There was a movie I watched in high school,
[00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:14.520]   like in social studies or something called "Madness."
[00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:17.000]   And it was all about different mental disorders.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.760]   And I remember there was one where this guy,
[00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:21.200]   it was like way back in the day in America,
[00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:22.840]   he was building the railroads,
[00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:24.280]   and there was an explosion,
[00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:27.960]   and it drove a railroad spike through the front of his head.
[00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:29.840]   Yeah, severed his brain.
[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:31.000]   But he didn't die.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.680]   Hey, but it severed his frontal lobe,
[00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:38.080]   the part that conditions what you say or don't say.
[00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:39.960]   And so then they're reenacting his life
[00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:41.440]   of him going to get his job back,
[00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:42.680]   and he's like, "I want my job back."
[00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:43.520]   And they're like, "Sorry, man,
[00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:44.720]   "you had a spike go through your head."
[00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:47.000]   And he's just like, "That makes me so sad.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.280]   "I'm gonna kill you!"
[00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:49.120]   Hey, you're attractive.
[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:49.960]   What's your name?
[00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:50.780]   Wait, hold on.
[00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:51.620]   "I'm gonna kill you!"
[00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:53.200]   And this guy's all over the place.
[00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:54.600]   And that's how I pray now.
[00:23:54.600 --> 00:24:00.240]   I've just given myself permission in that journal.
[00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:02.000]   I'm not writing a memoir.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.640]   And so many people in DC do that.
[00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:05.040]   They're like, "A lot of challenges today,
[00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:06.800]   "and yet I will overcome, 'cause that's what I do."
[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:07.640]   You're like, "Oh, stop.
[00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:08.880]   "No one's gonna read it."
[00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:10.640]   (congregation laughing)
[00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:12.280]   Write it to God and say, "I'm scared about that.
[00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:13.120]   "I'm concerned about that.
[00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:14.020]   "I don't know how to feel about that.
[00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:14.860]   "I'm happy about that.
[00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:15.700]   "I'm worried about that.
[00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:16.540]   "I'm angry about this.
[00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:17.480]   "I'm insecure about that."
[00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:21.880]   Just let it rise to him by prayer and supplication.
[00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:25.400]   With thanksgiving, let your request be made known to God.
[00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:26.800]   And you go, "Why with thanksgiving?"
[00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:28.680]   Because you have the opportunity
[00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:32.000]   to let this stuff be made known to God.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.120]   That's why what's amazing about that
[00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:36.640]   is when he commands us to do that,
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:40.720]   1 Peter 5, 7 says, "Cast all your anxieties upon him."
[00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:42.000]   That's a command.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.160]   If you have an anxiety, cast it on him.
[00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:47.400]   And then you're told why, because he cares for you.
[00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:51.520]   And then Psalm 55, 22 says, "Cast your cares upon the Lord."
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:52.680]   Why?
[00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:54.080]   "And he will sustain you.
[00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:56.360]   "He will not let the righteous fall."
[00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:57.860]   I love it, the same command,
[00:24:57.860 --> 00:25:00.120]   but for two very different motivations.
[00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:02.000]   Cast your anxiety onto him.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:02.840]   Why?
[00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:03.660]   Because he loves you.
[00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:05.040]   Cast your anxiety onto him.
[00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:05.880]   Why?
[00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:06.860]   'Cause he'll stabilize you.
[00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:08.280]   Cast your anxiety onto him.
[00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:09.100]   Why?
[00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:11.000]   Because he's loving enough to wanna hear them
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.880]   and strong enough to do something about it.
[00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:16.080]   He's the best person to take him to.
[00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:18.560]   You have permission to sit with the king.
[00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:21.080]   You have a father who knows what you need
[00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:22.160]   before you ask him.
[00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:24.320]   And it's a stabilizing thing to know that.
[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:27.320]   I remember when my daughter came to me one night
[00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:30.080]   and it was time to go upstairs,
[00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:32.800]   and I just picked her up to carry her upstairs.
[00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:35.360]   And she went, "No, I'm too heavy, Daddy."
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:38.080]   And I was like, "Uh, okay.
[00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:39.960]   "One, who told you that?"
[00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:45.400]   And then two, "You're not too heavy for Daddy, baby."
[00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:48.120]   And then I did like a couple presses with her, right?
[00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:50.680]   Just so she could see, like, you see what I'm saying?
[00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:51.520]   All right.
[00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:55.360]   'Cause whatever somebody told her,
[00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:58.360]   she believed that whatever she's dealing with's too heavy.
[00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:00.600]   It's not too heavy for me.
[00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:03.440]   And some of you are carrying some stuff right now,
[00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:05.340]   and let's be honest, it's killing you.
[00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:08.120]   Your digestion's not working right.
[00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:09.760]   You're socially bound up.
[00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:11.880]   You're not thriving in life.
[00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:15.900]   And the reality is you're trying to carry it all.
[00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:18.320]   And there's some things you need to carry,
[00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:21.840]   but you need to keep in mind that he wants to carry you.
[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:24.520]   You got a father who wants to carry you.
[00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:27.060]   He says, "Don't be anxious, little flock.
[00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:29.140]   "I wanna take care of you and shepherd you.
[00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:31.060]   "You just gotta let me.
[00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:34.800]   "Create the space, be still, sit before your God,"
[00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:37.200]   because he's loving enough to hear your problems,
[00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:39.360]   and he's strong enough to do something about 'em.
[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:43.000]   And he's offering you, "Come sit with your dad."
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.400]   And when you do, you get a promise in verse seven,
[00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:49.040]   "And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding,
[00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:52.560]   "will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus."
[00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:56.120]   Abraham Lincoln, there was a day during the Civil War
[00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:59.200]   where 76,000 troops were marched into Pennsylvania,
[00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:01.560]   and panic took hold of Washington.
[00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:03.560]   And as these troops marched that close,
[00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:07.120]   led by General Lee, historians report Abraham Lincoln
[00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:09.200]   had an eerie calm about him
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:10.960]   and was able to make clear-headed decisions.
[00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:13.040]   And so a general that he visited in the hospital
[00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:15.200]   that was wounded in Gettysburg asked him later,
[00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:16.960]   "How were you able to function
[00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:18.600]   "in the middle of all that stress?"
[00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:20.400]   And here's what Abraham Lincoln said.
[00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:23.600]   He said, "When everyone was panic-stricken,
[00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:26.200]   "I went to my room, got down on my knees
[00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:29.200]   "before Almighty God, and I prayed.
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:31.940]   "Soon a sweet comfort crept into my soul
[00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:34.500]   "that God Almighty had taken the whole business
[00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:36.000]   "into His own hands."
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.040]   Now, did that free him up from having to make decisions?
[00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:42.440]   No, he's a leader, but it freed him up
[00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:44.040]   to make good decisions.
[00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:44.880]   Do you see that?
[00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:46.280]   Some of you, anxiety is just making you
[00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:47.880]   make really unwise choices.
[00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:50.040]   You're supposed to cast that anxiety onto him
[00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:52.360]   and be liberated to make wise decisions
[00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:53.640]   even in the midst of the stress.
[00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:54.880]   That's a gift he's given you.
[00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:57.120]   My peace will come guard you.
[00:27:57.120 --> 00:28:00.040]   It will stand guard over your heart and your mind
[00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:02.400]   so you can access your heart in a healthy way
[00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:03.680]   and think rightly.
[00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:05.280]   You're still gonna use these things.
[00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:07.320]   I'm just gonna protect them from the anxiety
[00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:09.280]   that's gonna send you running the wrong direction.
[00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:10.600]   That's the gift you're given
[00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:13.400]   if you'll create the space to sit with him.
[00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:16.880]   Jeremiah Burroughs, the old Puritan, said it this way.
[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:20.800]   He said, "You don't pour wine into a shaky bottle,"
[00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:22.920]   which I just love that imagery 'cause you can imagine that.
[00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:24.120]   It's like, "Would you like a glass of wine?"
[00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:24.960]   "Sure."
[00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:25.800]   (congregation laughing)
[00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:26.640]   You're like, "Mm."
[00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:31.560]   He said, "You still the glass first,
[00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:33.880]   "and then wine gets poured in."
[00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:37.100]   He said, "God has blessings He wants to pour in your life,
[00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:39.120]   "but you gotta be still,
[00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:42.160]   "and some of us need to get this part right."
[00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:44.160]   He said, "It's like a child.
[00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:46.760]   "When a child comes to you asking for something,
[00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:49.320]   "it may be a thing you wanna give 'em,
[00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:51.760]   "but what are you gonna do first?"
[00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:53.880]   You want 'em to calm down.
[00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:54.720]   When they come running to you,
[00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:55.560]   "Can I have a snack, can I have a snack,
[00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:57.720]   "can I have a snack, can I have a snack?"
[00:28:57.720 --> 00:28:59.200]   Stop, stop.
[00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:05.760]   And you're like, "Hey, man, you gonna starve?
[00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:06.600]   "You ever starved yet?
[00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:09.280]   "Did I decide not to feed ya at some point?
[00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:10.600]   "That ain't even got some trauma?"
[00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:12.520]   "No, I'm gonna look out for you.
[00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:13.360]   "Just calm down.
[00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:16.820]   "Your stress about this dishonors me,
[00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:20.600]   "and you think I'm not gonna take care of you.
[00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:23.760]   "So be still, ask calmly,
[00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:25.420]   "because know your Father's heart delights
[00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:27.200]   "to take care of you.
[00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:31.760]   "Be still, cast your anxieties onto Him, 'cause He cares."
[00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:33.360]   Do you see it?
[00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:35.360]   For me, what I do in the morning
[00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:38.400]   is I have this little monitor I attach to my ear
[00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:39.880]   that measures not just your heart rate,
[00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:41.360]   but the distance between your heartbeats.
[00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:43.160]   It's to show, they call it coherence,
[00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:44.360]   just how calm you are.
[00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:45.760]   And when I start in the morning,
[00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:47.520]   it has this little reader on the phone,
[00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:50.000]   and it always starts red, which is bad.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.440]   And you know it's bad 'cause of the noise it makes
[00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:55.280]   as it just goes, "Dung," which is kind of inevitable,
[00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:57.560]   like, "Too much stress, you know, like you're dying."
[00:29:57.560 --> 00:29:58.640]   You're like, "Oh, man."
[00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:00.680]   And so then I just sit there and breathe,
[00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:04.180]   let my anxieties be known to God.
[00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:06.000]   And as I do that, it's the most interesting thing.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.140]   It's like, "Dung," turns blue.
[00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:10.680]   "Dung," turns green.
[00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:12.440]   I'm like, "Oh, okay."
[00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:13.840]   (congregation laughing)
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:14.880]   I got a clear mind.
[00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:17.280]   And what's crazy about it is
[00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:19.960]   that's where most mindfulness practices start.
[00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:22.200]   Stop, just empty your mind.
[00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:25.160]   That's only part one of a three-part move.
[00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:26.900]   You're not supposed to just sweep the house empty
[00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:27.740]   and leave it empty.
[00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:29.560]   You're supposed to put something in.
[00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:32.600]   And so that's why he says, "Cast your anxieties onto him.
[00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:34.600]   "I release my anxiety to him,
[00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:36.720]   "but then there's something else I embrace."
[00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:37.960]   That's verse eight.
[00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:40.160]   Brothers, whatever's true, whatever's honorable,
[00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:42.240]   whatever's just, whatever's pure, whatever's lovely,
[00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:44.200]   whatever's commendable, if there's any excellence,
[00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:47.480]   if anything worthy of praise, think about those things.
[00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:50.280]   And so I cast out of my mind my anxieties
[00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:52.800]   and I put into my mind holy thoughts.
[00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:54.880]   I release my anxious thoughts
[00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:56.840]   and I embrace his holy thoughts.
[00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:57.720]   That's what I do.
[00:30:57.720 --> 00:30:59.960]   I pour out my anxieties on that page
[00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:01.960]   and then I open the Word of God.
[00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:04.140]   And sometimes I write it out on that page
[00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:06.680]   and let Ben's anxious thoughts bend around
[00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:08.240]   his eternal Word.
[00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:09.400]   I put something in me.
[00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:10.520]   And what I've noticed is,
[00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:13.360]   is I think about these things that are true.
[00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:14.600]   What is really true?
[00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:16.920]   Let me not take God out of the equation
[00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:19.900]   when I'm thinking about where my career path's gonna go.
[00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:22.520]   Let me stop suddenly pretending like God's not real
[00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:25.400]   when I process who I should date and who I should marry.
[00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:28.020]   Let me start thinking about what is accurate
[00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:29.320]   about the situation I'm in.
[00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:30.760]   What is an honorable way to act?
[00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:31.600]   What is just?
[00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:32.600]   Start thinking about those things.
[00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:35.700]   And as I turn my mind there, it liberates me to function.
[00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:38.320]   Jeff Strucker's one of my heroes.
[00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:40.920]   Jeff Strucker was an army ranger in 1993
[00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:46.600]   tasked to drive the lead Humvee in the Battle of Mogadishu.
[00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:49.240]   The Battle of Mogadishu was famously portrayed
[00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:50.820]   in the movie "Black Hawk Down"
[00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:52.980]   where a small group of special forces
[00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:55.920]   were sent into the Somalian town of Mogadishu
[00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:58.460]   to pull out two high-value targets.
[00:31:58.460 --> 00:32:01.820]   It was meant to be a mission that was well under an hour.
[00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:05.500]   But in that mission, two Black Hawk helicopters were downed.
[00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:07.380]   The mission descended into chaos
[00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:08.940]   and it lasted not just through the day
[00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:11.380]   but through the night into the next day.
[00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:13.900]   Sergeant Strucker was in charge of driving the lead Humvee
[00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:16.100]   which was their exfil vehicle.
[00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:17.220]   And as he was driving it,
[00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:19.260]   they sustained their first casualty in the battle,
[00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:21.580]   his friend who was sitting next to him.
[00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:23.460]   But as the bullets riddled the side of his Humvee,
[00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:25.660]   he was able to make it out of the city alive
[00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:27.180]   and make it back to his base.
[00:32:27.180 --> 00:32:30.340]   And he said he got out and was just so thankful to be alive.
[00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:31.620]   And as he was there, like, oh my God,
[00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:32.460]   I can't believe I made it.
[00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:34.580]   There were literally thousands of soldiers
[00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:36.740]   surrounding them shooting and I survived.
[00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:38.060]   As he's processing that,
[00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:39.780]   his commanding officer came to him and said,
[00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:41.660]   "Hey, there's still men trapped in that city.
[00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:45.460]   "I need you to get in your Humvee and drive back in there."
[00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:47.620]   And he's like, "You gotta be kidding me."
[00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:49.260]   And then one of the other special forces men said,
[00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:50.280]   "Hey, before you do that,
[00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:52.200]   "you need to wash all this blood out of your truck.
[00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:53.320]   "It'll traumatize those men
[00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:55.220]   "if they have to sit in the blood of their fallen comrade.
[00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:56.820]   "You gotta clean this blood out of this truck
[00:32:56.820 --> 00:32:58.100]   "and then drive it back in there."
[00:32:58.100 --> 00:33:00.500]   And so he went to clean his friend's blood out of his truck
[00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:03.500]   and he tells the story that he just freaked out.
[00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:04.720]   He said, "Panic began to struck me
[00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:06.340]   "and I just thought, I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die."
[00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:08.100]   And he said, "It just kept going over and over in my head.
[00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:09.620]   "This is gonna be my blood, this is gonna be my blood,
[00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:10.460]   "this is gonna be my blood."
[00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:13.060]   And he said he was completely wracked with anxiety.
[00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:17.180]   And then in that moment, he started to pray
[00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:18.700]   and started to unload that onto God,
[00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:20.540]   his terror about losing his life.
[00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:23.920]   And as he unloaded that onto God,
[00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:26.620]   the thoughts started entering his mind of what's true.
[00:33:26.620 --> 00:33:30.660]   God determines my story, not my enemy.
[00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:34.260]   God writes history, not my enemy.
[00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:39.460]   And so if God wants me to live today, I'm gonna live.
[00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:42.460]   If God wants me to die today, I'm gonna die.
[00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:44.500]   He said, "If God lets me survive today,
[00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:48.260]   "I'll get to go home and see my wife and kids.
[00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:50.160]   "If God has me die today,
[00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:52.100]   "then I will go home to meet my Savior."
[00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:53.780]   'Cause he had faith in Jesus.
[00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:56.320]   He said, "But either way, I'm going home."
[00:33:56.320 --> 00:34:00.740]   And the more he focused on that, he said he calmed down,
[00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:03.700]   he was able to function, he got back in that Humvee,
[00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:06.460]   drove into danger and rescued men and drove out
[00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:11.020]   and then drove back again and again and again
[00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:12.860]   and rescued his fallen brothers.
[00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:13.700]   Why?
[00:34:13.700 --> 00:34:16.220]   Because he was practicing, I'm gonna release anxiety
[00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:17.780]   and I'm gonna take up what is true,
[00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:20.340]   what is accurate about who God is, what is honorable,
[00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:23.820]   what is the best way I could act in this work environment?
[00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:24.920]   What is just?
[00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:27.320]   What's the thing I could do in my office
[00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:29.660]   that fulfills all obligations to God and men?
[00:34:29.660 --> 00:34:30.500]   What is pure?
[00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:32.980]   What is the thing I could say that's not duplicitous,
[00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:34.100]   no false motives?
[00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:34.920]   What is lovely?
[00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:37.300]   What's a way to act that would be beautiful
[00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:38.140]   to people in the room?
[00:34:38.140 --> 00:34:39.180]   What is commendable?
[00:34:39.180 --> 00:34:41.240]   What's the kind of way I could make decisions
[00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:42.820]   that people would write books about?
[00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:44.140]   Saying that's the way to live life,
[00:34:44.140 --> 00:34:47.100]   that I don't condescend to the least common denominator
[00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:50.300]   of my culture, but I rise into the status of heroes
[00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:52.060]   in the way I conduct my story.
[00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:53.340]   How could I live like that?
[00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:55.660]   That if there's anything excellent or worthy of praise,
[00:34:55.660 --> 00:34:57.140]   I'm gonna think about those things.
[00:34:57.140 --> 00:34:59.140]   That's why I read a lot of biographies,
[00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:01.300]   'cause I don't wanna just react to my culture.
[00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:03.180]   I wanna read the stories of men and women
[00:35:03.180 --> 00:35:06.300]   who lived great lives and approximate my life to them.
[00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:09.500]   I wanna dwell on beautiful, commendable things,
[00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:11.540]   'cause I wanna be like 'em.
[00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:13.900]   That I cast my anxiety onto him,
[00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:16.120]   and I take his thoughts into me.
[00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:19.660]   I release anxiety, and I embrace the word of God,
[00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:22.540]   and I let it change me, because every good decision
[00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:24.460]   is first preceded by a good thought,
[00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:26.740]   bolstered by a courageous heart.
[00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:28.280]   And as good thoughts are plugged in,
[00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:30.700]   and a courageous heart feeds 'em, good decisions are made.
[00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:32.900]   So what I'm talking about here is the way you live
[00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:36.260]   a good life, a heroic life, a worthy life.
[00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:38.620]   It starts here in this lab.
[00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:40.140]   And so I wanna do this.
[00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:42.940]   And not only do I wanna read his word, verse nine,
[00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:45.100]   says, "In what you have learned and received
[00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:49.360]   "and heard and seen in me, practice these things,
[00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:51.900]   "and the God of peace will be with you."
[00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:52.740]   I love that.
[00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:54.660]   He says, "I don't want you to just read about it.
[00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:56.560]   "I want you to walk in it.
[00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:58.840]   "I want you to release anxiety.
[00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:00.940]   "I want you to embrace my thoughts,
[00:36:00.940 --> 00:36:03.940]   "and then I want you to excel at the revealed things."
[00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:08.180]   So often we wanna know God's unrevealed will.
[00:36:08.180 --> 00:36:09.660]   And he says, "I'm not gonna tell you."
[00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:11.500]   And then we stress about his job.
[00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:13.460]   He's like, "Let me do my job.
[00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:14.860]   "I've given you yours.
[00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:16.400]   "I've shown you, oh man, what is good,
[00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:18.300]   "what the Lord requires of you.
[00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:20.020]   "Love justice, walk humbly with your God.
[00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:23.260]   "He's told us, so I'm gonna get great
[00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:24.520]   "at the revealed things."
[00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:28.220]   So when I left college, it was a jarring experience.
[00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:29.260]   I know many of you have had that,
[00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:32.220]   where education keeps you on some rails,
[00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:33.820]   and then it's just like the rails end,
[00:36:33.820 --> 00:36:36.500]   and your little train just goes off a cliff and free floats.
[00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:37.660]   And you're like, "This feels bad."
[00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:40.220]   You know, and you're like, "Where's my life going?"
[00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:43.540]   And for me, I became a youth pastor.
[00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:46.620]   I'd never had a youth pastor.
[00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:48.300]   Didn't know what one did.
[00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:49.860]   And so I remember I showed up there,
[00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:50.700]   and I was like, "What do you do?"
[00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:52.660]   And someone said, "Well, you gotta go ask good youth pastors."
[00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:55.300]   So I went and met with great youth pastors all around Texas,
[00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:57.500]   and all of them had youth ministries about this size,
[00:36:57.500 --> 00:36:58.580]   and they were saying things to me like,
[00:36:58.580 --> 00:37:01.420]   "Well, when you hire your seventh middle school videographer,"
[00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:02.260]   and stuff like that.
[00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:03.100]   And I'm like, "Wait, what?"
[00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:05.100]   Because I had a ministry of six kids
[00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:07.740]   that after a few months, I had grown to one kid.
[00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:10.100]   And I was like, "Man, what?"
[00:37:10.100 --> 00:37:12.140]   And so they're talking about how to build an empire
[00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:13.780]   like this, and it was overwhelming.
[00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:15.520]   Now, granted, I wasn't doing much,
[00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:16.900]   but the thought of trying to take my little
[00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:18.220]   and make it big was too much.
[00:37:18.220 --> 00:37:19.060]   I couldn't handle it.
[00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:22.780]   I freaked out, and I quit, like a month in.
[00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:24.500]   I felt really bad about that,
[00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:26.260]   so I like unquit two days later.
[00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:28.660]   (congregation laughing)
[00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:30.140]   But I was like, "I literally don't know
[00:37:30.140 --> 00:37:31.260]   "what I'm doing with my life.
[00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:32.440]   "I don't even know what I'm doing here.
[00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:34.120]   "I don't even know if I wanna be a youth pastor.
[00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:34.960]   "Somebody help me."
[00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:36.240]   And I remember a mentor telling me,
[00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:39.060]   "Ben, you gotta figure out why you exist,
[00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:40.660]   "why it's Ben on the planet."
[00:37:40.660 --> 00:37:43.500]   And I just came back to the simple truth.
[00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:45.520]   All things are made by him and for him.
[00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:46.620]   I'm made for him.
[00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:49.040]   What's the greatest commandment?
[00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:51.740]   To love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, and mind.
[00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:53.420]   Love your neighbor as yourself.
[00:37:53.420 --> 00:37:54.820]   So I would put that in my calendar.
[00:37:54.820 --> 00:37:58.620]   If my first reason Ben exists is to know and love God,
[00:37:58.620 --> 00:37:59.620]   then I'm gonna do that every day.
[00:37:59.620 --> 00:38:01.220]   That's the first thing that lands in my calendar.
[00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:03.940]   And for me, the screens in my life were a distraction,
[00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:05.860]   so I got rid of my TV.
[00:38:05.860 --> 00:38:08.020]   'Cause I realized my God has talked to me,
[00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:10.300]   and I had never read most of what he had to say.
[00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:11.140]   I'm gonna change that.
[00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:13.160]   And I just wanted to get near him.
[00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:15.220]   And then I wanted to make him known.
[00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:16.300]   And what's that gonna look like?
[00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:17.740]   Well, for me, it was pretty easy at first.
[00:38:17.740 --> 00:38:18.580]   It was just one kid.
[00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:19.740]   I'm like, "Austin, how you doing, man?"
[00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:21.780]   And I'd talk to him, and then we grew it back
[00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:24.380]   to five, six kids, and I had this little youth ministry
[00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:28.100]   full of punks, in a technical sense.
[00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:31.300]   You know, they wore all black and safety pins and whatnot.
[00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:35.380]   And we would sit at Taco Bell and talk.
[00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:36.460]   It wasn't stuff like this.
[00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:37.660]   I didn't need a microphone.
[00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:39.300]   It was just all like, "All right, guys, can you scooch?
[00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:40.580]   "All right, gather in."
[00:38:40.580 --> 00:38:41.940]   And I was like, "I'm gonna make God known
[00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:43.220]   "to these six kids."
[00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:45.060]   And I would just do that.
[00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:46.420]   And I didn't really know how to build.
[00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:49.340]   I just wanted to be faithful at what he gave me to do.
[00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:50.820]   And as I was faithful with the little things,
[00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:52.500]   he taught me more things.
[00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:53.660]   And as I was faithful with those things,
[00:38:53.660 --> 00:38:54.500]   he gave me more things.
[00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:55.820]   And over the course of my life,
[00:38:55.820 --> 00:38:57.460]   I haven't known so much of what's coming,
[00:38:57.460 --> 00:39:00.540]   but I feel like I'm living a pretty great story.
[00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:02.900]   Because I don't know a lot, but I know him.
[00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:04.620]   And I trust him.
[00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:06.900]   And so I'm not gonna let anxiety wreck me,
[00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:09.220]   but I'm gonna let his word dwell richly in me,
[00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:11.980]   and then I'm gonna let my feet walk wherever he leads.
[00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:14.060]   And I wanna be excellent what is good,
[00:39:14.060 --> 00:39:15.780]   and I wanna be innocent of evil.
[00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:18.140]   Because when I do that, not only is the peace of God
[00:39:18.140 --> 00:39:20.940]   with me, the God of peace is with me.
[00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:22.140]   Isn't that great?
[00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:23.580]   I love that parallel at the end.
[00:39:23.580 --> 00:39:25.300]   It's not just that I wanna put my peace in your heart
[00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:28.580]   to guard you, the very God of peace steps into your story
[00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:30.300]   and says, "I'm gonna be with you.
[00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:32.100]   "I'm gonna stand with you.
[00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:34.140]   "I'm here with you in Dallas.
[00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:35.980]   "I'm here with you in that apartment.
[00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:38.900]   "Now your family's not here anymore, but I'm here.
[00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:40.860]   "Now that person is out of your life,
[00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:42.820]   "but the maker of the stars knows your name,
[00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:44.540]   "and he hasn't lost sight of you.
[00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:46.140]   "There's purpose in your life.
[00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:47.380]   "Live into that.
[00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:48.500]   "Walk with him.
[00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:50.260]   "There's a beautiful peace there."
[00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:54.180]   John Patton is another one of my heroes.
[00:39:54.180 --> 00:39:56.540]   John Patton was a missionary in the 1800s
[00:39:56.540 --> 00:39:59.300]   that sailed to the New Hebrides,
[00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:02.900]   a little island that was filled with cannibals.
[00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:06.940]   And people warned him when he left Scotland to go there.
[00:40:06.940 --> 00:40:09.060]   They were like, "Cannibals, John!
[00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:11.180]   "You're gonna be eaten by cannibals!"
[00:40:11.180 --> 00:40:16.580]   And his response was, "Well, sir, you're advanced in age,
[00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:18.700]   "soon to be eaten by worms."
[00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:21.620]   (congregation laughing)
[00:40:21.620 --> 00:40:23.540]   So whether I'm eaten by worms or cannibals
[00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:25.340]   doesn't really matter for me.
[00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:26.500]   I just wanna be faithful.
[00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:28.500]   It's a pretty cool answer.
[00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:29.660]   But then when he got there,
[00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:32.420]   his new adventure in life's pretty stressful.
[00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:34.740]   I mean, you read his biography, it's like an action movie.
[00:40:34.740 --> 00:40:35.580]   They should make it a movie.
[00:40:35.580 --> 00:40:37.580]   Like he's literally, people are trying to kill him
[00:40:37.580 --> 00:40:38.740]   like always.
[00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:40.140]   And so he's literally out there like,
[00:40:40.140 --> 00:40:41.740]   "Hey, I was thinking the other day,
[00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:44.900]   "like dodging axes and people coming at him."
[00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:46.820]   There was one point where they had surrounded
[00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:49.180]   his little hut and were about to murder him.
[00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:50.620]   He realized, "I can't escape."
[00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:51.980]   And so he's like, "I don't even know what to do."
[00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:54.500]   So he prayed and trust God, opened the door and walked out
[00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:57.780]   and rebuked them for inhospitality.
[00:40:57.780 --> 00:40:58.860]   He's like, "You know what, guys?
[00:40:58.860 --> 00:41:02.140]   "Frankly, all this murder is rude, okay?
[00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:04.940]   "Not cool."
[00:41:04.940 --> 00:41:08.940]   And he said, they were kind of like, "Wait, what?"
[00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:11.060]   And then it got like, it messed with him.
[00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:12.980]   They were like, "Yeah, sorry, man.
[00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:14.420]   "That's weird, yeah, no."
[00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:15.260]   And then he's right.
[00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:16.100]   I mean, he's right.
[00:41:16.100 --> 00:41:18.100]   And then they told him, "From now on,
[00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:19.100]   "we're gonna kill for you."
[00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:20.620]   And he's like, "Well, no, that's not, you know what?
[00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:23.140]   "Okay, that's a step, let's start there."
[00:41:23.140 --> 00:41:26.060]   And he just lived a crazy story.
[00:41:26.060 --> 00:41:35.420]   By the end of his story, an entire island that had,
[00:41:35.420 --> 00:41:39.780]   he said, been held captive by fear of animism
[00:41:39.780 --> 00:41:43.020]   was terrified of angry and capricious demons
[00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:46.540]   that were cruel to children and would murder women.
[00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:49.620]   He said he got to a situation where they realized,
[00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:51.020]   no, the heavens aren't angry with you,
[00:41:51.020 --> 00:41:52.460]   there's a God that loves you.
[00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:55.340]   No, the gods aren't making you sacrifice
[00:41:55.340 --> 00:41:57.140]   your women and children to them.
[00:41:57.140 --> 00:41:58.940]   Your God gave his son for you.
[00:41:58.940 --> 00:42:02.220]   And your God wants to do something beautiful in your life,
[00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:04.540]   not to hold you captive by fear,
[00:42:04.540 --> 00:42:06.340]   but to set you free to walk in the liberty
[00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:08.060]   of the sons and daughters of God.
[00:42:08.060 --> 00:42:12.180]   That's why his son came, to live the perfect life you can't,
[00:42:12.180 --> 00:42:15.220]   to be the sacrifice for you that you need,
[00:42:15.220 --> 00:42:16.900]   so you can be welcomed home,
[00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:19.300]   not trying to earn the favor of your God,
[00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:21.340]   but resting in the fact that you have it.
[00:42:21.340 --> 00:42:24.820]   And there was one night on his journey
[00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:28.780]   when it was still very uncertain that he found out again
[00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:30.340]   people were coming to kill him.
[00:42:30.340 --> 00:42:33.900]   A group of men that he didn't particularly trust
[00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:35.700]   told him about it and told him you had to flee,
[00:42:35.700 --> 00:42:37.940]   and they pointed out a tree for him to climb.
[00:42:37.940 --> 00:42:40.900]   And he wrote in his autobiography,
[00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:43.180]   being entirely at the mercy of such doubtful
[00:42:43.180 --> 00:42:44.700]   and vacillating friends,
[00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:47.980]   I, though perplexed, felt it best to obey.
[00:42:47.980 --> 00:42:50.260]   I climbed into the tree
[00:42:50.260 --> 00:42:52.140]   and was left there alone in the bush.
[00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:55.220]   The hours I spent there live all before me
[00:42:55.220 --> 00:42:56.460]   as if it were yesterday.
[00:42:56.460 --> 00:43:00.020]   I heard the frequent discharging of muskets
[00:43:00.020 --> 00:43:01.620]   and the yells of the savages.
[00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:05.780]   Yet I sat there among the branches,
[00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:08.220]   as safe as in the very arms of Jesus.
[00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:13.660]   Never in all my sorrows did my Lord draw nearer to me
[00:43:13.660 --> 00:43:17.820]   and speak more soothingly in my soul
[00:43:17.820 --> 00:43:19.180]   than when the moonlight flickered
[00:43:19.180 --> 00:43:21.380]   among those chestnut leaves
[00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:24.100]   and the night air played on my throbbing brow
[00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:26.700]   as I told all of my heart to Jesus.
[00:43:26.700 --> 00:43:29.620]   Alone yet not alone.
[00:43:29.620 --> 00:43:32.860]   If it be to glorify my God,
[00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:35.980]   I would not grudge to spend many times alone in such a tree.
[00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:39.260]   To feel again my Savior's presence,
[00:43:39.260 --> 00:43:41.740]   to enjoy his consoling fellowship.
[00:43:41.740 --> 00:43:43.580]   And then he asks us a question.
[00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:46.180]   If thus thrown back upon your own soul,
[00:43:46.180 --> 00:43:50.420]   alone, all alone in the midnight, in the wild,
[00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:51.860]   in the very embrace of death,
[00:43:51.860 --> 00:43:55.620]   do you have a friend who will not fail you then?
[00:43:55.620 --> 00:43:59.140]   The answer is you do.
[00:43:59.140 --> 00:44:02.740]   Jesus said, "Don't be anxious.
[00:44:02.740 --> 00:44:04.940]   "The world does that.
[00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:07.540]   "Your Father knows what you need.
[00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:10.020]   "So don't worry, my little flock.
[00:44:10.020 --> 00:44:13.340]   "God delights to give you the kingdom."
[00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:16.900]   So you got a rescuer who's come for you.
[00:44:16.900 --> 00:44:18.620]   You're not alone.
[00:44:18.620 --> 00:44:19.620]   You got a God who sees you.
[00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:20.460]   You're not alone.
[00:44:20.460 --> 00:44:23.740]   And there's an invitation before us today
[00:44:23.740 --> 00:44:26.980]   to put the anxiety down and to rest
[00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:29.580]   in an inexhaustible and unfailing love
[00:44:29.580 --> 00:44:32.500]   of a God who knows you and he cares
[00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:35.100]   and is strong enough to carry you if you'll let him.
[00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:38.100]   Father, I wanna thank you
[00:44:38.100 --> 00:44:43.820]   that you don't lie to us about the fact that life is hard.
[00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:47.660]   In this world, you will have trouble,
[00:44:47.660 --> 00:44:52.780]   but we take heart 'cause you've overcome the world.
[00:44:52.780 --> 00:44:57.740]   And God, I believe there's some people in this room
[00:44:57.740 --> 00:45:01.700]   that their whole life has been about,
[00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:03.420]   I gotta carry my own self,
[00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:06.660]   pull myself up by my own bootstraps,
[00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:07.700]   carry my own weight.
[00:45:07.700 --> 00:45:08.900]   I got broad shoulders.
[00:45:08.900 --> 00:45:09.740]   I can handle it.
[00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:10.580]   I can do it.
[00:45:10.580 --> 00:45:12.860]   My parents weren't there for me, but I'm there for me.
[00:45:12.860 --> 00:45:14.900]   Nobody's looking out for me, but I'm looking out for me.
[00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:16.700]   And you've done that, but how long?
[00:45:16.700 --> 00:45:20.780]   And you know in the stillness of the night,
[00:45:20.780 --> 00:45:22.100]   that's not how you're meant to live.
[00:45:22.100 --> 00:45:23.940]   There's something better.
[00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:26.500]   Yes, you are meant to carry great things,
[00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:29.380]   but you are meant to be carried by the great one.
[00:45:29.380 --> 00:45:31.780]   And as Jack said earlier, that's why Jesus came.
[00:45:31.780 --> 00:45:36.180]   To be the perfection you're not.
[00:45:36.380 --> 00:45:38.260]   To be the perfection you're not.
[00:45:38.260 --> 00:45:40.300]   And to be the perfection you're not.
[00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:42.300]   And to be the perfection you're not.
[00:45:42.300 --> 00:45:44.340]   And to be the perfection you're not.
[00:45:44.340 --> 00:45:46.380]   And to be the perfection you're not.
[00:45:46.380 --> 00:45:48.380]   And to be the perfection you're not.
[00:45:48.380 --> 00:45:50.420]   And to be the perfection you're not.
[00:45:50.420 --> 00:45:52.380]   And to be the perfection you're not.
[00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:54.420]   And to be the perfection you're not.
[00:45:54.420 --> 00:45:56.460]   And to be the perfection you're not.
[00:45:56.460 --> 00:45:58.500]   And to be the perfection you're not.
[00:45:58.500 --> 00:46:00.540]   And to be the perfection you're not.
[00:46:00.540 --> 00:46:02.500]   And to be the perfection you're not.
[00:46:02.500 --> 00:46:04.460]   And to be the perfection you're not.
[00:46:04.460 --> 00:46:07.100]   If the offer on the table is to know God as a father,
[00:46:07.100 --> 00:46:11.380]   a loving father, not an imperfect one like my earthly one,
[00:46:11.380 --> 00:46:12.420]   but a perfect one,
[00:46:12.420 --> 00:46:15.940]   then I want God to be a dad like that.
[00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:20.300]   And if you're feeling him call you,
[00:46:20.300 --> 00:46:21.540]   I just want you to say yes.
[00:46:21.540 --> 00:46:24.460]   I just want you to put your faith in him, to tell him yes.
[00:46:24.460 --> 00:46:28.780]   Even now while you're sitting there,
[00:46:28.780 --> 00:46:30.700]   if that's you say yes God, I want in.
[00:46:30.700 --> 00:46:32.780]   Bring me into your family by your grace.
[00:46:32.780 --> 00:46:35.200]   (soft music)
[00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:42.740]   And look, I can't see most of you,
[00:46:42.740 --> 00:46:46.580]   but I wonder if, well every heads down and eyes closed,
[00:46:46.580 --> 00:46:49.140]   if that's you and you're saying I wanna come home,
[00:46:49.140 --> 00:46:50.540]   I wanna put my faith in Jesus,
[00:46:50.540 --> 00:46:51.860]   would you put a hand up for me?
[00:46:51.860 --> 00:46:54.420]   Some of you I'll be able to see, some I won't.
[00:46:54.420 --> 00:46:55.660]   But it's more about you and God.
[00:46:55.660 --> 00:46:56.860]   Okay, I see a lot of them.
[00:46:56.860 --> 00:46:57.860]   All right, all right.
[00:46:57.860 --> 00:46:59.900]   Man, okay.
[00:46:59.900 --> 00:47:02.020]   Amazing.
[00:47:02.860 --> 00:47:04.220]   It's incredible.
[00:47:04.220 --> 00:47:05.060]   Praise God.
[00:47:05.060 --> 00:47:11.900]   Anybody wanna just tell him, me God,
[00:47:11.900 --> 00:47:14.180]   you see me and I see you and I'm coming home.
[00:47:14.180 --> 00:47:20.620]   Well, if that's you and you put a hand up,
[00:47:20.620 --> 00:47:22.020]   you just tell him thank you.
[00:47:22.020 --> 00:47:25.820]   Thank you for sending your son to come get me.
[00:47:25.820 --> 00:47:28.180]   I believe it.
[00:47:28.180 --> 00:47:30.500]   And I receive it.
[00:47:30.500 --> 00:47:31.340]   I believe it.
[00:47:31.340 --> 00:47:37.940]   And then for those of us who know him,
[00:47:37.940 --> 00:47:40.780]   and even if you don't, the invitation's on the table tonight
[00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:42.860]   and here's the thing, I don't want you to leave here
[00:47:42.860 --> 00:47:44.700]   and maybe at some point get around
[00:47:44.700 --> 00:47:46.580]   to casting your cares upon him.
[00:47:46.580 --> 00:47:48.560]   We got a moment here and we're about to leave,
[00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:50.580]   but just if you can hang in.
[00:47:50.580 --> 00:47:52.140]   I just don't wanna leave the space
[00:47:52.140 --> 00:47:54.540]   and miss out on a moment right now.
[00:47:54.540 --> 00:47:56.600]   To not say I'll cast my cares on him someday,
[00:47:56.600 --> 00:47:59.980]   but even now, you just got some space here.
[00:47:59.980 --> 00:48:01.260]   You got some quiet.
[00:48:01.260 --> 00:48:04.680]   And I wonder if across this room,
[00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:06.780]   we'd be willing to just open up empty hands
[00:48:06.780 --> 00:48:08.020]   and say this is it for me, God.
[00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:08.980]   I know you know what it is,
[00:48:08.980 --> 00:48:11.140]   but it's helpful for me to just say it.
[00:48:11.140 --> 00:48:13.500]   I'm anxious about this.
[00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:14.380]   I'm scared about that.
[00:48:14.380 --> 00:48:16.020]   I'm uncertain about this.
[00:48:16.020 --> 00:48:18.220]   And I don't want that anxiety to drive me.
[00:48:18.220 --> 00:48:20.700]   So I'm trusting you, I'm believing you,
[00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:22.020]   and I'm gonna do it tonight.
[00:48:22.020 --> 00:48:24.000]   I know I'm gonna get one thing right today,
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:24.840]   if nothing else.
[00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:25.980]   I'm gonna do what your word says
[00:48:25.980 --> 00:48:28.100]   and I'm just gonna cast this on you
[00:48:28.100 --> 00:48:30.780]   and believe that you're there and you care.
[00:48:30.780 --> 00:48:35.500]   Band's gonna lead us in a minute
[00:48:35.500 --> 00:48:37.600]   and they're gonna sing and for some of us,
[00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:40.460]   right away, you're gonna wanna rise up
[00:48:40.460 --> 00:48:41.580]   'cause what they're singing is gonna be
[00:48:41.580 --> 00:48:42.400]   the cry of your heart.
[00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:44.800]   You sing it out, brother, and you cry out, sister.
[00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:48.060]   Others of us, you're gonna need a minute
[00:48:48.060 --> 00:48:49.900]   to just sit and keep pouring out your heart
[00:48:49.900 --> 00:48:51.860]   and you just do that.
[00:48:51.860 --> 00:48:53.500]   When you're ready to sing, you sing along,
[00:48:53.500 --> 00:48:54.620]   but let's just have a moment here
[00:48:54.620 --> 00:48:55.460]   where we meet with God.
[00:48:55.460 --> 00:48:56.660]   Don't let it pass us by.
[00:48:56.660 --> 00:49:00.020]   (congregation murmuring)
[00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:02.820]   And all across this room, let us cast our cares on him.
[00:49:02.820 --> 00:49:09.140]   And then pray by his grace that we would believe
[00:49:09.140 --> 00:49:12.900]   that he cares and he is big enough to carry us.
[00:49:12.900 --> 00:49:17.180]   So much bigger than we thought he was.
[00:49:17.180 --> 00:49:27.180]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
