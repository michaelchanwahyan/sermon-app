[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:21.320]   - Y'all, welcome to The Porch, Dallas, Texas.
[00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.440]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.080]   It's so good, it's so good to be here
[00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.960]   worshiping with all of you.
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.380]   And God is at work in this place, in this city.
[00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.900]   We've been praying all day for you,
[00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.560]   specifically like every seat, every row,
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:35.600]   you have been prayed for,
[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.320]   we've been asking God to move in power.
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.160]   And there's others that we wanna acknowledge too
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.200]   as I look into these cameras
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.480]   because all across the nation,
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.680]   there are people gathered, young adults,
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.520]   but right now, tonight, we wanna recognize Fort Worth
[00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.800]   and Indianapolis and where else?
[00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:51.880]   Somewhere else, where else?
[00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:52.840]   Remind me.
[00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.080]   Tulsa, that's right, Tulsa, Oklahoma.
[00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.760]   Dude, so welcome Porch Live locations,
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.060]   those three and everyone else.
[00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.460]   And I'm thankful to be with you.
[00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.520]   My name is John, I'm one of the teaching pastors
[00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.220]   here at the church.
[00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.780]   And I wanna tell you about a time
[00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.540]   and I want you to know up front too,
[00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.000]   I've like felt like I'm on the verge of crying all day.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.700]   I think because of this message
[00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.620]   that I believe the Lord has laid on my heart.
[00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.620]   And so I was sitting across from my grandfather,
[00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.220]   technically, he was my grandfather-in-law,
[00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.720]   my wife, Laura, her grandfather.
[00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.020]   We were at my in-law's ranch and he was there
[00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.520]   and he, at this point in his life,
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.580]   had been diagnosed with cancer, he was dying.
[00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.420]   And my grandfather was an agnostic,
[00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:39.780]   like I don't know if there is a God,
[00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.820]   he would always say like, "Well, if I die,"
[00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:42.840]   whenever we'd share the gospel, he's like,
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.260]   "If I die, I reserve the right to be surprised."
[00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:46.980]   I'm like, "Well, no, actually you don't.
[00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.760]   "Like once you died, the surprise that you will see,
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.040]   "it'll be too late, your fate will be sealed."
[00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.240]   As scripture says, it's appointed for man to die once
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.760]   and then face judgment, like that'll be it.
[00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.920]   And he was an atheist, he's like,
[00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.100]   at times, I think because of the loss
[00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.520]   that he had been through, he lost his wife
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.060]   and his daughter to cancer, just like anger.
[00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.580]   Like if there is a God, I don't want anything
[00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.500]   to do with him, so I'm just gonna say you don't exist
[00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.740]   'cause where were you in my greatest time of need?
[00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.800]   Never vocalized or verbalized those things,
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.900]   but you could just, the pain was there.
[00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.540]   And then I would say he was pantheistic,
[00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.820]   meaning God was everything and in everything.
[00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.220]   And so my wife and I, Laura,
[00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.060]   I was sharing the gospel with him on repeat
[00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.100]   throughout my 10 years that he got to be my grandfather,
[00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.500]   who's the grandfather I never had.
[00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.940]   And we're in Colorado once at his little cabin
[00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.900]   and I said, "Hey, this is who Jesus is.
[00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:39.860]   "You know my story.
[00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.420]   "I was an alcoholic, I was a bad person.
[00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.940]   "Jesus saves me, like I didn't decide the change.
[00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.780]   "He saved me, changed me.
[00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:47.760]   "I was forgiven of my sins.
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.700]   "I wasn't given a better life, but a new life."
[00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.120]   And he's just politely listening and he's like,
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.540]   "Uh-huh."
[00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.540]   I was like, "Who do you think made all this?"
[00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.520]   Looking at like the beauty of Colorado and he's like,
[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.300]   "Well, I believe God is in the deer
[00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.620]   "and God is in the mountains and my church is the mountains."
[00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.620]   And it was just, it was animism, pantheism.
[00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.260]   So there we are sitting at the dining room table
[00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.140]   at my in-laws ranch and he pulls out a guitar.
[00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.820]   I'd never, I didn't even know he played guitar.
[00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.140]   He's an old like Korean war vet, fighter pilot.
[00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.460]   And pulls out this guitar.
[00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.940]   I was like, we called him Da, affectionately.
[00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.620]   Like that was his name.
[00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.740]   That's what my wife called him when she was a little kid
[00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:31.740]   before she could speak.
[00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:33.080]   She called him Da and we're like,
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.780]   "Da, I didn't know you played the guitar."
[00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.700]   And he's like, "Well, I dabble."
[00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.880]   And he starts to play and I was like,
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.500]   "Well, where did you learn to play this?"
[00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.740]   And he's like, "Oh, my friend from the Bog Riders taught me."
[00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:52.100]   And I was like, "The what?"
[00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.020]   And he's like, "The Bog Riders."
[00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:57.780]   I was like, he was missing teeth at this point in his life.
[00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:58.860]   I didn't know what he was saying.
[00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.660]   I'm like, "Da, I don't know what you're saying.
[00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.500]   Like, hold on, who taught you this?
[00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.260]   Like, where did you learn to play the guitar?"
[00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.020]   He's like, "The Bog Riders."
[00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.120]   I'm like, "What are you saying?"
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.500]   He's like, he leans down, he sets his guitar down.
[00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.860]   He's like, "Do you not know what a Bog Rider is?"
[00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.780]   As if I was the one that was,
[00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.380]   no, no, no one knows what a Bog Rider is, frankly.
[00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.540]   I was like, "No, I don't know what a Bog Rider is."
[00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.500]   He lays the guitar on his lap and he's like, "Oh."
[00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.540]   Well, the Bog Rider is the worst job
[00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.260]   that a cowboy could have.
[00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.700]   It's the job that no cowboy wants to have,
[00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.160]   but he must have if he's a good cowboy.
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.500]   You see, the Bog Rider, he rides to all the bogs
[00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.140]   because when the rains stop
[00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:44.520]   and the watering holes begin to dry up,
[00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.020]   cattle will go to those known watering holes
[00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.500]   and in order to get to the water that is now receded,
[00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.980]   they'll go further and further into the mud
[00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.540]   just to get to the water.
[00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:59.980]   And then when they get the water that they desired,
[00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:01.540]   they're stuck.
[00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.940]   They're stuck in that bog, B-O-G.
[00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:09.220]   And the birds of death start swirling.
[00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.020]   The vultures, the buzzards, knowing that cow,
[00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.260]   that livestock, that sheep is not getting out.
[00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:17.820]   This is a certain death.
[00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.380]   And so they begin to descend and they're swirling.
[00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:26.380]   But the Bog Rider begins to watch the sky and the horizon
[00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:30.460]   and he goes to all of the bogs, all of the creeks,
[00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:35.460]   the lakes, the tanks, the ponds in search of any stray
[00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:39.300]   rather than following him back to safe pasture,
[00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.220]   got stuck in one of the bogs.
[00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:44.120]   And when he finds a cow that's stuck in a bog,
[00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.740]   my grandfather tells me, he gets off of his horse,
[00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.620]   he ties the lasso to the saddle horn,
[00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.120]   then he takes the lasso and he can't just throw it
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.340]   around the cow because what would happen is,
[00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:59.740]   is it would go around its neck and the force and weight
[00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.800]   of the mud, the suction, the weight that's upon it,
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.420]   if he were to pull it out at that point,
[00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:07.820]   it would kill what he would gone to rescue.
[00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:11.340]   And so instead, the Bog Rider gets off of his horse
[00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:14.680]   and with a small hand shovel, begins shoveling out
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:19.360]   as he is immersed now in the muck and mire and the bog.
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.040]   He's now in where he does not want to be,
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:24.900]   taking all of that filth upon him,
[00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.720]   simply to rescue this animal.
[00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:31.080]   And then he puts it around the horns of the animal
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:34.240]   or maybe the legs and begins then to instruct
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.920]   and get the horse to pull it out.
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:39.760]   Now he's covered in total filth, dirty from head to toe.
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:43.140]   The cow often he said would just like kick and thrash
[00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:44.860]   against the very one who saved him,
[00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:47.580]   flinging mud up onto his face, knocking off his hat,
[00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:48.980]   losing things in the mud.
[00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:50.540]   And then he goes back to the mess hall
[00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:54.120]   and he just looks like the greatest fool.
[00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.900]   As everyone else has already been there,
[00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:57.760]   they're all cleaned up, they've done their work
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.600]   and here comes the Bog Rider.
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:05.580]   For the sake of one, just one, covered head to toe.
[00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:09.100]   But in faithfulness would go and do that.
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:15.040]   And then my agnostic, atheist, pantheist,
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:20.320]   animistic grandfather looks at me across the table
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:21.780]   with tears in his eyes.
[00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:24.560]   And he says, you know, John,
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:30.980]   my friend tells me that Christ is the great Bog Rider.
[00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:35.800]   I was like, he is.
[00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:39.580]   He is, dawg, he is the great Bog Rider.
[00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:42.660]   Like there's no greater explanation.
[00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:44.160]   That's what he did.
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.620]   Dawg, when I was dying in my alcoholism,
[00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:50.300]   I was so stuck living on a couch, gun to my head,
[00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:52.900]   wanting to die, knowing I was dying.
[00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:55.660]   The birds of death were swirling around me
[00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:59.340]   as doctors told me, if you keep drinking, you'll die.
[00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:00.220]   There was no way out.
[00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:01.860]   I tried quitting on my own.
[00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:03.300]   I was stuck, dawg.
[00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:06.500]   But I cried out to Jesus.
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:10.440]   And the filth that he took upon himself
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:13.640]   was the bog of sin that I was stuck in.
[00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:17.240]   And he saved me, and he'll save you too.
[00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:20.800]   And he said something to the effect of,
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.240]   I'm happy that he's brought you peace.
[00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:27.060]   And then went into singing Home on the Range.
[00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:30.580]   And I'm like, you gotta be kidding me.
[00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:32.320]   Like, God, I've been praying and petitioning
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:33.480]   for this man's life.
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:34.840]   He's dying of cancer.
[00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:37.780]   He just shared the gospel in a sense with me
[00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:39.900]   by saying Christ is the great bog rider.
[00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:43.140]   And there was a veil blocking his heart and mind
[00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:45.620]   that he cannot see Jesus for who he is,
[00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:49.000]   nor can he see the bog of sin that he is stuck in.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.900]   And it haunted me.
[00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:53.580]   And I was sitting at my desk,
[00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:57.100]   and I'm just thinking about the bog rider,
[00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:59.060]   and I'm thinking about my grandfather,
[00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:03.540]   and I pull out my phone, my little ESV Bible app,
[00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:08.540]   and I search bog, B-O-G, search.
[00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:16.060]   One instance, one singular instance
[00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:18.980]   in the entirety of these scriptures
[00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:22.880]   is the word bog, B-O-G.
[00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:27.220]   Psalm 40, verse one through three.
[00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:32.860]   Awaited patiently for the Lord,
[00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:37.100]   he inclined to me and heard my cry.
[00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:41.220]   You think about one, an animal that's stuck in a bog
[00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:44.660]   and can't move, and the crying out that it would do
[00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:47.300]   knowing the certain death.
[00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:49.300]   And all you can do is wait.
[00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:50.140]   What are you gonna do?
[00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:52.980]   You have nothing to do but wait patiently and cry.
[00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:58.980]   He drew me up from the pit of destruction
[00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:02.140]   out of the miry bog.
[00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:04.220]   The bog rider.
[00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:10.940]   And set my feet upon a rock, making my steps secure.
[00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:16.100]   He put a new song in my mouth, a song of praise to our God.
[00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:21.380]   Many will see and fear and put their trust in the Lord.
[00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:25.940]   It's a psalm by David.
[00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:28.940]   David wrote the psalm.
[00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:30.700]   It says that it's recorded right there.
[00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:33.380]   To the choir master of David.
[00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:36.300]   And I'm looking at the verses and I'm like,
[00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:37.180]   I can't believe this.
[00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:40.480]   Like, out of the miry bog, that's literally the picture
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:42.340]   that I was just told of this bog rider.
[00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:47.340]   Like, God is, Christ is, Jesus is the bog rider.
[00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:51.340]   Just riding to the bogs of sin to find those
[00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:53.780]   who are waiting and crying out to him
[00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:55.860]   and then setting their feet upon a rock.
[00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:59.060]   And I'm reading it and my mind is blown
[00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:01.540]   because of this.
[00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:07.860]   I'm like, wait, David wrote this.
[00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:15.340]   David, before he was a king, was a rancher.
[00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:23.180]   David, David was writing what he had done hundreds of times.
[00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:27.060]   He was caring for sheep.
[00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:31.140]   And when a sheep gets wet or weighted down by water
[00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:33.980]   or by mud, that's it, game over.
[00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:39.140]   And David, I believe from this, knowing what he had done,
[00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:42.180]   he had gone to the bogs in search of the strays
[00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:44.940]   who didn't follow the voice of the shepherd, David.
[00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:47.100]   And so he went back, searched the bogs,
[00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:49.740]   knowing that there might've been one that had strayed
[00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:52.980]   that was doomed for death and pulled it out
[00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:57.980]   of the miry bog and set its feet upon a rock.
[00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:02.420]   He heard the cry of the sheep.
[00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:06.500]   And I'm like, oh my goodness, David's writing
[00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:08.460]   about what he had done for his sheep.
[00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:11.580]   And he's like, that's what you did for me, God.
[00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:13.620]   What he had done for his sheep, he's considering it.
[00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:17.100]   Maybe it was one day and he literally had been taking
[00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:20.460]   that sheep and all the mud and filth and excrement
[00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:24.140]   upon himself of that trapped one and stopped
[00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:27.700]   and paused in that moment, was like, oh my goodness.
[00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:30.540]   I waited patiently for the Lord.
[00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:32.200]   He inclined and heard my cry.
[00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:38.100]   He rescued me out of the pit of destruction,
[00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:40.380]   out of the miry bog and set my feet upon a rock.
[00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:42.860]   Like God, you've done this for me.
[00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:47.500]   And put it down in a Psalm inspired by the Spirit.
[00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:50.420]   And so the actions of David that you see in Psalm 40
[00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:51.900]   is that he was saved.
[00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:56.740]   Then you will see in verses six through eight
[00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:58.900]   that he was surrendered, he was saved,
[00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:02.300]   then he was surrendered, and then he spoke.
[00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:05.020]   There's a refrain throughout Psalm 40.
[00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:06.780]   He says, many will see and fear
[00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:08.140]   and put their trust in the Lord.
[00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:10.140]   And the reason that they would do that
[00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:14.420]   is because David was saved by the bog rider.
[00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:17.180]   Then he was surrendered to the will of God.
[00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:18.740]   And then he speaks.
[00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:20.020]   He can't help but speak.
[00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:22.700]   Like I'm gonna tell everybody of your deeds
[00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:24.620]   in the great congregation.
[00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:26.620]   That's the refrain, that's the response.
[00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:28.860]   The David's like, I'm about to tell everybody
[00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:31.100]   because I believe that everyone has sin,
[00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:33.100]   but not everybody has a savior.
[00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:35.460]   And so I'm gonna tell everybody what you have done for me,
[00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:37.580]   that you are the great bog rider,
[00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:40.500]   that you save us out of the bog, the pit of destruction.
[00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:44.140]   And I'm gonna tell everyone in my surrendering, I will speak.
[00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:47.540]   I will not restrain my lips, as the scriptures say.
[00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:50.220]   And then the actions of God are the great bog rider.
[00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:53.300]   He hears cries, he inclines his ear.
[00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:58.060]   He's listening for the cries of the one who was stuck.
[00:13:58.060 --> 00:14:00.940]   And truly everyone is stuck, but only some cry.
[00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:04.620]   And then he draws up from the pit of destruction.
[00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:06.100]   He makes us secure.
[00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:08.940]   He puts a new song in your mouth, not a better song,
[00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:11.380]   a new song because he gives a new life.
[00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:16.100]   And then he moves others to see and fear
[00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:18.780]   and put their trust in him, this ripple effect.
[00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:23.220]   And so if I'm you, I'm sitting there, I'm like, really?
[00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:26.980]   But really, is that just a good story from a grandpa?
[00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:29.220]   Really is Christ the great bog rider?
[00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:32.720]   You found one verse, Psalm 40.
[00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:36.960]   Listen to Hebrews chapter 13, verse 20.
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:41.680]   Now may the God of peace and the opposite of peace,
[00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:46.220]   just being turmoil and chaos and desperation,
[00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:49.820]   like the God of peace who brought again from the dead
[00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:51.580]   our Lord Jesus.
[00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:57.740]   Listen, the great shepherd of the sheep.
[00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:04.260]   He's the one who seeks after you.
[00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.220]   He's the one who laid down his life.
[00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:10.460]   He went into the bog, the pit of destruction.
[00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:14.800]   He went into sin and death to pull you out.
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:17.740]   And then after having laid down his life,
[00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:20.980]   he walked out of that pit of destruction alive
[00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:22.120]   and raised again.
[00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:25.060]   It's the gospel.
[00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:26.740]   It's the gospel.
[00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:29.420]   It's that everyone is in a pit of destruction.
[00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:31.020]   It's sin.
[00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:35.340]   And it's unloving to not tell someone that they have sin.
[00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:39.160]   Like how horrific to be like, I don't know, man,
[00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:41.880]   you do you, who am I to judge?
[00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:45.760]   Or rather to be like, man, everybody's got sin.
[00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:48.140]   Me foremost, let me tell you all about it.
[00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:49.840]   But I don't just have sin, I have a savior.
[00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:53.080]   It's Romans 6, 23, it says the wages of sin is death.
[00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:56.600]   Everyone has sin and what we get because of our sin
[00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:59.420]   is death, it says, but the free gift of God.
[00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:02.580]   There's nothing anyone stuck in a bog can do to earn that.
[00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:06.160]   That is only the love and mercy and grace
[00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:08.200]   of the one coming to rescue.
[00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:11.640]   But the free gift of God is eternal life
[00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:14.480]   in Christ Jesus, our Lord.
[00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:17.400]   And so there's two people in the room tonight.
[00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:19.440]   You're one of two people.
[00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:23.840]   You're either crying in the pit of destruction.
[00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:25.360]   You're in the pit of destruction right now
[00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:28.480]   and that cry may be so faint, that cry might sound like
[00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:31.360]   anger or rejection or scoffing at God,
[00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:32.940]   just like my grandfathers did.
[00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:35.080]   But if you're in a pit of destruction,
[00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:39.360]   if you're in that bog of sin, the response is to cry out.
[00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:41.400]   Save me.
[00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:46.580]   Or you've been saved from that miry bog.
[00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:50.000]   You've had your feet set upon the rock.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.080]   Christ, the great bog rider has saved you
[00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:54.320]   and now he's put a new song in your mouth.
[00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:56.620]   And so you're either crying or you're singing.
[00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:59.240]   You're crying or you're singing.
[00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:00.920]   And the other two people that are in this room
[00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:03.000]   and you're one of two here also,
[00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:07.360]   is you're either in need of being saved
[00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:10.780]   or you're in need of surrendering.
[00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:15.100]   You either need to be saved to place your faith in Jesus
[00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:16.680]   for the forgiveness of your sins,
[00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:20.320]   believing that he died the death on the cross for you.
[00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:22.980]   Sinless Savior of all mankind, he died for you.
[00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:25.560]   It's not just that it's true, it's true for you,
[00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:27.380]   for your sins.
[00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:30.120]   Not just for sins, your sins.
[00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:33.760]   And believing that God raised him from the dead
[00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:37.120]   and that if you call out to him,
[00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:39.640]   for everyone who confesses that Jesus is Lord
[00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:41.880]   and believes that God raised him from the dead,
[00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:44.880]   will be saved, you're in need of saving
[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:46.860]   or you're in need of surrendering.
[00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:49.320]   Because you can be saved and not surrendered.
[00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:51.460]   When it says the free gift of God is eternal life
[00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:54.040]   in Christ Jesus our Lord,
[00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:56.440]   Christ means the Messiah, the anointed one,
[00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:58.320]   the one who was to come,
[00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:00.160]   the one who would lay down on his life,
[00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:03.200]   who would go into sin and death on our behalf,
[00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:05.840]   lay down his life that we might go free
[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:08.440]   and then he would take it back up his life again.
[00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:14.440]   You can believe in that, be saved and not be surrendered.
[00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:18.120]   And thus you wouldn't experience the full abundant life.
[00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:19.800]   Like Jesus says, I've come to give them life
[00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:20.840]   that they might have it to the full.
[00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:23.640]   And you're like, dude, I don't have that.
[00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:27.000]   Just feels like, nah, straddling the fence,
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.200]   like Reagan said, of the world and of Christ.
[00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:34.520]   And so you're either in need of being saved
[00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:36.920]   or in need of surrendering.
[00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:40.200]   And tonight you're gonna be met with that choice.
[00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:42.000]   Tonight you'll be met with that choice.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.240]   But surely Christ is the great bog rider.
[00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:50.520]   And then my mind was blown again.
[00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:52.360]   So I'm thinking about the bog rider,
[00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:54.480]   I'm thinking about David being a rancher
[00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:58.000]   and that he's saving sheep.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.480]   How many he must have gone,
[00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:02.760]   like stepped down into the mud.
[00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:05.200]   We know that he fought off bear and lion
[00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:06.440]   in order to rescue a sheep.
[00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:08.760]   In this case, I believe that he literally stepped
[00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:13.120]   into all that filth to rescue out his livestock
[00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:14.840]   as a rancher to save.
[00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:21.680]   But it goes on, we know from the Bible,
[00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:25.080]   like nobody had a sheep as a pet.
[00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:26.880]   Just wasn't a thing.
[00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:29.120]   Still not a thing to this day typically.
[00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:31.680]   Like no, but David wasn't raising sheep to be like,
[00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:32.960]   all right, here's my little flock
[00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:35.200]   and I'm just gonna, they're gonna live to a ripe old age
[00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:36.680]   and one day they'll get kind of old
[00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:38.560]   and man, I won't even put them down,
[00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:40.200]   I'll just bury them with a little, you know,
[00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:43.240]   cross in the yard and there's Geppetto
[00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:45.460]   and there's Tommy and he was a good one.
[00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:51.320]   But rather those sheep were being raised to be sacrificed.
[00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:55.560]   This is crazy.
[00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:56.680]   Total paradox.
[00:19:56.680 --> 00:20:00.520]   He is saving a sheep in one instance
[00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:03.280]   and then laying down sheep in another,
[00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:05.320]   be it for Passover or whatever meal,
[00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:08.680]   but that sheep was to give up its life,
[00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:11.800]   to give up its wool, to give up its life
[00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:16.600]   for the purpose of the master.
[00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:20.760]   And there comes the surrender.
[00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:22.360]   And as it says in Hebrews 13,
[00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:27.360]   when I just said that Jesus brought back from the dead
[00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:29.780]   is the great shepherd of the sheep,
[00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:32.320]   listen to how the verse continues.
[00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:34.700]   It says in 21,
[00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:39.840]   that he would equip you with everything good
[00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:44.640]   that you may do his will,
[00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:47.520]   not your will any longer.
[00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:49.920]   He saved you to send you out.
[00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:52.040]   He saved you to change you.
[00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:55.120]   He saved you that you might surrender
[00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:57.360]   and quit kicking against the goats,
[00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:00.600]   but instead to be like, you rescued me from all,
[00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:02.280]   I give you all.
[00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:04.720]   I surrender everything to you.
[00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:06.140]   How could I not?
[00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:07.680]   My life is yours.
[00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:09.720]   Now, in this case, the analogy breaks down
[00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:11.520]   because he's not sacrificing you
[00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:14.360]   and asking you to physically die,
[00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:16.400]   but it does say in Luke chapter nine,
[00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:18.360]   that if anyone would come after Jesus,
[00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:20.160]   he must take up his cross,
[00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:24.480]   deny himself daily to follow him.
[00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:26.400]   That there is a daily death of self
[00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:28.960]   and that daily death is a death to our own will.
[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:33.640]   Like it's no longer my will, your will be done.
[00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:36.120]   That that's the only way to live.
[00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:38.320]   And so I'll tell you when my life changed,
[00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:42.040]   when my life radically changed,
[00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:44.560]   is when my life was falling apart,
[00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:46.480]   I placed my faith in Jesus.
[00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:48.320]   And then just like days later,
[00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:49.700]   I got on my knees,
[00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:52.640]   besides that couch that I was living on,
[00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:54.520]   face to the ground,
[00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:56.680]   and I surrendered everything.
[00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:59.900]   I was like, Jesus, I have been a really bad Lord of my life.
[00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:00.740]   You get everything.
[00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:02.440]   You get my money, you get my mind,
[00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:04.680]   you get my body, you get my relationships,
[00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:07.160]   you get my job, you get who I date,
[00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:09.120]   you get my computer, you get my phone,
[00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:11.280]   you get my car, you get where I live,
[00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:14.840]   you get my free time, you get everything.
[00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:16.560]   It's all yours.
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:20.340]   And in that surrendering came the greatest freedom.
[00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:25.080]   It's like I was just drowning,
[00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:27.880]   like barely getting a gasp of breath,
[00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:29.920]   and then like these weights were cut off,
[00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:32.220]   and I was free, free.
[00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:38.160]   Because I was no longer daily battling, hourly battling,
[00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:40.920]   between like the lust of the flesh,
[00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:43.440]   and what I wanted with women,
[00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:46.240]   versus like, no, my body is a temple,
[00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:48.920]   and those women are precious in the sight of the Lord.
[00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:52.520]   And I wanna be rich, filthy, dirty, rich.
[00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:54.460]   I wanna retire at 40 to like,
[00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:57.840]   I don't care about money anymore.
[00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:00.600]   It was actually a real problem in my life.
[00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:02.200]   And I want things.
[00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:04.900]   I want the townhouse, the lake house,
[00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:08.300]   the Land Rover, the BMW, all the things.
[00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:10.400]   That'll give me satisfaction to like,
[00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:13.840]   no, those things were a trap.
[00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:16.400]   And the more I had, the more they had me.
[00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:17.600]   And I want status.
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:18.960]   I wanna make a name for myself.
[00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:21.520]   I want people to know John Elmore,
[00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:25.560]   advertising exec in Austin, Texas.
[00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:26.620]   Such a joke.
[00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:31.440]   To like, no, I want people to know about Jesus.
[00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:34.900]   He saved me, and I'm gonna spend the rest of my life
[00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:37.000]   telling everybody that he is real.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.460]   You are never too far gone, and he can change everything.
[00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:41.800]   Forget my name, the name of Jesus.
[00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:44.000]   Forget my kingdom, his kingdom.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   Forget me trying to live by my power.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.600]   It's all by his power.
[00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:50.560]   Forget me trying to live for my own vain glory.
[00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:53.060]   Let's live for Christ's glory.
[00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:54.880]   There was a surrendering, and in that surrendering
[00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:59.600]   brought total freedom, and joy, and peace.
[00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:01.320]   I was no longer striving against God.
[00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:03.240]   I was with him.
[00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:06.640]   We were at that same ranch, and we have trouble with hogs,
[00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:08.560]   like feral hogs that just tear up the land,
[00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:11.180]   tear up the fence, the cows get out, and all that.
[00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:12.140]   So we hunt the hogs.
[00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:14.700]   If you're an animal fan, I'm sorry.
[00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:16.600]   We didn't rescue them, we killed them.
[00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:24.460]   So we set the traps, steel traps, put in some corn,
[00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:25.900]   little trail of corn leading into it.
[00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:28.940]   The hog walks in, hits the trip wire, door shuts,
[00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:31.820]   shoot the hog, leave it for the vultures, circle of life.
[00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:36.020]   Some of you just tuned out, and some of you are like,
[00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:36.860]   I like him.
[00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:39.820]   (audience laughing)
[00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:40.760]   One shot, one kill.
[00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:43.740]   Anyway, that's how I'm training my son.
[00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:48.300]   But we go and we check the traps,
[00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:51.020]   and it's like hog, hog, hog, hog, baby hogs.
[00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:51.860]   That's a sad story.
[00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:54.400]   Anyway, we get to another one,
[00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:58.460]   we get to another one, and there's a white-tailed deer.
[00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:02.020]   And this deer is like, I mean, if I can make the sound,
[00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:04.500]   like, (hitting)
[00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:08.580]   just like shredding itself,
[00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:13.180]   full speed in a six by four steel cage,
[00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:17.500]   slamming its head as hard as it can into the sides,
[00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:19.120]   kicking, getting its legs stuck.
[00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:20.420]   It's got blood on its eyes.
[00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:22.340]   I mean, just like, oh my goodness, oh my goodness,
[00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:23.820]   I gotta get the deer out.
[00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:28.020]   And so I start walking up to it.
[00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:31.940]   And at this point, it's, I mean, it was going crazy.
[00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:35.860]   Now it's like bonafide out of its mind, this poor deer.
[00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:37.720]   You can see, like, I mean, its tongue's hanging out.
[00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:39.620]   It hasn't had water for hours.
[00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:43.060]   It went in for the corn, and now it's like so trapped.
[00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:44.980]   It thinks I'm like there to kill it.
[00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:47.220]   It's probably heard about me from the hogs, but I'm not.
[00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:48.220]   I'm there to free it.
[00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:50.780]   And I'm walking up, and I'm now,
[00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:52.500]   at this point it feels even dangerous
[00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:54.820]   because this thing is flailing.
[00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:57.020]   And Laura's like, be careful, be careful.
[00:25:57.020 --> 00:25:58.940]   I'm like, God, who are you talking to?
[00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:01.500]   And I've gotta release the spring,
[00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:04.060]   this big, like, garage door spring.
[00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:06.420]   And then I, like, take the latch,
[00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:08.940]   and it's like freaking out at the other side of the cage.
[00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:11.900]   I swing the door open, and once that thing
[00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:13.960]   sees just a little two by three,
[00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:16.900]   no longer any kind of mesh, bolts,
[00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:19.660]   like as fast and far as it can.
[00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:21.960]   And in that moment, it feels so free.
[00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:25.900]   But it's actually running to certain death.
[00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:30.320]   Like, the best thing in the world for that deer to do
[00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:32.540]   would be to just, like, lay down at my feet.
[00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:33.740]   Dude, we'd adopt that thing.
[00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:36.880]   My daughter, Penny, she would be, like,
[00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:40.020]   the best deer whisperer to that little injured deer.
[00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:42.140]   Like, I mean, we would adopt it.
[00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:42.980]   We would care for it.
[00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:43.980]   It'd be the best thing in the world.
[00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:47.860]   Like, hand feed it, baby bottle of whatever deers drink.
[00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:48.700]   Is deer even a word?
[00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:49.820]   Deer, not plural?
[00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:50.660]   Anyway.
[00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:54.380]   And yet it just runs away.
[00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:58.100]   And I think so often, God walks up to us,
[00:26:58.100 --> 00:26:59.660]   and we're in that cage of sin,
[00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:00.800]   and we're like, no, no, no.
[00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:02.800]   You're here to do something to me.
[00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:04.920]   You wanna take away my desire to date
[00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:07.480]   and my desire for marriage or my aspirations at work?
[00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:08.560]   I know what you're up to.
[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:09.600]   I know what you're doing.
[00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:11.360]   You're here to take away.
[00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:13.080]   And he's like, no, I'm here to free you.
[00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:15.920]   And he gets us free, and we're like, see ya.
[00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:18.640]   Joke's on you.
[00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:22.600]   And the best thing in the world is that we'd be like,
[00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:23.680]   dude, you saved me?
[00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:26.360]   I'll surrender everything to you.
[00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:28.560]   I'm not going anywhere.
[00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:30.280]   I will be right here.
[00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:33.000]   If you're so good to put yourself at risk,
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.760]   walk up to me, set me free,
[00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:36.980]   why would I ever run away from you?
[00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:37.920]   And yet we do.
[00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:40.280]   We don't trust.
[00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:43.640]   It says in Romans chapter eight
[00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:47.160]   that life in accordance with the Spirit,
[00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:48.920]   the mind in accordance with the Spirit,
[00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:50.780]   is life and peace.
[00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:52.640]   Isn't that what all of us want?
[00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:55.660]   Just life and peace.
[00:27:55.660 --> 00:27:59.140]   That the anxiety, the worry, the fear, the doubt,
[00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:03.680]   the condemnation, the shame of the sexual sin,
[00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:08.520]   the chasing after money and status
[00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:10.060]   like I did for all my life,
[00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:14.280]   the haunting shame from maybe a past abortion,
[00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:17.960]   the condemnation you may feel from a divorce,
[00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:24.020]   the shame and even though it wasn't your fault,
[00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:25.620]   and I'm speaking first person
[00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:28.100]   of the sexual abuse I experienced as a kid
[00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:29.180]   that maybe you did also,
[00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:30.980]   like, well, I'm not gonna tell anybody.
[00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:32.060]   I won't be loved.
[00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:37.780]   The control and anxiety that's just got you wrecked.
[00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:42.900]   And we want Jesus to free us, give us salvation,
[00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:44.460]   and then we just bolt.
[00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:46.460]   Like, I'll just do it on my own.
[00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:50.220]   And here tonight, you can be saved and surrender.
[00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:53.820]   We don't have to run away.
[00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:57.300]   He's come to save us and he's come to keep us safe.
[00:28:57.300 --> 00:29:00.140]   That deer probably got eaten by a coyote
[00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:01.980]   or shot by a hunter.
[00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:03.740]   If it would've stayed with me,
[00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:06.120]   everything would've been fine.
[00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:08.900]   And so that we would not only be saved,
[00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:13.900]   but we would be safe by staying with the one who frees us.
[00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:21.440]   It goes on in Psalm 40, verse eight.
[00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:22.900]   So I talked about how he saves us
[00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:24.620]   and here it is, his surrendering.
[00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:27.300]   He says, "I delight to do your will."
[00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:28.220]   Oh my God.
[00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:30.940]   That there's now this delight of like,
[00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:34.620]   man, it is exhausting trying to live my life my way,
[00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:36.480]   that I would somehow have all the wisdom,
[00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:39.420]   all the power, all the charm, all the luck, all the,
[00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:42.540]   it's like, no, that's exhausting.
[00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:44.020]   Now it's your will.
[00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:46.580]   It's your will by your power for your glory.
[00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:48.220]   And so there's that surrendering
[00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:50.420]   that just like floods in peace tonight
[00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:51.780]   that can be for you.
[00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:55.860]   Because you are the lamb of Psalm 40
[00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:58.020]   and Christ is the bog rider.
[00:29:58.020 --> 00:29:59.580]   And you were saved to be surrendered
[00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:02.160]   and you were surrendered to be a sacrifice,
[00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:04.340]   not that would lead unto death like David's,
[00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:06.180]   but that we would be a living sacrifice.
[00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:09.700]   So you go to Romans 12, verse one,
[00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:11.740]   walks through the entirety of the gospel
[00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:13.580]   and you get to chapter 12, verse one,
[00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:16.740]   and he says, "Therefore," Paul, writing by the Spirit,
[00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:20.100]   "Therefore, in view of God's mercy,"
[00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:23.060]   and the mercy is that Christ entered
[00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:25.520]   into the bog of sin and death,
[00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:29.380]   that he left heaven, took on flesh,
[00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:32.100]   lived a sinless life, was persecuted,
[00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:35.100]   and hit, and scorned, and shamed,
[00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:37.500]   and beard torn out, and spit upon,
[00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:42.060]   and struck, and crown of thorns, and nailed to a cross.
[00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:44.820]   And it says, as if that wasn't enough physically,
[00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:48.780]   in Colossians chapter two, it says that the legal decree
[00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:51.900]   that stood opposed to us, this God set aside,
[00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:54.700]   nailing it to the cross.
[00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:57.860]   That not only did he take all of that physical suffering,
[00:30:57.860 --> 00:31:00.980]   that every single sin that you have committed,
[00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:03.820]   if you were in Christ, was spiritually that way.
[00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:05.060]   You know when you commit sin
[00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:07.460]   and you feel that guilt and condemnation?
[00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:10.100]   All of that was laid upon Jesus.
[00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:12.340]   The legal decree in which Satan said,
[00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:14.140]   "They're guilty, God, you know it.
[00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:15.140]   "Here it is.
[00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:17.420]   "Here's all their sin.
[00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:18.820]   "They're guilty."
[00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:25.220]   God said, "You're right, and I'm nailing it to the cross."
[00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:29.540]   And all of that was laid upon Jesus.
[00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:32.340]   He died the death that we deserved,
[00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:37.340]   was laid in the tomb, and three days later, rose again.
[00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:38.180]   - Amen.
[00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:43.180]   - He went in to the bog of sin and death for you.
[00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:47.940]   Hear me when I say it's not just that it's true,
[00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:52.580]   it is for you tonight, tonight.
[00:31:52.580 --> 00:31:55.620]   And it's not just that you might be saved,
[00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:59.140]   but that you would also be surrendered
[00:31:59.140 --> 00:32:00.820]   and quit living a double life.
[00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:02.900]   Jesus said, "You can't serve two masters.
[00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:04.300]   "You know it experientially."
[00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:06.500]   Like, this is exhausting,
[00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:09.780]   trying to live the Dallas life and the Christ life.
[00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:13.140]   And I can't enjoy either one.
[00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:16.300]   'Cause I'm convicted when I'm here,
[00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:21.900]   and I feel like I'm maybe missing out when I'm here.
[00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:26.900]   And so, put to death the desires of the flesh by the Spirit.
[00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:28.460]   Live a surrendered life,
[00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:32.820]   and tonight, you can choose, you get it all.
[00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:34.820]   You saved me from all, you get it all.
[00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:37.380]   And not only to be surrendered,
[00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:39.080]   but that you would speak about it.
[00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:42.540]   That's the outline of Psalm 40.
[00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:45.820]   You've been saved, you surrender,
[00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:47.780]   and then you speak about it.
[00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:49.540]   And why would you speak about it?
[00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:53.300]   'Cause there's 3,000 people here,
[00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:55.220]   there's however many viewing in Fort Worth,
[00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:57.980]   Indianapolis, Tulsa, and all beyond.
[00:32:57.980 --> 00:33:00.940]   And so, great, you're here, you're hearing about it.
[00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:02.820]   Good news for you.
[00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:03.980]   Well, you're gonna go to work,
[00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:05.260]   you're gonna go to your internship,
[00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:06.380]   you're gonna go back to your roommates,
[00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:09.500]   you're gonna go back to your family on summer vacation,
[00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:12.500]   you're gonna be interacting with a waitress at a restaurant,
[00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:17.820]   and they have sin, you can be sure of it.
[00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:20.180]   But maybe they don't have a Savior.
[00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:22.820]   And so, you can tell 'em about the great bog rider.
[00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:25.700]   Just like my grandfather told about me,
[00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:27.140]   and I got to tell about him.
[00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:33.920]   Because Laura and I had been saved,
[00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:36.940]   we then lived to speak about him to others.
[00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:39.880]   And so, there we are, now on my knees again,
[00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:41.860]   but this time with my dying grandfather
[00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:44.440]   sitting in a easy chair.
[00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:46.980]   And he would never leave that easy chair
[00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:49.780]   until he went to his bed in which he would die in.
[00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:51.980]   And we're sitting there,
[00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:56.900]   and we're saying, hey, it's about to get dark.
[00:33:56.900 --> 00:33:58.460]   You're going to die.
[00:33:58.460 --> 00:34:00.360]   And when you do, you'll face judgment.
[00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:04.600]   And you will spend eternity in heaven or hell.
[00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:08.440]   Are you ready?
[00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:10.400]   Is there anything keeping you
[00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:12.000]   from placing your faith in Jesus?
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   And he resisted and resisted and resisted,
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:20.160]   and we persisted and persisted and persisted.
[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:26.080]   And I said, before you die, and you will,
[00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:32.760]   just say, Jesus, I'm a sinner, save me.
[00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:34.120]   That's all you have to say.
[00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:37.280]   You just cry out from the barn, that's it.
[00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:40.320]   Waited patiently for the Lord,
[00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:41.560]   he inclined and heard my cry,
[00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:44.120]   just say, Jesus, I'm a sinner, save me.
[00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:48.720]   And my grandfather looked at me,
[00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:52.160]   and he said, Jesus, I'm a sinner, save me.
[00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:55.440]   It's the first time he'd ever said
[00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:57.400]   anything close to Christianity.
[00:34:57.400 --> 00:35:02.240]   And I said, dawg, are you just saying that to me,
[00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:03.320]   or are you praying a prayer?
[00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:05.840]   'Cause I can have an atheist say those words.
[00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:11.360]   And he said, Jesus, I'm a sinner, save me.
[00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:14.520]   And I said, would you like for me
[00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:16.600]   to lead you in a prayer right now,
[00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:21.080]   to receive the free gift of salvation in Jesus Christ,
[00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:22.800]   to receive the forgiveness of sins,
[00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:25.680]   to receive the Holy Spirit, to be born again,
[00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:27.840]   and to go to heaven when you die.
[00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:31.480]   And he reached out these decaying, feeble,
[00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:36.440]   cancer-filled body hands, and said, I'm ready.
[00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:41.680]   And I just pray, and we've been praying all day,
[00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:47.160]   that you're ready, that you're ready tonight.
[00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:50.800]   Don't delay.
[00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:55.400]   There's a whole world of temptation
[00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:57.000]   and deception out there waiting.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:00.680]   So some need to trust in Jesus tonight
[00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:01.880]   for the forgiveness of sins,
[00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:06.800]   and others need to be like, I'm done serving two masters.
[00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:08.680]   Tonight's your night.
[00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:12.160]   I surrender all to be saved and surrender,
[00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:14.680]   and then to speak out for others.
[00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:19.280]   He trusted in Jesus, and in the midst of that,
[00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:21.480]   my wife was going through breast cancer.
[00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:23.120]   She's okay now, but in the midst of it,
[00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:24.800]   we didn't know what was gonna happen.
[00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:26.640]   And in the midst of that breast cancer journey,
[00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:29.360]   this is two years ago, I'm just like,
[00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:31.120]   okay, God, could you speak to me?
[00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:33.360]   Like, I see, you know, people are bringing meals.
[00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:34.400]   That's nice.
[00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:36.960]   I need a little more than food right now.
[00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:39.880]   I could use a word from you, and I'm reading your word,
[00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:41.000]   I'm searching the scriptures,
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   and if you could just say something,
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:46.080]   like the silence is painful.
[00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:47.960]   And you said, the Holy Spirit's the comforter
[00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:50.280]   and the counselor, and I'm not hearing anything,
[00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:52.560]   and this would be a really good time to speak,
[00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:54.800]   'cause my wife has breast cancer,
[00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:55.920]   and I got three little kids,
[00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:57.040]   and I don't wanna be single dad,
[00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:58.680]   and could you just say something?
[00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:01.400]   And there was silence.
[00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:04.720]   And I shared the story about the bog rider in church,
[00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:06.880]   and then I got this text of a picture.
[00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:12.040]   And I was like, the second I looked at it,
[00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:17.200]   I heard, not audibly, but in my mind,
[00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:20.520]   God say, I'm carrying Laura.
[00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:24.280]   I'm carrying Laura.
[00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:29.720]   And I have, in a sense, that picture here for you tonight,
[00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:33.200]   because what you may not have known or realized,
[00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:36.200]   and likely don't, is that this whole time tonight,
[00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:39.800]   someone's been at work.
[00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:41.640]   They've been at work very intentionally,
[00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:44.440]   very purposefully, making something,
[00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:48.400]   creating something to portray the gospel.
[00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:55.200]   Just like tonight, in your hearing,
[00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:58.480]   all your life, from birth until this point tonight,
[00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:02.680]   on June 13th, God has been at work.
[00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:05.120]   He has been at work in all the design,
[00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:08.200]   in all the detail, in all the redemption,
[00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:10.800]   in all the pain, in all the difficulty.
[00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:15.600]   He has been working unto tonight
[00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:17.160]   that you would be saved or surrendered.
[00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:19.080]   And so I want to now show you,
[00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:26.960]   and introduce to you, a friend, a brother in Christ.
[00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:29.080]   And what's been happening this entire time,
[00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:31.200]   as we've been talking about the Bog Rider,
[00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:39.840]   is there's been this sketch.
[00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:44.520]   And this sketch, by our friend
[00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:46.880]   and brother in Christ right here, John Fleming,
[00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:49.360]   that was the gift someone gave to me.
[00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:51.160]   You're gonna see it on the screen, the completion.
[00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:52.160]   This is a print.
[00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:55.080]   And I'm gonna let him tell you what the name of it is
[00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:56.440]   and why he created it.
[00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:59.640]   John doesn't want me to say this,
[00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:03.040]   but I want you to know that he's a world-renowned artist,
[00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:05.120]   and he's a brother in Christ.
[00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:07.800]   And this work has great spiritual meaning.
[00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:09.880]   When I saw this picture on my phone,
[00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:13.040]   I was like, I heard God say, "I'm carrying Laura."
[00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:15.600]   And then somebody gave me this.
[00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:16.840]   If you come into my office ever,
[00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:20.440]   you're gonna see that print in that frame on my wall,
[00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:21.720]   because I want everyone to know
[00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:24.080]   about Christ the great Bog Rider,
[00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:25.960]   and that he saved us and he'll keep us safe.
[00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:28.400]   And so I asked John, I said, "Will you come?
[00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:31.280]   "And would you do this?"
[00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:34.640]   And he's like, "Man, I don't want it to be about me."
[00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:37.080]   And I was like, "It won't be, it's about Jesus.
[00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:39.720]   "That's why you painted it in the first place."
[00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:42.800]   And so I want John to now share what he shared with me.
[00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:44.880]   - Thanks, John.
[00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:49.560]   So John and I have been having some conversations
[00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:52.160]   over the last several weeks,
[00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:53.960]   but we had a conversation yesterday
[00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:58.960]   and he just asked me to share with him
[00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:01.520]   what this piece means.
[00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:03.520]   And I just said, "Hey, John."
[00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:07.440]   I said, "Savior is based on a photo I saw
[00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:12.000]   "of a cowboy or Bog Rider carrying a calf.
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:17.280]   "The added symbolism tells the story of trouble all around.
[00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:24.440]   "You've got obvious signs,
[00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:29.280]   "cactus, rough terrain, storms.
[00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:39.120]   "The added symbolism tells the story of trouble all around.
[00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:44.120]   "Some that we even tangle with and get caught up in.
[00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:48.320]   "But the Father is there to save, forgive,
[00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:51.360]   "and reconcile us to him.
[00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:57.840]   "It is never too late to come to him and be forgiven,
[00:40:57.840 --> 00:41:02.400]   "restored, renewed, whether you're a believer
[00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:06.400]   "who has strayed," and there's another picture
[00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:11.400]   of a cow or a calf running away from the cowboy,
[00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:17.960]   "whether you're a believer who has strayed
[00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:22.160]   "or rebelled or an unbeliever coming to Jesus
[00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:23.360]   "for the first time."
[00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:28.560]   And then in Psalm 40, verses 12 and 13,
[00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:32.880]   I just shared this, or I added this to my text to John.
[00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:36.720]   I just said, because this really spoke to me.
[00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:40.560]   I said, "For troubles without numbers surround me.
[00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:44.880]   "My sins have overtaken me and I cannot see.
[00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:47.640]   "They are more than the hairs of my head
[00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:51.080]   "and my heart fails within me.
[00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:53.800]   "Be pleased to save me, Lord.
[00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:56.680]   "Come quickly, Lord, to help me."
[00:41:56.680 --> 00:41:58.960]   And the reason those verses spoke to me
[00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:03.960]   and just 100% transparency here is because
[00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:08.400]   I came to Jesus as a boy of eight years old,
[00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:15.000]   but this season of life, I've really been struggling
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:18.560]   with pride and selfishness,
[00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:22.400]   and that's just real transparent.
[00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:27.400]   And so I just want you guys to know that,
[00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:34.280]   as John has already shared, that surrender is key,
[00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:38.360]   and I think that that's something,
[00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:42.000]   as a believer for many years,
[00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:47.320]   I have been that stray and I have wandered,
[00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:51.720]   and God is reconciling me to him,
[00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:56.000]   and it's a painful process, but it's, like I mentioned,
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:56.880]   it's never too late.
[00:42:56.880 --> 00:43:00.120]   So John, thanks for letting me be here.
[00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:00.960]   - Thank you, John.
[00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:01.800]   Glory to brother.
[00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:04.960]   (audience applauding)
[00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:16.140]   - So it says in Psalm 40,
[00:43:16.140 --> 00:43:20.680]   we can be saved to surrender and then to speak.
[00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:23.080]   I wanna read to you now the ones about speaking.
[00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:28.880]   David says, "Having been saved by Christ,
[00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:31.200]   "I will proclaim and tell them,
[00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:34.360]   "yet there are more that can be told."
[00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:37.640]   That's of God's wondrous deeds and thoughts towards us.
[00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:40.060]   "I will proclaim and tell of them,
[00:43:40.060 --> 00:43:42.520]   "yet there are more than can be told."
[00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:43.480]   And then in verse nine, he says,
[00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:47.140]   "I have told the glad news of deliverance
[00:43:47.140 --> 00:43:49.080]   "in the great congregation.
[00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:52.580]   "Behold, I have not restrained my lips,
[00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:53.900]   "as you know, O Lord.
[00:43:53.900 --> 00:43:56.300]   "I have not hidden your deliverance within my heart.
[00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:59.720]   "I have spoken of your faithfulness and your salvation.
[00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:02.340]   "I have not concealed your steadfast love
[00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:05.760]   "and your faithfulness from the great congregation."
[00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:07.640]   And then the title of the Psalm,
[00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:08.980]   you find in the very last line,
[00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:11.600]   "As for me, I am poor and needy."
[00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:13.860]   It's like he never forgot.
[00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:17.400]   Man, I surrendered once and for all, and I surrender daily.
[00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:18.480]   I need the gospel daily.
[00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:20.920]   "As for me, I am poor and needy,
[00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:22.760]   "but the Lord takes thought of me.
[00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:27.300]   "You are my help and my deliverer.
[00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:29.440]   "Do not delay, O my God."
[00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:36.680]   And I would say, "Do not delay tonight."
[00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:39.480]   The band's gonna come back up,
[00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:42.640]   and we're gonna sing a song in response
[00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:45.940]   to the great Bog Rider, Jesus Christ, our Lord.
[00:44:45.940 --> 00:44:48.800]   And I wanna invite some of you,
[00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:50.800]   and I don't care if you're in the last row of the balcony,
[00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:53.000]   it'll only take a few seconds,
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:54.940]   but there's gonna be a team up front here,
[00:44:54.940 --> 00:44:58.140]   and they can come forward now to receive you,
[00:44:58.140 --> 00:45:01.160]   that you might receive Christ.
[00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:04.600]   So tonight, if you wanna come forward and be like,
[00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:07.880]   I wanna place my faith in Jesus,
[00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:10.640]   and I wanna be forgiven of my sins,
[00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:13.800]   and come forward tonight as this song plays.
[00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:15.160]   And if you're like, I need to surrender,
[00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:17.320]   I've been saved, but I've been living the double life.
[00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:19.120]   I've been living with two masters,
[00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:22.520]   and now I want to surrender tonight, June 13th.
[00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:26.840]   I wanna surrender all, Him not just be Savior, but be Lord.
[00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:28.760]   And I don't wanna just be free,
[00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:32.880]   I wanna stay by my Savior, and come forward too.
[00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:35.760]   As they bring down the lights and the band goes on,
[00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:40.760]   this place is open, and this time is yours, do not delay.
[00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:43.560]   Let's stand now and sing to Jesus.
[00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:53.560]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
