 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:28,040
 Forge, what's up?

5
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,320
 How we doing?

6
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,240
 [APPLAUSE]

7
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,120
 Man, so good to see you.

8
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:34,960
 How are you tonight?

9
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:35,460
 Good?

10
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,280
 Doing OK?

11
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,200
 Hey, special shout out to some of our friends

12
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,280
 tuning in from across the nation.

13
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,280
 Porch Live Midland.

14
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,640
 Yeah, Porch Live Dayton and Porch Live Des Moines.

15
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,140
 Really glad you guys are joining us.

16
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:49,760
 Thanks so much for tuning in and being

17
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,100
 a part of what God is doing, not only here in our city,

18
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,280
 but in your city too.

19
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,000
 God can genuinely meet with anyone, anywhere,

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,160
 and at any time.

21
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,860
 And so we're really glad that you would

22
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,800
 trust us with your Tuesday.

23
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,440
 Well, just a few years ago, Brooke and I

24
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,120
 were traveling to Colorado for a wedding in a remote city

25
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,720
 called Lake City.

26
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,360
 We'd never been there before, but we

27
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,000
 knew by the time we landed in Denver,

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,680
 it was approximately a four-hour drive from the airport

29
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,760
 to the destination.

30
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,640
 And so we land in Denver.

31
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,520
 We make our way over to the rental car agency.

32
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,320
 We get into our rental car.

33
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,160
 And right as I'm pulling out of the parking lot,

34
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:31,560
 I stop the car, and I look over to my wife,

35
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,640
 and I say, hey, we should just pray.

36
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,640
 You know, we got four hours in the car together.

37
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,360
 We should pray that over the course of the next four hours,

38
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,280
 God would meet with us.

39
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,560
 And so I prayed this specifically.

40
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,160
 I said, God, as we drive today, would you make yourself

41
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,440
 known to us along the way?

42
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,920
 And then I proceeded to hit the gas,

43
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,960
 pull out of the parking lot, and we

44
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,560
 traversed our way to our destination in Lake City.

45
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,240
 One hour passed by.

46
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,760
 Two hours passed by.

47
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,320
 Three hours passed by.

48
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,280
 And then four hours passed by.

49
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,160
 And as I looked around, I could tell, man,

50
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,320
 it doesn't really feel like we're

51
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,240
 getting close to Lake City.

52
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,000
 I've never been there before.

53
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,360
 I don't know what it looks like.

54
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,600
 But it doesn't seem like we're actually

55
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,000
 getting as close as we should be by this point.

56
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,480
 Brooke, where are we at right now?

57
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,400
 And she proceeds to look at the GPS,

58
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,880
 and she realizes that we are up.

59
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:25,280
 We're still three hours away from our destination, which

60
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,880
 was horrifying to learn in the moment,

61
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,560
 because by the time we had learned this news,

62
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,760
 we could have already been there.

63
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,720
 We could have already shown up and said hello

64
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,800
 to the bridal party and gotten into our room

65
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,800
 and checked in nice and cozy.

66
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,800
 But instead, we still had three hours in the car.

67
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,080
 I love my wife.

68
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,740
 But that's seven hours of total driving,

69
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,160
 and that's a long time behind the wheel.

70
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,200
 You know what I'm saying?

71
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,440
 So we look around, and I'm traumatized by the fact

72
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,360
 that we still have this long to go.

73
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,440
 And so I start to wonder to myself, what happened?

74
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,880
 And then I realize it was Apple Maps.

75
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,200
 It led us astray.

76
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,840
 It took us down the longest foreseeable route possible

77
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,480
 from Denver to our destination.

78
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,600
 We had made a grievous mistake.

79
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,160
 We did not choose the quickest route.

80
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:14,320
 Instead, we chose a long route unbeknownst to us.

81
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,880
 And so in this moment, I'm frustrated,

82
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,280
 frustrated with the situation, frustrated with my wife.

83
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,960
 I'm frustrated with the fact that Colorado

84
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,040
 even has a route that's this long to get to this city

85
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,480
 when it's not necessary.

86
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:28,440
 I am so frustrated that our GPS has taken us down a road,

87
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,340
 the likes of which we never had to go.

88
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:36,040
 And yet, it was a road the likes of which God

89
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:40,040
 very clearly wanted us to drive down.

90
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:43,880
 Because as we made our way to Lake City,

91
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,640
 down the scenic route, what we found is

92
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:52,560
 we were trapped in a field of wildflowers in bloom,

93
00:03:52,560 --> 00:04:02,520
 crystal lakes cascading through thousands of acres

94
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,320
 all at sunset.

95
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:09,800
 Because this route that we did not choose for ourself,

96
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,320
 but God chose for us, actually took us

97
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,920
 into the Rio Grande National Forest.

98
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:19,460
 And it was there that God decided to answer my prayer.

99
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:24,220
 He was making himself known to us along the way.

100
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,800
 Now, why do I tell you that?

101
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,000
 Because over the course of the last several weeks,

102
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,480
 we here at The Porch have been working through a series

103
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,760
 called Essential that has felt a lot like this journey

104
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,200
 of mine in Colorado.

105
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,220
 We've been talking about the one thing

106
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,040
 that brings everything into focus.

107
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,960
 That's been our destination to talk about the one thing.

108
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:45,760
 And yet, it has taken us now five total weeks of time

109
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,040
 to unpack one thing,

110
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,400
 which feels a little bit like a bait and switch.

111
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,320
 You're like, wait, I showed up for one thing

112
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,600
 and I've gotten over a month's worth of teaching.

113
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,560
 Like, what is with this?

114
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,200
 This shouldn't be so difficult.

115
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,720
 Like, this is the most important thing

116
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,960
 and yet it's taking so long for you to explain to us.

117
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,760
 I feel like I've shown up week after week after week

118
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,120
 and I feel like I'm learning the same thing

119
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:02,960
 over and over and over.

120
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,640
 Why is it taking so long?

121
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:10,800
 And the reason is because that which is most important,

122
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,800
 according to the scriptures,

123
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,880
 the one thing that God wants you to know,

124
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,560
 which is that we should aspire

125
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,600
 to see as much of him as possible.

126
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,520
 We don't arrive at that quickly,

127
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:27,520
 but instead, that's a process that takes a long time

128
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,740
 and often leads us down a road much further

129
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:35,180
 than we initially intended or expected.

130
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:37,640
 This is why we've been journeying through the series.

131
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,540
 We have been looking at these one thing statements.

132
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:43,280
 One thing I ask, one thing I lack, one thing I do,

133
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,620
 one thing I need, one thing I know,

134
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,960
 because those statements reinforce the importance

135
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,600
 of seeing God for who he is.

136
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,400
 That's the most important thing in the Bible,

137
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:55,440
 to get your eyes on him, to set your gaze on him,

138
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,160
 to see him and as much of him as possible,

139
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,080
 which takes time.

140
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,520
 And tonight, we're arriving at the end of our destination

141
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,420
 because tonight we find ourselves

142
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,720
 on the fifth one thing statement,

143
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,240
 which is in John chapter nine.

144
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,440
 So if you have a Bible, you can grab your Bible,

145
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,160
 you can turn with me to John chapter nine.

146
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,600
 While you're doing that, what you need to know is this,

147
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,120
 as we turn to this story,

148
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,760
 we're gonna catch up to Jesus in Jerusalem.

149
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,520
 It's in chapter seven that he travels to Jerusalem

150
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,280
 for the Feast of Tabernacles.

151
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,160
 What you need to know about the Feast of Tabernacles

152
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,800
 is it was one of three annual feasts,

153
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,640
 the people of Jerusalem, the people of Israel,

154
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,200
 they would celebrate every single year

155
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,640
 that was a pilgrimage feast.

156
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,900
 So that meant that they would celebrate this feast

157
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,680
 by way of traveling back to the holy city,

158
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,320
 that native Jews spread all over the globe.

159
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,480
 They would return to Jerusalem in this moment,

160
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,620
 which meant that the city

161
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,520
 was busting at the seams of people.

162
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,920
 Like there are thousands upon thousands

163
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,000
 upon thousands of people, travelers,

164
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,800
 that are native Jews that have returned to the city

165
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,720
 for the Feast of Tabernacles.

166
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,240
 And this feast, it's like a giant party.

167
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,760
 Like everyone has high spirits

168
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:08,480
 because they've shown back up to celebrate God's provision

169
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,880
 of the nation of Israel over the course

170
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,600
 of the last several centuries.

171
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,600
 That's what's happening in this story.

172
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,440
 We catch up to Jesus in a moment

173
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,720
 where he's surrounded by thousands.

174
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,840
 People are setting up booths,

175
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,520
 they're in temporary shelters,

176
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,080
 the streets are littered with folks.

177
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,360
 And in the scene, we see in verse one,

178
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:33,200
 that as he passed by, he saw a man blind from birth.

179
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,640
 And his disciples asked him,

180
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:38,580
 "Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents?"

181
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,320
 That he was born blind.

182
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,640
 And Jesus answered,

183
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:45,840
 "It was not that this man sinned or his parents,

184
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,700
 but that the works of God might be displayed in him.

185
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,440
 We must work the works of him who sent me while it's day.

186
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,480
 Night is coming when no one can work.

187
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,200
 As long as I'm in the world, I'm the light of the world."

188
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,840
 So just briefly,

189
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,120
 we're gonna work all the way through this passage,

190
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,160
 but I do wanna just stop here for a minute

191
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,800
 because we need to see what's happening.

192
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,580
 The disciples, they see this man,

193
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:08,560
 this man born blind, sitting on the side of the road

194
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,340
 and they ask Jesus an odd line of questioning.

195
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:15,820
 Like, "Hey, this guy is pretty messed up.

196
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,460
 He's in a weird situation.

197
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:18,440
 Whose fault is it?

198
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,400
 Is it his fault that he sinned against his parents

199
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,020
 or is it his parents' fault?"

200
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,380
 Which feels strange to us.

201
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,200
 And yet, what we just need to know

202
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,060
 is it actually accords with Jewish tradition.

203
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,580
 You see, according to Jewish tradition,

204
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,940
 what we know is that at the time of conception,

205
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:36,060
 it was believed that a fetus could choose

206
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:37,620
 between two different inclinations.

207
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:40,020
 One good and one evil.

208
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,980
 If it chose an evil inclination, then it would do things.

209
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:43,940
 It would kick in the womb

210
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,140
 and it would make the pregnancy really hard

211
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,260
 and there'd be lots of morning sickness.

212
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,460
 And the belief would be that that fetus

213
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,480
 has chosen an evil inclination

214
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,980
 and thus it stands likely to suffer some sort of defect

215
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,780
 as it comes into the world.

216
00:08:58,780 --> 00:08:59,740
 This was one belief.

217
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:02,380
 The alternative is that God was revisiting

218
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:05,300
 the errors or mistakes of the parents upon that child.

219
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,380
 That, "Hey, you guys, y'all messed up in the past."

220
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,220
 And so what I'm gonna do

221
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,100
 is I'm gonna get my paddle flushed from the little guy.

222
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,980
 That was kind of God's perspective

223
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,220
 according to Jewish tradition.

224
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:16,140
 And yet, Jesus, he knows that this is what they're thinking

225
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,300
 and he's like, "No, no, no, no, no.

226
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,900
 That's not what happened here."

227
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:24,900
 He says, "No, it's not the man, nor is it the parents' fault.

228
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,500
 They're not the cause of his condition.

229
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,820
 His flaws, they don't exist to perpetuate his shame.

230
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:35,200
 His flaws exist to promote God's glory."

231
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,340
 That's what he says.

232
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,940
 That his pain, it's not pointless.

233
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,180
 It's purposeful.

234
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,620
 God wants to use him to make himself known,

235
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,820
 which I think is important for us to just take time

236
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:46,860
 and unpack really quickly here

237
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,060
 because some of you have walked in here tonight

238
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:51,380
 and you have some imperfections, some blemishes,

239
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:53,560
 some deficiencies that you think,

240
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,060
 "Man, God, you just don't love me.

241
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,980
 Like this has happened to me,

242
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:00,420
 I guess because of something I did in the past."

243
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:03,180
 And yet what you need to know by way of this quick text

244
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,740
 is that your imperfections,

245
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:09,720
 that thing which you feel is so messed up in your life,

246
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,820
 it's not the result of some divine displeasure

247
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:18,780
 God has with you, that that's not the case.

248
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:21,020
 No, instead what this text is telling us

249
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,860
 is that there's no karma in the Christian life.

250
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:26,300
 Like there's no, what you give is what you get.

251
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,460
 You reap what you sow.

252
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,460
 What goes around comes around.

253
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:31,700
 Like that's not a philosophy in the Christian worldview.

254
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,140
 No, the Christian worldview is not

255
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,700
 that we get what we deserve,

256
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,860
 it's that we get what we do not deserve.

257
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:39,900
 We get what Christ deserves.

258
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,580
 What does Christ deserve?

259
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,020
 The love of God.

260
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:47,020
 A love that's not transactional, that's not quid pro quo.

261
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,140
 Hey, you give me a little bit of that,

262
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:49,060
 I'll give you a little bit of this.

263
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,940
 That's not the kind of love that God has for his people.

264
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,540
 It's not the kind of love that he has for his son.

265
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:56,980
 He has an unconditional love, which is ours in Christ.

266
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:59,220
 We get grace, unmerited favor.

267
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,820
 And Jesus is using this man's story tonight

268
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:05,420
 to help us realize that his blemishes,

269
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:08,900
 they're but a canvas upon which God is going to paint

270
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,460
 a beautiful portrait for us to see,

271
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:15,760
 which is why he does what he does next.

272
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,260
 Verse six, "Having said these things,

273
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:22,260
 Jesus spit on the ground and he made mud with the saliva.

274
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,820
 Then he anointed the man's eyes with the mud

275
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,720
 and he said to him, 'Go, wash in the pool of Siloam,'"

276
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,620
 which means sent.

277
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:30,680
 So he went, he washed, and he came back to sin.

278
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,980
 Now, Jesus's treatment of this man

279
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,460
 is very different than the disciples'

280
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:37,420
 and it's very different than anyone's treatment

281
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,420
 of this man, right?

282
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,880
 None of us would treat this man this way

283
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,220
 because it's not common to just smear mud

284
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,100
 into people's faces.

285
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,220
 This is something that's very unique to Jesus

286
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,620
 and yet it's very purposeful to Jesus.

287
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:50,480
 You see, the disciples, they engage this man's condition

288
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,460
 as fodder for theological discussion.

289
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:56,380
 Man, that guy looks like he did something wrong,

290
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,320
 so what do you think caused it?

291
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,000
 That's not what Jesus does.

292
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,060
 He doesn't see his condition as just fodder

293
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:05,500
 or fuel for theological discussion.

294
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:10,260
 He sees it as an opportunity for new revelation.

295
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:14,580
 He sees it as a chance to present both to this man

296
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,380
 and to the rest of the crowd,

297
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:21,340
 the watching world in that moment, who God is.

298
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,380
 What we said at the beginning,

299
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,020
 the most important thing is to see

300
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,140
 as much of God as possible.

301
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,220
 Jesus is looking at this man,

302
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,620
 he's saying, "This is perfect.

303
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:32,220
 "I can help them see God through this guy's example."

304
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:37,020
 And so Jesus takes us to our first point.

305
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:39,740
 He proves to us through this man

306
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:42,260
 that he will meet us where we are

307
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:45,700
 so we can see him as he is.

308
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:49,420
 Jesus meets us where we are so we can see him as he is.

309
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,060
 That's why he spits on the ground,

310
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:54,340
 he makes some mud, and he smears it on the guy's eyes.

311
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,100
 Like this isn't a long lost treatment

312
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,540
 for blindness, this is something that Jesus

313
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:02,820
 is very uniquely and specifically doing for this guy.

314
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,980
 There's an important detail in this story.

315
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:07,900
 This man was born blind, okay?

316
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:10,340
 The author, John, really wants us to get it.

317
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:12,180
 He wants us to know, "Hey, this guy was born blind."

318
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,100
 It says that he was blind 13 times

319
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,740
 over the course of this entire chapter,

320
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:18,860
 and it details that he was blind from birth

321
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:21,260
 over five times in this chapter

322
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,940
 because he needs us to know.

323
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:25,860
 Jesus isn't just curing a very general kind of blindness,

324
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:29,740
 he's curing a very specific kind of blindness.

325
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:35,060
 It was a blindness that was from birth,

326
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:39,400
 meaning that this man's issue is that he was created wrong.

327
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:43,980
 Like his problem isn't that he lost vision,

328
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:46,300
 it's that he never had vision.

329
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:51,140
 The issue is that he was created blind.

330
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:54,760
 So catch this, what does Jesus do?

331
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,880
 He stoops down and he meets the man where he is.

332
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,640
 He takes from the dust of the ground.

333
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:08,760
 He forms new life upon which he smears to this man's eyes,

334
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:12,320
 and instead of just giving restoration to his sight,

335
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,160
 he brings a recreation to his sight.

336
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:20,160
 Jesus becomes the God of creation, do you see it?

337
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,800
 Like that's what he's doing in this moment.

338
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,400
 And what's amazing about this is as Jesus goes along,

339
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,760
 he doesn't just meet this guy where he is,

340
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,240
 he meets this guy where everyone is

341
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,640
 because he performs a miracle,

342
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:34,960
 the likes of which would have put everybody on notice

343
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:39,880
 because he performs what we know as a messianic miracle.

344
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,360
 The Old Testament talks about three specific miracles

345
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:45,400
 that only the Messiah would have been able to perform.

346
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,580
 Those three miracles, number one is cleansing a leper,

347
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,120
 because to cleanse a leper,

348
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,320
 you would have made yourself unclean,

349
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,420
 which the Messiah couldn't be.

350
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:55,280
 The Messiah had to be clean.

351
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:58,840
 Number two was casting out a mute demon.

352
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,920
 You see, the proper Jewish methodology for exorcism

353
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,720
 required that you cast a demon out by its name.

354
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,720
 That's how you had authority over it.

355
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:10,240
 And yet if the demon was mute, if it couldn't speak,

356
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,560
 then you couldn't know its name

357
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,240
 and you had no authority to cast it out.

358
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,080
 Yet the Messiah would be able to do that anyways.

359
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,760
 And then the third messianic miracle

360
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:21,080
 is that you would be able to heal a man born blind,

361
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,920
 because this isn't just an act of restoration,

362
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,980
 it's an act of recreation.

363
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:27,300
 It's restoring something, recreating something

364
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:30,220
 that was never there to begin with.

365
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,860
 You see, by the time we reach this story,

366
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:35,900
 and Jesus has already performed two of those miracles.

367
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,380
 He's done the first two.

368
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:40,100
 And as he comes to this moment with this man,

369
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:44,160
 he performs the third, which puts everybody on red alert.

370
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,480
 Like it freaks everybody, the ever-loving out.

371
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,940
 They see that he doesn't just heal this blind man.

372
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:52,080
 Blind people were getting healed by Pharisees, right?

373
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,940
 Like this was something that rabbis could do

374
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:56,660
 at some level of infrequency.

375
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,980
 No, Jesus does something that has never been done

376
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,340
 in the history of humanity.

377
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:06,020
 And in so doing, he proves I'm the Messiah.

378
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:09,360
 It's kind of like the process you go

379
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,900
 to get verified on Instagram, right?

380
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,060
 That's what Jesus is doing.

381
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:14,500
 He's trying to earn, not pay for,

382
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,540
 earn that little blue check mark.

383
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,940
 He wants everyone to know I'm the real deal.

384
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,660
 Like I'm the genuine article.

385
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:21,620
 And so what does he do?

386
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,660
 He does exactly what you would do on Instagram.

387
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,420
 Like he presents that he's authentic.

388
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:28,020
 He represents, like what does it mean?

389
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,980
 You have to represent a real and genuine person.

390
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,500
 Jesus is that.

391
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,380
 Like we can historically verify the fact

392
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:36,300
 that Jesus is authentically real.

393
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,140
 There has to be a level of uniqueness

394
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:39,720
 to the person's account.

395
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,580
 You have to represent the unique presence of that person.

396
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,560
 One account is allowed per person,

397
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,060
 just meaning you've actually gotta be you.

398
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:48,740
 Jesus is not trying to be anybody that he's not.

399
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,460
 He's very content in his identity.

400
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,860
 Very secure individual.

401
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:55,500
 So he's uniquely himself and no one else.

402
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,360
 He also, he presents a complete account.

403
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:02,580
 Like he demonstrates to everyone that yes, he is public.

404
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:03,420
 He does have a bio.

405
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:04,860
 Hello, I'm the son of God.

406
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:05,980
 He has a profile photo.

407
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:08,460
 You can catch me on the Galilean seaside.

408
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,300
 And I'm active.

409
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,140
 I'm out here, I'm doing things.

410
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:12,560
 I'm teaching, I'm performing miracles.

411
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,980
 Jesus is very completely himself.

412
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:17,080
 And then lastly, he's notable.

413
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,620
 Like he is noteworthy.

414
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:21,420
 People want to know him.

415
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,580
 He is a well-known figure.

416
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:25,620
 He has a brand and a persona,

417
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:27,960
 the likes of which sends people flocking.

418
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,940
 You know, like they want to get

419
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,260
 as close to this guy as they can.

420
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:33,640
 They are fascinated by the authority with which he teaches.

421
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,300
 Jesus is verifying for everyone,

422
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:39,700
 hey, I am the Messiah and to leave no room for doubt,

423
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:42,020
 I'm going to perform these miracles

424
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:46,340
 so that way you know I am he and no one else is.

425
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:50,980
 Because this is a title, again, you don't buy, but you earn.

426
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:54,380
 It's something that has to be proven.

427
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:57,420
 And Jesus is doing that in this moment.

428
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:02,420
 He's showing that I'm the literal king.

429
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:05,840
 Like I'm the anointed one.

430
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:10,220
 I'm the deliverer, savior of God's chosen people, Israel.

431
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,060
 That's who I am.

432
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,520
 That's what he's proving to everybody

433
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:15,060
 by way of this moment.

434
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,560
 He's the one that people have been waiting for.

435
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,920
 That stories have been told about.

436
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,620
 That prayers have been lifted to, that hope hinges upon.

437
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:25,620
 That's who Jesus Christ is.

438
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,860
 And in so doing this miracle,

439
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:30,620
 yes, he's meeting this man where he's at,

440
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:34,740
 but he's meeting everyone where they're at too.

441
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:37,060
 Catch this, this is amazing.

442
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:40,020
 Jesus, he meets this blind man where he is.

443
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,660
 What's this man need?

444
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,300
 He needs recreation.

445
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,180
 He can't see.

446
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:46,580
 He's never been able to see.

447
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,280
 So what does Jesus do?

448
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:51,400
 He stoops to his level and he performs the miracle

449
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:56,260
 in a way that demonstrates he is the creator God.

450
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,400
 What about the crowds?

451
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,400
 What do they need?

452
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,480
 He meets them where they are.

453
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,560
 He performs a miracle,

454
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,480
 the likes of which they all had been anticipating.

455
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,440
 They had all been waiting for.

456
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,480
 He performs a miracle that demonstrates

457
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,280
 he is not just a teacher, a prophet, a nice guy,

458
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,600
 a moral example to follow, a revolutionary leader.

459
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,400
 No, he is the Messiah.

460
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,180
 And not only that, the Pharisees in the story.

461
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,340
 What does Jesus do?

462
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:24,840
 He performs a miracle on Sabbath.

463
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:28,380
 And not just any Sabbath, a high Sabbath, a festival Sabbath,

464
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,540
 a really important day.

465
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:32,500
 He performs it on a day that was intended for rest

466
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,860
 and that sends the Pharisees up in arms

467
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,260
 because he wants to prove to them,

468
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,780
 I am the Lord of the Sabbath.

469
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:40,620
 Do you see it?

470
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:46,740
 In this one moment, he meets everyone right where they are

471
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:53,240
 so they can see him exactly as he is,

472
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:57,960
 which is why God brought some of you here tonight.

473
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,840
 Like you've not walked into this room

474
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,800
 and fooled God into seeing you

475
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,600
 as something other than you're not.

476
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,360
 Like you've not come in here and cleaned yourself up enough

477
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,280
 that God's like, yeah, man, you're looking good.

478
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,120
 You know, like, no, you walked in here tonight

479
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:16,120
 and he knows you exactly as you are in your inmost self.

480
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,260
 Not like this guy, not blind and begging,

481
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,460
 but burdened all the same.

482
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:24,240
 And what he wants to do for you

483
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,320
 is exactly what he does for this man.

484
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,440
 He wants to meet you where you are

485
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:37,180
 that you might see him as he is.

486
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:42,320
 So for some of you, he knows you are overwhelmed

487
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,440
 by the approval of others.

488
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,120
 Like you just want people to like you.

489
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:45,960
 Like you'll do anything.

490
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,200
 I'll compromise my character.

491
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,160
 Like what do I gotta do?

492
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,000
 What do I gotta sell?

493
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:49,840
 Where do I gotta be?

494
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:50,660
 What do I need to say?

495
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:51,500
 You'll do anything

496
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,120
 'cause you just want people to approve of you.

497
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,840
 And Jesus is like, calm down.

498
00:20:54,840 --> 00:21:00,460
 I'm a friend that's as close as a brother.

499
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:03,800
 That's what Galatians 3:29 tells us.

500
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,780
 Some of you, you are trapped in addiction.

501
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:09,220
 You are enslaved to your sin.

502
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:11,820
 You have cravings, hungers, appetites, desires,

503
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:14,380
 the likes of which you have prayed would go away,

504
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:16,740
 and yet they are still there waiting for you

505
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,380
 early in the morning and late into the evening.

506
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,940
 You are trapped in an addiction.

507
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:24,940
 And Jesus is saying, hey, I'm a wonderful counselor.

508
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:27,020
 I can help you through that.

509
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,820
 Colossians, or Isaiah 9, 6.

510
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:31,500
 Some of you, you're desperate for things to get better.

511
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:35,620
 In your job, in your relationship with your family,

512
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,940
 amongst your parents, in your friendships, whatever it is,

513
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,500
 you're just desperate for things to get better.

514
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,500
 God, it seems like nothing will ever actually improve.

515
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,620
 And yet he's looking and he's saying,

516
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,460
 hey, you're not hopeless.

517
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:46,540
 You have me.

518
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:48,700
 I'm the hope of glory, Colossians 1, 27.

519
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:51,620
 Some of you, you're haunted by past mistakes.

520
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:53,700
 You think back to that thing you did,

521
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:56,140
 not just yesterday, not just last week,

522
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:58,620
 not just last month, but years ago.

523
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,260
 And you're still carrying it with you.

524
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:03,780
 You're haunted by something that happened so long ago,

525
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:04,900
 and yet he's looking at you and he's saying,

526
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:08,580
 no, no, no, there's no sin, which I will not forgive.

527
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:09,740
 Luke 23, 24.

528
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,660
 Some of you, you're not just thinking about the past,

529
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:13,060
 you're afraid of the future.

530
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:16,300
 It freaks you out.

531
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,860
 You don't know what's gonna happen out there.

532
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:21,860
 And so what you do is you just sit and dwell

533
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:24,020
 and worry and complain right here.

534
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,860
 And yet your fear of the future is something

535
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:27,500
 Jesus looks at and he says, no, no, no,

536
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,900
 you don't need to worry about what's ahead.

537
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,020
 I will take care of it.

538
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,140
 I am the way.

539
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:33,140
 I am the truth.

540
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:34,540
 I am the life.

541
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,700
 John 14, 26.

542
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:38,140
 Some of you, you are enslaved to secrets

543
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:41,240
 you feel you can never share.

544
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:46,060
 There is some hidden sin,

545
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:50,800
 some forbidden shame,

546
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:54,940
 that God, if it ever got out into the light of day,

547
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:59,380
 you'd lose your job, you'd lose your relationship,

548
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:01,500
 your family would disown you,

549
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,780
 your community would outright expose you.

550
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:07,460
 You can't, you can't get it out in the open.

551
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:10,060
 No one can ever know I'm going to the grave with this thing.

552
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:12,100
 I'll never share this secret I have.

553
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,620
 And yet Jesus is looking at you and he's saying, no,

554
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:18,180
 I am a savior that has come to rescue you from that.

555
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:20,380
 Luke 19, 10.

556
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:22,480
 Some of you tonight,

557
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,060
 you've been walking with God for a long time.

558
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:29,360
 You're comfortable in spaces like this.

559
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,820
 You know all the lyrics of the songs we sing.

560
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:34,100
 You raise your hands in the right moments.

561
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:37,980
 And yet you're spiritually flatlining.

562
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:42,780
 And your doubtful things will ever return

563
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:44,960
 to the way they were at first.

564
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:49,760
 Jesus welcomes all who are weary and heavy laden.

565
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,660
 That's what Matthew 11 says.

566
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:58,700
 And to the last of you,

567
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:04,160
 your sin's not hidden in secret.

568
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:09,640
 It has been laid bare for all to see.

569
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:13,160
 You walk into rooms like this

570
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:19,120
 and just by way of your presence entering the doorway,

571
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:24,280
 you feel exposed and vulnerable

572
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,000
 amongst a people like the porch.

573
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,020
 Jesus looks at you and he says,

574
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:33,680
 I'm a man you are.

575
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,680
 I'm with you.

576
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,060
 You're not alone.

577
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:39,100
 You're welcome here.

578
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:46,540
 Jesus knows your condition and he's come close anyways.

579
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:49,680
 He wants to meet you where you are

580
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:52,380
 that you might see him as he is.

581
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:53,620
 That's what he does for this man.

582
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:54,820
 And that's what he wants to do for you.

583
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:55,940
 But there's a catch.

584
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:00,940
 Jesus will complicate your life to clarify your vision.

585
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:06,760
 He will complicate your life to clarify your vision.

586
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,940
 I hate to be the bearer of bad news.

587
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:12,180
 Listen, that's a tough bit to sell.

588
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:14,300
 I'll admit it, but it's true.

589
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,700
 I've got to give it to you straight.

590
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:18,140
 This is what we learn in this story.

591
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:20,900
 Like Jesus, he not only wants you to see him,

592
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:23,460
 he wants you to see him clearly,

593
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:25,300
 like he wants it to be 20/20 vision.

594
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,180
 He wants you to get all of him and more.

595
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:29,340
 He wants you to have the full array

596
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:31,300
 of who he is as a person,

597
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:33,660
 which means he will complicate your life

598
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:35,020
 to clarify your vision.

599
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:37,960
 Why do parents give their children chores?

600
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:42,060
 Why do they unnecessarily complicate their lives?

601
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:48,340
 Because without them, they're spoiled and entitled

602
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:52,180
 and self-interested and a pain upon this world.

603
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:54,380
 No, they give them chores

604
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:57,340
 because that's where they learn responsibility.

605
00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:00,060
 Like that's where they grow in character.

606
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:03,340
 That's where they build some sense of maturity.

607
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:04,780
 They grow in gratitude.

608
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:06,260
 That's why they're given chores.

609
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:09,660
 That's why my dad drug me to our family farm

610
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:11,820
 and taught me how to cut firewood as a boy.

611
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:15,780
 When all of my friends on Saturday mornings

612
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,900
 were snuggled nice in their beds

613
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:20,620
 and watching Saturday morning cartoons,

614
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:24,660
 I was out there in the cold of winter

615
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:29,180
 just swinging an ax, just working it, you know?

616
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:30,880
 Why did my dad do that to me?

617
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,820
 Because he cared about me.

618
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:36,360
 He didn't want me to be like them.

619
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:40,400
 He wanted me to be better.

620
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,300
 He wanted to complicate my life to clarify my vision.

621
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,100
 Yes, he wanted to teach me things.

622
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,300
 He wanted to grow my character.

623
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:49,800
 He wanted to like help me learn responsibility.

624
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:54,600
 But it was in the complication

625
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,880
 that I only got a vision for those things.

626
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,980
 I got a vision for him.

627
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,920
 I got to learn my dad.

628
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:03,400
 I got to get to know him.

629
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,560
 I got to understand his character.

630
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,880
 I get to learn from his example.

631
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,920
 And in the process,

632
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,680
 I learned what it meant to navigate the hard together.

633
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:15,680
 That's what Jesus is doing with this guy.

634
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,840
 Like he complicates his life.

635
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:19,520
 Jesus tells him to go and to wash in the pool

636
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,480
 of Siloam, which really doesn't mean much to us.

637
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,000
 Can we just be clear on that?

638
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 Like we probably don't have much grasp

639
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,800
 of ancient Jewish geography.

640
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,040
 This just sounds like, hey, he saw him at the temple

641
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:29,880
 and he invited him.

642
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,280
 Hey buddy, let's just, I'll take you by the hand.

643
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,880
 Come on, you know, we'll just walk over here

644
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,220
 to the pool of Siloam, put some mud, wipe it off.

645
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,060
 You're going to see, you know,

646
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,480
 like that's what we feel like this is.

647
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,520
 But that is not the case.

648
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,280
 If you go and you look at historical maps,

649
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:46,320
 what you realize is this is a half mile journey

650
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,200
 down a 400 foot decline pitch

651
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,900
 on one of the three busiest days in Jerusalem.

652
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:55,680
 That's cruel.

653
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,080
 That is unusual punishment.

654
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:00,000
 Jesus, why would you tell a blind man to do that?

655
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,240
 That is hard enough for regular people.

656
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,160
 I know folks that can't make that kind of hike today.

657
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,560
 And yet you're asking someone who can't even see

658
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,000
 to traverse that sort of terrain.

659
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,180
 That feels crazy.

660
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:16,700
 And yet Jesus cares too much to not complicate his life.

661
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:22,160
 You see, Jesus is doing this for a very specific purpose.

662
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,720
 Like, couldn't he just snap his fingers,

663
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,180
 give but a word and give him his sight back?

664
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:30,140
 Of course, I know doubt Jesus could do that.

665
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:32,920
 But therein lies the significance to this story.

666
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:36,360
 Jesus is less concerned with this man's physical sight.

667
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:39,680
 And he is more concerned with his spiritual sight.

668
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:42,640
 He is less concerned with the eyes of his head

669
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,160
 and more concerned with the eyes of his heart.

670
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,920
 That's what Jesus' aim is.

671
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,400
 And that's his aim for us too.

672
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,480
 Second Corinthians 5, seven, for we,

673
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,660
 those who know the Lord Jesus Christ,

674
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:56,720
 we walk by faith, not by sight.

675
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,540
 Hebrews 11, one.

676
00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:00,320
 Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for.

677
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,700
 It's the conviction of things not seen.

678
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:05,800
 John 20, 29, from Jesus himself, he says,

679
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:09,000
 "Have you believed because you have seen me?

680
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 "Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed."

681
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,320
 Jesus could have solved this man's blindness

682
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,280
 in but a moment.

683
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:22,760
 The blindness of his heart,

684
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,800
 that took a little bit more time.

685
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:30,040
 I know this lesson really well.

686
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:34,060
 When my wife and I, Brooke, moved to Houston,

687
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:37,200
 we went to work with young adults there.

688
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,640
 People, the exact same stage of life as you.

689
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,300
 As we made our way to Houston, I was pumped.

690
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,720
 I was so excited.

691
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,000
 Like I had been working in college ministry

692
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,360
 and cutting my teeth and in smaller ways,

693
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,480
 but for the first time I was gonna get to lead and teach

694
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,320
 and shepherd God's people.

695
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,280
 And I was amped.

696
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,160
 Like I was ready to like kick butt and take names.

697
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,520
 You know, I've walked in, I was like, here I am.

698
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:59,360
 And yet I was the one whose butt got kicked.

699
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,360
 I was the name that got taken.

700
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,040
 You know, it was so much harder than I expected,

701
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:07,120
 especially in my first year.

702
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,080
 And I remember at the end of year one,

703
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:12,280
 looking up to God and being like, why?

704
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,440
 Like, God, why would you do this to me?

705
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:21,120
 And it's one of the best lessons I've ever learned.

706
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,240
 He taught me in that season,

707
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:29,040
 "Kylin, I will take you places you would never choose to go

708
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:32,640
 to teach you those things

709
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,080
 you need to know.

710
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:43,200
 I will lead you into places you would never choose.

711
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,440
 And yet it will be those places that you'll never take back."

712
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:52,440
 You see, it was through the pain, not despite it,

713
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:55,920
 but through the pain that I learned to trust God,

714
00:30:55,920 --> 00:31:00,280
 trust Him with my life, trust Him with my future,

715
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,560
 trust Him with my family.

716
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,480
 In the process of doing so,

717
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:09,160
 I got a clearer vision of Him.

718
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:12,000
 Friends, God will complicate your life

719
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:12,920
 to clarify your vision.

720
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,480
 He wants you to know Him so much so

721
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,440
 that He will inconvenience your life

722
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,160
 and He will disrupt your plans.

723
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:23,600
 Does that mean it's easy to handle those moments

724
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,120
 in the future now that we know that?

725
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:31,240
 No, not at all.

726
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,640
 I was just thinking about this guy's story.

727
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,680
 This is a hard ask.

728
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:42,280
 Don't you think during his journey to Siloam,

729
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:45,120
 he probably thought, "Why am I even doing this?

730
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,560
 This is so hard.

731
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,920
 I can't even see."

732
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,760
 Jesus, you couldn't have picked a closer pool.

733
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,600
 There are plenty in Jerusalem for you to choose.

734
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,920
 Why would you pick Siloam?

735
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:56,400
 Why are you sending me down this path to this place?

736
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,760
 Why couldn't you pick something easier?

737
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,360
 And not only that, Jesus,

738
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,440
 the thing you're trying to do,

739
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,920
 it's something that no one's ever done before.

740
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,800
 Like, I'm gonna be the first one.

741
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,680
 Hello, everyone.

742
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,840
 I'm the man born blind that was healed.

743
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,520
 History, count my name, it was me.

744
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,480
 No, that's not gonna be the case.

745
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,880
 This feels crazy.

746
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,600
 Why would he do this?

747
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,160
 Why does this man press on?

748
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:23,320
 For this reason, I think, I think,

749
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:26,600
 he was desperate enough to keep going.

750
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,840
 I think he was weary of the hopelessness.

751
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,920
 I think he was tired of his circumstance.

752
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:38,840
 And he heard from one man a voice and a truth

753
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:42,360
 that sounded like the God he had heard for so long say,

754
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:45,480
 "I can help you take this and go there."

755
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,920
 And so he did.

756
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:49,400
 He got up and he moved.

757
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,780
 You see, desperation is a great motivation.

758
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:54,280
 It'll move you forward.

759
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,000
 It'll keep you going.

760
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,560
 Some of you tonight, like,

761
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:00,320
 I think that you're in this place.

762
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,800
 Like, amidst the heart of whatever it is you're enduring,

763
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,040
 the pain of whatever you're feeling,

764
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:07,800
 some of you, you are desperate enough like this man

765
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,540
 in this seat that you're sitting in tonight

766
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:13,020
 to humble yourself and just say,

767
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:17,320
 "Jesus, I don't know if you can fix me.

768
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,620
 "I don't know if you can heal me.

769
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:20,280
 "I don't know if you can help me.

770
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:23,500
 "But God, I know I can't.

771
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:27,000
 "So I might as well try."

772
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,180
 Where's Salome?

773
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:32,160
 What can I lose?

774
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,360
 Wrong question.

775
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:36,720
 It's not what can you lose,

776
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,720
 because you can't lose a thing by trusting in Jesus.

777
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:43,320
 It's what can you gain, because you can gain everything.

778
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:48,080
 Which brings me to my third point.

779
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:52,160
 One touch from God changes everything.

780
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:56,760
 One touch from God changes absolutely everything.

781
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:59,000
 That's what happens in this story for this guy.

782
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,100
 Look at how the rest of the passage unfolds.

783
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:04,520
 It starts with an interrogation by the Pharisees.

784
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,520
 It says the Pharisees, they get wind of what happened,

785
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,280
 that Jesus is out here and he's performing these miracles.

786
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,800
 And rightly so, as religious leaders,

787
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,720
 he's performed enough of these messianic miracles

788
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,600
 that they should investigate.

789
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:17,160
 But they don't just investigate, they interrogate this guy.

790
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:19,660
 Like, there's some pride, there's some ego,

791
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:20,720
 there's some platform here

792
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,400
 that they're worried Jesus is encroaching on.

793
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,840
 And so they gather this guy and they say this.

794
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,760
 They brought to the Pharisees

795
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,120
 the man who had formerly been blind.

796
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:30,800
 Now, it was a Sabbath day when Jesus made the mud

797
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,080
 and he opened his eyes.

798
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,760
 So the Pharisees again asked him how he had received his

799
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,800
 sight and he said to them,

800
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:39,560
 he put mud on my eyes and I washed, then I see.

801
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:44,020
 Some of the Pharisees said, this man is not from God,

802
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,560
 for he does not keep the Sabbath.

803
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,560
 But others said, how can a man who is a sinner

804
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,280
 do such signs?

805
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,120
 And there was division among them.

806
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,660
 So they said again to the blind man,

807
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:55,840
 who's not so blind anymore,

808
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:59,080
 what do you say about him since he has opened your eyes?

809
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,520
 And he said, he's a prophet.

810
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,300
 You see, they can't make sense of it.

811
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:07,360
 They are so dissatisfied with this guy's answers

812
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,240
 that they go, and we won't read it for the sake of time,

813
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,900
 they go from interrogating him

814
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,480
 to interrogating his parents.

815
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,560
 You know, if he's not gonna tell us the truth,

816
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,600
 bring in mom and dad, they will tell us the truth.

817
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,640
 Is he suspect?

818
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,600
 Should we trust him?

819
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,520
 Is he believable?

820
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,340
 No, okay.

821
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:23,440
 Like, that's what they're trying to just find a way,

822
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,180
 a loophole, a path towards manipulating

823
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:27,440
 around this situation.

824
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,500
 And yet it says there's division among them.

825
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,560
 They cannot agree.

826
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,080
 And so they have him come back.

827
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,920
 And what happens is the interrogation, it escalates.

828
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:39,640
 It moves from interrogation to intimidation,

829
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,400
 which is what we see in verse 24.

830
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,720
 So for the second time,

831
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:46,320
 they called the man who had been blind and said to him,

832
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,720
 give glory to God, which is ironic.

833
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:53,500
 We know that this man is a sinner, talking about Jesus.

834
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:56,700
 He answered, whether he's a sinner, I do not know.

835
00:35:56,700 --> 00:36:00,320
 But one thing, there it is.

836
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:05,320
 One thing I do know, I was blind, but now I see.

837
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:11,300
 They said to him, what did he do to you?

838
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:13,220
 How did he open your eyes?

839
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:15,900
 And he answered them, I have told you already,

840
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,820
 are you not listening?

841
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:19,940
 Why do you want to hear it again?

842
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:22,220
 Do you also want to become his disciples?

843
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:23,580
 I kind of like this guy, you know,

844
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:25,480
 throwing a little jab, a little sarcasm in the mix.

845
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:28,020
 You can feel the tension in this moment rising.

846
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,100
 Like the Pharisees, they are openly dissatisfied

847
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:30,940
 with the man's claims.

848
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:32,900
 Like they're not just behind hushed doors,

849
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,540
 talking to each other and saying, we can't make sense of it.

850
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:35,700
 They are looking at him and they're saying,

851
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,340
 we can't make sense of this.

852
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:39,160
 This doesn't compute.

853
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,460
 And yet what happens as he stands

854
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:43,460
 before the religious leaders,

855
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:47,340
 and they're not only interrogating him,

856
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:49,020
 they are intimidating him.

857
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:50,220
 He doesn't back down.

858
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:53,380
 He does not give ground.

859
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:56,340
 He doesn't bend, he doesn't bow, he doesn't break.

860
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:58,060
 He stands stalwart.

861
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:00,180
 Why?

862
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:04,480
 Because one touch from God changes everything.

863
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:09,200
 Which raises an important question for us.

864
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,820
 Why is this his reaction?

865
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:15,940
 He was blind.

866
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:18,500
 What do you think he wanted to see?

867
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,900
 He got it.

868
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:22,140
 Like he had already gotten the thing he wanted.

869
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:23,740
 And so he's in the middle of this interrogation

870
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:25,340
 in the process of this intimidation.

871
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:27,440
 And he has his sight.

872
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:30,980
 In the midst of this conflict,

873
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:33,460
 why doesn't he just plead the fifth?

874
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:36,020
 Throw Jesus under the bus.

875
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:38,140
 Sorry, man, it's you or me.

876
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:39,580
 Why does he go down with the ship

877
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:42,460
 when he could just into the trade portal,

878
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:45,940
 swap teams and leave Jesus behind and join these guys.

879
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:47,100
 He has his sight.

880
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,380
 He has what he wants.

881
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:52,500
 Why does he stand in allegiance to Jesus?

882
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:53,740
 Because, and this is big,

883
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:55,100
 and I don't need you to miss this,

884
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,900
 one touch from Jesus,

885
00:37:56,900 --> 00:38:01,360
 it didn't just change something in this guy's life.

886
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:06,280
 It changed everything in this guy's life.

887
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:09,200
 Which is a really confronting thought

888
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,660
 for some of us here tonight.

889
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:14,300
 Because if we can be honest with ourselves,

890
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:19,660
 some of us just want Jesus to change something.

891
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:23,740
 Like, Jesus, I don't need you to change everything

892
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:27,060
 in my life, but I just need you to change something.

893
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:30,340
 Like my job, my paycheck, my bank account,

894
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:32,020
 my position in the office,

895
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:35,360
 maybe move me completely from this city to that city.

896
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,180
 My relationship status would be amazing.

897
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:38,300
 Can you help me change my body?

898
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:39,860
 That'd be great too.

899
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:41,740
 We just wanted to change something.

900
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:42,900
 And maybe it's not a tangible something.

901
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:45,020
 Maybe it's an intangible something.

902
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:47,700
 Maybe it's Jesus, can you help me change my desire?

903
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,240
 Can you help me change my dreams?

904
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,900
 Can you help me change my skills, my giftings, my talents?

905
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,700
 Can you help me change my reputation, my knowledge?

906
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,320
 Can you help me change that?

907
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:58,060
 Listen, these things are not inherently bad.

908
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:00,020
 In fact, they're morally neutral.

909
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:08,660
 But if Jesus Christ is not Lord over all of your life,

910
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:12,620
 then he is not Lord over any part of your life.

911
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:17,620
 There's one throne in your life

912
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:19,180
 and you don't get to sit on it.

913
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:23,660
 It's his, he is king.

914
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:26,140
 Paul tells us in Philippians 2, 9 through 11,

915
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:28,700
 "Therefore God has highly exalted him

916
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:31,340
 and bestowed on him the name that is above every name

917
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:33,860
 so that the name of Jesus, every knee should bow."

918
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:35,540
 That's what you do to kings.

919
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:38,260
 You bow before them in heaven and on earth

920
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:39,100
 and under the earth.

921
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:41,180
 There is no mark of real estate anywhere

922
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:44,180
 in all of the cosmos that is excluded from this.

923
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:46,100
 Everyone will bow the knee

924
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:51,100
 and every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord

925
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:53,300
 to the glory of God the Father.

926
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:55,780
 If that's not enough, Paul keeps going in Colossians 1.

927
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:57,500
 He says, "He," talking about Jesus,

928
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,360
 "is the image of the invisible God,

929
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,820
 the firstborn of all creation.

930
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:04,460
 For by him, all things were created in heaven and earth,

931
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:05,300
 visible and invisible,

932
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:06,940
 whether thrones or dominions, rulers or authorities.

933
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:11,940
 All things, all things were created through him and for him.

934
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:16,220
 He is before all things,

935
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:18,100
 and in him, all things hold together.

936
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:20,940
 He is the head of the body, the church.

937
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:22,340
 He is the beginning.

938
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:24,420
 He is the firstborn from the dead,

939
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:29,420
 that in everything, in everything, he might be preeminent.

940
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:34,580
 Jesus is supreme.

941
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:38,780
 Jesus is king.

942
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:42,180
 Jesus is Lord.

943
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:45,220
 And he gets to sit on the throne of your life.

944
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:47,860
 That's why one touch from God changes everything.

945
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:49,780
 That's what the one thing this man knows.

946
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:53,340
 He was blind, but now he sees.

947
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:56,180
 And not just physically sees, he spiritually sees.

948
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:58,540
 Like that's what the Greek in this moment says.

949
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:00,920
 The word for sight here is blepo,

950
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:03,940
 which means that he doesn't just see what's tangible,

951
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:05,660
 he sees what's true.

952
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:13,100
 That's what the hand of God does in the life of a person.

953
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:16,780
 That's what one touch can do for you tonight.

954
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:18,940
 It can change everything.

955
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:25,640
 It can erupt your rhythms.

956
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:28,460
 It can disrupt your plans.

957
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:35,260
 And it can lead you into deeper, fuller, more lasting life

958
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:37,460
 than you'll find anywhere else.

959
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:41,040
 Than you yourself will ever lead yourself unto.

960
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:46,020
 You see, Jesus Christ, he is the son of God.

961
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:47,020
 He is the hero of heaven.

962
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:48,340
 He is the light of the world.

963
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:49,460
 He is the prince of peace.

964
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:52,340
 He is the Messiah, according to this text

965
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:54,580
 that was sent to save.

966
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:59,480
 And for this man, and God, I pray for you,

967
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:04,900
 no amount of interrogation

968
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:09,540
 and no amount of intimidation could ever sway his allegiance

969
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:11,120
 from this king.

970
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:16,000
 Jesus is God become man,

971
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,180
 that man might come to God.

972
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:23,780
 And no cost incurred in this world

973
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:29,500
 is worth the riches of all he affords.

974
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:33,940
 Even the cost of being cast out,

975
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:35,640
 which is where the story finishes.

976
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:41,900
 Like at the very bottom paragraph of this text,

977
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:43,860
 it says that the Pharisees,

978
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:45,380
 they can't make sense with this guy.

979
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:47,740
 And so what they do is they cast him out.

980
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:52,500
 There's a really detailed explanation

981
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,420
 of what that kind of casting out means,

982
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:56,820
 what that sort of excommunication looks like,

983
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:58,860
 according to Pharisaic tradition.

984
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:00,060
 But for the sake of our time,

985
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:04,140
 what you need to know is he is cast out in such a way

986
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:09,220
 that it's only modern day equivalent is death.

987
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:12,340
 He's removed from the synagogue.

988
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:13,500
 That's what verse 22 tells us.

989
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:16,320
 He's removed from the Jewish community,

990
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:19,500
 that which he has wanted to be a part of.

991
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:22,340
 And he at last has a chance to because he has his sight.

992
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:25,420
 He loses it.

993
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:27,060
 He's removed from it.

994
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:29,780
 He is ostracized from community.

995
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:32,740
 He is cast out of society.

996
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:37,500
 He is alienated and alone, left forbidden on the fringe.

997
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:42,980
 And it's there that Jesus comes to him

998
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:46,440
 when no one else wanted him.

999
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:50,240
 Jesus says, "I want you.

1000
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:57,420
 "You may be cast out, but I'm closing in."

1001
00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:00,500
 And as he engages this man, he looks at him.

1002
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:03,000
 He says, "Hey, do you believe in the Son of Man?"

1003
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:08,740
 To which this guy responds, "Who is he, sir?

1004
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:10,740
 "I wanna believe in him, but who is he?"

1005
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:17,260
 And I can just imagine Jesus

1006
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:21,680
 sitting face to face with this guy,

1007
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:25,980
 staring into those eyes which now can see.

1008
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:29,540
 (gentle music)

1009
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:31,240
 He says, "You've already seen him.

1010
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:39,180
 "And it is me that is him."

1011
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:50,780
 Friends, don't you know that Jesus Christ

1012
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:53,460
 has done for him what he wishes to do for you?

1013
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:55,860
 He wishes to engage you tonight

1014
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:59,980
 wherever it is you are.

1015
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:06,740
 Meet you in that place that you might see him as he is,

1016
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:10,080
 for that is what he has done in descending from heaven above,

1017
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:12,340
 coming to earth below, meeting us here,

1018
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:16,020
 fallen, broken, bruised, broken, and busted humanity.

1019
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:21,020
 Meeting us in our death,

1020
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:23,340
 that we might see him in his life

1021
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:25,140
 and receive that for ourselves too.

1022
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:29,780
 You see, Jesus, he wants for you

1023
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:30,900
 what he wants for this man.

1024
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:35,900
 He wishes you to know your life is so complicated,

1025
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:40,180
 but I bore that complication upon the cross

1026
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:45,620
 that it might clarify your vision of who it is I am.

1027
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:52,100
 And Jesus wants you to know,

1028
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:55,900
 just as this man does himself,

1029
00:45:55,900 --> 00:46:00,300
 that one touch from God can change a person forever.

1030
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:03,420
 And Jesus Christ is the gracious hand of God

1031
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:07,020
 extending to those who feel so far off

1032
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:10,100
 and yet will be brought home

1033
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:11,940
 should they place their faith in him

1034
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:14,460
 and follow him heavenward.

1035
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:18,300
 Friends, don't you know,

1036
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:23,740
 Jesus is the one who has come near

1037
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:25,300
 to be cast out,

1038
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:31,940
 that we who are cast out might come near.

1039
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:34,660
 This is the heart of our King.

1040
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:37,260
 This is the one thing to know.

1041
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:43,580
 If you're blind, tonight you can see.

1042
00:46:43,580 --> 00:46:48,660
 One touch, it changes everything.

1043
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:52,900
 How badly do you want for that touch tonight?

1044
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:55,620
 Let me pray.

1045
00:46:55,620 --> 00:47:00,860
 Father, I just thank you.

1046
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:04,860
 I thank you, God, that in moments like this,

1047
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:09,460
 you come close to meet us.

1048
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:13,580
 People from all walks of life

1049
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:15,220
 and assortment of backgrounds, God,

1050
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:18,420
 you come close to meet us here in this moment.

1051
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:21,060
 And yet to teach us that same truth,

1052
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:24,540
 which we all need despite our diversity,

1053
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:30,700
 which is that one came for all,

1054
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:34,620
 that all might be united as one under his name.

1055
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:39,100
 Father, I pray that you would move in this moment,

1056
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:40,780
 that your Holy Spirit would come

1057
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:42,820
 and would sweep amongst us,

1058
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:45,460
 that you, God, would have your way

1059
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:47,780
 amongst my friends here in these seats.

1060
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:50,380
 God, there are some people here tonight

1061
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:53,260
 that want a fresh touch from you,

1062
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:54,980
 that want a touch from heaven.

1063
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:58,140
 I pray, God, that you would reach down

1064
00:47:58,140 --> 00:47:59,820
 and you would meet them where they are,

1065
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:01,380
 and you, God, would lift them

1066
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:03,500
 to where you yourself sit tonight.

1067
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:06,940
 Others, God, they're here,

1068
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:13,860
 and God, what they need is humbling.

1069
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:17,980
 I think about the Pharisees in this story,

1070
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:22,980
 and they have so much line length and page work, God.

1071
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:26,500
 And yet what we see from their example, God,

1072
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:30,420
 is that spiritual arrogance leads to spiritual blindness.

1073
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:32,260
 I pray, God, that for those in the room

1074
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:34,780
 that may in fact know you, they would say,

1075
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:38,300
 "Jesus, I'm blinder than I thought.

1076
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:41,620
 "Would you light up my life, give me new sight,

1077
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:43,660
 "and lead me in the way everlasting?"

1078
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:50,060
 For others, tonight, God, is a night of salvation,

1079
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:52,500
 that they might look to you and say,

1080
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:56,460
 "Jesus Christ, be the Lord of my life.

1081
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:58,220
 "I've reached the end of myself.

1082
00:48:58,220 --> 00:49:01,580
 "I am desperate enough to follow.

1083
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:03,020
 "It's not what do I have to lose,

1084
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:05,020
 "it's what do I have to gain,

1085
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:07,620
 "and it's you, my God, that I wish to gain tonight.

1086
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:11,100
 "Save me from my sin, forgive me of my iniquity,

1087
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:14,100
 "and lead me home that I might be with you forever."

1088
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:19,420
 This room is yours, this people, they're yours.

1089
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:22,820
 Would you sit on the throne of our life, God, we pray.

1090
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:24,100
 In Christ's name, amen.

1091
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:27,440
