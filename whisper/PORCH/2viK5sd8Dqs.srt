1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:18,200
 - All right, all right, let's do it.

3
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,340
 Porch, how we doing?

4
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:21,080
 (audience cheering)

5
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,600
 If we haven't met, my name is JD.

6
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,400
 I'm the creative director here on Tuesday nights.

7
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,400
 It's an honor to be here.

8
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,440
 We're gonna jump right in.

9
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,600
 I wanna say what's up first

10
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,960
 to our Porch Live locations tonight.

11
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,280
 Say hello to Porch Live North Houston,

12
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,880
 Porch Live Scottsdale, Tulsa, and Midland.

13
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,920
 Let's give them a hello from Dallas, Texas.

14
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:38,960
 (audience cheering)

15
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,480
 So glad you guys are tuning in.

16
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,920
 Wherever you're watching online,

17
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,040
 you are welcome here tonight.

18
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,200
 I wanna go and give a preview of where we're heading tonight.

19
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,020
 We are in between series.

20
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:51,160
 We just finished RIP to the old me.

21
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,780
 Next week, we have something really exciting in store.

22
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:54,840
 Stay tuned.

23
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,520
 And tonight, we're gonna look at a story

24
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,480
 that I think a lot of us are familiar with

25
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,800
 and when I was praying about where

26
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,800
 the kind of God wanted to take us tonight,

27
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,740
 there was a quote that I used the last time I spoke

28
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:08,940
 from A.W. Tozer, and he said,

29
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:13,160
 "Your view of God determines your response to him."

30
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:16,240
 Your view of God determines your response to him.

31
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,120
 And it seemed to resonate with a lot of people.

32
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,220
 And so I thought tonight,

33
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:22,400
 I'd take us further on what that looks like.

34
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,940
 And we're gonna do that through this story

35
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,320
 in Luke chapter 15.

36
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,640
 And so if you go ahead and turn there,

37
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,000
 I'm gonna just read the story for us tonight.

38
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,240
 And then after that, we're gonna pray and get right in.

39
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,080
 Luke chapter 15 set the scene.

40
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,000
 Jesus is sitting in verse one, we see this.

41
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,440
 He says, "Now the tax collectors and sinners

42
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:43,160
 were all drawing near to him," him being Jesus.

43
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:47,680
 "And the Pharisees and the scribes grumbled,

44
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,000
 saying, 'This man receives sinners and eats with them.'"

45
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,160
 That's the setting that we're sitting in.

46
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,920
 And clearly what Jesus is about to show us here

47
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,640
 is there are people in his midst

48
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,620
 who had a wrong view of what he was about,

49
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:06,840
 had a wrong view of what his father was about

50
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,200
 and the people that he wanted to reach and to save,

51
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,960
 the people that he wanted to draw near to.

52
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,280
 There were people in his midst who were grumbling

53
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,440
 and complaining and distant from Jesus

54
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,760
 because they did not know what he was about,

55
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,040
 what his actual heart was for people.

56
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,040
 And so Jesus takes this moment

57
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,520
 where he's gonna share this story

58
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,360
 that resonates with every single person

59
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,920
 in this room tonight.

60
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,320
 And he reads this story because we know

61
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,600
 that scripture tells us that Jesus was fully God

62
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,440
 and fully man.

63
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,320
 And I don't know right now what has dictated your view

64
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,640
 of God and the church up into this point.

65
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,220
 I don't know what experience has brought you

66
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:51,800
 to how you currently view him, but there is no one,

67
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,400
 no one who has ever walked the earth

68
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,660
 who knows more of how to have the right view of God

69
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,920
 than Jesus.

70
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,960
 And so if you wanna have the right view of him,

71
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,000
 this is the story 'cause he's gonna tell you,

72
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,920
 hey, this is the heart of God.

73
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,420
 Chapter 15, verse 11.

74
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:11,140
 Here's how he describes the heart of God.

75
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:15,480
 He parallels it to a young man and his father.

76
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,680
 Verse 11, and he said,

77
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,200
 "There was a man who had two sons

78
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,800
 "and the younger of them said to his father,

79
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,340
 "Father, give me the share of property

80
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,680
 "that is coming to me.

81
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,080
 "And he divided his property between them.

82
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,640
 "Not many days later, the younger son gathered all he had

83
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,720
 "and took a journey into a far country.

84
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,940
 "And there he squandered his property in reckless living.

85
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,640
 "And when he has spent everything,

86
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,960
 "a severe famine arose in that country

87
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,380
 "and he began to be in need.

88
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,240
 "So he went and hired himself out

89
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,440
 "to the one of the citizens of that country

90
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:48,460
 "who sent him into the fields to feed pigs.

91
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,360
 "And he was longing to be fed with the pods

92
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,380
 "that the pigs ate and no one gave him anything.

93
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:59,100
 "But when he came to himself,

94
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:03,000
 "he said, how many of my father's hired servants

95
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,580
 "have more than enough bread,

96
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:07,040
 "but I perish here with hunger.

97
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,780
 "I will arise and go to my father

98
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:09,700
 "and I will say to him,

99
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,940
 "Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you.

100
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:16,000
 "I am no longer worthy to be called your son.

101
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,940
 "Treat me as one of your hired servants.

102
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:21,800
 "And he arose and came to his father.

103
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,720
 "But while he was still a long ways off,

104
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,160
 "his father saw him and felt compassion.

105
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:33,620
 "And he ran and embraced him and kissed him.

106
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:34,580
 "And the son said to him,

107
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:37,040
 "Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you.

108
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,320
 "I'm no longer worthy to be called your son.

109
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,960
 "But the father said to his servants,

110
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,260
 "bring quickly the best robe, put it on him,

111
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:45,320
 "put the ring on his hand, the shoes on his feet

112
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,080
 "and bring the fattened calf and kill it

113
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,140
 "and let us eat and celebrate.

114
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:52,080
 "For this my son was dead and is alive again.

115
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,960
 "He was lost and is found.

116
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,640
 "And they began to celebrate."

117
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:00,080
 God, this is your heart for your people.

118
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,420
 If there's someone here tonight,

119
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:06,960
 I don't know what it is, but whatever it is,

120
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,200
 they're angry with you, they're mad at you,

121
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,600
 they're distant from you.

122
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:14,200
 They think that you're irrelevant or you're some myth.

123
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,500
 And they're here for any other reason other than you

124
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,040
 because they don't truly have the right view of you.

125
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,360
 Would you open up their eyes tonight?

126
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,640
 Holy Spirit, would you come and speak through me right now?

127
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,560
 If there's anything that JD wants to say, take it away.

128
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,120
 Take it away, would you come and move?

129
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,400
 We open up our hearts to you in this time.

130
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,440
 We wanna know your heart, God, and respond accordingly.

131
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,040
 In your name that we pray, amen.

132
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:41,740
 Well, my junior year or sophomore year of college,

133
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:42,580
 I can't remember.

134
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,240
 Me and my friends did this thing one Friday night

135
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,480
 where we brought over all our friends,

136
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,080
 we took all the mattresses out of all of our room,

137
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,120
 we put them in the living room,

138
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,600
 and we had a scary movie night.

139
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,100
 The scariest movie, I think,

140
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,620
 I stopped watching scary movies after this

141
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,260
 because it petrified me, was "Strangers."

142
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,560
 In this movie, the premise,

143
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,840
 it starts off with this statistic,

144
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,960
 I don't remember exactly what it said,

145
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,760
 but it says something along the lines of,

146
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,200
 "Hey, every year in America,

147
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,120
 this many random murders happen for no reason."

148
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,240
 And I'm like, that's great.

149
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,760
 And then the movie goes on and there's this married couple,

150
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,240
 they like, their car breaks down,

151
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,840
 they find themselves in this like Airbnb, I guess,

152
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,800
 and throughout the night,

153
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,440
 they're just getting tortured by this group of people.

154
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,160
 It's a great start of the message.

155
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:25,520
 So at the end, the husband's dead, we're led to believe,

156
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,040
 and then the wife is like crawling backwards,

157
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,800
 and you're watching the girl in the bunny mask

158
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,480
 like drag the knife or ax or whatever,

159
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,480
 and then she like flips her over and she's like,

160
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,300
 "Why are you doing this?"

161
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,960
 And she gets down and she's like,

162
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,200
 (congregation laughing)

163
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,260
 because you were home.

164
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,320
 That was it.

165
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,500
 And it like ends.

166
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,040
 And you're like, wait, hold up.

167
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,620
 People are out here killing people for simply being at home.

168
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:49,680
 Like they don't need a reason.

169
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,280
 Hide your kids, hide your wife, nobody's safe.

170
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,280
 And so I don't go back to my room.

171
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,280
 I don't wanna be alone.

172
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,400
 So I fall asleep on the couch.

173
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,040
 So everyone leaves, all three of my roommates

174
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,880
 were football players, so they had a game the next morning.

175
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,920
 They're out the door.

176
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,840
 And I wake up to this eerie feeling

177
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,920
 that like I knew I wasn't alone.

178
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,520
 Like I knew.

179
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,740
 Be it the movie the night before, I don't know,

180
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:13,560
 but I just understood that there was someone with me.

181
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,300
 And you know when the blinds aren't pulled up,

182
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,860
 but they're like open?

183
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:21,600
 I like raised up and I'm like looking in my backyard.

184
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,640
 It was like fenced in where like you can't come in

185
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,480
 if you're not invited.

186
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,300
 You don't just get to like be like,

187
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,380
 "Oh, I'm in your backyard."

188
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,680
 It was a very private backyard.

189
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,080
 And there's this man, I would say late forties, early fifties

190
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,900
 with a beard and like the like zip up,

191
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,060
 like mechanic things walking around.

192
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:36,900
 And I'm like,

193
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:41,240
 I grabbed my bat, I head to the back door and I'm like,

194
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,180
 "Yo, I'm just kidding."

195
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,820
 I ran to the back closet.

196
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:47,300
 And so I run to the farthest room,

197
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,060
 I go inside and I get inside the closet.

198
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,700
 And it's like one of those like rectangular closets

199
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,780
 with like the trifold doors, like the old house,

200
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:54,820
 you know what I'm talking about.

201
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,980
 And so I get in there, I get behind the clothes

202
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:59,740
 and all of a sudden the back door.

203
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:05,280
 And I hear, "Is anyone home?

204
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,180
 Why'd the girl last night die?

205
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,480
 Because she was home."

206
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:11,260
 So I'm like, "Take whatever you want,

207
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,340
 but your brother ain't home.

208
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,380
 Like come and do what you want

209
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:17,100
 'cause you ain't killing me today, no sir."

210
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,540
 And so I am dead quiet.

211
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,840
 And I'm like, "He's gonna just steal the TV and leave,

212
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,940
 like it's fine."

213
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:24,420
 So I'm sitting there, knees weak, arms are heavy,

214
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,260
 I'm down like this.

215
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:29,180
 And I kind of look like I think like when I picture myself

216
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:32,300
 as like Smeagol, like, you know, like.

217
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:36,660
 And so I'm sitting there and he comes walking back

218
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:38,340
 down the hall and I'm like,

219
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:40,200
 "Okay, he has no business back here.

220
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,700
 Like what's he doing back here?"

221
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,700
 Out of all four doors, the one I'm in.

222
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:47,140
 At this point I'm like,

223
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:50,980
 "Anyone home?"

224
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:56,340
 'Cause there's no way he's gonna look inside the closet.

225
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,540
 Who is this man, right?

226
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:02,220
 I look up, hands grab the clothes,

227
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,940
 pull them back.

228
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,940
 "Son of a."

229
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:09,540
 I won't fill in what he said after that.

230
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,720
 If I don't see him, he can't see me.

231
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,760
 So I keep my head down.

232
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,280
 The awkward tension is so thick in the room.

233
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:18,520
 I'm like in my boxers, I'll say it, you know.

234
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,800
 And I'm probably covered in sweat.

235
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,040
 I mean, I look like the epitome of demon possessed.

236
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,640
 And I'm sitting there and this man's like, "Oh."

237
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,680
 And I hear like clank, clank, clank, clank,

238
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:32,060
 footsteps out, door slams, car runs off.

239
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:37,760
 I fall out and I look at my phone and my roommate's like,

240
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,760
 "Hey, heads up, the landlord is sending over the electrician."

241
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,000
 (audience laughing)

242
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,720
 And it's an old house and I'm not kidding.

243
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,180
 Out of everywhere to hide in this dang house,

244
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:52,360
 I hid underneath the breaker box.

245
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,920
 (audience laughing)

246
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,080
 And I like to think that right now

247
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,060
 he's in front of a thousand people being like,

248
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:59,520
 "So here's the day I met a demon possessed guy."

249
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:03,440
 And I start there because

250
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:07,620
 I clearly had a wrong view of this man.

251
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:12,700
 Like he was there to help me, a kind man.

252
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,300
 And I was like, "You're here to kill me.

253
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,100
 You're here to hurt me."

254
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:19,100
 And my response showed accordingly.

255
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,780
 I ran from him.

256
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:25,420
 I did not come to him because I viewed him improperly.

257
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:29,620
 How you view someone determines your response to them.

258
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,780
 So it's really important.

259
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:35,440
 It's really important that when we talk about God,

260
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,320
 the one that we say here as the church

261
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,000
 is the author and giver of life,

262
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,040
 the one that you should surrender your all to,

263
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,500
 it's really important that you take time

264
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,420
 being around the right people,

265
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:49,340
 reading his word and being informed

266
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:52,600
 to have the right view of who he truly is.

267
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,560
 Because if you don't,

268
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,400
 you will find yourself wasting your life.

269
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,900
 Because you're gonna spend your days

270
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,500
 running from a God who is there.

271
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,360
 He's always been there to help and love you.

272
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,800
 But because of your improper view,

273
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,880
 you chose your own path

274
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,760
 because you thought he was there to hurt you.

275
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,200
 And we see in this story that clearly this son

276
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,560
 in the same way he ran from his father

277
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,880
 because he had a false view,

278
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,800
 an incorrect view of who he was.

279
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:24,280
 So we're gonna look at this story and see two false views.

280
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:27,080
 Two false views of God that we have

281
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,200
 that determine a wrong response to him.

282
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,740
 And hopefully that when we look to this

283
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,040
 and we learn about what God,

284
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,040
 what Jesus is trying to say

285
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,880
 is actually true of our father God,

286
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,320
 it will change our view,

287
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,800
 therefore change everything

288
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,120
 about how we respond to him with our lives.

289
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,460
 So false view number one.

290
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:46,220
 A false view number one is God the withholder.

291
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:49,560
 God the withholder.

292
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,480
 This son clearly thought that his father,

293
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,520
 his intent was to withhold fun,

294
00:11:56,520 --> 00:12:01,520
 passion, pleasure and success from him by his actions.

295
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:05,380
 Verse 11, he said, "There was a man who had two sons

296
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:07,340
 and the younger of them said to his father,

297
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:09,060
 'Father, give me the share of property

298
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,260
 that is coming to me.'

299
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:12,700
 And he divided his property between them.

300
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:16,660
 'Father, give me my share that is coming to me.

301
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:19,100
 I know dad that you have some plan for my life

302
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,620
 or you're accumulating some inheritance to give me.

303
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:23,340
 And I know like, if you think about it,

304
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,740
 this dad had everything.

305
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:27,540
 We're seeing here that there was a wealth in this family,

306
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,260
 that they lived in a nice place.

307
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:31,500
 He had food, he had hired servants,

308
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,100
 he had clothes on his back.

309
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,780
 He had everything that he could ever need.

310
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:39,140
 Yet because he thought that life was green

311
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:39,980
 on the other side,

312
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:42,460
 because he thought his father was there

313
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,820
 to withhold from him,

314
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:46,500
 he said, "I wanna take hold of my own life.

315
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,820
 Give it to me now."

316
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,980
 This looks like a lot of us today.

317
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:56,380
 God, man, he kind of seems like a fun sucker.

318
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:59,580
 Like my friends that don't follow Jesus,

319
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:02,180
 they're out living it up every weekend.

320
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:04,740
 They get to spend their money how they want.

321
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,460
 They get to dress how they want,

322
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,260
 post how they want,

323
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:10,940
 hook up when they want and with who they want.

324
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:13,800
 They get to play house with their significant other.

325
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,800
 They seem to have no guilt about it.

326
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,740
 God must be no fun.

327
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:19,760
 He must be a fun sucker.

328
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,340
 He must be withholding from me.

329
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,500
 And like this son, we say,

330
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,380
 "Okay, then I'm gonna take what's mine

331
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,620
 and make a plan for my own life.

332
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:32,540
 I'm gonna go make my own fun.

333
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,860
 I'm gonna go spend it all on reckless living.

334
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:39,180
 The nice apartment, the nice clothes,

335
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,740
 the job to get that relationship

336
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,580
 with that hot guy or that hot girl."

337
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:46,340
 Girls, a lot of the ways that this looks like for you

338
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:51,060
 is, well, God, you're clearly withholding from me

339
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:54,700
 because I've been praying for a spouse for three years

340
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,000
 and I'm still single.

341
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,780
 God, you said if I went into a relationship with you,

342
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,380
 you would give me the desires of my heart.

343
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:04,960
 Well, hello, my desires want that man over there

344
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,480
 and he won't even ask me on a date.

345
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,400
 So what do you do?

346
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,620
 You take control.

347
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:13,760
 And the problem is, is when we start to think God

348
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,020
 as a God who withholds your best life now,

349
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:19,820
 when you start to doubt the heart of God,

350
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:22,500
 you will start to trust your own heart.

351
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,720
 And there's a lot of things

352
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,580
 that that will result in in your life

353
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,500
 because the problem with trusting your own heart

354
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,140
 is Jeremiah 17, nine says,

355
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:32,940
 "The heart is deceitful above all things.

356
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,700
 It's desperately sick.

357
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,540
 Who can understand it?

358
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:39,420
 You left to you are a mess."

359
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,020
 And Jesus is showing us that here.

360
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:45,220
 Yeah, sure, for a moment, this guy experienced fun.

361
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:47,740
 Yeah, for a moment, this guy had some money.

362
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:50,700
 Yeah, for a moment, this guy experienced the party life

363
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,580
 and the pleasure, but left to himself,

364
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,180
 where did it take him?

365
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:58,260
 Where did he end up?

366
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:01,620
 This is what thinking that you can take control

367
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:04,020
 and when you think, oh, God withholds

368
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:07,660
 so I should take hold of my plan for my life,

369
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:10,380
 you start to play God, things get really, really bad.

370
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:11,980
 A couple of ways that looks like that you can just go,

371
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:16,280
 man, is my response to God to take control of my own life?

372
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:21,280
 Well, are you someone that obsesses over your plans?

373
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,940
 Like you're like, man,

374
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:24,780
 here's exactly how I want this to go.

375
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:29,620
 Get the degree, get the job, get the girl or get the guy,

376
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:33,180
 have the kids, get the house, get the 401k,

377
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:35,300
 go on the vacations, get the car,

378
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:38,700
 do all these different things, what I want, when I want.

379
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:41,940
 And if anything, if God wants to take any of this from me,

380
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:44,940
 I'll show him, I'll double down on my work.

381
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:49,140
 I'll double down on my fun living because this is my life.

382
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,800
 I wanna live my best life now.

383
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:56,020
 So many of us, whether we realize it or not, want control.

384
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:59,220
 But to think that you have control over anything

385
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:02,640
 in this world is to be in a state of delusion.

386
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:08,900
 COVID, actually this week I saw, this week, two years ago,

387
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,000
 sorry for the PTSD of the trigger,

388
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,520
 like this week, two years ago, we couldn't be here anymore.

389
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,160
 This was the week.

390
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,160
 That's crazy when you think about it.

391
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,300
 But that showed all of us really quickly,

392
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:24,200
 man, our plans, nothing.

393
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,160
 There's nothing.

394
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:31,040
 So why would I want to put all my trust into my plan

395
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,720
 when it can so quickly change?

396
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,640
 This guy left and things were going according to his plan.

397
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,200
 And then look what happens.

398
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:41,520
 It says a famine came into the land.

399
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,760
 Hey, he might can control where he spends his money

400
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:48,400
 or how he gets it, but he can't control the weather.

401
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,260
 He can't control a famine.

402
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:53,840
 He can't manifest it either.

403
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:58,960
 And I wanna quickly just talk about this trend I'm seeing

404
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,520
 where a lot of people think that they can manifest

405
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,180
 what they want in their life.

406
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:06,300
 There's this thing about manifestation

407
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,460
 that I'm telling you you're being deceived

408
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,580
 because no matter how much you name it and claim it,

409
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:12,740
 no matter how much you say, I will have success,

410
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,540
 I will have a pay raise, I will get that car,

411
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,180
 I will have that significant other,

412
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:20,280
 I will have only positive vibes and positive energy.

413
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:24,800
 The Bible says, in this world, you will have trouble.

414
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,260
 Not if you will, because we're a fallen world.

415
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,280
 And so for you to think,

416
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,740
 man, it's up to me to manifest my day.

417
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,900
 It's up to me to manifest my joy.

418
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,540
 It's up to me to manifest who I let in.

419
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:40,580
 No, because if you think that you can manifest

420
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:43,140
 what you want, why did you not manifest COVID away?

421
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,980
 I mean, just help a brother out.

422
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:49,900
 If it works, if your manifestation board works,

423
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,500
 you could have put COVID-19 on there for us,

424
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,700
 but you can't.

425
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:58,040
 And to think that you have control,

426
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:02,180
 it's a state of delusion, none of us do.

427
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:05,780
 The Bible says in James chapter one, verse 17,

428
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:08,780
 that every good and perfect gift is from above,

429
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:11,300
 coming down from the father of the heavenly lights,

430
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:16,300
 who does not change like shifting shadows.

431
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,260
 That's so important that you understand

432
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:20,060
 the reason why we make terrible gods

433
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:22,840
 is 'cause we are changing.

434
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:26,620
 Life around us is changing, circumstances change,

435
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:30,020
 which proves that only God is truly trustworthy

436
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:34,100
 because he is the only one who never changes, ever.

437
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,860
 He is consistent.

438
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:40,020
 His character is the only thing truly dependable.

439
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:43,940
 What I see here is his view of his father, this son,

440
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:46,100
 was that he couldn't trust him.

441
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,060
 And like a lot of us,

442
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,900
 when you try to get control of your life,

443
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,060
 what I think that you are saying with that action

444
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:54,760
 is I cannot trust you, God, so I'm gonna trust myself.

445
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,020
 How's that going for you?

446
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:59,600
 I know for me, when I try to take matters into my own hands,

447
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,220
 it only makes me more anxious

448
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:04,880
 'cause I realize just how much I can't control things.

449
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,780
 You only get more depressed.

450
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:09,860
 You only get more worried and stressed out.

451
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:13,520
 And so the response here to God should be,

452
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,220
 God, I trust you, that if you dress the lilies,

453
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,980
 if you provide the home for the sparrows,

454
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:22,140
 how much more will you clothe me

455
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,020
 and love me and provide for me?

456
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:25,900
 And God is looking for people.

457
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:28,640
 He's looking to trust people with great things

458
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,820
 for those who put great trust in him.

459
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:36,500
 He's looking for people who have faith in his plans

460
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,820
 and say, God, this doesn't look like I thought it would.

461
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:42,980
 God, I didn't think I'd be 28 and single.

462
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:46,580
 God, I didn't think that I would lose my job in 2020

463
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:47,960
 and nothing ever be the same since.

464
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,460
 I didn't think I'd be working from home

465
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:53,800
 and experiencing such loneliness, but I trust you.

466
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:58,540
 Despite what I feel, despite what I see, I trust you.

467
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:02,440
 And watch what he will do with that trust.

468
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,880
 Because if your view of God

469
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,000
 is that he truly is not withholding,

470
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,960
 but he does want to give you life and life to the full,

471
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,060
 it will change your response to him.

472
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,880
 You'll run into hard circumstances

473
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,500
 because you're not operating in fear, but faith.

474
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,840
 You'll climb that next height

475
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,060
 or you'll step into that new situation.

476
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:22,160
 You'll go on that trip to Ethiopia

477
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:25,120
 because you're like, I trust you.

478
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,560
 I'll do what you want.

479
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,980
 I'll leave the job.

480
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,540
 I'll make the change.

481
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:32,780
 I'll have the breakup.

482
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,500
 Whatever you want, I trust you

483
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,000
 'cause I don't believe you're withholding from me.

484
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,380
 I believe that you only want to give me good things,

485
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,740
 that you know what I need before I even ask,

486
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:44,880
 like your word says.

487
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,380
 But this man, his view of God is that he's a withholder,

488
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,620
 that he's untrustworthy.

489
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:53,560
 So his response was to run.

490
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:56,480
 What's crazy, it says,

491
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,620
 he spent it all on reckless living, verse 14.

492
00:20:58,620 --> 00:20:59,500
 When he had spent everything,

493
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,060
 a severe famine arose in that country

494
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,480
 and he began to be in need.

495
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,140
 So he went and hired himself out

496
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,100
 to one of the citizens of that country

497
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,260
 who sent him into the fields to feed pigs.

498
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:11,180
 And he was longing to be fed with the pies that the pigs ate

499
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:13,580
 and no one gave him anything.

500
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:15,820
 There's a quote we say a lot around here

501
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,220
 is that sin will take you further

502
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,580
 than you ever wanted to go.

503
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:22,600
 It'll keep you longer than you ever wanted to stay

504
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,360
 and it will cost you more than you ever wanted to pay.

505
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:29,020
 This man had his best life plan now.

506
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,540
 I see so many people who don't know God

507
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,620
 posting about, man, me living my best life.

508
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:35,580
 You cannot live your best life apart from Jesus.

509
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,600
 You can't, you can't.

510
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,580
 I'm telling you right now,

511
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,720
 you think that's your best life?

512
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:43,220
 No, you're sacrificing good or great for good.

513
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,940
 That's what you're doing.

514
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,880
 'Cause the only life to the full,

515
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:51,080
 the only life in abundance is with Jesus.

516
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:54,000
 And this man shows us what Jesus is saying here

517
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,240
 is so many of us are forsaking the palace

518
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,200
 to sleep with the pigs.

519
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,960
 We have found ourself leaving all that God has had for us

520
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:07,680
 for some pigs, for people who don't wanna make you better,

521
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,560
 for people who want to see you fail,

522
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,760
 for people who want you to be miserable like they are.

523
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,720
 They want that for you.

524
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,980
 You know who wants that more than them?

525
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,160
 The enemy.

526
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,560
 He wants to see your life destroyed.

527
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,840
 And so he's gonna convince you that,

528
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,800
 yeah, take your own life, take your own plan of action.

529
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,680
 You got this, you do you, boo.

530
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,160
 You form your own truth.

531
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,560
 You love who you wanna love.

532
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,580
 You live how you wanna live.

533
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:28,960
 There's no absolute truth.

534
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,200
 God's word isn't good.

535
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,320
 It contradicts your life.

536
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,280
 You do you.

537
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,040
 And now you found yourself further

538
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,440
 than you ever wanted to go.

539
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,760
 And you've left the palace, the abundant life

540
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,760
 for some pigs, for your sin.

541
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,800
 And I'm here to tell you

542
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,840
 that if you would change your view of God,

543
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,640
 if you would trust him with your life and go,

544
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,120
 God, even when it feels like

545
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,480
 you're withholding something from me,

546
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,840
 I'm choosing to hold on to what is true.

547
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,620
 And I'm choosing to hold on to you, Jesus.

548
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:56,440
 It will change everything about how you respond

549
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,160
 to him with your life.

550
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:02,140
 And that is when you'll experience your best life now.

551
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:05,680
 The next thing we see here,

552
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:09,800
 false view number two is God the angry judge.

553
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,320
 It says in verse 17,

554
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,200
 "But when he came to himself,"

555
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,880
 some of you tonight,

556
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,580
 the only thing that you need to understand

557
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:19,980
 is this moment for this man.

558
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:24,680
 He's laying there with pigs, covered in mud,

559
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:28,440
 and he's asking to be fed pig slop.

560
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:33,880
 And then he remembers his life with his dad.

561
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,960
 And he just has this aha moment

562
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,680
 where it's like scales fall off his eyes.

563
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,440
 And he's like, man, what am I doing?

564
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,960
 And he came to his senses.

565
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,660
 He let go of his pride.

566
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:52,360
 And he saw his father and he remembered.

567
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,240
 And he came to his senses.

568
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,040
 Some of you tonight,

569
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,760
 you need to simply wake up.

570
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,960
 You need to realize,

571
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:02,440
 you need to look at your circumstances.

572
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,720
 Remember how your parents raised you.

573
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,480
 Some of you, your parents miss you.

574
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,020
 Your parents miss you.

575
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,800
 You're not who they raised you to be, and you know it.

576
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,400
 And you need to come to your senses.

577
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,760
 Some of you, your God misses you.

578
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,600
 And he sees you.

579
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,160
 He remembers when you were 12,

580
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,280
 when you made that decision to give him your life.

581
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,680
 And then that thing happened to you

582
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,000
 that led to you making a decision

583
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,420
 and running and running and running.

584
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:29,040
 And he's asking you, he's begging you tonight,

585
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,840
 come to your senses, come back home.

586
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:35,340
 He says, he came to himself and he said,

587
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,960
 "How many of my father's hired servants

588
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:37,940
 "have more than enough bread,

589
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,360
 "but I perish here with hunger.

590
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,600
 "I will arise and go to my father.

591
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,440
 "And I will say to him,

592
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,820
 "Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you.

593
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,980
 "I am no longer worthy to be called your son.

594
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:50,040
 "Treat me as one of your hired servants."

595
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,360
 His false view here is he still saw something wrong

596
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,160
 with his father.

597
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,440
 Because something in him believed,

598
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,840
 because of his actions,

599
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,040
 he had a conditional love with his father.

600
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,880
 Therefore, hey, you know, my dad,

601
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,200
 there's no way because of what I did

602
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,320
 that he'll take me back as his son.

603
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,280
 So maybe he'll take me back as a slave.

604
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,920
 A lot of us are there.

605
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:12,100
 A lot of Christians are there.

606
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:14,160
 Where you stepped into a relationship with God,

607
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,760
 you've acknowledged him as your father.

608
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,260
 You're saying, I am your son and your daughter.

609
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:22,920
 But because of your actions, you're living like a slave.

610
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:26,080
 Here's what this looks like.

611
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:30,040
 God invites every single one of us to feast

612
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,640
 and experience, like I said, life and life to the full.

613
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,400
 He wants you to sit down and he wants you to taste

614
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,880
 and see how good he is

615
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,520
 and experience all of this stuff,

616
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,760
 to drink and have fun and be married

617
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,400
 and experience a life with him.

618
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,840
 He wants to simply be with you.

619
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:48,040
 We create this place because we believe that God wants to be

620
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,500
 with every single one of you.

621
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:53,960
 However, because of your 12-year porn addiction,

622
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,760
 because you're living with your significant other

623
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,920
 and y'all are hooking up all the time

624
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,420
 and you know that's not God's best,

625
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:00,400
 we tell you that all the time

626
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,120
 and you still choose your pleasure

627
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,520
 and your passions over your God.

628
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:07,240
 Because of your pride and your gossip

629
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,040
 and because of your bitterness and your anger,

630
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,240
 because of the thing that happened to you

631
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,740
 that's made you distant from God.

632
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,720
 Yeah, you come here, but you only do it

633
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,880
 because you believe that God still wants you to do something.

634
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,600
 So you're going, what you're communicating is,

635
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,920
 God, I can't come here and be free

636
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,800
 and lift my hands and eat and dine

637
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,120
 and sit at the feast with you.

638
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,720
 I'll come here and I'll serve you.

639
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,600
 I'll do things, I'll prepare a table.

640
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,640
 I'll do all this stuff.

641
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,480
 And God is saying, sit.

642
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,080
 I want you to be with me.

643
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:33,980
 I love you.

644
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:38,900
 But so many of us, we come in here.

645
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,100
 I'll see how this goes.

646
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:45,700
 We come in here and this is how we operate with God.

647
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:48,740
 I'll try, I'll try.

648
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,980
 Let me, we come in here

649
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:53,420
 and our hearts are worshiping like this.

650
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:54,300
 Yeah, we're lifting hands

651
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,460
 'cause we think God wants us to serve him,

652
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,700
 but this is how they are.

653
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:02,660
 We fold our hands in prayer, but this is how we look.

654
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:06,500
 Because something in you still believes,

655
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,820
 God, I'll come back home.

656
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:13,100
 I'll come to church, but you just want me as a slave.

657
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:17,300
 You don't want me as a son because you're an angry judge.

658
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,380
 That's your view of God.

659
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:20,540
 I don't know what dictated that view for you.

660
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:22,460
 I don't know what formed that view of God for you.

661
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:24,660
 Maybe it's because you've only had angry judges

662
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:26,180
 in your life.

663
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:29,160
 Maybe it's because you've only experienced conditional love

664
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,740
 that when you did something bad, you got bad.

665
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:34,340
 Maybe it's 'cause your parents divorced, conditional.

666
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:36,580
 Maybe 'cause your dad left.

667
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:39,260
 Well, if he can leave, how do I know God won't bounce?

668
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:41,180
 Maybe it's 'cause that person cheated on you

669
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:43,940
 when they said they loved you and you were in game.

670
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:46,980
 Something formed a view that you have projected onto God

671
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:49,100
 for far too long and you still believe

672
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,180
 that he's an angry judge, but the Bible says,

673
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:53,940
 "There is now therefore no condemnation

674
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:56,820
 "for those who are in Christ Jesus our Lord."

675
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:59,260
 And I had to believe that this was Jesus' favorite part

676
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:02,780
 of the story because in John, in John, read this.

677
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:04,500
 Jesus says, John chapter eight,

678
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,220
 Jesus replied, "I tell you the truth.

679
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:09,200
 "Everyone who sins is a slave to sin.

680
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,120
 "A slave is not a permanent member of the family,

681
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:15,980
 "but a son is a part of the family forever.

682
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:20,480
 "So if the son sets you free, you are truly free."

683
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,660
 Who was the son of God?

684
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,020
 Jesus.

685
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:26,260
 So I had to think when he's telling this story,

686
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:28,020
 it has to be so personal to him

687
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:30,180
 because he's like, "The reason why you can come

688
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:33,020
 "to the porch and not be like this,

689
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:35,180
 "the reason why you don't have to be a slave,

690
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:39,660
 "the reason why God isn't an angry judge is because,"

691
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:43,020
 Come on.

692
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:45,440
 Come on, JD.

693
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,420
 One down.

694
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:50,020
 Wait for it.

695
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:53,400
 Man, cops ain't playing, y'all.

696
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,780
 Because

697
00:28:56,780 --> 00:29:01,780
 God sent me, knowing you would run from me,

698
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:05,700
 I ran down to you and I took your sin.

699
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:08,340
 I took your punishment.

700
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:12,580
 I took what you deserved and I died for it on the cross.

701
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:13,680
 And then I defeated it.

702
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,500
 I shut it up once and for all.

703
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,740
 I buried it in the grave,

704
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:20,100
 but I defeated it by rising from the grave three days later.

705
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:23,820
 So that way, when the world tells you God doesn't love you,

706
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:26,540
 when your family demonstrates a conditional love with you,

707
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:28,700
 when your shame and guilt try to tell you

708
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,920
 you don't get to come in here and lift your hands freely,

709
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,520
 you can say, "Yeah, I can because of Jesus.

710
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,840
 "I can come and sit at the table because of Jesus.

711
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,860
 "I can feast and dine and simply be with God

712
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:42,280
 "as a son and daughter, not a slave,

713
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,340
 "because my God is not an angry judge.

714
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:48,180
 "He is a God who unconditionally loves me."

715
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:50,140
 And when your view of God is that

716
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:51,920
 he simply wants to be with you

717
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,920
 like a father wants to be with his child,

718
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,840
 when that is your view,

719
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:58,020
 that no matter what you've done because of his son,

720
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:58,900
 when that's your view,

721
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:01,140
 it changes everything about your response.

722
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:05,800
 You now have the courage to come to him in your sin,

723
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,360
 in your darkest moment.

724
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,800
 When you truly have the view,

725
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,760
 when Jesus is saying here,

726
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,000
 if you would understand the heart of your God,

727
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,760
 it would change everything about how you view your past,

728
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:19,140
 mistakes, your sin, everything.

729
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,000
 You're not coming over here

730
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,880
 just sheepishly crawling back going like,

731
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,340
 "Here God, let me give you some cake.

732
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:26,500
 "Here God, let me just serve you."

733
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:29,500
 You understand you have a seat at the table

734
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:33,740
 as a son and daughter, and he's asking you to feast,

735
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:37,080
 but you can't feast in chains.

736
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:42,080
 You can't worship in chains.

737
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,720
 You can't pray and serve and read

738
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,660
 and live life to the full in chains.

739
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:49,420
 And so I'm telling you tonight,

740
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:51,840
 if your response to God is to come in chains,

741
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:56,200
 take them off because Jesus rewrites stories.

742
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:59,560
 Jesus takes away the things that once held you down

743
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,860
 and he sets you free.

744
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:04,780
 Because of Jesus, you are a son and daughter.

745
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:07,600
 That should be your view.

746
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,840
 Your view of God is that he sees you

747
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:10,760
 as a son and a daughter,

748
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,840
 no matter what you've done, you can come.

749
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:16,320
 And this is what he will do.

750
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,480
 Verse 20, "He arose and came to his father,

751
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,100
 "but while he was still a long way off,

752
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:25,040
 "his father saw him and felt compassion."

753
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:29,080
 Some of you tonight need to simply hear that God sees it.

754
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:31,580
 He sees the abortion.

755
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:35,920
 He sees the night you gave yourself away.

756
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,840
 He sees the blackouts.

757
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,560
 He sees the drugs.

758
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:43,360
 He sees you laying there,

759
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:47,480
 contemplating and having a conversation with yourself going,

760
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,440
 would God want me back?

761
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,360
 Can I really serve at a church?

762
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,720
 Like, I know what I've done.

763
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,020
 Like, he sees it all.

764
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:58,400
 And he's looking at every single one of you by name.

765
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,000
 He's looking at me by name.

766
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,680
 Guys, my past is riddled with mistakes.

767
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,480
 I am the least of these.

768
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:08,440
 I am undeserving, the most undeserving.

769
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,640
 In this story, it just, it gets me every time,

770
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,680
 no matter how many times I hear it,

771
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,320
 because I'm reminded that God looks at me

772
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,900
 crawling back to church, crawling back to him,

773
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,840
 going, I'm so sorry, take me as a slave.

774
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,400
 And he feels compassion.

775
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:24,080
 He feels compassion.

776
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:27,000
 A lot of you, it's hard to believe

777
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,920
 because you came back to a person,

778
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,760
 wanted to be met with love,

779
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:34,840
 and they gave you shame and anger and unforgiveness.

780
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,200
 That's not your God.

781
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:39,060
 You do not need to project another experience onto your God

782
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:42,520
 because his love is unlike anything else in this world.

783
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,680
 It's, you can't compare it to anything.

784
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,200
 It's uncomparable.

785
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,600
 It's unimaginable.

786
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,900
 And it keeps going deeper and deeper and deeper.

787
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,340
 The more you trust yourself with him,

788
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:53,660
 it's the best love to ever exist.

789
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:57,160
 And he felt compassion.

790
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,080
 And he ran and embraced him and kissed him.

791
00:32:59,080 --> 00:32:59,920
 The son said to him,

792
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,920
 "Father, I have sinned against heaven before you.

793
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:02,920
 "I'm no longer worthy."

794
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,480
 And the father just says, "Hey, interrupt.

795
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:08,680
 "Servants, bring the robe, bring the shoes, bring the ring.

796
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,640
 "Kill the calf, have the party.

797
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,940
 "It's time to celebrate.

798
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,360
 "My son was gone.

799
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,860
 "My son was dead and he is found.

800
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:16,840
 "He is back.

801
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,160
 "It's time to celebrate."

802
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,320
 And tonight, I'm telling you,

803
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,380
 God's response is the same to you.

804
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:24,280
 If our view of somebody determines our response to him,

805
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,920
 what does this man's response to his son

806
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:29,680
 say about his view of his son?

807
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:33,600
 What is God's response to you?

808
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,560
 By sending his son to run and meet you in your sin

809
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,800
 and in your depravity,

810
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,000
 what is his response to you say about his view of you,

811
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,140
 that you're worth it?

812
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:44,360
 He felt so unworthy to be called a son.

813
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,320
 He says, "You're worth it.

814
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,180
 "I'd die for you.

815
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:47,020
 "You're worth it.

816
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:47,900
 "Just come to me.

817
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,260
 "Let me throw a party."

818
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:51,800
 The Bible says when one repentant person comes,

819
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,120
 the angels celebrate in heaven.

820
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,300
 There's a party being thrown

821
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,840
 for those who will just simply come

822
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,740
 because they believe their view of God says,

823
00:33:58,740 --> 00:33:59,740
 "God, I'm choosing to believe

824
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:01,020
 "that you won't withhold from me.

825
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,380
 "God, I'm choosing to believe

826
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:03,800
 "that you aren't some angry judge

827
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,520
 "who's out to get me because of my mistakes,

828
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,000
 "that you unconditionally love me

829
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,420
 "and you wanna give me my best life with you,

830
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:13,040
 "but you've gotta make the step to come back."

831
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:17,960
 While I was worshiping, I looked down at my wedding ring,

832
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,480
 and this ring is a sign

833
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:23,360
 of my proposed unconditional love for my wife.

834
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:27,060
 And because I'm human, I'm gonna get it wrong.

835
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:29,840
 I know that we're in the honeymoon phase right now,

836
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,280
 and I'm sure in the years down the road,

837
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,800
 I'm gonna do things, I know me,

838
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,780
 I'm gonna do things that she's like, "It's really hard.

839
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:35,920
 "It's really hard."

840
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,200
 (congregation laughing)

841
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,240
 But just like this ring,

842
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,760
 it just continues to keep going and keep going

843
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,680
 and keep going.

844
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,400
 It's not even a reminder of my bad,

845
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:46,000
 but God's good that his love just keeps going

846
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,040
 and keeps going and keeps going.

847
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:51,560
 And it's available for you tonight,

848
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:55,040
 but you have to have the right view of him.

849
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,840
 And if you would focus

850
00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:00,180
 and have the right view of God's unconditional love for you,

851
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:03,760
 and if you would respond to that love,

852
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,420
 it'll change everything.

853
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:06,260
 Let's pray.

854
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:12,000
 God, I ask that you would truly come

855
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,040
 and speak to the person right now

856
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,720
 who has a wrong view of you.

857
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,000
 And would you redirect their view?

858
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,480
 Would you change their vocabulary?

859
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,600
 Would you shift their experience?

860
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,780
 And right now, would they experience you?

861
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:28,000
 Would they understand

862
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,400
 that they are trading the palace for the pigs?

863
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,500
 That they are choosing sin over a savior?

864
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,200
 And when they make the step,

865
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,440
 would they come to their senses?

866
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,120
 And as they are coming back to you,

867
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,880
 maybe timid, maybe ashamed,

868
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:43,960
 would you run right now?

869
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:46,240
 And would you show them the compassion you see

870
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,400
 when you look at them and say, "I've got it.

871
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,200
 "I've sent my son, I've got it."

872
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,840
 And would the response be to celebrate?

873
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:57,040
 For those that have come back to you,

874
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,920
 may we celebrate in this response.

875
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,320
 For those who need to come to you,

876
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,320
 may we respond in this response to you.

877
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:06,260
 In this response, not because

878
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:09,060
 of anything to do with ourself,

879
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:11,200
 but everything, God, everything,

880
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,420
 because of what you've done for us.

881
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:17,780
 We give you this moment.

882
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:22,060
 I give you, God, just these next minutes together,

883
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:24,860
 asking that you would call people back home.

884
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:28,380
 May we respond now, in the name that I pray, amen.
