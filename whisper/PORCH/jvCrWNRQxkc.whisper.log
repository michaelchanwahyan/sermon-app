[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   Oh
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.200]   Man what a crazy day
[00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:13.040]   Just made up. I actually I almost died this morning
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.340]   in a car accident, so this is I
[00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.880]   Actually, that's that's an exaggeration almost killed someone else I
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.400]   You know we were in the process of adopting this girl
[00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:32.960]   This is a 16 year old girl out of the foster system. We've had her in our house for like eight months
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.760]   I love her to death
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.040]   but now I'm teaching her how to drive and
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:44.640]   Man, I've never come so close to killing someone. I mean not like like she was just I mean
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.080]   I'm screaming at the top of my lungs stop
[00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.800]   and just like inches and
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.360]   so
[00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:59.200]   I was almost in prison almost killed a lady almost missed the flight out here, but here I am so God wants to do something
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:06.320]   You know what let me just back up a little bit
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.920]   Just just thinking about my my new daughter if those who don't know I've got seven kids and
[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:17.480]   Yeah, and so this this gal that we're adopting though, and I'm just crazy about her
[00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.040]   The things that God's done in her life
[00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:27.480]   Just from this terrible background and and to see God completely turn her life around
[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.680]   but also
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.720]   Also seeing my 15 year old daughter. You know
[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.760]   ministering to her and
[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:41.760]   Discipling her and they you know they're bunking together and and just even before this gal moved in you know I was talking to my
[00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.160]   15 year old about it. You know and and
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.320]   You know we're at a restaurant or something, and you know she didn't eat anything. I'm like you know what's the matter
[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.800]   She was oh, I'm fasting this week for her. I'm like wow
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.000]   It's just so cool
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.920]   and and I just really believe it's those prayers of this 15 year old girl that transformed this girl's life and
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:10.080]   But but one of the joys for me was at one point the social worker asked you know how long?
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.760]   can she stay here with you and
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.400]   To be able to look into her eyes and and say honey. Don't worry
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:24.480]   You know you you can stay here as long as you want you can be one of my daughters see all the girls
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.920]   You know how I treat my daughters. You can be one of them. I will take you
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:36.240]   Completely have you as one as my whatever is mine is yours like I see you as my girl
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.800]   And and as I was saying that you know I mean it just kind of flowed out of my mouth
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:47.720]   I totally believed that I felt so good saying it. I felt like God was speaking to me at that same moment
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:53.240]   You know like like him just gone Francis. Don't you see that's that's what I say to you
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:58.080]   You know why do you still sometimes have a hard time believing that?
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:03.080]   That he goes. Why do you think you as a human being can look at this girl and say everything?
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.920]   That's mine is yours. I will take you as my own. I'll treat you as one of my daughters
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.000]   Why do you think you can do that? Do you not believe I can do that?
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.240]   Do you not believe that I've said that to you as well as moments where I just it's just a
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:23.680]   Security because I'm I guarantee some of you in this room struggle the way that I have
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:31.520]   Where because of your past because you're your upbringing you may struggle with the security before God where you go wait
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.040]   But I did this but I did this wrong. I did this wrong
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:40.540]   I did this wrong don't I still have to do this rather than really believing his word and him saying no
[00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:41.760]   I'm a good father
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.560]   You know and it was just one of those moments in my life
[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:51.700]   I just felt like God was reassuring me again like don't you see the way you feel towards her and and don't you see how?
[00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.320]   You just want her to believe it because it's true
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:04:00.120]   That's what I say to you, and I just believe God has that message for some of you
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.960]   tonight that that maybe you're just feeling insecure in your relationship with God because
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.760]   There's some lies in your life
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:14.880]   There's some things that you've covered up. There's some things that you've done that no one else in this room knows about and
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:21.800]   Sometimes it's hard to believe because of your upbringing or something to happen in your past that there's this
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:29.460]   Amazing. Holy almighty God that looks at you and says no, don't you get it? I'll adopt you
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:36.360]   You know everything that Jesus has you you you can even have his righteousness and all of his riches
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.720]   It's all you were all so that you would just go wait. There's nothing I did
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.120]   You just chose to love me like that
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:50.560]   Just like this gal. It's like I hardly knew her and yet. There was just something no
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.560]   I love her here it is
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.200]   Man, I saw thank God
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:01.600]   You know for for the law just just I love her. I love my kids. Love all my kids
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:08.360]   Wasn't planning on going there, it's just all from her trying to kill someone today, but
[00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.560]   You know I just the last few years
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:18.240]   I've just been more and more believing that I need to be led by the Spirit wherever I am
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:23.240]   That doesn't mean I don't study. I study this book. I know the passages
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:29.400]   I want to know the Word of God, but I guess I'm less and less into the carefully crafted message
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:34.680]   Where I walk out and I tell some dramatic story. It was a cold night
[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:41.800]   You know, it's just I like I'm just like really is that what I see in Scripture or?
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:49.920]   Or am I just supposed to walk so closely with him and know this word so deeply and turn to a passage
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.440]   Where we all read and just stand in awe
[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.120]   Of the Word of God and that's what I want to do tonight
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:03.180]   But it's a rare opportunity tonight that we have because
[00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:09.600]   Because we have so many children my wife rarely gets to go with me anywhere and
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:13.960]   And the last couple of years
[00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:17.560]   God's been speaking through her
[00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:20.760]   In fact, I even told her a couple of years ago
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:28.840]   I really feel like this next phase of our lives is him wanting her to speak more and more into the lives of women
[00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:33.480]   Because people have heard everything I have to say and I said man. I'll stay home with the kids you go talk
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:42.400]   Because I really believe there's a message and that God's used her in some powerful ways and teaching the Word of God and
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.760]   It's been cool seeing this new gift rise up in her
[00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:51.560]   And so I asked if she would actually come up and share a few words of whatever the Lord lays on her heart and whatever
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:57.520]   Passage the Lord lays on her heart. So if you guys could welcome the former Miss teen, California
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:10.320]   He's so silly
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:17.760]   Well, I like to have a carefully crafted message because getting up here and and
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:26.200]   Trusting the Spirit is hard for me to do but that's what I'm going to do because I do not have anything carefully crafted
[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:28.840]   but I love that I
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:34.280]   could just sit here and read scripture to you and you wouldn't really need anything else beyond that and
[00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:38.880]   the scripture the Lord put on my heart for you guys, there's
[00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:42.400]   Four and I'm trying to figure out which ones to share
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:49.320]   But I want to start with Deuteronomy 30 because lately with a couple of our kids, they've gotten a little busted
[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:51.600]   and
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.600]   anytime your kids
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:57.240]   Get in trouble or do something wrong. It's so hard as a parent
[00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:01.800]   You're trying to find that balance between I've got to punish you and show you that it's not okay to do this
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:07.720]   I also want you to understand the grace of God and that I love you and that I forgive you and that that is
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:09.560]   secure in the midst of
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:11.320]   you were naughty and
[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:13.320]   something's gonna happen now and
[00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:20.080]   So last night I was talking with one of my daughters and I was sharing with her through Hebrews
[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:27.880]   Chapter 12 and I was saying it says it right there all discipline seems painful at the moment, right?
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:33.320]   But to those who have been trained by it it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:37.160]   I'm like, honey. This is just part of your training
[00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:44.320]   it's okay to do the wrong thing to get caught because God loves you and I love you and to be trained by it and
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:50.480]   To learn from that discipline of your parents and ultimately one day. We're not gonna discipline you anymore
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:55.720]   It's gonna be between you and God and that's the part that I worry about for you guys is you're at that
[00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:57.760]   You know your mom and dad they're not
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:00.840]   They're not looking over your shoulder. They're not catching you
[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:03.260]   They're not telling you don't do that
[00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:08.880]   They're not saying no more video games for you because you just lied or you just went onto this website
[00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:10.880]   And you know, you're not supposed to
[00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:14.720]   So, what is it for you guys? It's gonna keep you
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:21.840]   Holy and pure and doing the right thing and I just want to remind you of this scripture in Deuteronomy
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:25.280]   chapter 30 way back in the Old Testament and
[00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:30.120]   I love the title of it says the choice of life and death
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:36.920]   For this commandment that I command you today is not too hard for you. Neither is it far off?
[00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:42.600]   It is not in heaven that you should say who will ascend to heaven for us and bring it to us that we may hear
[00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:43.560]   It and do it
[00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:49.580]   Neither is it beyond the sea that you should say who will go over the sea for us and bring it to us that we may
[00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:53.600]   Hear it and do it, but the word is very near you
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:58.800]   It is in your mouth and in your heart so that you can do it
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:03.120]   See I have set before you today life and good
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.720]   death and evil
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:11.480]   If you obey the commandments of the Lord your God that I command you today
[00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:19.320]   By loving the Lord your God by walking in his ways and by keeping his commandments and his statues and his rules
[00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:26.400]   Then you shall live and multiply and the Lord your God will bless you in the land that you're entering
[00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:29.680]   but if your heart turns away and
[00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:32.280]   You will not hear
[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:36.600]   But are drawn away to worship other gods and serve them. I
[00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:39.960]   Declare to you today that you shall surely perish
[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:43.880]   You will not live long in the land that you are going over to possess
[00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:50.560]   I call heaven and earth to witness against you today that I have set before you life and death
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:53.320]   blessing and curse
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:54.840]   therefore
[00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:56.840]   choose life
[00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:59.480]   That you and your offspring may live
[00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:07.200]   Loving the Lord your God obeying his voice and holding fast to him for he is your life and length
[00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:09.600]   of days I
[00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:14.760]   Love that that's something that should be on your Facebook page right there. I
[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:18.200]   Have set before you it's Deuteronomy 30
[00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:26.360]   Verse 19 I have set before you life and death blessing and curse therefore choose life
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:28.000]   and
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   I just want to ask you today, please
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:37.240]   Choose life the Lord always sets it before you it is a choice and you have to decide who are you living for?
[00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:39.640]   Who do you trust? Who will you listen to?
[00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:44.000]   Will it be the world and the enemy in all of its ways or are you gonna?
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.680]   completely separate yourself and find life and joy and peace and
[00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:53.600]   Trust the Lord your God who has created you who has good works for you to do
[00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:58.040]   Who loves you
[00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:01.800]   That's it
[00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:04.040]   It's all we need
[00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:16.640]   That's funny because I almost interrupted you so that you had more just to say
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:23.680]   You know my wife and I just finished writing a book on marriage called you and me forever
[00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:31.040]   And it's about it's about forever. It's about marriage in light of eternity. It's about what the scripture actually says about marriage
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:33.600]   which
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:39.440]   Scripture doesn't really say a whole lot about marriage. You know we kind of blow it up like oh this whole books about marriage
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:46.640]   There's only a couple verses about marriage and even those verses aren't really about human marriage that are about Christ in the church
[00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:48.640]   And sometimes we just blow it out of proportion
[00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:53.880]   You know because we enjoy it and so we we idolize it
[00:12:53.880 --> 00:13:00.080]   But I I wanted to say a few words. You know as she was up here speaking. I was just thinking about how
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:04.320]   You know for some of you ladies just
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:11.560]   You know Lisa, and I've been married for
[00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:14.280]   21 and a half years now
[00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:19.720]   You know our oldest daughter is yeah, no that's you can clap for that
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:23.120]   Hasn't hasn't been that hard
[00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:26.600]   but we
[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:34.480]   Our oldest is 19. You know so she's in college or youngest is three months old and we've got everything in between
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.520]   and
[00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:39.680]   But I can't tell you I mean
[00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:49.040]   When we got married like I had no idea what it was gonna be like to have someone support me because I never had that
[00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:54.040]   You know a lot of you know my testimony my parents were dead by the time I was in junior high so I never really
[00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:56.800]   had anyone believing in me and
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:00.200]   You know when the scriptures talk about how?
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:04.880]   God made this helper for Adam you know and and
[00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:11.240]   You know it wasn't good for him to be alone. There was something about this completing that happened and and
[00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:14.480]   We had such
[00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:22.000]   Completely radically different upbringings. I mean she was in the perfectly little safe. You know nice little rich neighborhood and
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.840]   Christian parents that were alive she wasn't even allowed to watch Scooby-Doo. You know just like I
[00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:32.880]   Mean she was just your cookie cutter. You know real safe
[00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:39.160]   She wasn't allowed to go you know more than this five mile radius. You know everything was just you know a little princess and
[00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:49.120]   You know and I just came from total freedom just on my own whatever else and and so I
[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:51.560]   Don't know it was just this
[00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:54.120]   This this thing that the Lord brought together
[00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:55.320]   and
[00:14:55.320 --> 00:15:01.600]   and I had no idea what it was gonna be like to have someone believe in me and even want to take her life in a
[00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:04.600]   complete different direction than what she was used to
[00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:11.160]   And just I mean you gotta you gotta understand. I mean we were married for maybe two I think about two weeks
[00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:17.080]   When I looked at her and said you know I've never even thought about this, but I think God wants me to start a church
[00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:22.640]   You know and I think that means I shouldn't take any money from the church
[00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:29.240]   And I think that means you support us. You know like what is that cool like can you just?
[00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:31.720]   you know I
[00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:35.520]   mean ladies think two weeks into marriage and
[00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:40.320]   This guy's going hey, can you support us because I think God wants me to start a church
[00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:43.680]   I don't know if anyone's gonna show up. I just want to do it the right way
[00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:46.960]   I want to do it in our house, so this way I don't care if anyone shows up
[00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:48.880]   I just want to preach whatever is in this book
[00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:54.780]   You know and and for her to rather than to go man. This is not what I dreamt about you know
[00:15:54.780 --> 00:16:00.240]   For her to say you know I married you because I believed God would use you to lead us
[00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:04.840]   And so that's what you think God wants us to do then I'm behind you a hundred percent
[00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:07.720]   And do you yeah?
[00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:09.920]   Do
[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:11.800]   You know what that
[00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:17.480]   Felt like for me and at that time you know as we started this little church, and she's working full-time
[00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:21.600]   suddenly she gets an offer as a recording artist and
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:26.680]   She's offered a contract and she's thinking gosh. This is my dream come true
[00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:33.640]   But I think this is gonna lead us in two different directions and for her to go no. I'm gonna support you
[00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:39.040]   You know I'm like no take it take it. You know and it was just no
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:43.760]   This is what I believe God wants me to do and and you know the decisions
[00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:51.240]   That we've made through the years that have just run completely counter to everything that she was used to
[00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:56.080]   You know of a husband that comes back from Africa and go this I can't live here anymore
[00:16:56.080 --> 00:17:01.400]   You know just going not like it. Just sell everything. I just let's go. Let's look at trailers
[00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:07.760]   Maybe live in trailer park and for her that afternoon not even going to Africa with me going to a trailer park looking
[00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:14.360]   You know with our two kids at that time, and you know it's just crazy crazy stuff
[00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:18.560]   And you know whether it's selling everything and moving to China
[00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:25.920]   You know later on in life or adopting this kid or it's just been this this whirlwind this this
[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:27.960]   crazy crazy
[00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:29.960]   adventure that we've been on and
[00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:32.480]   And
[00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:35.720]   So when she speaks and she speaks to
[00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:41.160]   You know she's always more comfortable just with the women, but I just want you to know
[00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:48.520]   It's not even just the word. She says because obviously that's scripture, but it's a life that she's lived and
[00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:54.260]   In writing the book a big reason why we wrote the book was for singles
[00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:58.520]   Because we said you know people have this weird view of marriage
[00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:04.120]   And I think we're seeing singles getting more and more afraid of marriage
[00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:07.200]   because
[00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:13.040]   Can you think of one person one strong believer?
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:21.880]   Who was radical about their faith, and then they got married and became more radical
[00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:26.380]   Can you even name one person like that
[00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:31.520]   Because usually what happens is people like you you're like
[00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:33.160]   I'll do anything for the Lord
[00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:38.600]   But then you meet someone and you start connecting with them a little bit and and then pretty soon
[00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:41.360]   It's like okay there. Yeah, we can't quite make it to this trip
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:46.400]   We can't quite make it to that Bible study, and then you get married all that first year is supposed to be about us
[00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:51.960]   And so let's just kind of back off and be about us and really spend the first year with us
[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:56.840]   and because you spent the first year with just us you get pregnant and then you
[00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:00.680]   And then what oh we just had a baby
[00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:05.920]   So now we really can't serve because you know God would want us to bond with a little goo goo
[00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:10.440]   You know and and it's like oh, you know let's just spend that first year
[00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:14.200]   And then oh he's learning how to walk learning out and and in this whole
[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:17.360]   Insane mindset that some of you have right now
[00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:22.960]   Was like we don't go anywhere for let's go. Let's go. Let's go suddenly everything
[00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:28.240]   Changes and it becomes inward and safe meanwhile
[00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:30.320]   There's this war going on out there
[00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:35.620]   But you got your nice little house in this gated community and you're putting up soundproof windows
[00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:37.960]   and there's a war going on out there and
[00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:46.400]   And we're prayer is that there would be a new generation that rises up and says man when I read this book
[00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:52.320]   It's not about all once I meet that like that's the goal of Christianity is to meet this person
[00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:56.040]   No, everything what the Bible teaches what it
[00:19:56.040 --> 00:20:03.320]   Emphasizes is how you like in first Corinthians 7 it's great to be single because you're undistracted
[00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:08.640]   And the idea even behind marriages. He's like those who are married should live as though they are not
[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:12.240]   You don't hear that verse preached very often
[00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:15.880]   That was the core of our book. It's like what's he saying?
[00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:21.880]   Why did Paul who say husbands love your wives also say those who are married should live as though they're not
[00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:24.720]   That's because there's something bigger going on than marriage
[00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:32.240]   Okay, and marriage is only to be a picture of a greater marriage. It's gonna come one day
[00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:35.040]   Which is that marriage supper of the Lamb?
[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:38.800]   That's what this book is about and to have a different mindset
[00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:43.880]   We're praying that the new group would rise up that says man if I'm gonna get married
[00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:47.000]   It's only because I believe will be more effective for the kingdom
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:52.720]   We can make more disciples together and if I have kids it's not so that I can have all these cute little pets
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:59.500]   It's the idea is I'm raising up some warriors, you know, I'm raising up some soldiers
[00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:03.720]   I mean, I want my seven kids to change the world, you know, I
[00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:10.240]   Don't you know protect them and keep them here, you know in my house with a helmet. I'm like go, you know
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:15.280]   We're gonna be in San Francisco. I'm put you in the public school. I'm gonna put you downtown, San Francisco
[00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:18.840]   I'm gonna have you talking to bumps. I'm gonna have you multiply
[00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:23.400]   The soldiers so now suddenly it's not just me by myself
[00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:29.760]   But I got someone fighting with me and we're making disciples together and I got seven others that we're raising up
[00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:32.160]   Hey have an influence wherever you are
[00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:38.440]   See, that's what I see in Scripture is that hey those who are married you got to understand the time short
[00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:45.260]   There's something bigger. There's a mission out there that we got to go after and so my prayer
[00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:50.100]   Is that you don't fall into some of this American dream or Christian eyes?
[00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:53.660]   American dream mindset, but you understand look
[00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:59.200]   My thought is Lisa as much as I love her and as much as I've even prayed like God
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:04.300]   I would love it if I died before her, you know, so I'd never have to live without her. Um
[00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:08.340]   As much as I want that I understand
[00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:11.820]   She's gonna die any second
[00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:18.500]   I'm gonna die any second and she's gonna stand before a holy God and my job is all I
[00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:23.380]   Want her to be able to say at the end of my life Lord. I completed the work. He gave me to do
[00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:30.100]   And please understand I'm not saying it's not important to be a dad I'm great dad I'm a killer
[00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:34.900]   I'm literally coach right now. I am a great dad. Okay, I'm not
[00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:40.860]   Diminishing any of that stuff. I'm not saying it's not important to be, you know a great mother
[00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:48.060]   Okay, so don't start tweeting Francis anti-family. I'm not saying that. Hey don't have fun as a couple
[00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:54.340]   There's no one on earth. I'd rather be with but I'm being true to scripture and saying look it's not about us and
[00:22:54.340 --> 00:23:02.220]   When you realize it's not about us and it's about at this mission. It's crazy how you two just end up being together
[00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:07.460]   It's it's it's like the mission trip. I talk about you know, like when you go on a mission trip
[00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:11.060]   You're not thinking about who this is my chance to bond with a bunch of people
[00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:16.020]   No, you're just thinking about the mission. But what happens as you're on mission together
[00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:21.420]   You start loving these people that you never would have hung out with before
[00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:26.760]   But you went on this mission trip together and suddenly it's like man. I love that old lady
[00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:29.660]   I love that little weird 12-year-old. I love this, you know
[00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:35.920]   Because you were doing something together and that's what I found in my family
[00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:38.060]   That's what the book was about. We're like man
[00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:42.660]   It's weird that our family's so close because you don't even try that hard
[00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:48.880]   It's weird that this happens because it's the mission that as we've even let go of the family
[00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:51.180]   it's kind of like when you lose it you find it and
[00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:55.580]   That's my point in that but I I'm
[00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:59.460]   But don't take my word for it. I want to just beg you
[00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:06.860]   Beg you please read this book for yourself if you don't study this book for yourself. I
[00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:16.080]   Don't know what hope there is for you honestly and and here's why I say that
[00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:20.020]   There is so much
[00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:23.940]   False teaching out there right now
[00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:31.660]   There is so much false teaching out there that's why I go man don't even listen to what I'm saying necessarily look it up
[00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:35.500]   See if that's what the real what the Bible really says
[00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:40.140]   I'm not I'm not saying that you've got to be some Hebrew scholar or Greek scholar
[00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:43.900]   but I'm saying some of those supposed scholars are really messing us up and
[00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:48.020]   We're missing the obvious teaching of Scripture
[00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:52.540]   I'm saying just read this book over and over and over
[00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:56.860]   We encourage every everyone in our churches, you know down in San Francisco
[00:24:56.860 --> 00:24:59.820]   We read through the Bible together verse by verse all you know
[00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:04.580]   The whole Bible every year because I want my people reading the word for themselves
[00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:11.180]   I want them to see the power that's in this and I want them to catch what's obvious and what is emphasized
[00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:16.140]   because the Bible says in 2nd Timothy chapter 4 in
[00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:20.420]   Verse 3 it says the time is coming
[00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:24.820]   When people will not endure sound teaching
[00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:29.580]   But having itching ears they will accumulate for themselves
[00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:33.780]   teachers to suit their own passions
[00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:42.140]   Paul tells Timothy look a times coming when people aren't gonna put up with sound doctrine
[00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:48.940]   But because they have these itching ears like they want to hear certain things. They're gonna accumulate for themselves
[00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:53.020]   Teachers to suit their own passions. How do you accumulate?
[00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:55.940]   teachers to suit your own passions
[00:25:55.940 --> 00:26:00.220]   It's about your passion you want something
[00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:07.820]   Listen something I learned in seminary is I can make this book say anything I want
[00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:16.540]   Give me a topic you want to kill rabbits for fun. I will show you how to proof text that
[00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:24.780]   I'll come up with some obscure cultural fact and give you some verb that means
[00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:27.380]   Hop I you know, whatever
[00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:29.500]   I'll
[00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:34.580]   Twist this twist that and you'll and you won't know any better. You don't know Hebrew
[00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:41.540]   This is what I learned in seminary man, I can make this thing say anything and
[00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:45.900]   If you want something to be true
[00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:51.540]   You can find someone with a PhD in Bible to tell you whatever you want to say
[00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:56.740]   Go to the Christian bookstore. You want to get a divorce? I'll find you a book that'll prove to you
[00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:58.740]   It's just totally fine under any condition
[00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:06.940]   You want to ignore the poor I can find you guys that will fight for that and they'll have a doctor before their name
[00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:11.180]   I'm telling you there's so much crafty
[00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:18.380]   Weird false teaching out there that if you are not a student of this book, I really don't know how you're gonna make it
[00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:22.380]   I really don't know how you're gonna get to what is true and what is actually
[00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:24.900]   emphasized in this book
[00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:33.340]   See Paul's talking about the end times here he says in the in the end times it's it's gonna get crazy and
[00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:40.500]   The issue isn't that these scholars are really coming up with these things and that it's really true
[00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:44.340]   The issue is the same issue. It's always been it's about their passions
[00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:50.740]   It's about sin and how sin is gonna creep itself into the church
[00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:54.860]   in fact in in 2nd Timothy 3
[00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:59.780]   He says this he says but understand this
[00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:05.460]   verse 1 that in the last days there will come times of
[00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:08.220]   difficulty
[00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:12.220]   He goes in the last days, which I think most of us believe we're in
[00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:17.260]   The last days he says it's it's gonna be times of difficulty
[00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:21.740]   The the term there some of your Bibles may say terrible
[00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:25.940]   Like there's just gonna be these terrible times in the end
[00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:30.100]   See times are changing
[00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:37.300]   And if you go to other countries you see just how bad it is for believers
[00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:40.260]   And we're heading more and more that way man
[00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:45.220]   It used to be when I grew up here in America. It used to be that I could just go to Sunday school
[00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:49.380]   Right, just go to Sunday school class learn the Bible, you know
[00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:55.420]   and then and then I can go to a youth group and have you know pizza nights and stuff and do good stuff with all
[00:28:55.420 --> 00:28:58.740]   My little Christians in my youth group and then you know
[00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:04.380]   And then after that I can go to a college group and you know go hang out with the cause group and then I can
[00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:10.740]   Go to a singles ministry, you know like this not this massive, but you know singles ministry, you know
[00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:18.020]   And and have something like that then then maybe one day, you know be part of a small group Bible study whether it's singles or
[00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:25.540]   couples or whoever kind of raise our kids and start the process all over again and kind of keep these little safe
[00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:31.140]   Environments going going going going but I think we all know that's not the future
[00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:33.860]   That
[00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:39.220]   It's gonna get hard really hard to take a stand on anything
[00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:41.620]   and
[00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:45.340]   Living in San Francisco. I see the future of Dallas
[00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:50.260]   We're not gonna become more like you
[00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:53.300]   the world's going more and more the
[00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:56.260]   way my city is and
[00:29:56.980 --> 00:30:02.940]   It's it's a scary time the things my kids have to put up with no youth groups gonna help them
[00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:10.380]   The things my kids are going through high school group. It's not enough not even close
[00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:17.540]   They better deeply know this book and the Holy Spirit better be in them
[00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:21.740]   Because you used to be able to live a moral life without the Holy Spirit
[00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:25.100]   It's just because that's the majority of the culture
[00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:30.060]   But now it's like man if you want to live a holy life
[00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:33.940]   Man, it better be coming from within it better be that
[00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:40.700]   Ezekiel miracle where the Spirit of God enters in you and now you're a slave to what is right because everything out there is gonna
[00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:42.700]   bombard you with lies and
[00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:51.700]   What second Timothy 3 is talking about these terrible lot these terrible times he's talking about even inside the church
[00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:57.620]   And you'll see this in the next few verses he explains why it's gonna be terrible verse 2
[00:30:57.620 --> 00:31:00.580]   He says for peeper peeper peeper
[00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:05.020]   Sorry if I English for peeper
[00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:17.180]   Okay for people
[00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:19.820]   I
[00:31:19.820 --> 00:31:29.460]   Love how I can just ruin a moment. Okay, just all on fire like yeah for people
[00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:33.460]   Will be lovers of self
[00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:36.140]   lovers of money
[00:31:36.140 --> 00:31:37.780]   proud
[00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:39.100]   arrogant
[00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:40.460]   abusive
[00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:42.460]   disobedient to their parents
[00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:44.300]   ungrateful
[00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:45.660]   unholy
[00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:47.140]   heartless
[00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:49.140]   unappeasable
[00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:51.300]   slanderous without self-control
[00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:54.820]   Brutal not loving good
[00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:57.780]   treacherous reckless
[00:31:57.780 --> 00:32:00.340]   swollen with conceit
[00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:04.460]   lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God
[00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:10.860]   Having the appearance of godliness, but denying its power
[00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:13.780]   avoid such people
[00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:19.620]   Okay, see even that last phrase, you know
[00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:24.700]   They having the appearance of godliness, but denying its power
[00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:31.460]   They have the appearance of godliness, but they deny its power. He's talking about people in the church
[00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:34.260]   He's not talking about atheists here
[00:32:34.260 --> 00:32:38.860]   Hey, it's all about people who actually claim the name of Christ
[00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:46.900]   But deny the power that Christ can have in an individual denying the power of the Holy Spirit to put to death the deeds of
[00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:47.980]   the flesh
[00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:53.860]   It's like oh you're just stuck with that. Oh you grew up with that. You you can't get rid of that. Oh
[00:32:53.860 --> 00:33:02.460]   You don't have power to change other people's lives, you know, not everyone has a spiritual gift that's gonna change the church
[00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:07.820]   It's this idea of having some form of godliness. It's about the person who goes
[00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:12.440]   Attends the church maybe even calls himself or herself a believer
[00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:20.440]   He's these things are about the church that's why Paul tells Timothy in chapter 4, okay
[00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:22.300]   This is the way it's gonna be in the end
[00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:27.260]   They're gonna look for teachers that'll tell them what they want to hear why it's okay to stay in their sin
[00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:34.660]   They don't really love him. They actually love pleasure. In fact, sometimes they'll go into buildings looking for pleasure
[00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:40.320]   And maybe God's a way that can lead me to that. We've got many churches teaching that today
[00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:46.660]   Hey, if you follow him, you can have this and this and this and this so you're not really after him
[00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:55.260]   You're after the things that you think would please you and he's like a genie who just might give that to you
[00:33:56.460 --> 00:34:04.300]   Paul says this is the way it's gonna be at the end because the truth is that first phrase people will be lovers of self. I
[00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:11.860]   Read one commentary that says that that because right there he names 19 different characteristics
[00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:14.500]   of
[00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:16.500]   people
[00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:22.060]   Of the majority of people and how it's gonna creep into the church those 19 characteristics, but I read one commentary
[00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:26.060]   I love what it said. It says that first one people will be lovers of self
[00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:31.600]   He says that's really the sewer pipe from which all the other garbage flows
[00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:35.780]   Okay, it starts off with being a lover of
[00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:39.300]   Self and
[00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:43.740]   This is a doctrine that has crept into the church
[00:34:43.740 --> 00:34:49.900]   Where I hear I've heard it for years well Bible says love your neighbor as yourself
[00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:52.900]   What if I don't love myself? I
[00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:55.860]   Need to spend more time loving myself
[00:34:55.860 --> 00:35:00.500]   So help me love myself. I don't love myself and
[00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:05.660]   Let's get together and talk about me and how I can love myself more
[00:35:05.660 --> 00:35:12.020]   And the truth is is the majority of people that make those comments really are obsessed with themselves
[00:35:12.020 --> 00:35:14.380]   They can't stop talking about themselves
[00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:20.280]   Let's come over come to my house and talk about my problems and why I don't like me
[00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:25.400]   It's me me me and I'm telling you some of the most
[00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:30.320]   Depressed people are also some of the most self-centered people
[00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:34.680]   It's it's it's this I can't stop thinking about myself
[00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:40.920]   And why things are not working out for me and yet the truth is is
[00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:45.360]   Being a lover of self is actually the opposite of love
[00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:52.800]   When the Bible's emphasis is about loving the Lord your God with all your heart and soul and mind
[00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:55.640]   it's about loving your neighbor as
[00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:58.760]   Yourself
[00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:00.640]   Because the self part is easy
[00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:06.360]   It's just that we can get consumed and I'm telling you any of us who thinks about himself or herself
[00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:08.640]   Too much it's gonna get depressed
[00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:11.880]   Man, if I just stare at me
[00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:18.200]   Now bum myself out I just will
[00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:24.180]   That's not what we're here for. We're here to stare at him and gaze at him and go man
[00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:27.440]   You're gonna adopt me like everything like everything
[00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:33.240]   I just get everything that you gave Jesus like everything Jesus has us. Are you kidding me? That's my feet
[00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:37.800]   That's what we're supposed to stare at man. I love you. I love you. I love you
[00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:42.560]   Man let me let me make a page. It's about you
[00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:46.840]   Rather than a page that's all about me. Look at me. Look at me. Look what I have to say
[00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:54.720]   But in the end times people are just gonna be about themselves loving themselves
[00:36:54.720 --> 00:37:00.760]   See and this is what the Holy Spirit can rescue you from
[00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:04.520]   Listen, I I'm not like
[00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:08.240]   What are you what do you call that
[00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:13.760]   I'm
[00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:16.480]   Not that okay, I'm not
[00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:22.680]   Like distanced oblivious like it's not beyond me what
[00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:26.720]   Not naive
[00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:30.040]   Ignorant beyond that. Yeah, I know but that's not a good word
[00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:34.040]   No, I'm not in denial. No
[00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:38.200]   It's a really easy word
[00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:42.320]   What
[00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:50.680]   Aloof no oblivious. No, it's like when it doesn't touch you like
[00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:57.000]   Immune yeah, okay. Yes
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:09.800]   Thank you people I am NOT
[00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:11.800]   It's not like it's part of getting old no, but I'm not like immune
[00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:28.720]   Just in case you're wondering I'm not immune to
[00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:32.920]   To selfishness, you know to waking up and thinking about me
[00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:40.400]   Right, it isn't it's it's a struggle for all of us you wake up and you think me. What does me want to eat?
[00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:44.600]   What is you know, it's it's just it's me me me. Let me look at me in the mirror
[00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:50.600]   Okay, you know, but these are the things that this is why this is what the Holy Spirit can do for you though
[00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:57.760]   It's it's like he he gives you the power to change that because we grow up man every child
[00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:04.240]   We've had we've had a lot every child we have man. They just naturally think about themselves
[00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:07.960]   Mine, that's one of the first words you guys learn
[00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:10.520]   mine, no
[00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:14.220]   Me. Yeah, you know, it's like
[00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:19.520]   Everyone's was a cater to me, you know, it's just that's the way we are
[00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:24.000]   But you got to understand there is something the Holy Spirit can do in your life
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.920]   Okay
[00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:29.920]   For those of you man, I don't mean to be little, you know
[00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:34.000]   Some of your problems when you just stare in that mirror and you do depress yourself
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:38.320]   You just feel like I'm not matching up. I thought I'd be further along in life. I thought I
[00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:43.760]   This is something the Holy Spirit can deliver you from I
[00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:47.880]   Hate how much I think about myself
[00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:54.440]   But when I seriously pray about it and say God, I just want to think about you, you know
[00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:56.440]   Let me let me just dwell on you. It's work
[00:39:57.360 --> 00:39:59.680]   to think about someone else and
[00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:04.400]   That's why I think sometimes we love it when we're in other countries
[00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:11.000]   I we love these mission trips where we're surrounded with people who who have much deeper needs than us and
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:13.800]   It feels good because you're not thinking about yourself
[00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:18.520]   You're not thinking about what you're wearing in the middle of you know, some village in Africa
[00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:25.720]   You're not thinking about how you look or how you're suddenly consumed with their need you're thinking about other people you're loving
[00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:27.280]   and
[00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:29.200]   There's something so great about that
[00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:35.680]   That's a work that the Holy Spirit wants to do in you where you're just focusing on him and thanking him
[00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:40.440]   Because it's it's that love of self really that does add to everything else in that list
[00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:43.600]   Lovers of money. Why do you love money?
[00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:48.360]   So you can spend it on you because you love you and money is good for you
[00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:51.360]   the lovers of money
[00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:53.640]   They're proud why?
[00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:56.520]   You're thinking about yourself
[00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:59.160]   Arrogant
[00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:05.280]   Abusive why because you're you're you know looking at the other person so you can abuse them
[00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:11.280]   For your own gain, you know, I was told you know, every every man is is either a
[00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:15.680]   Predator or a protector
[00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:19.080]   You're either a predator or a protector
[00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:24.200]   Either preying on women or you're protecting the women
[00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:32.680]   You know, that's what God can change your heart from just you you you abusive why because it's all about you
[00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:37.040]   He can change that's why I sing. That's the sewer pipe that love of self, man
[00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:41.240]   I remember when I was a you know, and like I think it was junior high or high school
[00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:46.520]   Man, this song came out by Whitney Houston. We used to slow dance to it all the time, you know
[00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:49.960]   Just I
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:55.880]   Believe the children are future, you know and that the whole song but but it was called the greatest love
[00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:59.400]   The greatest
[00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:01.480]   You know that one
[00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:06.600]   Love of all it's and and the phrase is learning to love yourself
[00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:10.840]   Is the greatest love of all I?
[00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:13.760]   remember singing that
[00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:19.360]   You know while you're hugging a girl grabbing her. It's just the greatest junior high high school
[00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:22.600]   Silly is before I was a Christian it you know, it's just
[00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:31.300]   It's this whole idea but it's just the same mindset goes in the end times this is the way people are gonna think it's about me
[00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:34.400]   The church is a consumer thing about me
[00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:40.120]   Let me come in and see if I like it what church is gonna please me the most because I love me
[00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:46.640]   You don't come in thinking God's given me a spiritual gift for the common good
[00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:53.960]   To come in and say God, I don't want tonight to be about me. I don't want to walk away. I don't want God
[00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:57.880]   I don't want to walk off the stage and have people think about me
[00:42:57.880 --> 00:43:01.080]   I don't want to walk off the stage and go. Oh good. They liked me
[00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:04.680]   Man, I wanted to be about you
[00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:09.160]   Like how can I how can I show them how great you are?
[00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:12.720]   How can I just show them how great your word is by just reading it to them?
[00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:16.920]   Don't you see all the truth that's coming out of these words. I mean, this is God
[00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:20.440]   He said look, this is the way it's gonna be in the end and it's gonna creep into the church
[00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:24.280]   They're gonna be self-centered they're gonna love themselves
[00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:30.040]   Abusive disobedient to their parents man, that's the norm
[00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:35.280]   Go work in the kids ministry, you know, you'll see
[00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:39.480]   Man, it's crazy the way kids talk to their parents
[00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:42.920]   ungrateful
[00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:52.000]   That's the opposite of a spirit-filled person in Ephesians 5 it talks about how they give thanks to God always in Christ Jesus in every
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:53.600]   situation
[00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:58.000]   Spiritful persons constantly. Oh god. Thank you for this. Thank you for this. Thank you for this
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:03.960]   And you know at the end times everyone's just complain about everything that's wrong
[00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:08.160]   Why can the church be more like this? Why can't my husband be more like this?
[00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:12.200]   Why can't our singles group be more like this? Why can't the preacher be more like this?
[00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:14.320]   Why can't the band be more like this what I?
[00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:16.960]   said just gratitude
[00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:19.400]   God life is great
[00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:26.800]   Everything everything that you own is mine. I'm your child. My whole future is set. Thank you. Thank you
[00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:27.960]   Thank you. Thank you
[00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:33.520]   And now you've given me some sort of spiritual gift where I can use it to bless others and bring them closer
[00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:38.920]   I'm a servant of are you kidding me a servant of God I get to work for him. That's what my life is about
[00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:42.680]   Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you
[00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:46.520]   Be ungrateful
[00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:49.600]   Unholy, I don't think I need to explain that
[00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:52.400]   heartless
[00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:54.400]   Unappeasable slanderous
[00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:59.120]   Then God's not allowed to do this. He's not allowed to punish. He's not allowed to
[00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:06.640]   Saying everything that God's not allowed to do without self-control
[00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:15.440]   Brutal not loving good treacherous reckless swollen with conceit
[00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:18.960]   lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God
[00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:22.480]   Having the appearance of godliness but denying its power
[00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:25.360]   avoid such people
[00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:28.360]   This is what we're up against
[00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:31.320]   This is what you're up against
[00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:37.360]   Some of you may already have children and if you're anything like me you're
[00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:41.920]   Concerned about the future gone man if it's this bad now
[00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:49.920]   Man I could tell you stories of things that my kids have had to go go through in the public school where I just go
[00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:52.280]   You've got to be kidding me
[00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:53.720]   Really?
[00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:55.720]   That's what it's come to already
[00:45:58.240 --> 00:46:03.800]   And others of you that maybe you will get married and have kids you can be freaked out about their future
[00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:09.000]   But this isn't this isn't so that we get terrified of it
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:17.600]   It's so that we're honest about what we're up against and what may creep into the church, but Paul tells Timothy
[00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:23.920]   Chapter 4 2nd Timothy 4 verse 1 but I charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus
[00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:27.480]   Who is to judge the living and the dead?
[00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:35.360]   Okay, he is coming to judge. I know that's not a popular belief anymore that God judges
[00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:37.520]   But I'm saying you really need to read this book
[00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:43.640]   Okay, because you you'll probably get to the second page and go. Oh he killed everyone
[00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:55.280]   And you'll have some Hebrew scholar that'll pick up some other verse somewhere out there at all God's not a good I'm just saying read it
[00:46:56.240 --> 00:46:58.240]   to drown everyone on earth
[00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:04.200]   To kill the firstborn of a whole city
[00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:09.540]   The whole nation the firstborn go I'm gonna do this and he does it
[00:47:09.540 --> 00:47:19.160]   Man did to have the earth open up and just swallow people alive to have snakes come out and and and just you know
[00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:21.240]   Start killing people
[00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:28.720]   To have fire come down from heaven and consume me. I mean read it. It's page after page you're gone, but that's Old Testament
[00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:32.720]   Yeah, cuz by Revelation he really mellows out
[00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:42.880]   He's like a little puppy at the end, huh?
[00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:46.880]   I'm just saying read it
[00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:56.000]   Okay, and here's Paul telling Timothy 2nd Timothy 4 verse 1 I charge you in the presence of God
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:01.320]   and of Christ Jesus who is to judge the living and the dead and
[00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:07.120]   By his appearing and his kingdom preach the word
[00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:11.160]   Be ready in season out of season reprove
[00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:13.760]   rebuke and
[00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:21.400]   Exhort with complete patience and teaching for the time is coming when people will not endure sound teaching
[00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:28.480]   But having itching ears they'll accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their own passions and they'll turn away from
[00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:33.600]   Listening to the truth and wander off into myths as for you
[00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:37.360]   Always be sober minded
[00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:39.440]   endure
[00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:43.160]   suffering do the work of an evangelist
[00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:45.880]   fulfill your ministry
[00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:52.040]   From already being poured out as a drink offering and the time of my departure has come
[00:48:52.040 --> 00:48:56.240]   I love this part. He goes. I've fought the good fight. I
[00:48:56.240 --> 00:49:02.280]   Have finished the race I have kept the faith
[00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:06.960]   Henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness
[00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:09.880]   which the Lord
[00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:13.320]   The righteous judge will award to me on that day
[00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:19.600]   And not only to me but also to all who have loved his appearing
[00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:24.440]   See, why does Paul warn Timothy of all this stuff not to freak him out?
[00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:27.720]   He says this is the way it's gonna be at the end. He goes but not you
[00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:35.500]   Okay, so that's the way everyone else is gonna be but as for you, I mean, I love that phrase
[00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:39.320]   He uses it often. He goes but but but not you but you man of God
[00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:44.560]   This is what everyone else is gonna do but you what are you gonna do?
[00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:50.560]   He goes you you confront it you exhort it you rebuke it you
[00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:55.160]   Patiently just teach it over and over and over do the work of an evangelist
[00:49:55.160 --> 00:50:00.520]   Tell them the truth about the judgment that's coming and he says, you know what and endure the suffering that's gonna come your way
[00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:07.920]   You're gonna suffer and what does Paul say at the end? He says look I've done it Paul says the time I
[00:50:08.520 --> 00:50:10.520]   Don't know how he knew
[00:50:10.520 --> 00:50:12.800]   But somehow he knew
[00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:16.040]   He says the time of my departure has come
[00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:25.280]   That's always puzzled me like housing how he knew maybe it was just the situation was so bad everything else
[00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:28.360]   But he was in so many difficult situations, but I don't know
[00:50:28.360 --> 00:50:32.400]   I've heard of people just kind of knowing at the end that we're close to God. Okay, it's time
[00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:36.560]   Other times I knew I was gonna make it through this time. No, no, it's
[00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:39.240]   Something's confirmed
[00:50:39.240 --> 00:50:46.960]   Just like two months ago I had like what I think might have been a heart attack
[00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:51.840]   I didn't know though like it was one of those things where suddenly, you know, I was in the morning
[00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:54.120]   I'm changing a diaper and I
[00:50:54.120 --> 00:51:00.180]   felt like these hands went inside of my ribcage and like grabbed my lungs like
[00:51:00.180 --> 00:51:06.080]   And I was just like kind of stuck just holding on this table and so much pain and my mind
[00:51:06.080 --> 00:51:09.440]   Just go I think this is what they I've never had any problems in that, you know
[00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:14.040]   So it's just this weird feeling. I don't even know how to describe it. I'm like, oh man. I think this is it
[00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:19.680]   I think this is a heart attack. You know, this is what I hear about and and I can barely breathe
[00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:24.600]   I'm just holding on I'm thinking okay. Do I yell for Lisa? No, I don't wake her up
[00:51:24.600 --> 00:51:28.960]   You know just like like this. I'm just telling you what's going on in my mind
[00:51:28.960 --> 00:51:32.720]   You know, I wasn't afraid but I just I remember thinking
[00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:39.560]   This might be it but that doesn't seem like this is how I would go
[00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:44.080]   You know, I seriously thought that cuz I thought about this past I thought
[00:51:44.080 --> 00:51:51.480]   Really after everything he's shown me. I'm gonna die changing a diaper, you know, like it just didn't fit, you know
[00:51:51.480 --> 00:51:55.440]   But you know, I I came out of experience, you know
[00:51:55.440 --> 00:52:00.220]   I did the treadmill thing and all that others all the stress tests and that we still don't know what happened. But
[00:52:01.040 --> 00:52:07.080]   What's so cool is to not fear death, you know, it's just kind of one of those things like death has lost its sting
[00:52:07.080 --> 00:52:12.440]   It's just cool. It's like well, maybe this is it but it'd be weird if this is it
[00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:16.620]   I thought it'd be more dramatic than you know, like I want to go out like something cool
[00:52:16.620 --> 00:52:25.500]   You know, but but Paul somehow knew he goes this is the end but what he says at the end was he goes
[00:52:25.500 --> 00:52:27.500]   I fought the good fight
[00:52:29.400 --> 00:52:36.060]   This is a fight you guys okay make no mistake about it. I think we all understand this. I hope we understand this
[00:52:36.060 --> 00:52:40.800]   What Paul was telling Timothy in these last times it's gonna be terrible times
[00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:48.360]   But Paul says I'm done. I did my part. I fought the fight and when you read about what Paul went through it was a fight
[00:52:48.360 --> 00:52:51.080]   And he says I finished the race. I
[00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:58.440]   Did it all and I kept the faith and he says so now I'm just waiting for my award my reward
[00:52:59.160 --> 00:53:04.040]   You know, it's that picture of like when you see in the Olympics, you know someone won their event and
[00:53:04.040 --> 00:53:12.440]   After all the work all the effort they win and now they're just waiting to be on that stand and get their medal
[00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:17.100]   Like you ever see their faces when they just know like that, you know the gymnast, you know
[00:53:17.100 --> 00:53:19.580]   it's just like they know, you know, or the
[00:53:19.580 --> 00:53:22.640]   SaoCao, you know ice skater or whatever and
[00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:24.520]   and
[00:53:24.520 --> 00:53:30.240]   They're about to get their award. You just see their face beaming like this is is everything I ever worked for
[00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:37.800]   Like that's the picture that Paul's painting there. It's like man. This is it. I'm dying. This is it
[00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:44.520]   I I did it. I fought the fight man. I put up with all the and he's telling Timothy look at my face
[00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:50.800]   You know, I wish you could see me right now. It's a these are good times. I'm about to get my reward
[00:53:50.800 --> 00:53:53.740]   Man, I hope this is the goal of your life
[00:53:54.220 --> 00:53:56.220]   you
[00:53:56.220 --> 00:54:01.860]   Know my wife and I were speaking a marriage conference once I'll close with this but she made the comment
[00:54:01.860 --> 00:54:05.160]   She you know, she she says, you know ever watch that show the amazing race
[00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:12.900]   where you know you find a partner and you're just race around the world with all these people and and and she's she just loves
[00:54:12.900 --> 00:54:17.940]   that show because you know, the whole idea is you see the couples that start fighting with each other and
[00:54:18.460 --> 00:54:24.380]   They start losing the races to start yelling each other and and and you know, and they try to get to these checkpoint
[00:54:24.380 --> 00:54:26.380]   I don't know how it works, but you win money at the end and
[00:54:26.380 --> 00:54:33.980]   And she says, you know, I feel like our marriage our life has been like a giant episode of the amazing race
[00:54:33.980 --> 00:54:37.140]   Like we don't have time to fight
[00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:39.340]   Okay
[00:54:39.340 --> 00:54:43.300]   We got to get to the next station and we don't have time to really celebrate
[00:54:43.300 --> 00:54:47.080]   It's like we get to these checkpoints something good happens like high five now
[00:54:47.080 --> 00:54:52.300]   Let's keep going because we're on a mission. We're down here doing something and she says one day
[00:54:52.300 --> 00:54:54.860]   Man, there'll be time to celebrate
[00:54:54.860 --> 00:55:01.500]   There will be time to fall each other's arms and go we did it and fall into our Savior's arms ago
[00:55:01.500 --> 00:55:05.820]   We did it but right now there's a war going on. There's a race going on
[00:55:05.820 --> 00:55:08.700]   and we want to run to win it and
[00:55:08.700 --> 00:55:14.740]   so many people don't have that mindset in life because they're just lovers of self and
[00:55:15.220 --> 00:55:19.600]   They're just thinking about how can I find happiness me me me me?
[00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:25.380]   Rather than focusing on this mission and if we would focus on this mission, we'd see oh man
[00:55:25.380 --> 00:55:28.580]   There's so much pleasure and serving God
[00:55:28.580 --> 00:55:31.140]   It's hard
[00:55:31.140 --> 00:55:36.720]   And there's days you want to quit but there's just something so cool, but ultimately it's about the end
[00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:42.140]   Ultimately it's about being like the Apostle Paul and at the end of our lives going
[00:55:43.340 --> 00:55:45.300]   We did it
[00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:49.460]   We did it and now we're just waiting to see him and get our reward
[00:55:49.460 --> 00:55:56.620]   So here's what I want you to do right now, would you just bow your heads for a second just just close you know
[00:55:56.620 --> 00:55:58.620]   I'm right here. Just close your eyes
[00:55:58.620 --> 00:56:08.660]   Just close your eyes and I just want you to imagine I
[00:56:08.660 --> 00:56:12.520]   Know we can't totally get it
[00:56:13.520 --> 00:56:20.360]   But think of every verse, you know about God and his holiness and dwelling in unapproachable light
[00:56:20.360 --> 00:56:26.160]   Think about that God who says I no one can look at me and live
[00:56:26.160 --> 00:56:30.360]   Think about the angels covering themselves up
[00:56:30.360 --> 00:56:37.000]   Holy holy holy and how one day you're gonna stand before him imagine Paul imagine yourself now
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:39.600]   imagine it's the end and
[00:56:40.320 --> 00:56:44.060]   You are before him
[00:56:44.060 --> 00:56:54.880]   Just picture yourself before God
[00:56:54.880 --> 00:56:56.880]   And
[00:56:56.880 --> 00:57:12.600]   What are you gonna be thinking at that moment
[00:57:20.680 --> 00:57:24.960]   What are you gonna care about as you're about to enter into forever
[00:57:24.960 --> 00:57:26.960]   Forever
[00:57:26.960 --> 00:57:54.080]   Father help us to really understand
[00:57:55.080 --> 00:57:57.160]   the brevity of life
[00:57:57.160 --> 00:58:07.360]   Father I ask you right now by the power of your Holy Spirit. Would you open our eyes?
[00:58:07.360 --> 00:58:15.760]   So we could just get a glimpse of how intense it's going to be when we face you
[00:58:15.760 --> 00:58:24.040]   And when we see you for the very first time, can you just give us a glimpse Lord
[00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:26.400]   So
[00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:35.200]   All the things in the world that we're in love with would grow strangely dim
[00:58:35.200 --> 00:58:46.880]   God I don't know what's going on in this room
[00:58:46.880 --> 00:58:51.640]   Lord, I just pray that you raise up a new generation of leaders
[00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:58.520]   That would focus on the mission and sacrifice whatever they need to
[00:58:58.520 --> 00:59:03.120]   For you
[00:59:03.120 --> 00:59:14.280]   And I got in a room this size there's all sorts of sin going on
[00:59:14.280 --> 00:59:18.560]   That's hidden
[00:59:21.560 --> 00:59:24.720]   And God I'm not asking them to feel guilt right now
[00:59:24.720 --> 00:59:35.160]   I'm asking you by your spirit Lord. Would you show them how beautiful you are?
[00:59:35.160 --> 00:59:40.880]   How much greater you are than all that sin
[00:59:40.880 --> 00:59:46.520]   That they would joyfully let go
[00:59:51.160 --> 00:59:58.600]   I got it. They'd be lovers of you rather than of pleasure or of self
[00:59:58.600 --> 01:00:03.960]   Thank you so much for your word Lord
[01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:10.760]   Thank you so much for your spirit Lord that we don't have to fear Lord. This world is gonna get uglier
[01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:14.320]   God it's okay
[01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:17.520]   Because we have your spirit in us
[01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:21.360]   Will enable us to suffer
[01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:26.000]   Whatever we need to for your glory
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:34.880]   Just look up at me for a second
[01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:40.240]   Just one last thought that came to me as I was praying
[01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:48.040]   You know, I don't know how you usually end things here, but you know, if there's people they can talk to or whatever but
[01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:50.960]   Just that picture of Judas
[01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:55.120]   Came to my mind as I was praying, you know where Judas
[01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:58.760]   betrayed Jesus for 30 pieces of silver and
[01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:02.840]   That picture of him once he was holding the silver
[01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:04.880]   he just
[01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:08.120]   Freaked out and just like threw it in the temple and went and hung himself
[01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:12.080]   And I don't know I'm still confused by Judas
[01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:14.080]   But I think what happens is you know
[01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:21.320]   This happens in life where you think something's so great and then you realize you traded the Son of God for this
[01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:27.480]   And you're holding the silver or whatever it is and going. What did I do?
[01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:30.320]   And
[01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:34.640]   it may really be a bag of silver for you or finances or a
[01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:37.560]   reputation or more
[01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:45.560]   Followers or maybe a guy or a girl and pretty soon you're holding them and going I gave up God for her
[01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:48.640]   for him
[01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:50.680]   for this and
[01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:55.460]   You just go nuts because you maybe you just suddenly get it
[01:01:55.460 --> 01:02:02.840]   And I'm just saying well before it's too late and before it destroys you like it did Judas
[01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:06.640]   Man, I'm saying man let go of it now
[01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:08.040]   and
[01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:10.040]   Maybe there's a reason why you're here tonight
[01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:15.880]   And maybe this is part of your preparation to get your life on a different track
[01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:18.280]   So you are ready to come in the presence of God?
