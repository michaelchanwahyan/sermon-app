[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:19.560]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:27.480]   - How's everybody doing?
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.800]   Good.
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.540]   Good to be here with y'all today.
[00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:36.540]   I appreciate that enthusiasm, that's nice.
[00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.780]   I feel welcome.
[00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.780]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:46.880]   If you don't know me, my name is Trip.
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:47.720]   What?
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.600]   I don't know what you said.
[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.560]   What did you say?
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.660]   I can't decide if I should feel excited or mad or not.
[00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.400]   What'd you say?
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.300]   Okay, I don't think he wants to tell me what he said.
[00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.280]   I'm excited to be here.
[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.740]   If you don't know me, I'm Trip.
[00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.080]   I'm a rapper and I'm also a pastor
[00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.380]   at Concord Church in South Oak Cliff.
[00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.520]   So I love what y'all are doing here.
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.320]   Excited to be able to be here and serve with y'all.
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.120]   And I'm excited to get to preach the word tonight.
[00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.660]   Anybody want to hear from God's word?
[00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.160]   (audience cheering)
[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.460]   See, this is what I do, I pray.
[00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.960]   And then we'll get started.
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.460]   Father, we come before you in Jesus' name.
[00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.800]   Father, there's no other name under heaven
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.040]   by which we can be saved.
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.040]   God, the name of Jesus is all we have to lay claim to, Lord.
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.180]   So we thank you for Jesus.
[00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:38.180]   And we thank you for this time
[00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.760]   when we can hear from you and your word.
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.120]   God, we pray you'd speak to us
[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.520]   that this would be a good use of our time,
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.840]   that you would work in us, Lord,
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.400]   that we can know you more.
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.180]   And we ask this in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.160]   Amen.
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.160]   All right, well, I want to talk this evening.
[00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.960]   I want to talk about fear.
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.840]   I want to talk about fear.
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.600]   And fear is not one of those things that,
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.880]   when you think about preaching a sermon on fear,
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.080]   it's not one of those things where I'm wondering,
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.440]   is this the type of issue
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.040]   that will be relevant to people's lives?
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.840]   Are these the kind of people who have fears?
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.120]   Because fear is a part of all of our lives, right?
[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.120]   There's not a single person in this room,
[00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.960]   you know, if I said, "Hey, if you've never struggled
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.460]   with any fear, raise your hand."
[00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.880]   No one would raise their hands unless they were liars
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.360]   and you need to repent.
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.180]   Fear is a part of all of our lives.
[00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:30.120]   When I think of fear,
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.320]   one of the things I think about is the IRS,
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.580]   because I have a particular situation.
[00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.120]   Stop laughing, let me tell you.
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:43.440]   So because I've been, for most of my life,
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.800]   my main employment has been being self-employed
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:46.620]   'cause I'm a rapper.
[00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.040]   That means that my taxes are not, you know,
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.160]   it doesn't just get taken out of my check, all right?
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.140]   No one pays me a salary, I'm self-employed.
[00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.040]   And so that means that there were some things
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.100]   about my taxes that were a little harder.
[00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.240]   And so me and my wife felt like,
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.040]   "Look, we need to get an accountant
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.240]   so this isn't so stressful and someone to take care of it."
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.400]   This was real early on in my career.
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.040]   So we do that and then we feel like we can relax.
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.680]   We're like, "Good, it's taken care of."
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.940]   Until we started getting notices in the mail.
[00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.680]   Just so you know, if you get an envelope in the IRS,
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.080]   the IRS doesn't write you love letters.
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.200]   So if you get something from the IRS,
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.520]   it's usually not a good thing.
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.160]   And so we would get these notices that would say,
[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.120]   "Hey, you didn't pay this, you owe this.
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.360]   Hey, you didn't pay this, you owe this."
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.640]   And so these things would pop up
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.260]   and we show it to our accountant like,
[00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:36.260]   "Hey, this is your whole job and I need you to do that."
[00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.600]   And they'd be like, "Oh, my bad."
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.160]   And then we'll take care of it.
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.840]   And this kept happening and we had to pay these late fees.
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.000]   And so it was around this time that the spirit of God
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.760]   revealed to me that I needed a new accountant.
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.640]   He said it to me clear as day.
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.280]   And so we got there.
[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.000]   And now, because we've got this new accountant,
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.480]   I got a good accountant, I got a good CPA,
[00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.880]   right, it means that I'm again at a place,
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.040]   taxes are still annoying, but it doesn't mean,
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.160]   it doesn't give the same stress and anxiety and fear.
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.700]   And here's what that shows me,
[00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.360]   is that the exact same situations
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:15.400]   can have a lot less fear depending on whose hands it's in.
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.880]   The exact same situations seem a lot scary
[00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.620]   when it's in the hands of somebody you trust.
[00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.120]   So I wanna talk about fear today.
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.240]   And here's why I think this matters
[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.160]   and we should talk about this,
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.320]   because while fear is a part of all of our lives
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.200]   and it will be, fear doesn't have to rule our lives.
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.840]   Fear doesn't have to be the thing
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.880]   that reigns over all of our decisions,
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.320]   because this is what fear can do.
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.880]   Fear can make us begin to live in a way
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.600]   where we're so afraid of things
[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.280]   that we make all of our decisions based on avoiding
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:48.960]   what we think is a worst case scenario,
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.040]   so that our life becomes about avoidance
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.400]   instead of actually moving forward
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.400]   towards something specific.
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.920]   And when we begin to think about who God made us to be
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.560]   and what God calls us to,
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.520]   he has not called us to live our lives
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:02.920]   just to avoid things we fear,
[00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.600]   he's called us to live actively in a way that honors him,
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.960]   right, and it's in accordance with who he made us to be.
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.880]   And so I want us to be able to do that
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.120]   and to know we can relax if we're in good hands.
[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:18.280]   We're gonna look at Isaiah chapter 41, verse 10.
[00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:19.720]   So if you have a Bible, turn there,
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:20.600]   it should be on the screen.
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.920]   If you don't have a Bible, that is fine.
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:26.880]   Isaiah 41, 10, one of my favorite verses of scripture,
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.600]   and it's in these verses
[00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.320]   that God is gonna speak to us about that,
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.360]   he's gonna give us some promises that he has for us.
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.440]   In this section of Isaiah,
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.840]   Prophet Isaiah is speaking to God's people.
[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.000]   God's speaking to his people,
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.560]   he's comforting them in the midst of captivity.
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.640]   What I want you to pay attention to
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.080]   is how committed God is to his people,
[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:51.040]   how decisive he is, how confidently he speaks.
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.800]   Isaiah chapter 41, verse 10, this is what God's word says.
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:01.600]   It says, "So do not fear, for I am with you.
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:05.760]   "Do not be dismayed, for I am your God.
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:08.460]   "I will strengthen you and help you.
[00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:12.360]   "I will uphold you with my righteous right hand."
[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.200]   I'm gonna read it one more time.
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:17.040]   He says, "So do not fear, for I am with you.
[00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:19.480]   "Do not be dismayed, for I am your God.
[00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:21.880]   "I will strengthen you and help you.
[00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:25.680]   "I will uphold you with my righteous right hand."
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.040]   That's the word of God.
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.600]   And God speaks his words of comfort
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.080]   to his people at the time,
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.200]   and he has these same words for us.
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.920]   And here's what I think the main point is.
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.160]   If you walk away with one thing,
[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:38.960]   this is the main thing I want you to walk away with,
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.360]   it's this, that knowing God
[00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.240]   means we don't have to know fear.
[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:46.560]   Knowing God means we don't have to know fear.
[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.320]   And there are two reasons in the text that we'll look at,
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:52.160]   and we'll start with the first one is this.
[00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:53.800]   The first reason we don't have to know fear
[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.980]   if we know God is God's presence.
[00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:58.980]   Number one is God's presence.
[00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:05.080]   Passage starts by saying, "Do not fear, for I am with you."
[00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:07.080]   Pretty straightforward.
[00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:10.560]   In this book, Isaiah is speaking to a fearful people.
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:13.080]   He's speaking to God's people, the nation of Israel,
[00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:15.880]   when God was mainly working with this particular nation
[00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:17.960]   of people that he was saving.
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:19.560]   And they always had to deal with threats,
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:20.880]   so they were always afraid.
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:23.000]   There were always these nations around them
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.080]   that were threatening to take them out,
[00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:27.440]   threatening to overtake them and destroy them.
[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:32.760]   God had said that these nations definitely would overtake
[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:36.920]   and destroy them if they didn't follow him and obey him.
[00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:39.400]   So they always felt like they were in danger.
[00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:43.320]   In the United States, we live in a kind of security
[00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:46.800]   and a lack of fear about our neighbors always attacking us.
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:47.900]   Israel didn't feel that way.
[00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:49.600]   They always thought an attack,
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:51.440]   them being taken into captivity,
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:52.800]   could be around the corner.
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:57.000]   And Isaiah, the prophet, writes ahead to God's people
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.720]   who will be held in captivity.
[00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:00.520]   They have a lot of reasons to be afraid,
[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:02.240]   a lot of reasons to be insecure.
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.200]   They'll wonder if they can ever be safe again.
[00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:06.360]   They'll wonder if their God is still there,
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:09.600]   and God is kind enough to speak through his servant
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:12.360]   in advance, and God says to his prophet Isaiah
[00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:15.760]   very clearly to them, "Do not fear," or "Don't be afraid."
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:17.200]   And those are the exact same words
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:19.120]   he has to say to us today.
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:22.400]   Right, our situation may look amazing compared to theirs,
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:24.600]   but we don't have to be in danger of attack
[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:26.640]   from other countries in order to be afraid.
[00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:29.280]   We don't have to be carried away from our homeland
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:31.940]   in order to be wrestling with fear.
[00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:35.920]   If I was to ask you, what is your biggest fear?
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:38.580]   What would you say?
[00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:40.720]   What is your biggest fear?
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:45.480]   And I don't mean when you're trying to be super Christian
[00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:46.640]   and someone's like, "Hey, what do you fear?"
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:48.120]   You're like, "I don't fear nothing but God, brother."
[00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:51.640]   Not talking about that, like actual real answers.
[00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:55.040]   Someone forgot to answer questions like humans
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:56.080]   after we got saved.
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:58.680]   Like really, what do you fear?
[00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:02.080]   There's a show, used to be on TV called Fear Factor,
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:03.880]   and the whole premise of this show
[00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:05.600]   was to play on people's fears.
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:07.680]   Whoever made that show was rude,
[00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.560]   but it's called Fear Factor.
[00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:11.640]   And so they would put people through all these crazy,
[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:13.840]   scary challenges to see if you could make it.
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:17.320]   And stuff like sitting just in a pit of rats,
[00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:20.960]   or being trapped in a tunnel with tarantulas,
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:25.840]   or eating goat eyeballs, just like crazy things.
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:27.080]   Some of y'all are just done,
[00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:28.600]   you're not going to hear none of the rest of the sermon,
[00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.440]   you're so distracted.
[00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:32.960]   Many of our fears, though those things sound scary,
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:35.720]   and people signed up for that voluntarily,
[00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:37.720]   but most of those things sound scary,
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:40.400]   but most of our biggest fears aren't things like that,
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.760]   it's stuff like losing a loved one.
[00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:45.560]   Those are the kinds of things that are our biggest fears.
[00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:48.400]   Maybe just being a failure,
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:51.600]   right, failing at the things we strive for.
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:56.400]   Disappointing the ones that love us and depend on us.
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:59.600]   Maybe our greatest fear is people finding out
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:00.840]   who we really are.
[00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:05.160]   We have fears.
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.760]   What would you say your biggest fear is?
[00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:10.120]   We all have these things in our lives,
[00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:13.920]   and it's interesting for God to tell them not to be afraid,
[00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:16.200]   it's interesting when anyone tells you not to be afraid,
[00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:18.160]   because no one really just decides
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:19.360]   that they want to be scared.
[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:20.360]   I mean, when we are afraid,
[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:22.080]   we don't normally think to ourselves,
[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:24.120]   you know what, I could be courageous in this moment,
[00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:26.520]   but you know what, I don't do enough,
[00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:28.320]   be afraid of stuff.
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:29.840]   So you know what, that's what I'm going to do right now.
[00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:32.120]   It's not normally how fear sneaks up,
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:33.800]   it's not a decision we make,
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:37.760]   it's an emotion we feel that we can't just turn off.
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:40.720]   Here's what fear is, fear is when we dread something
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:43.200]   because we think it's a threat to us, right?
[00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:44.440]   Fear is when we're in a situation,
[00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:46.800]   we see something and we think something is a threat to us,
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:48.320]   so we dread that.
[00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:50.760]   So we feel fear when we get a phone call late at night
[00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:51.600]   'cause we're afraid,
[00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:54.480]   we don't know what that call could be about.
[00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:57.440]   We fear when we're driving and someone slams on their brakes
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:01.000]   right in front of us and we almost rear end them, right?
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.520]   We fear we'll get injured, but how about this,
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:06.120]   what if that happens, somebody stops real quick
[00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:08.640]   and you got a slam on your brakes, you're afraid,
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:10.960]   and you got a friend riding with you on the passenger side
[00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:13.100]   and right as you're about to do that, they just do this,
[00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:14.800]   they say, "Don't be afraid!"
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:17.280]   (audience laughing)
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:18.520]   Would that help you?
[00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:21.780]   No, probably not.
[00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:25.040]   That's probably just going to make,
[00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:26.600]   we all got friends and when they ride with you,
[00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:28.060]   they just overreact to everything
[00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:30.520]   and it's like, you almost made me have an accident
[00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:32.000]   by your overreactions.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.120]   Just open the door and roll out if you're going to be like that.
[00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:38.760]   It wouldn't help, just to scream, "Don't be afraid,"
[00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:41.600]   and the reason that wouldn't do anything
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:47.680]   is because, right, this is not the situation at hand here.
[00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:49.480]   You can't just scream, "Don't be afraid,"
[00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:51.080]   but that's what God tells his people
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:53.160]   right here in this terrifying situation.
[00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:54.560]   He says, "Don't be afraid,"
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:55.840]   so what's the difference between your friend
[00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:57.840]   who's not helpful and between God saying it?
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:00.280]   Here's the difference, is that God tells us
[00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:01.840]   why we shouldn't be afraid.
[00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:04.760]   He's not just screaming pointless stuff at us
[00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:06.680]   and this isn't just some random person
[00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:08.200]   telling us not to be afraid.
[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:10.820]   Our friend, it's not someone who can't do anything
[00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:13.400]   about the situation, this is the God of the universe
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:15.320]   who is sovereign over your situation.
[00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:17.520]   This is the God of the universe who already knows
[00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:19.320]   what's going to happen in your situation.
[00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:22.040]   This is not a random friend who's observing
[00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:25.320]   what's happening along with you, this is God.
[00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:27.820]   So that when God tells us not to be afraid,
[00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:30.460]   not only is it different because of who's speaking,
[00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:32.260]   but also because he gives us reasons
[00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.260]   that we shouldn't be afraid.
[00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.080]   'Cause fear isn't just something we can just turn off
[00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:39.240]   like a light switch, but fear dies
[00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:41.920]   when the perception of danger goes away.
[00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:46.920]   Fear can only thrive when the perceived danger seems real,
[00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:48.500]   when the threat seems real.
[00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:50.220]   So God is talking to these people and he's saying,
[00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:51.940]   "Look, I know it looks really bad,
[00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:55.200]   "but I need you to reassess the situation.
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:57.680]   "I need you to rethink about this threat,
[00:12:57.680 --> 00:12:58.680]   "about this in front of you."
[00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:00.200]   I'll give you an example.
[00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:02.680]   A few years ago, I was in D.C.,
[00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:04.220]   I was an elder at a church there
[00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:06.980]   and we were going on this retreat.
[00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:10.640]   They had this thing they called the Elder Olympics.
[00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:12.440]   So we were doing good stuff like prayer
[00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:14.800]   and spiritual things, but we also were just doing fun stuff.
[00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.260]   So they called it the Elder Olympics,
[00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.060]   it's just a way for people to just play some games.
[00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:20.280]   And it was a list of stuff you could sign up for
[00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:22.320]   and I was looking at the list and I was like,
[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:24.480]   I'm only good at, I'm only good at very few things.
[00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:26.960]   I was like, terrible at that, not good at that,
[00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:28.300]   I don't respect people who do that.
[00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:31.520]   I'm going through this list and I see basketball on there
[00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:33.880]   and I love basketball, I'm not great at it,
[00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:37.260]   but I looked around the room, I was like,
[00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:38.260]   I think I got this.
[00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:42.180]   So I signed up for that and I was feeling good.
[00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:46.880]   And then there was another dude named Jeremy
[00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:48.660]   who they were like, "You remember what Jeremy
[00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:49.640]   "was doing last year?"
[00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:50.760]   I was like, "Huh?"
[00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:52.240]   And they just started talking him up
[00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:56.700]   like he was just the second coming of Michael Jordan.
[00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:58.800]   I started to feel fear, I felt confident before,
[00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:01.380]   but now I began to feel fear because I knew about,
[00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:04.340]   I saw something completely differently, I reassessed.
[00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:05.840]   Now we don't need to talk about how it ended up,
[00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:07.640]   we got the point of the illustration.
[00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:12.080]   We're just saying, fear is based on how threatening
[00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:13.940]   something seems to us.
[00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:16.560]   That's how we, that's what decides whether or not
[00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:19.480]   we'll be afraid and what God is doing here to his people,
[00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:21.720]   it's kind of like the opposite of trash talk.
[00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:23.080]   You know what trash talk is?
[00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:26.720]   Like dudes are playing basketball and you know,
[00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:28.580]   you're just trying to get in somebody's head
[00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:29.960]   and you're like, "You ain't going to make this shot.
[00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:31.180]   "You're not good, right?
[00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:32.580]   "You're probably going to lose your job."
[00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:35.880]   Whatever comes to mind, you just try to get in their head
[00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:38.840]   and throw them off their game.
[00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:42.120]   You shouldn't say that on the court, that's too much.
[00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:44.380]   But you're trying to get in their head to throw them off
[00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:46.460]   so they won't be able to succeed, right?
[00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:48.120]   You're trying to say there's bigger threats in mind,
[00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:49.100]   you should be afraid.
[00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:51.220]   What God does here with his people is kind of the opposite
[00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:53.540]   of trash talk where he says, "You are in a really difficult
[00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:56.120]   "situation and I want to whisper things to you.
[00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:58.440]   "I want to say things in your ear that change the way
[00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:00.500]   "you see this threat and I want you to know
[00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:02.460]   "that this threat doesn't have to overcome you.
[00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:05.100]   "You don't have to see this threat in that same way."
[00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:08.000]   God is whispering, in the middle of whatever kind of stuff
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.440]   we have going on that's scary, God is whispering
[00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:13.220]   comforting things to us in our ears to build us up,
[00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:15.740]   to give us what we need to persevere and he's telling us
[00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:19.020]   in the midst of difficulty, reassess the situation,
[00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:20.400]   do not be afraid.
[00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:24.200]   And don't get me wrong, as a pastor, I understand
[00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:26.880]   that in a room this big, there are so many people
[00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:28.840]   with all different kinds of issues going on
[00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:30.800]   and all different kinds of fear.
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:34.320]   We have family issues and health issues and money issues
[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:37.360]   and emotional issues and issues, you know,
[00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:39.560]   you can't figure out whether or not you actually believe
[00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:41.920]   in Jesus or not or whether or not you still believe
[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:45.160]   the Bible and you're afraid of what that might mean for you.
[00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:48.280]   I know there's a lot of different fears,
[00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:51.000]   but God is saying right here, when we are overwhelmed
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.420]   with fear, we should reassess.
[00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:57.400]   And to think about the truth that I don't have
[00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:00.080]   to be afraid, I don't have to live under the tyranny
[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:03.240]   of fear, is a comforting thought.
[00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:04.680]   And I want to know what it would look like
[00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:06.560]   to actually walk in that.
[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:10.760]   So I want you to ask yourself what kinds of scary situations
[00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:12.840]   in your life that you need to reassess.
[00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:16.800]   What kind of things in your life do you need to reassess
[00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:18.720]   in light of who God is?
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:20.200]   Somebody right now might be thinking, though,
[00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:21.600]   they might think, now, true,
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:24.760]   fear is a really natural thing,
[00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:26.760]   so why are you talking about it like it's something
[00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:28.680]   we can just get rid of or as if it's something
[00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:29.880]   that's really bad?
[00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:32.600]   You might say, true, why does the Bible sound
[00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:34.760]   so negative about fear?
[00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:37.080]   Because fear comes up in the Bible a lot.
[00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:40.080]   The command, do not fear, is actually the most common
[00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:41.800]   command in all of the Bible.
[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:43.800]   God is saying this all the time.
[00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:46.000]   Like Joshua 1, 9, where God says,
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.400]   have I not commanded you, be strong and courageous,
[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:50.680]   do not be frightened, do not be dismayed,
[00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:53.180]   for the Lord your God is with you wherever you go.
[00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:56.360]   Bible's always telling people don't be afraid,
[00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:58.760]   but since fear is such a natural response
[00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:01.680]   to difficult situations, why does Scripture talk about it
[00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:04.200]   so negatively, and I'll say this to give you
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:09.200]   the quick answer, is fear can show our lack of trust in God.
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:10.760]   And again, I don't mean just being scared
[00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:11.960]   when you're about to crash your car,
[00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:14.320]   that's a good kind of fear that can save your life.
[00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:15.880]   In that sense, fear is good,
[00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:18.220]   but there are different kinds of fear.
[00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:20.600]   So not every kind of fear is sinful.
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:22.840]   Here's when fear is actually sinful.
[00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:26.080]   Fear turns to sin when it comes from unbelief
[00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:28.520]   or when it leads you to disobedience.
[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:31.400]   Right, so scared you're gonna crash your car,
[00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:32.560]   not sinful fear.
[00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:37.720]   If you're afraid to be honest about your faith in Jesus
[00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:39.800]   because you think someone will look at you differently,
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:42.760]   that would be sinful fear because it has led to disobedience.
[00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:44.360]   If you're afraid,
[00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:49.520]   if you're afraid of not getting that job opportunity
[00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:52.880]   because you don't trust that God could provide for you
[00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:54.480]   any other way or open any other doors,
[00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:56.040]   that would be sinful fear.
[00:17:56.040 --> 00:18:00.440]   Fear turns sinful when it comes from unbelief
[00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:02.240]   or when it leads to disobedience.
[00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:04.680]   So the Bible is calling us not to fear
[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:07.040]   in a way that distrusts God.
[00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:10.480]   We shouldn't fear things more than we fear God.
[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:13.600]   So many of our daily fears
[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:16.920]   do have to do with what other people think, though.
[00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:20.240]   I mean, we think about a lot of the stuff that we fear.
[00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:21.660]   It has to do with what other people think,
[00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:24.660]   and it's because we fear people more than we fear God.
[00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:27.360]   At the end of the day,
[00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:30.040]   the way that what people think of us
[00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:31.480]   matches up with what God thinks of us
[00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:32.880]   and what God has promised us,
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:34.800]   it just looms larger in our minds.
[00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:36.640]   So that even if we would say God is bigger,
[00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:39.200]   we treat those things like they're bigger than him.
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:43.400]   And we pay such close attention to our fears
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:45.040]   because they expose our unbelief.
[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:47.640]   We think God is smaller than the other things
[00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:48.920]   that are facing us.
[00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:49.920]   And here's the thing that happens.
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:52.280]   Our response in a trial or something scary,
[00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:54.120]   it's kind of like an X-ray.
[00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:57.800]   You know, you have an X-ray, something's wrong,
[00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:59.560]   your leg hurts, you go to the doctor,
[00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:02.160]   they can do an X-ray and tell you if something's broken,
[00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:03.600]   and it can come back good, it's all good,
[00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:05.160]   or you can see that there's a fracture.
[00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:07.520]   What our trials do is they expose
[00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:09.600]   what's actually happening in our souls.
[00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:12.120]   The way that we respond in difficult situations
[00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:13.880]   shows what's inside.
[00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:16.560]   There may be this kind of faith
[00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:17.960]   that sees God for who he is,
[00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:21.040]   or there could be a lot of fear in there
[00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:22.960]   that sees God as a lot smaller than others.
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:24.760]   So we should pay attention to our trials.
[00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:26.480]   We should pay attention to our fears
[00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:28.920]   'cause they show us who we really are.
[00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:30.680]   We should do the same thing for one another.
[00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:32.640]   We should pay attention to what's going on
[00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:34.000]   in those tough situations.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.520]   But we want to turn from fear
[00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:37.320]   'cause fear is giving our trials
[00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:39.880]   more credit than they deserve.
[00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:41.360]   Fear is giving our circumstances
[00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:42.720]   more credit than they deserve.
[00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:46.000]   So God says reassess, and he gives them a reason.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.440]   I know you said, "Tripp, you said there were reasons."
[00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:48.800]   Here's the reason he gives them.
[00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:52.240]   Because I am with you, which sounds really nice
[00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:54.400]   to think that God is with us.
[00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:55.640]   Doesn't that sound nice?
[00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:58.720]   God is with us, but what does that really mean
[00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:00.400]   for God to be with us?
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:02.480]   In the Bible, when the Bible talks about God being with us,
[00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:04.200]   it means more than just he's present.
[00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:05.040]   'Cause the Bible's clear,
[00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:08.960]   God is present everywhere at the same time.
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:10.880]   He's always present.
[00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:13.240]   So it must mean more than just that.
[00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:16.000]   Because sometimes somebody just being present
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.640]   doesn't really help that much.
[00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:21.080]   So if you was in school and a bully said
[00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:22.560]   he was going to beat you up and you told the teacher,
[00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:23.720]   and you was like, "He said he's going to beat me up
[00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:25.560]   "at 3.30," and she was like, "All right, I'll be there."
[00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:27.800]   And then she shows up and she watches.
[00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:29.520]   That's not really helpful.
[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:32.160]   It's like you was here, but.
[00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:36.520]   So when God talks about, when he promises that he's with us,
[00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:38.240]   when the Bible talks about God being with us,
[00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:40.400]   it doesn't just mean that he's present.
[00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:42.160]   When the Bible talks about God being with us,
[00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:44.400]   it also means he's going to work on our behalf
[00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:46.280]   according to his promises.
[00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:48.040]   So when the Bible talks about God being with us,
[00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:50.360]   it means he's committed to work on our behalf
[00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:51.560]   according to his promises.
[00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:54.240]   We know that from passages like this, Genesis 39.
[00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:56.640]   It says, "The Lord was with Joseph,
[00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:58.460]   "and he became a successful man
[00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:00.560]   "and was in the house of his Egyptian master,
[00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:02.800]   "the Lord was with him and caused all that he did
[00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:04.160]   "to succeed in his hands."
[00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:07.280]   Jeremiah 1.19, it says, "They'll fight against you,
[00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:09.160]   "but they shall not prevail," why?
[00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:11.680]   "For I am with you," declares the Lord, "to deliver you."
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:13.320]   So when the Lord talks about being with us,
[00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:16.920]   he's saying, "I am committed to you to work for your good
[00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:20.800]   "according to my promises."
[00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:21.800]   He's committed to us.
[00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:23.840]   Now this doesn't mean that God is just going to help you
[00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:25.920]   win every military battle.
[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:28.040]   That's not what that means.
[00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:29.920]   We got to think in terms of God's promises to us.
[00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:33.760]   So you shouldn't just talk crazy to your boss tomorrow,
[00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:35.440]   like, "God is with me though, so I'm good.
[00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:36.680]   "This is not what this is.
[00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:40.160]   "Don't blame me for your termination," all right?
[00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:42.440]   We have to think in terms of God's promises to us.
[00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:43.280]   We have to think about,
[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:44.760]   'cause God made commitments to Israel
[00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:45.760]   that have to do with these battles.
[00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:48.640]   What promises has God made to us
[00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:50.400]   that can remind us what it means
[00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:52.680]   that he's with us in difficult times?
[00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:53.640]   Just to give you some,
[00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:56.160]   God has promised never to leave or forsake us.
[00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:59.240]   So when we have a particular fear about relationships
[00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:02.000]   and we allow those to kind of lord over our whole life,
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.400]   we should remember we have a God
[00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:05.360]   who's promised never to leave or forsake us.
[00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:08.080]   God has promised to give us eternal life.
[00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:10.640]   God has promised to resurrect our bodies.
[00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:13.360]   God has promised to work all things for our good.
[00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:16.400]   God has promised to wipe away all of our tears one day.
[00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:19.160]   God has promised to pour out riches of grace on us
[00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:20.440]   for all of eternity.
[00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:22.360]   God has promised to give us strength
[00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:23.600]   in difficult situations.
[00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:26.200]   God has promised to care for us through his people.
[00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:30.200]   God has promised so many precious things to us.
[00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:33.280]   So when we think about the things that we fear,
[00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:36.000]   when we remember, boy, I have a God who's with me,
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.840]   who's made amazing promises to me,
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:41.320]   that should make us reassess those threats.
[00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:44.960]   There's no way you can go that God won't be with you.
[00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:47.720]   And it's a tough season where we feel like we're alone.
[00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:51.800]   But God is saying he's with us.
[00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:53.040]   He'll never leave us.
[00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:55.800]   Next part of the verse is really similar.
[00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:59.400]   He says, "Be not dismayed, for I am your God."
[00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:00.240]   Right?
[00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:02.760]   So there's a call not to be anxious.
[00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:05.000]   And then he says, "Because I'm your God."
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.080]   You know, there's no end of verse.
[00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:07.160]   He doesn't say, "Don't be afraid,
[00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:08.880]   "'cause you're better than that."
[00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:12.360]   He doesn't say, "Hey, bro, don't be afraid, man up."
[00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:13.880]   These are not the things that he says.
[00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:15.680]   Or, "You got this."
[00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:18.160]   Instead of pointing to you and what you can do,
[00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:21.640]   when God says, "Don't be afraid," he points to himself.
[00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:23.880]   He says, "Don't be afraid, not 'cause you're so amazing.
[00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:26.160]   "Don't be afraid, because I'm with you."
[00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:27.000]   Right?
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.400]   He doesn't say, "Don't be afraid, 'cause you're amazing."
[00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:31.280]   He says, "Don't be afraid, 'cause I am your God."
[00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:34.400]   And it's trust in God that kills off sinful fear.
[00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:37.300]   Faith in God suffocates sinful fear.
[00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:40.480]   How could it not?
[00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:44.400]   And, you know, I don't have enough time to go into this,
[00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:47.680]   but just Isaiah 41 happened right after Isaiah 40,
[00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:49.920]   where God points to all these amazing things
[00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:51.480]   about his character.
[00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:54.640]   Right, where Isaiah is just pointing to how incredible he is.
[00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:56.840]   He's so big, we're like grasshoppers in his sight.
[00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:59.680]   He sits over the circle of the globe.
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:02.160]   Right, the things that seem huge to us are tiny to him.
[00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:04.620]   And right after that, God is saying,
[00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:06.600]   "Don't be afraid, 'cause I'm your God."
[00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:07.900]   And especially the Israelis saying,
[00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:10.140]   "Not those idols of the other nations,
[00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:12.660]   "not the false gods of the other nations.
[00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:13.960]   "They said they're going to help them defeat you."
[00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:16.440]   He says, "Don't be afraid, 'cause I'm your God."
[00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:18.760]   And to us, he may say, "Not the money
[00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:19.840]   "that you've been depending on
[00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:20.920]   "and made the center of your life."
[00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:23.040]   He's saying, "Don't be afraid, 'cause I'm your God."
[00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:24.760]   Not those relationships that you think
[00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:26.080]   are the only thing keeping you afloat.
[00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:29.280]   He's saying, "Don't be afraid, 'cause I am your God."
[00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:31.840]   And so many of us, it's so difficult to survive
[00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:33.000]   in fearful situations,
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.600]   because we've made other things our gods.
[00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:37.440]   We've built our lives on things
[00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:40.640]   that are not strong enough or mighty enough to hold us up.
[00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:43.320]   And God is saying, "I am your God."
[00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:46.560]   And that is a beautiful truth,
[00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:48.960]   because there's no one like our God.
[00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:52.920]   Right, it's scary to remove other things
[00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:54.720]   from the center of your life and to put God there,
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:56.360]   because it's vulnerable,
[00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:58.800]   there's stuff that you like about how things are,
[00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:02.360]   but it's always a good trade-off.
[00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:04.760]   God's stronger than those things.
[00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:06.480]   He's more faithful than those things,
[00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:08.120]   more loving than those things,
[00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:12.240]   and a stronger commitment to us than those things.
[00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:15.240]   God is saying, "Don't be afraid, I'm your God."
[00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:17.680]   Knowing God means you don't have to know fear.
[00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:19.480]   First reason was God's provision.
[00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:22.800]   Very briefly, the second reason was God's presence.
[00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:25.720]   Very briefly, the second reason is God's provision.
[00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:26.920]   God's provision.
[00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:32.360]   When me and my wife got married,
[00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:34.720]   and my wife is here tonight, say, "Hey, Jess."
[00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:35.720]   - Hey, Jess.
[00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:39.080]   - When we got married, a lot of people said,
[00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:41.760]   "Man, your wedding was beautiful, especially the vows."
[00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:43.760]   People just kept saying the vows were amazing.
[00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:46.680]   And I don't think it was because we said anything
[00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:47.800]   especially amazing.
[00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:50.400]   I think just the concept of vows is amazing.
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:52.480]   You're saying all these things that you promised
[00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:56.000]   to do for somebody for the rest of your life,
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.200]   not even knowing what they're gonna be like.
[00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:01.240]   I like you now, what you gonna be like in 10 years, though?
[00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:03.480]   But you're saying, "Look, no matter what,
[00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:08.120]   "richer or poorer, I'm with you."
[00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:10.640]   And this is almost, so the first part
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:13.600]   is almost like God's pronouncement of who he is to us,
[00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:14.560]   I'm your God.
[00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:16.680]   The second part is almost like God's vows,
[00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:18.800]   what he is promising to do for us
[00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:21.240]   based on this relationship he has with us.
[00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:23.040]   The difference is when my vows, when I got married,
[00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:24.040]   I also promised, I said,
[00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:26.200]   and for all the times I failed these things,
[00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:29.080]   I will, I promise to try to repent and do better.
[00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:30.840]   We have a God who's perfectly faithful
[00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:33.000]   and never have to repent and try to do better
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:34.560]   because he will keep them to perfection.
[00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:36.360]   And here's what he vows to do.
[00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:38.120]   He says, "I will strengthen you.
[00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:40.880]   "I will help you.
[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:44.400]   "I will uphold you with my righteous right hand."
[00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:47.360]   What a guy.
[00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:49.800]   These weak people have gotten themselves into trouble
[00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:51.120]   because of their disobedience.
[00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:53.800]   God is saying, "I will help you.
[00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:56.000]   "I'll strengthen you, I'll uphold you."
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.560]   And he's making that promise to us.
[00:26:57.560 --> 00:26:59.120]   And I don't know about you, I really,
[00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:01.000]   I don't always like when people offer me help
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.080]   because I feel like it's implying that I need it
[00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:05.360]   and I don't like to seem like I need help.
[00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:08.440]   Right, so you feel like I'm supposed to take the trash out
[00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:09.960]   and I'm about to do it and my wife reminds me
[00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:12.360]   right before I do it, I'm like, "I was gonna do it.
[00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:15.800]   "I didn't need you to say that, I got this."
[00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:19.080]   It implies that we need help.
[00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:20.520]   Right, it implies that we're weak.
[00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:22.360]   God is implying that we're weak when he says,
[00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:24.640]   "I'll help you, I'll strengthen you, I'll uphold you."
[00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:27.000]   He's implying that we need help, right?
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.600]   That we're weak and need to be strengthened.
[00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:31.200]   That we're about to fall and we need to be upheld.
[00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:35.920]   And look, at different seasons of our life,
[00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:38.720]   more times than others, we are afraid to admit
[00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:41.480]   or acknowledge or see our own weakness.
[00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:44.560]   And it's very hard for us to not give in to fear
[00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:47.160]   'cause all over our lives, when we are determined
[00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:49.120]   to only depend on our own strength,
[00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:51.000]   I just want you to know, if you think your strength
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:52.040]   is gonna get you through everything,
[00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:54.640]   you will live a life full of fear
[00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:56.920]   because you will constantly run into situations
[00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:59.360]   that you cannot possibly get through on your own.
[00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:03.160]   It's okay to admit our own weakness.
[00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:05.440]   And this is one of the hard things,
[00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:08.640]   it's difficult about just beginning to follow Jesus at all.
[00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:09.880]   Right, I know there's some of us here today
[00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:11.680]   who are wondering, "Should I follow Jesus?
[00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:13.040]   "I'm trying to figure this out."
[00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:14.680]   And one of the hard things is you're saying,
[00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:16.360]   "Look, actually, the way I've been doing this
[00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:19.440]   "hasn't been working that well and I need God to show me."
[00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:23.640]   The good news is is that God doesn't only tell us
[00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:25.720]   we're weak, he tells us we're weak
[00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:27.960]   as he promises to strengthen us.
[00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:32.080]   And he's saying, "I'll strengthen you, help you, uphold you."
[00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:34.640]   All of us are weak in different ways
[00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:37.000]   and it helps us to understand, when God does this,
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.120]   it helps us to understand our role in a relationship.
[00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:41.760]   He's the rescuer, we are the damsel in distress.
[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:44.000]   He's the one that swoops in to save the day,
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.400]   we're the ones who need a rescuer.
[00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:48.240]   He's the firefighter coming to put it out,
[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:50.760]   we're the kids inside who need to be snatched.
[00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:55.280]   And God has promised to be with us, right?
[00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:57.640]   So this means something that he'll strengthen us,
[00:28:57.640 --> 00:28:58.960]   this means something for those of us
[00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:01.560]   who feel especially emotionally weak,
[00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:04.160]   who feel like there's a cloud over our heads at all times,
[00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:05.880]   God is saying he will strengthen us.
[00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:07.760]   For those of us who are physically weak,
[00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:09.400]   who struggle to get through our days,
[00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:11.360]   God is promising to help us.
[00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:13.080]   For those of us who are spiritually weak,
[00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:14.520]   aren't even sure where we are,
[00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:16.960]   wondering if we can still believe in Jesus for another day,
[00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:19.040]   God will uphold us, he'll give us what we need
[00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:21.240]   to keep persevering and he's promised it.
[00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:22.840]   And I love how he promises to do it,
[00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:24.720]   he says, "By his righteous right hand."
[00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:26.480]   He doesn't say, "I'm going to send a friend of mine
[00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:27.720]   "to help you."
[00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:29.820]   He doesn't say, "I'm going to send some really strong people
[00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:31.180]   "I know to try to uphold you."
[00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:34.760]   He says, "I will do it with my righteous right hand."
[00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:37.120]   That God is willing to get in the field with us
[00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:38.960]   and uphold us himself.
[00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:43.640]   I mean, this is part of the beauty of the gospel of Jesus.
[00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:47.040]   That when we had sinned against him in such a way
[00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:49.700]   that we were separated from him,
[00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:53.880]   God didn't send angels to die for us,
[00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:58.120]   God put on human flesh and came himself.
[00:29:58.120 --> 00:29:59.440]   He said, "I'll take care of this."
[00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:01.240]   This is part of the beauty of the gospel,
[00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:02.760]   it's part of the beauty of who God is.
[00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:05.360]   And here too, he says, "I will uphold you
[00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:07.780]   "by my righteous right hand."
[00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:12.220]   My wife and I were talking about fear
[00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:14.980]   when I was studying this text.
[00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:17.620]   And we agreed that a lot of times we fear God,
[00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:20.260]   not because we actually think that those things
[00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:23.200]   are bigger or stronger than God,
[00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:24.700]   but a lot of times we fear situations
[00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:27.620]   because we know that even though God is strong,
[00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:29.380]   but sometimes he allows things to happen
[00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:31.620]   that are going to be hurtful.
[00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:33.420]   So it's not enough to say, "Oh, God is stronger,"
[00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:34.780]   because yeah, I know he's stronger,
[00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:37.140]   but sometimes he allows things to happen
[00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:38.260]   that we don't like.
[00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:41.220]   And so just because you believe that God is in control
[00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:44.420]   doesn't mean you're not guilty of sinful fear.
[00:30:44.420 --> 00:30:45.940]   But I want to remind you, God can,
[00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:48.380]   and he will give you the strength that you need
[00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:50.780]   to be able to persevere through that.
[00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:54.780]   If we know God, we don't have to know fear.
[00:30:54.780 --> 00:30:58.380]   And he can work up that trust in him and how good he is.
[00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:00.100]   I wish there were like some magic,
[00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:01.980]   if you're like, "Man, how can I learn to trust God more
[00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:03.260]   "even in the midst of my fear?"
[00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:05.060]   I wish I had like some magic solutions,
[00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:07.940]   like, "Hey, click your heels together three times
[00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:11.260]   "and listen to a Bieber song and you'll be good."
[00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:12.460]   I wish it was that easy.
[00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:16.560]   It's not, but I don't have any magic solutions,
[00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:18.380]   but there are these things that the Bible tells us
[00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:20.060]   about all the time that don't really sound
[00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:21.940]   that special or impressive,
[00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:24.300]   but are the things that scripture sends us to
[00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:25.980]   to build up our trust in God.
[00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:27.740]   One of them is his word.
[00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:29.500]   That's how we see what he's like,
[00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:31.740]   when we look in his word.
[00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:33.380]   And when we look in this book
[00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:36.260]   and we see how time after time after time
[00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:38.120]   he's been faithful to keep his promises,
[00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:41.380]   time after time after time he has gone before people
[00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:43.260]   who seem too weak for the situation,
[00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:45.660]   time after time after time he has blown us away
[00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:47.860]   with his amazing power and grace and love.
[00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:49.860]   When we see that stuff in his word,
[00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:51.540]   this is not just a book full of stories,
[00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:53.100]   this is how we see God.
[00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:56.140]   If you miss your friend, you forget what your friend is like,
[00:31:56.140 --> 00:31:57.780]   you spend time with your friend.
[00:31:57.780 --> 00:32:00.460]   This is not just a book of some good stories to inspire us,
[00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:02.380]   this is where we meet with God.
[00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:05.300]   Well, we're reminded what he's like.
[00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:09.460]   I wanna encourage you also to pray.
[00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:12.980]   I can't tell you the number of times
[00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:15.000]   when something seemed so much bigger than me,
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.080]   but when I was forced to just be quiet
[00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:20.220]   and then just talk to God, I was reminded how big he is.
[00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:24.020]   And I was reminded I get to hand it over to him.
[00:32:24.020 --> 00:32:26.140]   Another thing that helps us with this is other people
[00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:28.820]   who are trying to walk after Jesus,
[00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:30.500]   who are also striving in the same way.
[00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:33.620]   Friends who, it's good to have friends who will say,
[00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:36.580]   "Man, look, I just wanna be honest.
[00:32:36.580 --> 00:32:39.200]   "I think you are sinfully afraid right now.
[00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:40.300]   "And I think you're treating that
[00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:41.700]   "like it's bigger than Jesus."
[00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:44.100]   You need some friends who will say that kind of stuff to you
[00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:46.660]   where you would just be real mad at them that night,
[00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:48.680]   but then you text them like, "You was right, bro."
[00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:50.360]   You need those friends.
[00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:52.580]   So it was only like friends who would just be like,
[00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:54.160]   "You know what, I'm mad too,
[00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:56.180]   "I'm more afraid than you are, bro."
[00:32:56.180 --> 00:32:59.140]   Like we only want friends who will never say anything hard
[00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:00.860]   to us or challenge us.
[00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:02.980]   One of the ways that we're able to be reminded
[00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:04.500]   that God is bigger than our stuff
[00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:06.680]   is sometimes we can't see it and we need friends to say,
[00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:10.660]   "Hey, as a reminder," not in a self-righteous way,
[00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:11.660]   like I struggle with fear too.
[00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:13.600]   Let me tell you what God reminded me the other day
[00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:14.900]   when I was wrestling with fear.
[00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:17.300]   He reminded me that he's much bigger than this.
[00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:20.740]   We need friends like that
[00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:22.760]   to help us wrestle through these things.
[00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:25.020]   If we know God, we don't have to know fear.
[00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:29.740]   And one of the most amazing pictures of this,
[00:33:29.740 --> 00:33:31.020]   that God means this,
[00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:34.560]   because sometimes when God makes a promise like that,
[00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:36.700]   look, you don't have to be afraid 'cause I'm your God,
[00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:38.660]   I'll strengthen you, uphold you, help you.
[00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:41.180]   A lot of times when people make big, grand promises,
[00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:44.460]   we wonder, can I really believe them?
[00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:46.020]   Right, is this the kind of person
[00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:47.540]   that's actually gonna follow through?
[00:33:47.540 --> 00:33:49.860]   Or we might say, "Look, that sounds nice,
[00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:52.380]   "but I need some action to show me."
[00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:54.300]   Well, let me tell you, one of the ways that we know
[00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:56.980]   that this is the kind of God who means it
[00:33:56.980 --> 00:33:58.300]   when he says, "I'm with you,"
[00:33:58.300 --> 00:34:00.040]   who means it when he says, "I will strengthen you,
[00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:01.460]   "I will uphold you,"
[00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:03.460]   the clearest picture of God's strength
[00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:04.900]   in the midst of our weakness,
[00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:08.580]   as we already talked about, is the gospel of Jesus.
[00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:11.580]   The good news, a story about the fact
[00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:13.500]   that we were desperately lost,
[00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:16.300]   there was no way we could get ourselves back to God,
[00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:19.300]   that we are broken, this is why our world is such a mess,
[00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:22.580]   but that God, even though he's the one we sinned against,
[00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:24.460]   said, "I'm gonna put on human flesh,"
[00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:27.780]   and though they were too weak to actually obey me,
[00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:29.620]   you know what, "I'm gonna put on human flesh,
[00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:31.200]   "and I'm gonna show 'em how it's done.
[00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:33.360]   "I'm gonna live the perfect life, I'm gonna love,
[00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:35.360]   "I'm gonna live a life of justice and mercy,
[00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:37.000]   "I'm gonna live a life of forgiveness,
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:38.700]   "I'm gonna show them how it's done,
[00:34:38.700 --> 00:34:40.740]   "and then, even though I live the perfect life
[00:34:40.740 --> 00:34:43.180]   "that deserves rewards,
[00:34:43.180 --> 00:34:45.460]   "I'm gonna take the punishment for them.
[00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:50.520]   "Now, I'm gonna take all the justice that they deserve,
[00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:52.900]   "but put it on me instead."
[00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:54.400]   Right, so sometimes we'll be like,
[00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:56.740]   "Man, but how do I know God loves me?"
[00:34:56.740 --> 00:34:58.340]   The Bible's really clear.
[00:34:58.340 --> 00:35:02.700]   The way that we know God's love,
[00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:04.660]   he displayed his love for us,
[00:35:04.660 --> 00:35:08.460]   and that while we were still sinners, Jesus died for us.
[00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:12.260]   Then it says, "Most people wouldn't even die
[00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:14.820]   "for a righteous man, but God shows his love for us,
[00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:18.540]   "and that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us."
[00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:20.180]   If you're here today and you're wondering,
[00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:23.860]   "I don't know if I'm really convinced
[00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:26.040]   "that I should really lay my life down
[00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:28.180]   "to follow after him, that he's really,"
[00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:32.060]   because these are promises that he has made to his people.
[00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:34.940]   So if we don't know Jesus, if we're not in his family,
[00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:37.480]   these are actually not promises he's made to us,
[00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:39.920]   but God longs to be able to say to you,
[00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:41.660]   "You don't have to be afraid 'cause I'm with you,
[00:35:41.660 --> 00:35:46.340]   "because you're mine, and you can be his now."
[00:35:46.340 --> 00:35:49.020]   You don't even have to wait,
[00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:51.860]   you don't have to say a special incantation,
[00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:53.460]   you don't have to go to a special place.
[00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:56.420]   I mean, you can believe on Jesus,
[00:35:56.420 --> 00:35:59.220]   that he is who he said he is, that he paid for our sins,
[00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:00.820]   that he got up from the grave,
[00:36:00.820 --> 00:36:04.020]   and that he delights to be able to pour grace on you
[00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:04.900]   for an eternity.
[00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:07.220]   And let me tell you, when we're in the family of God,
[00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:09.740]   he just makes beautiful promises like this
[00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:11.280]   to us over and over again,
[00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:13.320]   and amazingly, he always keeps them.
[00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:15.980]   And then sometimes he keeps them,
[00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:18.020]   and we don't even notice, and then like a year later,
[00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:20.100]   he's like, "Man, God is good."
[00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:23.820]   I didn't even think about the way that God cared for me
[00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:24.660]   through these people.
[00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:26.620]   I didn't even think about the way that this hard thing
[00:36:26.620 --> 00:36:28.660]   is something God was using to strengthen me,
[00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:30.440]   just like he promised he would do.
[00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:35.100]   And when we are able to be reminded of the kind of God
[00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:37.480]   we have, the kind of promises that he keeps,
[00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:40.260]   then there's rest.
[00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:43.460]   Rest to know that these scary situations
[00:36:43.460 --> 00:36:45.720]   don't have to rule our lives.
[00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:48.720]   Rest to know that threats that seem big
[00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:50.320]   are not bigger than our God.
[00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:54.680]   Rest to know that God hasn't promised
[00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:56.680]   that those things that scare us won't hurt us.
[00:36:56.680 --> 00:36:58.800]   That's not one of his promises.
[00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:00.880]   But he said, "Even when they hurt you, I'm still with you,
[00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:02.680]   "and I'mma work 'em for your good."
[00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:06.420]   So that even in the toughest situations that hurt a lot,
[00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:07.640]   I know God is with me.
[00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:10.400]   That freedom is available to all of us.
[00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:13.600]   For some of us, it means we need to join God's family,
[00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:15.080]   and grab ahold of those promises.
[00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:18.400]   And for some of us, it means I need to push further in
[00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:21.080]   to know God more so that I can walk in that freedom
[00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:23.760]   he's provided for me in Jesus.
[00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:27.740]   And so, friends, that's what my desire is for you tonight.
[00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:30.580]   And I'm praying that this word,
[00:37:30.580 --> 00:37:32.360]   that knowing God means we don't have to know fear,
[00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:34.140]   would be a reality for you.
[00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:34.980]   Let me pray.
[00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:41.440]   Father, we're so grateful for how gracious you are to us.
[00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:45.760]   Father, that you bring so much strength
[00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:47.720]   where we have so much weakness, God.
[00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:51.820]   That we bring death, but you bring life, Father.
[00:37:51.820 --> 00:37:56.460]   That we bring sin, and you bring righteousness, Lord.
[00:37:56.460 --> 00:38:00.080]   Father, that we bring bitterness and hatred,
[00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:02.180]   and you bring love and forgiveness, Father.
[00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:05.320]   You've shown time and time again that you're willing
[00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:08.040]   to be a strong God to weak people.
[00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:09.600]   And we thank you for that, God.
[00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:12.040]   God, I pray for my brothers and sisters
[00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:14.760]   who are in this room who know you, God,
[00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:17.780]   that you'd help us to know you more,
[00:38:17.780 --> 00:38:19.320]   see you more clearly, Father,
[00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:21.160]   to walk in the freedom that you've given us.
[00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:23.320]   And God, we pray for our friends in here
[00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:24.880]   who don't know you yet or are not sure
[00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:25.920]   that they know you yet.
[00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:29.860]   God, we pray you would show them how good you are.
[00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:34.440]   God, that you'd remind them that this is not,
[00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:36.120]   it's not something that's too good to be true.
[00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:37.160]   This is true.
[00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:38.960]   You are who you say you are, Father.
[00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:41.800]   And that you've been so gracious
[00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:44.160]   that you haven't asked us to clean ourselves up
[00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:45.840]   and to come to you strong already.
[00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:49.040]   You said, "Just come to me weak like you are.
[00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:50.200]   I'll provide the strength.
[00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:51.400]   I'll provide the forgiveness.
[00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:52.760]   I'll provide the good works.
[00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:53.960]   I'll give it all to you.
[00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:58.200]   Just acknowledge, come, and trust."
[00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:02.880]   And so, Father, we pray you'd work that in their hearts, God.
[00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:05.880]   And God, we pray you'd help all of us to know you
[00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:07.560]   and to trust you.
[00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:09.800]   And we ask in Jesus' name, amen.
