[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   [ Music ]
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.720]   >> What's up everybody in the room?
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.440]   Everybody tuning in online.
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.120]   All of our Porch Live locations.
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.880]   I'm going to list those out.
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.560]   Porch Live, Fort Worth, North Houston, Austin, Texas, Midland, Texas, Scottsdale, Arizona,
[00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:47.520]   Boise, Idaho, Tulsa, Oklahoma, Cincinnati, Ohio, Des Moines, Iowa, Indianapolis, Indiana,
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.960]   Greater Lafayette, Indiana.
[00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:57.000]   We are -- not sure what that was, but we are wrapping up this series, his and hers,
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.120]   and finishing up a conversation about dating.
[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.840]   On the topic of dating, this week marks an interesting week for myself and my wife because
[00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.520]   10 years ago this week, we got married.
[00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.360]   Here's a -- yeah, thank you.
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.360]   Thank you.
[00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.400]   Here's a picture of our wedding.
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.680]   JP actually did the wedding.
[00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.960]   It was 10 years ago, fun fact.
[00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.880]   It was the first ever Shane and Shane Porch Christmas concert.
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.240]   So they like popped over there.
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.960]   Shane took his hat off, sang a song, came back over.
[00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:29.960]   It was a blast.
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.000]   We got married.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.080]   And so to celebrate for 10 years, you got to go big.
[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.600]   So I did what any person would do.
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.480]   I booked a 10-year anniversary trip through Costco.
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:43.760]   Okay?
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.440]   Yes.
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.500]   They don't just sell paper towels.
[00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.520]   You can also go to Paris and Rome.
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.480]   Now when I booked this trip, true story, I didn't know quite what to expect.
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.760]   I was basically the guinea pig of this whole operation because I didn't know anyone who
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.360]   had ever done Costco travel before.
[00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.620]   You walk by it if you've ever gone to Costco.
[00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.480]   It's right there in these little pamphlets.
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.480]   And I was like, man, interesting.
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.440]   And I'm kind of a sucker for a deal.
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.600]   And I typed in the price and it was shocking.
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.200]   It was like certainly this is a down payment or something.
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.120]   This is not the entire thing.
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.120]   And it was.
[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.320]   So I didn't know if this was going to be amazing or you get what you pay for and I'm going
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.600]   to have the -- I'm the guy that's telling this story for the rest of his life.
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:28.560]   So on our 10-year anniversary, get this one, I booked a Costco trip and just living with
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.560]   that.
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.560]   But it was amazing.
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.920]   And we went for the last week or a week ago, we went for seven days to Paris and Rome and
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.540]   I'd never been there before.
[00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:43.880]   And so I just went full sin in research mode to make sure we maximized our time.
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.640]   I'm reading books on the city of Rome.
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.760]   They've got podcasts out there that you can download and listen to.
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:57.480]   And I just went full sin to make sure that I took advantage of this one shot we had,
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:03.400]   potentially maybe ever, to see some of the most incredible cities on earth.
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.560]   Now what does that have to do with what we're talking about tonight?
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.800]   Well we're in a series on dating and love and relationships.
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:15.760]   And our hope in heart is to as best we can give you as much information from God's Word
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:24.400]   and truth and wisdom to help you succeed and have one amazing shot at this thing called
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.160]   marriage.
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:33.200]   Which is the point and really what dating is meant to lead you and be a path towards.
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.680]   And so last week we opened up a conversation about the ladies and men, who to date and
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.160]   what she should look like and ladies, who to strive to be and what God's Word has to
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.160]   say.
[00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:49.200]   Tonight we're going to talk about the his and his and hers.
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.560]   Specifically to the ladies in the room.
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.880]   Any ladies in the room tonight?
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:02.440]   Who you should look for as it relates to a potential spouse.
[00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:12.080]   That this is the character and characteristics that you should make required for any guy
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.080]   who is going to date you.
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:18.040]   And what I hope to do in the next 30 minutes is not to be down on the guys at all but rather
[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:24.180]   to paint a picture of men for who to strive to be, who God calls us and I believe in you.
[00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:31.960]   You have got it through God's Spirit, living with God's people, you can be God's man.
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.360]   And I want to paint that picture and look at a passage in 1 Timothy chapter 3.
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.200]   So if you have a Bible you can flip over to 1 Timothy chapter 3.
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.200]   Here's what we know about 1 Timothy.
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.720]   It was written to Timothy by the Apostle Paul.
[00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.560]   And Paul writes and he gives instructions on what the leaders of a church should look
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.720]   like.
[00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.200]   Now what does it have to do with dating and love?
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:57.320]   Well the Bible says that God calls the church his bride.
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:05.240]   In other words, when God says here's the type of men I want to lead my bride, the church,
[00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:12.200]   he gives us really a blueprint for what men in general we should strive for.
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:16.880]   In other words, if this is the type of man that God says is qualified to lead his bride,
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:22.240]   it's also the type of man that can lead you as a bride.
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:27.480]   Or in being and pursuing allows you to be someone worthy of leading a bride, not the
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.320]   church bride but a wife.
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.760]   So we're going to look at six characteristics from this passage.
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.520]   I'm going to read all the way through it and then pull out six different things to strive
[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:44.520]   for to look at what God calls ladies, you to look for in a husband and us as men to
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.640]   pursue and prioritize becoming.
[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:51.880]   So 1 Timothy chapter 3 verse 1 says this.
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.800]   Here is a trustworthy saying.
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:01.760]   Whoever aspires to be an overseer or I may say elder, it's the same word there, it's
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.440]   just a leader within the church.
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.040]   That's all that that means.
[00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.800]   Desires a noble task.
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.000]   That's a good thing.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.740]   Now the overseer or the leader of my bride, the church, must be above reproach.
[00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.400]   He's faithful to his wife.
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.600]   He's temperate, self-controlled.
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.160]   He's respectable.
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.220]   He's hospitable or welcoming and warm.
[00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:27.800]   He's able to teach.
[00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.600]   He knows God's word and he's able to teach it.
[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:37.120]   He's not given to drunkenness, not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome,
[00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.200]   not a lover of money.
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:46.120]   He must manage his own family well, as in he leads his family well,
[00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:49.360]   and see that his children obey him.
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:53.560]   And he must do so in a manner worthy of full of respect.
[00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.560]   If anyone does not know how to manage his own house or his own family,
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.240]   how can he take care of God's church?
[00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:04.560]   He must not be a recent convert or he may become conceited or arrogant and fall
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:07.880]   into the same judgment as the devil.
[00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:12.160]   He must have a good reputation with outsiders.
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:17.480]   That he has a reputation that is positive even among non-believers.
[00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:23.840]   So that he will not fall into disgrace and into the devil's trap.
[00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:27.200]   Now there's a lot of characteristics and really what I want to do is succinctly
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:31.800]   put them into six different criteria that men, whatever and wherever you are
[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:36.880]   at in your journey, today you can start pursuing and becoming.
[00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:40.400]   And so we're going to look at six different things directly from this text
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.720]   as it relates to the type of husband to look for.
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:44.520]   In other words, if you're dating somebody and they don't have these
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:47.440]   characteristics, that should be concerning.
[00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:50.320]   And the type of person that you should allow to date and have a relationship
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.560]   with you, if you're a lady, should have these characteristics.
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.480]   We're going to talk through these six.
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:58.120]   So the first one that you should examine, all six of them are things that,
[00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:02.560]   hey, if you're in the dating time, this is the process of evaluating,
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:08.720]   is this a person I want to continue on this path called dating towards marriage?
[00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:10.320]   And I need to examine these six things.
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:13.800]   The first thing that you need to examine is his commitments.
[00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:15.400]   His commitments.
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:18.080]   Every guy in the room is committed to a lot of different things.
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.800]   Some of them committed to cowboys, Dallas Cowboys.
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.120]   Some are committed to their jobs.
[00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:24.880]   Some are committed to, you know, call of duty.
[00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:28.240]   Some are committed to a myriad of different things.
[00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:35.080]   But specifically, evaluate his commitments to the local church and his commitment
[00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:36.360]   to the covenant of marriage.
[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:37.480]   And I'm going to unpack both of those.
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:40.400]   But the first one, is he committed to a local church?
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:44.240]   The scriptures command that you and I are to be connected to a body,
[00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:46.160]   a local church, not at the porch.
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.520]   The porch is not a church.
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:51.800]   It's a ministry within Watermark, which is our church, my church.
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:56.960]   That you are to be connected to a local church in order so they can control you?
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:03.800]   No, because it's one of God's ways of caring and protecting and caring for you.
[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:06.400]   Are they committed and listening to God's word saying, "Man,
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:08.360]   I'm going to be connected to a local church.
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:10.440]   I'm going to live in community with other guys.
[00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:14.600]   I'm going to walk openly and honestly about where I'm struggling,
[00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:16.320]   where I could use prayer with other guys."
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:23.400]   In Hebrews 13, verse 17, it describes teaching and the role that really elders,
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:27.280]   which Watermark has elders, church leadership, they're to play in caring
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:31.680]   for the people that God has a part of their church community.
[00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:35.280]   It says this, "Have confidence in your leaders.
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:41.160]   Submit, listen to their authority because they keep watch over you as those who must
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.840]   give an account.
[00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:47.360]   Do this so their work will be a joy and not a burden, for that would be of no
[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:47.960]   benefit to you."
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:53.440]   The Bible just said, hey, that at the end of life, at the end when Jesus
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:58.520]   returns in eternity, elders and leaders within a local church are going to give
[00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:05.000]   an account for the people that made up their local church.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.760]   Are you connected to a local church?
[00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:12.040]   It's there that you're going to receive care, accountability, encouragement.
[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:14.960]   One of the greatest sources of blessing to my life, to my wife,
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:21.520]   to our world or my world is my community group that we've been with eight years,
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:24.480]   that we meet every single week, sometimes multiple times a week.
[00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:25.600]   They know where I need prayer.
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:29.320]   They know where I need to improve or do better or love my wife better.
[00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:37.400]   They know the struggles and temptations that I face, and they provide care and are
[00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:39.800]   a source of God's provision.
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:42.160]   If you're dating somebody, and for whatever reason, and there's going to be a
[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:42.960]   lot of excuses.
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.840]   They're going to say, "Oh, you know, I listen to a lot of the podcasts,
[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:49.480]   and I really like to stream church from home, and I like to check out a number
[00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:50.200]   of different churches."
[00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:52.800]   Like, if I was to talk to you down front, you have a reason why you're not
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:53.800]   connected to the church.
[00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:57.440]   It's just not a good one or a biblical one.
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:02.160]   And God says, you and I are to be connected to a local body as a source of
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:05.560]   receiving care, encouragement, and support.
[00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:10.680]   And quite frankly, it allows other people to know you, like really know you.
[00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:12.920]   Like, man, if you came down front and you asked me to pray for you,
[00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:15.800]   I'd love to pray for you, but I don't know you.
[00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:19.040]   I don't know the ins and outs of your life.
[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:23.920]   But here, and at a local church, you can get known and cared for and allow
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:27.680]   other people to see into your life and see, quite frankly, blind spots.
[00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:30.200]   You have, you don't even realize you have them.
[00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:30.840]   It's like this.
[00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:33.760]   When I was 22, for the first time, when I came on staff at Watermark,
[00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:37.360]   I'd never had dental care before.
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:39.280]   So, I never went to the dentist.
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:41.080]   22 years growing up.
[00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:42.560]   I know, it's shocking.
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:45.880]   And I go to the dentist, and it was the first time I was like, "This is cool.
[00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:47.960]   I get to go to the dentist, sit back in this comfortable chair,
[00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:50.600]   and, you know, experience the whole nine yards."
[00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:52.880]   And she comes in, does X-rays, and I'm like, "That's cool.
[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:53.880]   They're doing X-rays."
[00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:56.360]   My mom just, for whatever reason, she was like, "Your teeth are straight.
[00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:57.080]   Get back in the game."
[00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:58.200]   So, that's how we lived.
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:03.440]   And I get the X-rays, and he comes out and says, "Man, your teeth are straight.
[00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:04.560]   That's great.
[00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:08.000]   You have 14 cavities."
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:08.840]   I know.
[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:10.440]   I was like, "What?"
[00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:15.120]   And he begins to ask questions like, "How much soda are you drinking?
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:17.280]   You know, how often are you brushing, flossing?
[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:21.040]   Are you sleeping with candy in your mouth?
[00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:23.280]   What is causing this?"
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:31.440]   And he was able to see an area of my life that due to just habits or not proper
[00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:36.120]   dental hygiene was creating problems and decay.
[00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:40.680]   And in a very similar way, it's inside of the church that not we open up,
[00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:45.360]   you know, your mouth for dental procedure, you open up your life and you allow people
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:53.440]   to speak into and to see the dysfunctional behavior and dating that you have and speak
[00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:57.240]   to it from God's word, not to, you know, shame you or hurt you,
[00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:03.800]   but to care for you, help you, that we benefit from others in our life
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:07.480]   as God's protection and provision of care.
[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:09.960]   The second thing he needs to make sure, and I'm going to move quicker through the
[00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:12.760]   rest of these, is that he is committed to the covenant of marriage.
[00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:14.280]   This is really important, okay?
[00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:16.840]   If you miss everything else that I say and you hold on to this,
[00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:17.880]   it'll be worth your time.
[00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:19.120]   Marriage is not a contract.
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:19.840]   What's a contract?
[00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:22.080]   Do you have a contract with AT&C or Spectrum?
[00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:25.800]   Contract is you give me certain services, and as long as you maintain that,
[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:27.040]   I give you a certain fee.
[00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:27.840]   It's not a contract.
[00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:29.320]   That's not what marriage is.
[00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:31.240]   It's not a commitment.
[00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:32.480]   It's not simply a commitment.
[00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:33.680]   In other words, it's not just, "You know what?
[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:34.640]   I'm committed to this."
[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:37.560]   Marriage, biblically, for Christians is a covenant.
[00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:38.720]   What's a covenant?
[00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:43.600]   A covenant is a relationship that two people voluntarily enter into that only
[00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:46.200]   ends in death.
[00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:52.920]   Is the person you're dating of a mindset that, "Hey, marriage is not something that
[00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:55.960]   we just try, and if it doesn't work, you know, we'll figure something out."
[00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:58.600]   No, marriage is a covenant.
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:01.920]   And when we stand before one another and make crazy promises, you know,
[00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:03.320]   that's what they do at a wedding.
[00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:06.840]   I mean, promises that are extraordinary.
[00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:10.000]   "Hey, I am with you for better or worse, sickness and in health,
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.800]   richer or poorer, whatever comes in front of us until death do us part."
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:17.080]   Are they committed to the covenant of marriage?
[00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:18.800]   How do you know?
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:20.480]   Ready?
[00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:23.600]   You ask them.
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:27.240]   What do you think about marriage?
[00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:30.160]   What do you believe about it?
[00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:33.840]   And if they say, "You know, as long as the person stays in a certain
[00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:38.120]   fitness level and does everything that I want, then I'm married," you run for the
[00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:41.320]   hills and you go red flag, red flag, red flag because they don't understand what
[00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:43.200]   marriage is.
[00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:45.080]   Marriage is a lifelong covenant.
[00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:48.080]   Every couple that I've ever done marriage counseling with or done their wedding will
[00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:51.280]   do two-on-two counseling, and I'll ask the same question.
[00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:57.000]   "Is there any situation in which you would divorce Kyle, you would leave Lisa?"
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.480]   They always say the same thing.
[00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:00.080]   "Oh, no, no."
[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:01.120]   Okay.
[00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:04.360]   If Lisa ends up sleeping with your cousin and runs off to the Himalayas,
[00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:07.600]   you're still in, you're chasing, you're pursuing, you're prioritizing
[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:09.360]   caring for her.
[00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:12.200]   "Well, I mean, if she sleeps with my cousin and goes to the Himalayas,
[00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:13.240]   that's a whole different thing."
[00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:13.720]   Okay, great.
[00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:14.840]   I'm going to write that one down, okay?
[00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:17.320]   We're going to put these in the vows, "Until death do us part," or "Until you
[00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:19.600]   sleep with my cousin and you run off to the Himalayas."
[00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:21.760]   I mean, that's the truth.
[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:25.760]   Grandma's not going to like it on the second row, but that's the truth.
[00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:27.720]   And so, let's be honest.
[00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:30.360]   Is the person you're dating committed to the covenant of marriage?
[00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:33.320]   Jesus in Matthew 19, we don't have time to look at all of it.
[00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:39.720]   He says something and he teaches on marriage, and he says, "It was never meant
[00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:42.520]   to be something that could break.
[00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:45.520]   It's a lifelong commitment."
[00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:52.920]   And it was so breathtaking to the disciples, they said, "If that's the case,
[00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:56.240]   maybe better to not get married."
[00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:59.520]   And Jesus doesn't say, "Oh, no, no, no, no.
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:00.840]   Marriage is amazing.
[00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:01.880]   Yes, it's amazing."
[00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:09.040]   He says, "Everyone who can accept this should accept this teaching."
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:12.840]   It's God's design, this lifelong covenant together.
[00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:14.440]   Is he committed to the covenant of marriage?
[00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:20.120]   Number two, you want to examine his humility.
[00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:21.640]   His humility.
[00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:23.440]   What is humility?
[00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:27.680]   Humility is not thinking less of yourself as though he's always putting himself
[00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:29.480]   down or he has low self-esteem.
[00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:30.680]   That's not humility.
[00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:33.880]   That can actually be pride because it's still focused on self.
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:38.360]   It's not thinking less of yourself, it's thinking about yourself less,
[00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:42.720]   that he's constantly focused and concerned about other people around him.
[00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:44.440]   Is his life marked with humility?
[00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:48.680]   1 Peter 5 says, "Everyone should clothe themselves like you daily get up."
[00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:52.560]   And as my friend says, "I want to wear humility as I walk
[00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:55.280]   into whatever meetings, whatever is in front of me today."
[00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:56.680]   What does humility look like?
[00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:58.480]   It looks like, "I'm going to ask for forgiveness.
[00:16:58.480 --> 00:16:59.760]   I'm going to own my part.
[00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:03.120]   I'm going to move in their direction.
[00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:07.280]   That when I'm wrong, I want to say I was wrong.
[00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:10.880]   I want to have a teachable spirit and not assume that I can't learn."
[00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:14.880]   The Scripture says in this text, it says, "That he must not be a recent convert,"
[00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:17.800]   and he's talking about leaders in the church, "because of the danger of being
[00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:22.840]   conceited or arrogant and falling under the same judgment as the devil."
[00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:28.920]   The devil, we know in Scripture, is the ruler of evil and darkness inside
[00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:31.920]   of this world, but at one point, he was an angel.
[00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:34.360]   Scripture say that he was cast out from heaven.
[00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:37.000]   Why?
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.640]   Well, when he was an angel, he didn't want to worship God.
[00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:42.400]   He wanted to be worshiped as God.
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:45.520]   Pride is the person that you are dating.
[00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:48.760]   Does humility mark their life?
[00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:51.640]   Perhaps of the whole list, this is one of the more important ones,
[00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:55.640]   because without humility, you won't get connected to a church.
[00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:59.160]   Without humility, you're not going to be willing to listen to other people.
[00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:01.320]   Without humility, you're not going to be willing to say, "You know,
[00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:04.320]   I think I was wrong."
[00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:07.200]   Does humility mark their life?
[00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:10.160]   What's interesting, ladies, and let me just pick a little bit on ladies,
[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:20.760]   there is something that consistently women will find themselves attracted
[00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:25.960]   to the arrogant, cocky jerk.
[00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:28.200]   And I don't know what it is, and it's puzzling.
[00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:30.640]   And, you know, you go back through all the way back to high school
[00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:33.840]   and the quarterback that just was all arrogance.
[00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:37.560]   And there's something that ladies can find attractive.
[00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:41.840]   That quality will not be something you find attractive in marriage.
[00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:45.640]   It'll be something that drives a wedge in your relationship.
[00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:49.560]   On the flip side, humility is something that always looks good on everybody,
[00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:50.600]   and will always look good.
[00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:52.760]   In other words, humility, it's the little black dress.
[00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:55.040]   It's the thing you go in, looks good every single time.
[00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:56.840]   In fact, men, let me just say this to you.
[00:18:56.840 --> 00:19:01.880]   If, you know, you got a face made for radio, you can be more attractive today.
[00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:05.160]   Some of you guys are just getting that right now.
[00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:10.760]   You will be more attractive today if you are humble.
[00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:16.760]   You can, man, if you will learn and practice humility overnight,
[00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:21.560]   you are immediately, because humility looks good on everybody.
[00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:23.840]   You need to examine their humility.
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:26.880]   Is their life marked with humility?
[00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:32.240]   Number three, examine their reputation.
[00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:35.400]   If humility is one of the most important, their reputation, candidly, ladies,
[00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:42.560]   is one of the ones that often is most overlooked or neglected or excused away.
[00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:44.320]   You need to examine his reputation.
[00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:50.560]   The scripture says, in this passage we read, he must have a good reputation
[00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:52.680]   with outsiders.
[00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:55.760]   Not even just within the church, he's well thought of and respected.
[00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:59.120]   Even with outsiders, when he's at work, when he's around non-believing family
[00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:01.840]   members, they speak well of him.
[00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:05.800]   What is the reputation of the guy or girl, but in this case,
[00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:08.600]   the guy that you're dating?
[00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:11.160]   The good news is no matter what your reputation, if you've blown every single
[00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:12.720]   one in this list, God isn't done with you.
[00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:16.280]   He can still write an amazing story.
[00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:17.840]   But what is the reputation?
[00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:20.320]   Is he known for being flaky?
[00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:24.920]   Is he known for not keeping his word when he says he's going to do something?
[00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:28.560]   Or is he known for being generous and kind?
[00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:31.240]   He's known as the guy who shows up to serve and help when somebody
[00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:31.920]   needs to move.
[00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:36.000]   He's known as the guy who constantly is giving friends rides to the airport.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.640]   He's known as the guy that is always looking out for family members and needs
[00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:42.400]   that they have.
[00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:47.520]   What is his reputation, for good or for worse?
[00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:50.200]   Is he a known commodity?
[00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:54.920]   One of the ways that you can know his reputation is by being in an environment
[00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:56.200]   where he's known.
[00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:59.320]   This goes back to the first point of being connected to a local church,
[00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:01.880]   that he's known by people in his life.
[00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:07.520]   And he's not a perfect guy by any means, but people know him and his reputation
[00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:11.760]   is one that is good with believers and non-believers.
[00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:13.520]   What is the reputation that he has?
[00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:17.960]   This is, candidly, why online dating is so dangerous.
[00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:21.880]   And it's the number one way that people meet today.
[00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:25.840]   But the reason it can be dangerous is anybody can look good over a cup of
[00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:30.200]   coffee and in their Instagram profile or their online dating or their Hinge or
[00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:37.400]   their Bumble or whatever profile, but you don't actually know them.
[00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:40.760]   Versus if they're connected and have other believers and they have roots
[00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:45.560]   inside of a church and a reputation that goes before them.
[00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:50.200]   Whenever we were in Europe, I would go onto TripAdvisor and I would
[00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:53.800]   evaluate everything that...anything that we were going to do or any place we're
[00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:56.360]   going to stay, man, I wanted to go look at the good, the bad,
[00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:57.720]   and the ugly of every place.
[00:21:57.720 --> 00:21:59.200]   So I just went, again, full tilt.
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:00.440]   I'm in there reading the reviews.
[00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:03.920]   I want to know the recent bad ones, not just all the glowing ones that
[00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:07.120]   somebody in the hotel staff wrote themselves.
[00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:11.080]   I want to know, like, the crazy Karen Josiah mentioned, what is she saying?
[00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:13.680]   I want to know the good, the bad, the ugly, everything about it.
[00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:15.440]   So I go in with eyes wide open.
[00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:20.000]   In the process of dating, it is evaluating.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:25.680]   It is them interviewing for the position of husband, interviewing for the position
[00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:29.320]   of your children's father.
[00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:37.440]   You cannot be too careful and take serious or take too seriously knowing who they are
[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:39.280]   and the person that you're dating them.
[00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:40.360]   What is their reputation?
[00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:45.480]   You need to examine what are they known for by the people in their life.
[00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:48.600]   If they have a reputation, just like in that scenario where you go
[00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:52.080]   on TripAdvisor and you see, "Oh, man, this hotel, there's a number
[00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:54.040]   of different bad reviews."
[00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:57.200]   You know what the good thing about that scenario with that hotel?
[00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:59.400]   You can get new management.
[00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:02.520]   You can make decisions and all of a sudden operate in a different way,
[00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:04.680]   and those reviews begin to change.
[00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:06.920]   You can begin to see, "Oh, man, they really started to operate
[00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:07.640]   things differently."
[00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:09.120]   The same thing is true in life.
[00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:11.760]   No matter what your reputation, you may have a string of bad relationship
[00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:14.600]   after relationship after relationship and ways that you blew it, man.
[00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:16.360]   God isn't done with you.
[00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:20.280]   And if you surrender to Him and walk with Him, He can begin to rewrite that story.
[00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:22.000]   I believe in you.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:27.400]   You can do it, but you have got to decide, "I'm going to trust God's way."
[00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:29.320]   What is his reputation?
[00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:36.800]   All right, number four, examine does he have initiative?
[00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:39.240]   Does he take initiative?
[00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:40.680]   He initiates.
[00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:42.400]   He has drive.
[00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:46.480]   He is not constantly or just simply spending every waking moment playing
[00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:47.640]   Fortnite.
[00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:54.040]   He has initiative, specifically in the context of leading and leading
[00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:55.080]   in a dating way.
[00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:58.120]   The Scripture says in this passage, it says, "He must be able to manage his
[00:23:58.120 --> 00:23:59.440]   own family well."
[00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:01.680]   It's talking about leadership in the home.
[00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:08.960]   You're looking for somebody who can lead your family and be a part of initiating
[00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:12.320]   and leading and caring for your future home.
[00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:15.080]   Does he have initiative?
[00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:18.360]   Biblically, leadership is synonymous with serving.
[00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:22.360]   Jesus would say that in Mark 10.
[00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:27.320]   Biblical leadership is chief servant.
[00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:33.000]   And having initiative is one of the ways, men, that you can serve her.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.240]   What do I mean?
[00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:35.000]   It looks like this.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.040]   What does it look like to show initiative?
[00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:41.000]   It means that you initiate the date.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.200]   It means you go up to her, and this is going to be scary because, ladies,
[00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:45.440]   you don't realize it, you're scary.
[00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:48.400]   You got all the earrings and nails and all this stuff, and guys are...
[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:50.440]   They look tough on the outside, but there's a little part,
[00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:52.280]   it's just intimidating.
[00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:54.080]   And you're going to go up despite that intimidation.
[00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:55.280]   You know what you're going to do, men?
[00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:58.720]   You're going to flex the courage muscle, and you're going to go up to her,
[00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:04.120]   and you're going to say, "Hey, Karen."
[00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:09.120]   It's like a third Karen reference tonight.
[00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:10.680]   I apologize.
[00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:15.960]   Whatever your name is, I would like to take you on a date this Saturday
[00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:18.400]   to the Mavericks game.
[00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:21.400]   Or...I got all the Mavs fans, good.
[00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:25.640]   I would like to take you out to dinner this weekend to go to the Perot Museum.
[00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:29.200]   I would like to take you out for coffee this Sunday afternoon.
[00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:30.480]   You're very specific.
[00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:33.680]   I would like to take you on a date, and then you fill in the blank showing
[00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:36.520]   that you are prepared, you have a plan, you're showing initiative,
[00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:38.360]   you're giving clarity on exactly the ask.
[00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:39.440]   We talked about it a few weeks ago.
[00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:43.800]   You don't just go up and say, "Hey, you got anything going Saturday,
[00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:44.880]   or you want to chill?"
[00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:47.680]   You say, "I'd like to take you on a date, and here's what I'd like to do."
[00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:50.240]   Then you give her a chance to respond.
[00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:52.560]   And if she doesn't have a response in that moment, you say, "It's okay,
[00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:54.280]   you can take time and let me know.
[00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:56.960]   I'd like to take you out on a date and get to know you better."
[00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:59.240]   You use your words and you initiate.
[00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:01.600]   Now, I answered this a couple of weeks ago, but let me come back to it.
[00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:05.960]   Ladies, can ladies ask guys on a date?
[00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:06.960]   - No.
[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:07.960]   - Yes.
[00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:15.320]   - Sure.
[00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:17.640]   I mean, it depends what you mean.
[00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:20.120]   Like, if you ask them out, does that mean you're going to hell?
[00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:22.240]   No, that's not what the Bible...
[00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:23.560]   Is it best?
[00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:28.680]   Well, God said that man is to be the chief leader and sacrificer for his family
[00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:29.720]   and in his home.
[00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:35.840]   And already, it's the first opportunity to initiate that he's not even doing.
[00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:37.520]   It doesn't communicate his leadership.
[00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:39.600]   The other thing that you're going to do, and this shows initiative,
[00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:42.400]   is all throughout the dating process, you took her on a date, and then you're
[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:43.600]   going to continue to bring clarity.
[00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:46.040]   So if you don't want to go on a second date, you don't just say,
[00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:49.080]   "I'd like to...I hope to see you again sometime," because that's not true.
[00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:50.840]   You tell the truth.
[00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:53.440]   If you do want to go on a second date, you say, "I've really enjoyed this
[00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:53.920]   first date.
[00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:55.440]   I'd love to take you on a second date."
[00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:56.600]   You never leave her wondering.
[00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:57.440]   Here's the truth.
[00:26:57.440 --> 00:26:59.560]   Ladies, they wonder.
[00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:00.600]   They're wondering.
[00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:02.880]   Guys, we just fixate on one thing.
[00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:04.920]   We're not even thinking about anything for, like, the entire day.
[00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:07.440]   But ladies, it's always going up there, and they're wondering,
[00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:09.200]   and you don't want to leave her wondering.
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:12.240]   And so you never want her to go, "I don't know what's going on with us,
[00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:15.520]   and is he interested, or he's kind of giving me just confusing vibes."
[00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:16.880]   None of that happens.
[00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:19.880]   You drive clarity because you're a man who's going to step up and show
[00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:21.640]   initiative and communicate.
[00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:23.240]   I would like you to be my girlfriend.
[00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:27.040]   When that moment comes, you're driving clarity into the relationship.
[00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:30.160]   If you're not sure the relationship should go forward, you communicate
[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:31.560]   that with her.
[00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:35.520]   And you, all along the way, are showing initiative in how you lead and bring
[00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:37.080]   clarity to the relationship.
[00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:38.840]   We've said before, leaders remove confusion.
[00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:41.680]   You're going to remove any confusion because we don't play games.
[00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:43.240]   Games are for kids.
[00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:47.440]   You're a follower of Jesus and a godly, pursuing being a godly man,
[00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:48.360]   and you're going to lead her in that way.
[00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:51.200]   This also means leading her in purity.
[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:57.400]   You're going to honor God by prioritizing maintaining sexual boundaries.
[00:27:57.400 --> 00:28:02.880]   I'm going to honor you and honor God by leading you in purity.
[00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:05.320]   Now, let me answer this question because there's a lot of confusion around,
[00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:06.560]   like, "Hey, women are..."
[00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:08.720]   Do you submit to the guy that you're dating?
[00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:09.880]   Ready?
[00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:12.040]   No.
[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:19.320]   Scripture says that wives submit to a husband as husbands submit to the Lord.
[00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:24.520]   So, until he puts a ring on it, and until he is in the position of,
[00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:25.240]   "Hey, I..."
[00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:29.840]   Because the Scripture also says, "Guys, you're called to die daily
[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:32.280]   for your wife."
[00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:35.480]   Until he's in that position, you're not in the position of submitting
[00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:36.480]   to anything.
[00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:40.600]   And his role is to be the chief servant in how he leads and cares and initiates
[00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:43.160]   with you in this time and in the marriage.
[00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:48.040]   All right, number five, examine his self-control.
[00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:51.920]   The passage we read talks about at least three areas, but several areas,
[00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:56.920]   that he, as a leader of a bride, should exhibit self-control.
[00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:57.880]   And he brings up three areas.
[00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:01.320]   It says, he's faithful to his wife, he's self-controlled,
[00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:05.880]   he's not given to drunkenness, he's not violent but gentle.
[00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:09.560]   So, here's three areas to evaluate, alcohol, anger, and adultery.
[00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:10.760]   Alcohol, anger, and adultery.
[00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:15.320]   If he is getting drunk in front of you, that's a red flag.
[00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:17.760]   And maybe the reason you don't see it that way is because you're getting drunk
[00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:20.400]   in front of him.
[00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:22.600]   And it's just kind of part of your relationship.
[00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:29.160]   That is a reflection of red flags in both directions.
[00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:34.080]   Does he exercise self-control as it relates to anger?
[00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:38.640]   Like, if he is getting in fights at the bar over the latest, you know,
[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:41.480]   Cowboys game, that's a big red flag.
[00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:45.480]   You are so valuable, God would die on a cross for you.
[00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:52.040]   Staying in a relationship with somebody who is belligerent in acting out in his
[00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:58.080]   anger, it's not worth your time.
[00:29:58.080 --> 00:29:59.160]   And that sounds not gracious.
[00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:00.360]   My point is to not be gracious.
[00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:01.540]   It's you are deciding.
[00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:07.120]   You can extend him grace and forgiveness, but not your hand in marriage.
[00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:11.960]   Because you're evaluating, is this the spouse and father and husband that I want
[00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:13.560]   to commit my life to?
[00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:17.960]   And then he brings up adultery, that he's faithful to his wife.
[00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:22.080]   Like, people will write in and ask, or ask the question, "Hey,
[00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:23.120]   my boyfriend cheated on me.
[00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:24.400]   What should I do?"
[00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:24.960]   Let me give the answer.
[00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:26.960]   Ready?
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:30.280]   You break up with him.
[00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:33.560]   You break up with him.
[00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:39.240]   He has shown that he's not in a healthy place, and you can pray for him and hope
[00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:46.160]   that he gets to a place where he's not cheating on anybody with anybody.
[00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:48.800]   But you don't date him.
[00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:51.640]   You don't move towards marriage with him.
[00:30:51.640 --> 00:31:01.000]   If he is looking at porn consistently, you should break the relationship and take
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   time to get healthy.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:06.760]   And, man, pornography is a big part of my story for years.
[00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:09.240]   And the opportunities to get healthy, they're all around here,
[00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:12.960]   going to Regen, signing up for Covenant Eyes, and getting it placed on your phone
[00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:16.360]   to struggle well so that you're not training yourself for variety,
[00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:19.800]   which is what pornography does.
[00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:23.440]   And you're exhibiting self-control.
[00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:27.280]   If he's pushing and pressuring you to go physically farther than God's word says,
[00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:30.200]   that's a red flag.
[00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:33.640]   Is he exhibiting and exercising self-control?
[00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:39.720]   Because if he's not right now and you're dating, what makes you think he will
[00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:41.840]   when you're married?
[00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:44.760]   If he's not right now saying, "Hey, I have the ability to not sleep with
[00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:52.120]   someone who's not my wife," what's going to magically turn that ability off
[00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:54.320]   whenever you guys get married?
[00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:58.240]   Then he's going to exercise self-control?
[00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:03.400]   In other words, right now, you're evaluating the pattern of their
[00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:09.200]   life, which is a far more in the path that their life is on.
[00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:11.800]   It's a far greater indicator than a promise that they're going to make.
[00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:13.440]   People can make promises all the time.
[00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:17.400]   What's much more powerful is the path that their life is on.
[00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:18.960]   In other words, right now, the World Cup is going on.
[00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:21.080]   USA Today, did anyone not see?
[00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:21.800]   Anyone know the score?
[00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:23.520]   I'm about to ruin it, so close your ears.
[00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:25.200]   Okay, ready?
[00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:32.960]   USA Today beats Iran, takes them down 1-0 on the path to victory.
[00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:37.280]   Now, Iran, despite having lost, they could say, "Hey, no,
[00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:41.800]   but we promise we are going to win the World Cup."
[00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:46.280]   What is a much more important variable or factor or determining factor if that's
[00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:51.520]   going to happen is not the promise they make, it is the path they are on.
[00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:55.840]   And in the same way, he can sit there and he can make promises about how he'll be,
[00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:58.600]   and what he'll be, and what it'll be like all day long.
[00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:04.000]   The promise is not nearly as powerful as the path that his life is on.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:10.320]   It's the path of his life, one that is moving in the direction
[00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:14.200]   that Christ says godly men should be moving.
[00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:16.440]   And is he exercising self-control.
[00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:19.320]   All right, number six, his trust in God.
[00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:27.640]   Evaluate his trust in God, that he really believes God's word.
[00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:31.080]   When it comes to living his life and how he thinks about money,
[00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:36.640]   how he sees the future, how he thinks about children in the home,
[00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:42.560]   how he understands marriage in general, is all of that informed by God's word
[00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:45.440]   or his opinions?
[00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:49.640]   Like, does he actually...I mean it, does he trust God's word?
[00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:52.240]   I'm going to live and look to God's word for direction.
[00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:56.240]   It says that he has to be able to teach it so that he can teach children and teach
[00:33:56.240 --> 00:34:01.280]   God's word, which means he needs to know God's word and live by God's word,
[00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:06.040]   which means he trusts God's word.
[00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:10.840]   Examine his trust in God, that he trusts God.
[00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:15.000]   In Titus 1, it's a very similar passage, covers elders as well.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:22.240]   It says, "Leaders of God's bride must hold firmly to the trustworthy message as it's
[00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:28.560]   been taught so he can encourage others with sound doctrine and refute those
[00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:29.240]   who oppose it."
[00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:32.120]   That when it comes to life, he's constantly going to God's word and
[00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:35.360]   saying, "Man, hey, this is how I naturally think about it,
[00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:42.200]   but this is really what God's word says about X topic.
[00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:45.280]   This is how I naturally think about love, sex, dating, but this is what God's
[00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:47.000]   word says.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:50.080]   This is how I think about my job and my boss, but this is what God's word says."
[00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:53.280]   He's constantly looking to it for direction.
[00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:56.760]   When we were in Paris, we would take the metro, which is the subway,
[00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:58.360]   basically, of Paris.
[00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:01.000]   And we were on such a tight schedule, like I said, because I packed everything
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:05.920]   in there, that I would carry around with me this map of the metro station because I
[00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:10.800]   always wanted to make sure we got on the right line to go to the right destination.
[00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:13.120]   In other words, I didn't just, you know, pull out the map and go,
[00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:15.160]   "Eeny, meeny, miny, moe, pick a tiger by its toe," this one.
[00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:18.800]   And then we'd go to wherever it ended up.
[00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:22.080]   I didn't go off of my own perspective and, I mean, I just like the color
[00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:23.120]   of that railway.
[00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:29.120]   I would look at the map because if I want to end up at the right destination,
[00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:35.080]   I have to make sure that I get on the thing that is moving in the right direction.
[00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:36.520]   I follow the directions.
[00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:42.360]   Does he look to God's word as his guide, source of direction?
[00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:46.400]   Or does he look to the opinions of friends and the world around him?
[00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:51.480]   Or does he trust God's word?
[00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:56.160]   In other words, you're looking for someone who's committed to the church,
[00:35:56.160 --> 00:36:00.960]   who's marked by humility, whose reputation is one that brings
[00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:08.600]   honor to God and to himself, has initiative, has self-control,
[00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:10.760]   and trusts God's word.
[00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:14.680]   You're looking for someone who's in relationship with Christ,
[00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:16.720]   who is walking with Christ.
[00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:18.040]   You're not going to find a perfect husband.
[00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:19.040]   There is no perfect husband.
[00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:20.260]   There's no perfect man.
[00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:22.760]   There is only one who's ever lived, Jesus.
[00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:27.600]   But the closer in relationship that he is to Christ and the more intimately that he
[00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:30.840]   walks with him, the more that he will exhibit all of those
[00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:32.920]   characteristics.
[00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:40.640]   And you're looking for somebody who is in relationship, walking daily with Christ.
[00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:45.000]   To be the leader of God's bride, God says, that's what it takes.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:48.880]   And to be the leader of you as a bride.
[00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:49.880]   These are the things to look for.
[00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:52.240]   And quite frankly, this is not a message of going, "Guys, hey,
[00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:54.000]   pull your bootstraps up and try a lot harder."
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.360]   This is a message of walking in dependence on Christ.
[00:36:56.360 --> 00:37:00.240]   That's the only way that anything that looks like Christ begins to show up in any
[00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:03.200]   of our lives is by walking in dependence on you, Jesus.
[00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:06.520]   I need your help to be the husband that I want to be, to keep my commitments the way
[00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:08.400]   that I want to, to be marked in humility.
[00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:10.920]   None of that comes from me, just like none of it comes from you.
[00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:13.400]   It comes from walking in dependence on Christ.
[00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:16.800]   And if you've never had a moment where you trusted in Jesus as your savior,
[00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:18.400]   you don't have a relationship with Christ.
[00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:22.120]   You don't have eternal life, to be quite frankly.
[00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:25.520]   And your moment tonight is not to try to keep commitments and get plugged
[00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:29.200]   into a church, it's to accept Jesus as your savior, the savior of the world who
[00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:30.000]   died for your sin.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:31.160]   That's what it means to be a Christian.
[00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:31.840]   You know that, right?
[00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:34.920]   The message of Christianity is not try harder and let's all get a motivational
[00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:37.160]   speech and you can go out there and you're going to do great this week.
[00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:40.240]   The message of Christianity is there are no good people.
[00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:42.480]   It's not good people in heaven, bad people in hell.
[00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:44.720]   It is forgiven people who go to heaven.
[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:49.800]   Only way you and I can be forgiven is by trusting Jesus as your savior,
[00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:55.360]   the payment for your sin, that he died in your place and he rose again showing the
[00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:56.840]   payment was more than enough.
[00:37:56.840 --> 00:38:00.200]   Check cleared, all went through.
[00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:03.360]   Everything you've ever done, paid for.
[00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:06.600]   And that allows you a relationship with Christ and that's how God begins to bring
[00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:08.680]   about these qualities and characteristic.
[00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:10.560]   No matter where you are, if you look at all of these and you're like,
[00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:14.280]   "I've blown it on each one of those," God is not done with you.
[00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:17.280]   You've got to trust him, surrender to him.
[00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:27.440]   So I'm going to walk with you to the ladies in the room who have faithfully been
[00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:36.280]   following Jesus, who have prioritized God's word, pursued purity,
[00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:40.800]   not settled and lowered your standards.
[00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:46.720]   I want you to hear from me, I am so proud of you.
[00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:49.160]   To the godly men in the room who have walked with Jesus,
[00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:53.960]   who are striving imperfectly like we all are to be God's man,
[00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:56.120]   I am so proud of you.
[00:38:56.120 --> 00:38:58.000]   And if you're in a place where ladies, you're just going, "Man,
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:01.200]   I've done those things," but it's just guys that are not asking me out.
[00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:04.920]   I have a four-year-old daughter.
[00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:10.440]   And for her to grow up and have all the beauty and the clothes and the car and
[00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:15.400]   the looks and everything the world says, but not have what you have,
[00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:20.360]   as a godly woman who says, "I trust God and I'm not going to settle for what
[00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:22.320]   other people in the world around me are settling for.
[00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:24.920]   I'm not going to lower my standards because I know my worth,
[00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:31.200]   I know my value, I know whose identity or whose image I'm made in."
[00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:34.040]   I'm going to trust God.
[00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:35.360]   I am so proud of you.
[00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:39.920]   And if my daughter grows up to be like you, I will be so proud.
[00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:42.440]   Keep going.
[00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:44.280]   It's worth it.
[00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:48.640]   And men, no matter where you're at, God isn't done with you and you have a
[00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:50.080]   chance and I believe in you.
[00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:52.920]   Those of you who know Jesus and you're walking with him just like me
[00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:57.800]   imperfectly with other guys in your life, keep going.
[00:39:57.800 --> 00:40:01.000]   It's worth it.
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:07.280]   And in time, you'll see that relationship prioritized with Jesus, it was worth it.
[00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:14.200]   And you'll look more and more like Christ.
[00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:15.320]   Let me pray.
[00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:23.200]   Father, thank you just for the ways you come alongside all of us despite our
[00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:27.920]   imperfections, our need for you, and thank you that you rush in to love us
[00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:29.640]   and help us.
[00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:33.600]   I pray for the guys in the room who are seeking to follow you and honor you,
[00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:36.600]   that you would continue to deepen their love for you, their faith in you,
[00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:37.880]   their trust in you.
[00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:45.040]   I pray for the ladies in the room seeking to do the same, you would strengthen their
[00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:51.120]   resolve and they would live and walk deeply in relationship with you.
[00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:56.440]   Thank you that you loved us so much that you would give your life for us to have
[00:40:56.440 --> 00:41:00.240]   a relationship in this life with you and for all of eternity.
[00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:06.760]   For anyone tonight who has never accepted, believed, or received that with that
[00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:14.360]   change, and they step into the most important relationship they'll ever have,
[00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:16.040]   which is with you.
[00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:17.800]   We worship you now in song.
[00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:19.280]   Amen.
[00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:22.760]   You guys take a seat real quick.
[00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:24.360]   Oh, man.
[00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:28.600]   Thanks, dude.
[00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:30.040]   I think I'm good, actually.
[00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:37.280]   I'm here.
[00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:47.680]   In 2010, I got asked by somebody named Jonathan Picluda to come teach at the
[00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:49.800]   porch.
[00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:51.600]   And it was a very different day.
[00:41:51.600 --> 00:42:00.320]   It was like there was 375 people and it was amazing.
[00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:06.800]   And since then, I've had the chance of seeing God just show up in unbelievable
[00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:09.440]   ways.
[00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:15.680]   And one of the greatest honors next to being Callie's husband and Monroe and Bear
[00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:21.400]   and Crew's dad has been having just a front row seat to see what God has done
[00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:23.000]   week after week.
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.040]   It's been amazing.
[00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:31.440]   And what he's done all over the country and the privilege of getting invited into
[00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:37.200]   dorm rooms and apartments where people are listening or on different walks and gyms
[00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:42.680]   where people are exercising and just the ways God has been writing amazing stories.
[00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:44.720]   And people come down, they're like, "The porch changed my life.
[00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:46.120]   The porch never changed any life.
[00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:48.720]   Jesus changed your life."
[00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:59.920]   And it has been so incredible to see him write these stories.
[00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:10.120]   And I'll never understand why he would give that privilege for me to get to see.
[00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:22.400]   And my wife, who's actually here tonight, and I have for the last 12 months prayed
[00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:33.160]   and wrestled and felt like God is leading us to transition to something different.
[00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:39.200]   And we don't know what that is and we're not disappearing.
[00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:48.680]   We love this church, but over the last 12 months, it has continued for him to put on
[00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:53.400]   our heart leading to do something different.
[00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:59.640]   And the timing doesn't make sense and I cannot say enough amazing things.
[00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:02.800]   I want to be very, very clear.
[00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:06.840]   I love this church.
[00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:14.840]   I have received more from Watermark in 13 years than I will ever or could ever repay.
[00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:16.920]   I love our leadership.
[00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:19.120]   They have discipled me.
[00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:22.600]   They've taught me God's word, how to think, so many of the things that even was
[00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:24.920]   shared here.
[00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:30.520]   I will spend the rest of my life sharing with other people things that I was just
[00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:35.600]   poured into and shared by the leadership and the elders here.
[00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:41.880]   We love this place and have loved serving and seeing God at work.
[00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:45.240]   And we cannot deny, we also feel like God's stirring and leading.
[00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:48.720]   And that is scary because we don't know what's next and we don't know what that is.
[00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:54.080]   We just felt like he was saying, "I need you to trust me.
[00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:58.320]   I want you to trust me," or inviting us to trust him.
[00:44:58.320 --> 00:44:59.240]   I love this team.
[00:44:59.240 --> 00:45:01.160]   My team is the best team at Watermark.
[00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:03.600]   I'm biased, but I think we have the best team, the Ports team.
[00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:04.720]   It's incredible.
[00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:11.600]   And God is, I believe, going to continue to write amazing stories.
[00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:16.240]   The best, brightest days of the ministry are in front and I want to do anything and
[00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:21.400]   everything and come back at any point in any time to help and to serve and to
[00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:24.880]   support in any way that I can.
[00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:31.480]   But we feel like this is the step that God's leading us to and where we're trying
[00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:35.840]   to live out and trust God's word and trust God's will and trust God's way.
[00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:42.760]   And so, we'd invite you to pray for that and know that we love this place.
[00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:47.440]   This was one of the harder decisions that I've ever had to make and yet we felt like
[00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:50.440]   it was God's leading.
[00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:51.680]   And we love you.
[00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:56.720]   I love and I'm so honored and humbled to have gotten to play a small role in the
[00:45:56.720 --> 00:46:00.640]   ways that God's at work in so many of your stories.
[00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:07.880]   And thank you.
[00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:13.000]   I'd love to invite our elders, a couple of our elders and some of my team just up
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:15.880]   here along with my wife just for prayer.
[00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:20.880]   And these are the men that I mentioned who I love deeply, who have impacted my life
[00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:28.400]   greatly and have for years been one of God's greatest amazing gifts.
[00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:30.720]   In fact, I'll say this last thing.
[00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:35.800]   When I was at DTS, I had to write a dissertation for my, like, final paper
[00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:37.200]   when I was in seminary.
[00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:41.400]   And I said, "It was about your church, like, what's your favorite thing?"
[00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:46.040]   And I wrote our elders.
[00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:55.000]   And we just love this place, man.
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.000]   - Love you, too.
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:06.480]   - Can I jump in?
[00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:07.480]   - Yeah, please.
[00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:08.480]   - All right.
[00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:11.000]   Hey, my name's Kyle Thompson.
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:18.560]   And I've had the joy of serving as an elder here at Watermark for over 18 years.
[00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:26.040]   And 13 years ago, I was hanging out and met a young guy who was in seminary.
[00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:28.120]   Just come on staff.
[00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:34.640]   And you know, those times when you meet someone, and even though I'm 30 years older than David,
[00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:35.960]   there was a real connection.
[00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:38.800]   And we developed a friendship.
[00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:43.660]   And that friendship has only grown over the last decade.
[00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:51.400]   My wife and I, when David and Callie got married over 10 years ago, we got to lead their newly
[00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:53.200]   married community group.
[00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:57.720]   So we got to spend a lot of time together in those early years.
[00:47:57.720 --> 00:48:01.920]   And David and I have continued to spend time together over the years.
[00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:04.840]   And a couple of things that I want to say.
[00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:12.520]   You know, David is one of the most gifted teachers that we've had on staff here at Watermark.
[00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:19.560]   And one of the things that we want to do first, I just want to publicly thank David for his
[00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:27.840]   investment here, for his ministry here, and just the ways that he has allowed God to use
[00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:31.680]   him to impact really thousands of lives.
[00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:33.000]   And I'm one of them.
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:37.900]   But I just want to publicly have us thank him for the ways that he's surrendered and
[00:48:37.900 --> 00:48:40.360]   allowed God to use him here.
[00:48:40.360 --> 00:49:02.120]   So thank you.
[00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:05.920]   And you know, y'all can be seated.
[00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:14.440]   The second thing, and this is so easy to miss, but I want to affirm what you heard David
[00:49:14.440 --> 00:49:15.800]   say.
[00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:23.400]   You know, one of the hardest things to do is when we're in a place where we feel like
[00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:29.680]   we're thriving and God's using us and we're comfortable and we kind of, you know, you're
[00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:39.800]   in the pattern, you know the routine, is to surrender and to have silence and solitude
[00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:45.320]   and to hear the voice of the Spirit when He's prodding us to move.
[00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:51.720]   And as you heard David say, that typically doesn't happen, you know, in a dream or in
[00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:52.840]   an instant.
[00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:58.120]   That's something that happens over days and weeks and months.
[00:49:58.120 --> 00:50:04.040]   And you heard him say that he and Callie have wrestled with this for close to a year.
[00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:09.960]   I've had the privilege of getting to be a part of that process and time that David and
[00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:17.160]   I have spent together talking and praying and just being a sounding board, just, you
[00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:23.760]   know, in affirming that hey, this may be what God's doing as much as we love having you
[00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:25.920]   here.
[00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:31.120]   And so I just, you know, to step out on faith like that, especially when you don't know
[00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:33.720]   what's next, that's a scary thing.
[00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:34.720]   But that's our Bible.
[00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:35.960]   I mean, you see that.
[00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:37.360]   You saw it in Abraham.
[00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:39.200]   You see it all through Scripture.
[00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:47.840]   And so as David said, man, you guys just continue to pray for them and it's going to be great.
[00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:53.920]   I love that we're going to continue to have shared ministry together with wherever David
[00:50:53.920 --> 00:50:56.240]   and Callie end up.
[00:50:56.240 --> 00:51:00.080]   We've got platforms here that we host.
[00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:06.680]   And so I'm excited how, you know, just the ways that we as Watermark are going to continue
[00:51:06.680 --> 00:51:12.560]   to partner in shared ministry with, and we don't know exactly what that looks like, but
[00:51:12.560 --> 00:51:18.120]   what we want to do, the most important thing we can do and we want to continue to do is
[00:51:18.120 --> 00:51:23.040]   I want to invite Callie up here because this is a journey for David and Callie.
[00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:24.520]   This is not David.
[00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:30.320]   And then Blake Holmes, who's our lead pastor and my fellow elder, we lead together here.
[00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:31.520]   I want Blake to come up.
[00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:36.000]   And then Josiah, I'd love for you and Sam to come up also.
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:43.080]   And we're going to, we're going to, I'm going to lead us in, in, in just praying for them,
[00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:44.240]   you know, doing what we said.
[00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:52.800]   We can talk all day, but God does things supernaturally just as we humble ourselves before Him.
[00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:57.440]   And so Father, I do thank you for David and Callie.
[00:51:57.440 --> 00:52:04.080]   I thank you for, again, that just the ways that you've used them to love people, to disciple
[00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:07.080]   people, to teach.
[00:52:07.080 --> 00:52:15.920]   Just thank you for the ways that they honor you by honoring your word, by following you,
[00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:22.380]   by imitating what Christ would have them do so that they are worthy of imitation.
[00:52:22.380 --> 00:52:27.920]   And Father, I do pray that you would overwhelm them with your grace and your love and your
[00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:37.960]   peace, the peace that you give, not as the world gives, and in a way that they can just
[00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:46.060]   rest and not operate under a timetable other than what your timetable is.
[00:52:46.060 --> 00:52:51.900]   You tell us in your word that you make our path clear, that in your presence is fullness
[00:52:51.900 --> 00:52:56.000]   of joy, in your right hand are pleasures forever.
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:57.880]   And I thank you that that's a promise.
[00:52:57.880 --> 00:53:06.720]   And so just as you guide and direct them, that you would just, again, allow them to
[00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:08.080]   rest in that peace.
[00:53:08.080 --> 00:53:16.640]   Father, I do pray that you direct conversations that you'd even, you know, use tonight as
[00:53:16.640 --> 00:53:17.880]   part of that process.
[00:53:17.880 --> 00:53:24.560]   We know that there's so many things that you're doing that we don't see, and yet sometimes
[00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:30.380]   we get to see the levers that you're pulling and get a glimpse of what that is.
[00:53:30.380 --> 00:53:36.420]   And so just thank you for the journey that they're on, which is rooted and traced in
[00:53:36.420 --> 00:53:41.340]   trust and faith in you, which is what this life is all about.
[00:53:41.340 --> 00:53:43.380]   And so I just pray that you would make that clear.
[00:53:43.380 --> 00:53:51.180]   We look forward to, again, how we're going to get to be on stages together and just continuing
[00:53:51.180 --> 00:53:57.740]   to follow you as we lock arms in ministry, as we love your people.
[00:53:57.740 --> 00:54:04.100]   And so just thank you for the sweetness of relationship, the way you created us for relationship
[00:54:04.100 --> 00:54:09.280]   with each other, the way we get to experience just the intimacy of that.
[00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:14.940]   And above all, the way we get to experience the intimacy of relationship with you through
[00:54:14.940 --> 00:54:15.940]   Jesus.
[00:54:15.940 --> 00:54:16.940]   Amen.
[00:54:16.940 --> 00:54:19.740]   Blake, I'm going to let you wrap it.
[00:54:19.740 --> 00:54:26.900]   >> All right, well, again, my name is Blake Holmes, and I just want to publicly thank
[00:54:26.900 --> 00:54:30.500]   David as well for serving here faithfully for 13 years.
[00:54:30.500 --> 00:54:36.020]   I've been on staff for 20 years, so David and I have had many years serving together.
[00:54:36.020 --> 00:54:40.360]   We've encouraged each other, we've sought the Lord in prayer together, we've admonished
[00:54:40.360 --> 00:54:45.360]   one another, and we've certainly laughed with each other.
[00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:48.440]   And we've laughed.
[00:54:48.440 --> 00:54:54.000]   And I got just one story I've got to tell on David.
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:55.920]   I won't tell the milk story, David.
[00:54:55.920 --> 00:54:57.400]   I won't share that.
[00:54:57.400 --> 00:55:01.640]   Who believed he could drink a gallon of milk in less than an hour.
[00:55:01.640 --> 00:55:03.560]   And I do remember that staff retreat.
[00:55:03.560 --> 00:55:04.560]   Was that your first staff retreat?
[00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:05.560]   >> I think so.
[00:55:05.560 --> 00:55:06.560]   >> Yeah.
[00:55:06.560 --> 00:55:11.040]   And then the other staff retreat, do you remember the raft that you tried to build to get us
[00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:13.240]   from one side of the pool to the other?
[00:55:13.240 --> 00:55:19.000]   Yeah, he went to A&M, and his raft was about that deep.
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:20.640]   And it certainly took on water.
[00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:23.320]   It sunk the first few seconds it got in there.
[00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:28.960]   I say a lot to go, hey, listen, you know David is a teacher and a communicator.
[00:55:28.960 --> 00:55:32.160]   And I know him as a friend, as a brother in Christ.
[00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:35.520]   And it really has been an honor and a joy just to walk with him.
[00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:40.420]   And I know that this year I've been a part of that process as well, that he's felt that
[00:55:40.420 --> 00:55:44.720]   stirring of, hey, what's next for me?
[00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:53.800]   And so I know every time there's a transition like this, right, there's -- it raises questions.
[00:55:53.800 --> 00:55:59.000]   And for you, there's candidly, selfishly, there's a part that you're probably sitting
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:02.680]   there going, okay, what does this mean for the porch, right?
[00:56:02.680 --> 00:56:07.420]   And you could be sad or you could be mad or you could be confused by all that.
[00:56:07.420 --> 00:56:08.420]   And I get that.
[00:56:08.420 --> 00:56:10.800]   I totally get that.
[00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:15.600]   Having served here for 20 years, I've had really good friends I've served beside -- he
[00:56:15.600 --> 00:56:18.120]   mentioned JP, served beside JP for years.
[00:56:18.120 --> 00:56:20.320]   I was sad when JP transitioned.
[00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:23.120]   And I can give many other names.
[00:56:23.120 --> 00:56:25.520]   But I certainly haven't lost touch with those guys.
[00:56:25.520 --> 00:56:26.520]   I love them.
[00:56:26.520 --> 00:56:30.920]   In fact, on Friday, I'm spending much of my day with JP on Friday.
[00:56:30.920 --> 00:56:36.360]   And I intend to spend time and laugh and continue to share stories with D. Marvin in the future
[00:56:36.360 --> 00:56:37.360]   as well.
[00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:44.440]   But as far as just to encourage you, I want to invite you to do more than just attend
[00:56:44.440 --> 00:56:46.320]   the porch on Tuesday nights.
[00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:52.960]   I want to invite you to be a part of the body of Christ at Watermark, to join us, to be
[00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:55.280]   a part of the family that David spoke of.
[00:56:55.280 --> 00:56:56.640]   It's God's provision for you.
[00:56:56.640 --> 00:57:02.880]   He doesn't intend for you to live your life with him as just a Jesus and me mindset.
[00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:08.760]   But calls you into a family of God where you are loved, cared for, supported, and fully
[00:57:08.760 --> 00:57:10.560]   known.
[00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:11.840]   And so that's the first thing.
[00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:17.560]   And then as far as the porch on Tuesday nights in the spring, you guys have heard Timothy
[00:57:17.560 --> 00:57:22.400]   Atik, TA, some of you from A&M and Breakaway.
[00:57:22.400 --> 00:57:24.600]   He's going to kick off a series for us in the spring.
[00:57:24.600 --> 00:57:26.240]   I know you're going to be blessed by.
[00:57:26.240 --> 00:57:32.520]   So January 24th, put that on your calendar and I hope to see you then.
[00:57:32.520 --> 00:57:33.520]   Okay.
[00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:41.280]   Hey, one song that the church has historically sung for generations is the doxology.
[00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:44.080]   And I know staff come and go.
[00:57:44.080 --> 00:57:48.400]   There's going to be a time where I'm going to leave, but there's three things that never
[00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:49.400]   change.
[00:57:49.400 --> 00:57:50.400]   Right?
[00:57:50.400 --> 00:57:53.520]   And that's the word of God, the character of God, and the mission of God.
[00:57:53.520 --> 00:57:55.520]   Those things never change.
[00:57:55.520 --> 00:58:00.480]   And so we're going to stand and we're going to sing what the church has sung for generations,
[00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:04.680]   reminding ourselves of the character of God and his goodness.
[00:58:04.680 --> 00:58:05.680]   So let's stay in.
[00:58:05.680 --> 00:58:06.680]   Let's do that.
