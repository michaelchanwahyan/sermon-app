[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.620]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:21.000]   - All right, what's up Fort Worth?
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.320]   Hello Dallas, how y'all doing tonight?
[00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.160]   Good, yeah?
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.360]   A couple, some people are doing good.
[00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.200]   Any pet or animal lovers in the room?
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.520]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.440]   Oh yeah, or should I say Christians in the room?
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.280]   I don't want to name names,
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.800]   but I work with some non-animal lovers, Greg.
[00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.940]   And any dog lovers?
[00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.640]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.400]   There you go, any cat lovers?
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.560]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.640]   That is, you need evidence for the fall of man.
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:52.580]   There it is.
[00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.280]   I don't know if you're the kind of person,
[00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.580]   if you're a dog lover, you probably are,
[00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.960]   that when you see a dog that's like on the loose
[00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.720]   in your neighborhood that you think has a collar,
[00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.580]   you'll stop or you'll try to go,
[00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.760]   and if they're not with any person around them,
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.720]   you'll try to go and get the dog
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.240]   or look at the collar to see if it has tags.
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.080]   Anyone do this?
[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.200]   Yes, no, maybe?
[00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.320]   The rest, how dare you?
[00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.600]   What kind of people are you?
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.220]   And so when I see a dog like that,
[00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.120]   I don't know if it's the Holy Spirit or like guilt,
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.040]   probably not from the Spirit,
[00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.080]   but I'm like, oh man, I need to go look at this dog
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.400]   and try to get it back to its owner.
[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.740]   So anytime I do that, I'll go look and see if it has tags.
[00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.980]   And the most memorable occasion where this happened
[00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.580]   was not long ago, and I ended up regretting
[00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.760]   that I had made the decision to do this.
[00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.580]   I was actually coming back from walking my dog at night
[00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.980]   or throwing the ball from him in Glencoe Park,
[00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.100]   which is in the M Streets in Dallas,
[00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.500]   which we used to live in,
[00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.780]   and I was coming back from that.
[00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.300]   In the M Streets, we live between Greenville and 75,
[00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.420]   which is an area in Dallas, and I was driving him back.
[00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.720]   He's sitting shotgun, he's like a lab size.
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.840]   And I see this pit bull in the front of someone's yard
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.720]   that's like walking from house to house.
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.560]   There's no one around, so I'm like, great.
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.920]   Gotta go see who this dog is, bring him home with me.
[00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.240]   And I drive up to the dog,
[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.000]   and it begins running away from me.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.360]   It begins running to the next house.
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.280]   And so I'm like, great, and it does have a collar,
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.360]   it does have tags.
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.120]   I need to continue going after this dog.
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.760]   So I finally pull into this house
[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.120]   that was some random house that the dog was in front of,
[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.760]   and I begin to get out of my car
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:22.880]   to move towards the dog.
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.760]   I'm sitting there, my dog's sitting shotgun.
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:26.960]   This is what you do if you don't have kids,
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.160]   you tell dog stories.
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.660]   So I'm sitting there, and my dog's sitting shotgun.
[00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.200]   (audience laughing)
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.960]   And I begin to open the door to go look at this dog,
[00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.000]   and immediately in an instant, my dog jumps over my lap
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.960]   and runs after the other dog,
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.560]   and they both take off all the way down Martell,
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.000]   or all the way down this street.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.400]   I'm there in like slippers and pajama pants, be jealous.
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.040]   And I'm like, oh my gosh, so I take off,
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.580]   I leave the car door open with the keys in it,
[00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:52.920]   in front of their house,
[00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.240]   and I take off sprinting after my dog,
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.880]   and they end up going around another street
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.820]   and headed back towards on like Mattelie or something,
[00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.320]   towards Greenville.
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.120]   And I continue to chase after them in slippers,
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.800]   and I'm yelling behind the dog, stop, stop.
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.720]   And I see them approaching Greenville,
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.400]   and they're getting closer to Greenville,
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.880]   and I'm going, oh my gosh, I'm trying to save this dog,
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:14.820]   I'm gonna lose my dog.
[00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.840]   They're gonna go form a little colony somewhere,
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.380]   and this dog is now taking away from me,
[00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.920]   or they're gonna get hit on Greenville,
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.280]   so I'm sprinting deeply out of breath
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.840]   because I don't run anywhere,
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.880]   and I'm trying to catch up to these dogs,
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.440]   and then all of a sudden,
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.160]   right before they get to Greenville,
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.720]   this man and his dog pull around the corner,
[00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.160]   which of course stopped my dogs,
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.520]   because they do the official like dog greeting.
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.760]   Won't even go into that.
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.640]   And they're stopping there, I'm like yelling,
[00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.880]   stop, please come, the dog.
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.680]   And I finally get over there, I get to the dog,
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.320]   and now I have both of them,
[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.960]   and I'm taking them back, and I've got my dog,
[00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:55.140]   and I'm like, I am out of shape, big time at this point.
[00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.320]   I end up throwing up in somebody's bushes,
[00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.220]   literally on Greenville.
[00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.480]   Probably not the first time that's happened in Greenville.
[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.320]   And so if that was you, I apologize.
[00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.640]   But I'm taking my dog, and the dog,
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.780]   the other one takes off again.
[00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.480]   And I'm like, okay, we are done.
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.480]   I don't even know if my car is still there.
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.480]   You're on your own, buddy, okay?
[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.200]   And we walk back to my car, put him in,
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.200]   and I go back home, and just like still throwing up,
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.520]   'cause I'm so out of shape.
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.360]   But it was one of those moments where my threshold
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.680]   of how much will I go after this stray or runaway
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.420]   was clearly put to the test.
[00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:34.620]   Although I think I'm kind of the person
[00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.360]   that would go after the runaway,
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.600]   and that moment it's like, well, every man for himself.
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.560]   And so the reason I set up with that story
[00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.680]   is because I think as it relates to the topic of runaways,
[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.900]   and how to deal with strays or runaways,
[00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.640]   not speaking with dogs anymore, but speaking with people,
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.440]   how does God deal with the runaway?
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.800]   How does God approach the person who's running from him
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:58.920]   or who is strayed?
[00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:02.280]   Strayed means not where they're supposed to be,
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.620]   in life, in a relationship.
[00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.620]   How does God approach or view the runaway?
[00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.120]   Because all of us at some point in our life
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.140]   will be running away from God
[00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:15.320]   if you haven't gone through that season
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.360]   or you're in that season, some of you in this room,
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.780]   and you know you are.
[00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.800]   And so how does God view you?
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.280]   Really, the question, in finding the answer
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.880]   about how we think God views the runaway,
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.020]   the person who's running from him,
[00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:33.080]   tells us what and how we view God,
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.880]   tells us how we view God's grace.
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.760]   Maybe you're the type of person that would say,
[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:40.000]   God, with the runaway, if I ran from God,
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.940]   I've trusted in Christ, I know there's nothing he would do.
[00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:44.600]   He would not stop chasing me.
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.340]   There's no point he'd say, I give up.
[00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.380]   Nothing can separate me from the love of Christ,
[00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:50.880]   you would say.
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.140]   I mean, but really, do you really think that?
[00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:56.120]   Like, if you got into a dark place,
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.440]   you got into some sort of crazy addiction for years
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.040]   and you totally walked away from your life,
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.440]   do you really think that?
[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.360]   Maybe if you're honest, you'd say,
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.640]   yeah, I would say I think that,
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:08.240]   but really I think I just probably
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.880]   will never be bad enough to run.
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.420]   Or maybe you're on the other side of the group
[00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:14.300]   where you go, yeah, God, runaways,
[00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:15.560]   God will let you run away.
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.500]   If you abandon God, he will abandon you.
[00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:18.940]   That's why you gotta keep coming to church,
[00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:22.020]   gotta keep living it out and digging into the word.
[00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:22.860]   That's what you gotta do.
[00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:26.060]   If you run away from him, he's gonna run away from you.
[00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:29.260]   But how does God view runaways?
[00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.300]   Really, this is a question taught all throughout the Bible
[00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:33.300]   and tonight as we wrap up Colossians,
[00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:37.880]   and we're gonna explore the story of a man who was a runaway.
[00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:39.820]   And in doing so, we're gonna see something about
[00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:42.460]   not only this man in the story, but about our story.
[00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:47.120]   And about the God who is in the heart of God himself.
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:48.480]   So we're gonna be in Colossians chapter four.
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.880]   If you have a Bible, you can flip open to Colossians.
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:52.120]   If you don't know where Colossians is,
[00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.340]   there's a table of contents in the front.
[00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:57.680]   I would go there and it should tell you where to go and flip
[00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.000]   and we're gonna pick it up in verse seven of chapter four
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.480]   as we wrap up this series on Colossians.
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:08.960]   Paul is about to give us his farewell speech
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:12.880]   or farewell address to the church in Colossae.
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.820]   And he's gonna write, he's gonna give us a bunch of names
[00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:15.900]   that really we don't use anymore
[00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:16.760]   and they're kind of funny names.
[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:19.340]   But in doing so, he's gonna give us a particular story
[00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:21.460]   of one person we're gonna focus in on
[00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:25.420]   and really give us some other farewell greetings
[00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:27.780]   that he gives inside of this letter.
[00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:29.940]   So we're gonna pick it up at verse seven.
[00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:32.020]   So there's gonna be a ton of names
[00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:34.960]   and then I'll kind of recap and say where we're going.
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:36.160]   Verse seven.
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:40.380]   Tychicus will tell you, this is Paul who's in Rome,
[00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:43.680]   in prison, writing a letter to the church in Colossae.
[00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:44.520]   Here's where we go.
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:47.760]   Tychicus will tell you, Colossians, all the news about me.
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:50.080]   So Tychicus is coming.
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:52.320]   He is a dear brother and a faithful minister
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:54.280]   and fellow servant in the Lord.
[00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:57.080]   I'm sending him to you for the express purpose
[00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:59.200]   that you may know about our circumstances
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:01.520]   and that he may encourage your hearts.
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:06.520]   He is coming with Onesimus, our faithful and dear brother
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:08.680]   who is one of you.
[00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:13.040]   They will tell you everything that is happening here.
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:16.600]   My fellow prisoner, Aristarchus,
[00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:18.240]   just go forward with confidence,
[00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:21.660]   sends you his greetings as does Mark,
[00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:26.680]   which feels like too normal of a name to be in this passage.
[00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:28.000]   The cousin of Barnabas.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.600]   There we go, another unusual one.
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:32.600]   You have received instructions about Mark.
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:35.080]   If he comes to you, welcome him.
[00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:38.600]   Jesus, who is also called Justice, wonder why.
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:40.640]   It's like, hey buddy, we're gonna call you Justice.
[00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:42.160]   There's only one Jesus.
[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:46.280]   Jesus, who's also called Justice, also sends greetings.
[00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:47.520]   That's not in there.
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:48.560]   What's wrong with me?
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:52.720]   These are the only Jews among my coworkers
[00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:54.040]   for the kingdom of God,
[00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:55.760]   and they've proved to be a comfort to me.
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:58.240]   Epaphras, who's one of you and a servant of Christ,
[00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:00.280]   Jesus sends greetings.
[00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:01.760]   He's always wrestling in prayer for you
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:05.000]   that you may stand firm in all the will of God,
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   mature and fully assured.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.520]   I vouch for him that he's working hard for you
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:11.760]   and for those in Laodicea and Heropolis,
[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:14.200]   two nearby cities to Colossae.
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:19.080]   Our dear friend Luke, the doctor, and Demas send greetings.
[00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:22.440]   Give my greetings to the brothers and sisters at Laodicea
[00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:25.160]   and to Nympha and the church in her house.
[00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:28.480]   So Paul basically wraps up and he's closing the letter
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.800]   and he gives all these different farewell addresses.
[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:32.520]   What I wanna hone in on tonight
[00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:35.120]   is a verse that he just gave us
[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:38.920]   about a particular man named Onesimus.
[00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:42.040]   And the story of Onesimus, I think,
[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:46.060]   is one of the greatest runaway redemption stories
[00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:46.900]   of all time.
[00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:48.160]   You may know some great runaway stories,
[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:50.200]   Homeward Bound, Fievel Goes West,
[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:54.200]   and I don't know what, Lion King, maybe?
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:55.040]   What is Disney?
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:55.860]   What's wrong?
[00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:58.440]   So anyways, it's one of the greatest never heard of
[00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:00.520]   redemption/runaway stories,
[00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:03.200]   and we're gonna find it in the story of Onesimus.
[00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:06.040]   And it's not only just this verse,
[00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:08.740]   but another book inside of the Bible
[00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:10.820]   that will help us understand the story.
[00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:13.480]   It's actually another book that was written
[00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:15.920]   to the church in Colossae.
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:17.320]   You may not know this,
[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:20.280]   but just like Ephesians was written to the church in Ephesus
[00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:22.520]   and Galatians was written to the church in Galatia,
[00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:25.260]   Colossians was written to the church in Colossae.
[00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.040]   But that's not the only letter that was written
[00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:29.480]   to the church in Colossae.
[00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:30.440]   There's another one.
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:31.720]   Anyone know what it is?
[00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:32.560]   Front row.
[00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:34.240]   - Philemon.
[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:36.760]   - Philemon, that's right, Philemon.
[00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:40.360]   Philemon is another letter, or another book
[00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:41.600]   that's inside of our New Testament
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:43.640]   that addresses the church in Colossae,
[00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:48.160]   the church in Colossae that met in Philemon's home.
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.120]   And so really, inside of that book,
[00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:54.640]   which tells the story of Onesimus and Philemon,
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:56.200]   and this verse right here,
[00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:59.560]   we're gonna find our story of the runaway Onesimus.
[00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:00.720]   But here's how it all starts out.
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:03.800]   So before this letter had even been sent
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:05.600]   and read by the Colossians,
[00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:08.080]   the origins of the church in Colossae,
[00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:09.140]   we're gonna have to go back there.
[00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:10.400]   So I'm gonna make it as interesting,
[00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:11.800]   we're gonna use some maps as we can.
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:12.640]   But here's what happens.
[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:15.760]   So Paul goes to, you can put up that first map, Daniel.
[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:18.560]   Paul goes to the church, or Paul goes to the city of Ephesus.
[00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:21.160]   So Christianity starts, the movement's on its way.
[00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:22.520]   They go to all these different cities,
[00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:24.640]   and a number of the different cities are kinda on here,
[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:27.000]   and these are some of the major and more influential ones.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.160]   Paul, who becomes this incredible missionary,
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:32.880]   goes to the city of Ephesus.
[00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:34.720]   And he's there, and this is in Acts 20,
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:37.120]   we find out that Paul sets up shop for three years,
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:40.540]   longest duration of time he's spent anywhere in the Bible.
[00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:42.440]   So the apostle Paul, you've heard of him,
[00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:45.720]   he's sitting up there, he's working in the church in Ephesus
[00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:47.240]   and doing ministry.
[00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:49.980]   And so while he's there, there's a man by the name
[00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:54.400]   of Philemon, who lives in the city of Colossae.
[00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:57.160]   And he decides one day to do what many people did
[00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:59.600]   in this area, and take a trip over to Ephesus.
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:01.800]   He was like to San Diego, we're gonna do shopping
[00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:03.640]   at this port city for a day.
[00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:06.400]   So he takes a trip with his family, they go to Ephesus,
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:08.800]   they're gonna do some shopping in Ephesus,
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:10.000]   for who knows what, pita bread.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   And he's hanging out in Ephesus, and he somehow meets Paul.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.680]   And Philemon becomes a follower of Jesus.
[00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:21.600]   We discover this inside of the book of Philemon.
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:24.840]   And so Philemon meets Paul, he becomes a Christian,
[00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:26.440]   and he and his family go back,
[00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:29.840]   and they start the church in Colossians.
[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:32.800]   And so now, the church is going, and things are going great,
[00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:35.720]   Epaphras, who is in there, is helping along with that.
[00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:37.200]   But Philemon's got this church going thing,
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:40.720]   and while that's taking place, Paul is sent to Rome.
[00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:43.000]   So our next map up there, where Paul,
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.160]   a couple years later, is imprisoned in Rome.
[00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:48.640]   Basically the emperor, and he was awaiting trial for that,
[00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:50.760]   and Paul, you're spreading this movement,
[00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:53.520]   you're going to Rome, he's in government housing,
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:55.600]   under house arrest over there, and he's arrested.
[00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:56.560]   So everybody with me?
[00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:59.320]   So Philemon's in Colossae, Paul's now back in Rome.
[00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:04.560]   And then one day, Philemon goes into his house,
[00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:08.120]   and he discovers two things.
[00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:12.560]   His slave, named Onesimus, this house slave,
[00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.360]   who he provided for and cared for,
[00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:19.800]   had stolen things from him, and had taken off.
[00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:22.160]   Onesimus looks at his master and decides,
[00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:24.920]   you know what, Onesimus is not a believer,
[00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:28.160]   all we know about him is he is a criminal slave
[00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:32.640]   who steals from Philemon, this man who had provided for him,
[00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:35.400]   and he uses that money to finance a trip,
[00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:38.080]   and where do you think he goes?
[00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:42.520]   He goes to the biggest city in the world at the time, Rome.
[00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:47.200]   So Onesimus takes off and journeys all the way to Rome,
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:49.280]   it's like Miami to New York City.
[00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:51.920]   He goes to the Big Apple, he goes to the big city,
[00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:53.040]   there's a million people there,
[00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:54.520]   he's gonna restart his life.
[00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:55.400]   Maybe you've been there before,
[00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:58.200]   you've lived in some small town in the country,
[00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:59.600]   and you decided, I'm gonna move to Dallas
[00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:01.280]   and get a new start, and so Philemon,
[00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:03.760]   or Onesimus decides, I'm gonna go get a new start,
[00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:06.640]   I've got some cash on me, I'm gonna get a fresh start,
[00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:09.040]   and he steals from his master,
[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:13.320]   and goes and runs away to the city of Rome.
[00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:18.320]   But no doubt, Onesimus always looked over his shoulder,
[00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:22.480]   because if you were a runaway slave and you were discovered,
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:24.560]   the penalty was crucifixion.
[00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:25.760]   So he's trying to keep it,
[00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:27.960]   this is like Jean Valjean stuff from Les Mis,
[00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:29.560]   he's trying to keep it a secret,
[00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:32.600]   he's living in this new town, but he's a man with a past,
[00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:36.520]   he's a criminal and he's a runaway rebel.
[00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:37.920]   A man who had turned his back
[00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:40.520]   on the one who had cared for him, Philemon.
[00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:42.920]   A man who had stolen what wasn't his,
[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:46.280]   to go and live and do whatever he wanted to do.
[00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:49.120]   And inside of the city of Rome, this is so crazy,
[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:51.360]   this is in your Bible, you should read your Bible.
[00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:56.360]   Inside of Rome, guess who Onesimus bumps into?
[00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:58.560]   Paul.
[00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:00.600]   How and why, we don't exactly understand,
[00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:02.400]   but inside of this enormous city,
[00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:04.760]   as God's sovereignty is at work,
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:08.000]   Onesimus bumps into none other than the apostle Paul,
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.920]   a million, biggest city in the world.
[00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:15.480]   He bumps into Paul, who's underneath house arrest,
[00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:18.240]   and so we don't understand, maybe he got into trouble,
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:20.760]   and he knew that Paul had been an influence
[00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:22.400]   on his master, Philemon, so he was like,
[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:24.920]   "I'm in trouble, I'll go to Paul, I know he can help me."
[00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:26.080]   We don't know, but we do know
[00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:28.320]   that they bumped into one another,
[00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:33.320]   and Paul begins to explain the gospel to Onesimus.
[00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:35.800]   He begins to explain the cross of Christ,
[00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:40.400]   that Jesus on the cross paid for all mankind's sins,
[00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:42.560]   and anyone who will trust in them
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:46.280]   has all of their sins paid for, past, present, and future,
[00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:48.960]   not by doing anything, just by trusting in him,
[00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:53.960]   and Onesimus accepts Christ and becomes a follower of God.
[00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:56.920]   I mean, this is like a Charles Dickens plot,
[00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:59.200]   it's unbelievable, and so inside of the city,
[00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:01.400]   but here's what's amazing even more about this story,
[00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:04.560]   this criminal man who had done nothing right,
[00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:07.320]   he'd done nothing right, he hadn't returned,
[00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:09.400]   he didn't go back to his master and say, "I'm really sorry,"
[00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:12.600]   and Paul says, "You are totally forgiven, Onesimus.
[00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:14.760]   "You're totally made clean.
[00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:19.760]   "You criminal felon who deserve crucifixion,
[00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:23.000]   "it's been paid for, it's been totally paid for."
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.760]   But God, he's a criminal, he needs to at least go back
[00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:28.840]   and say he's sorry, he needs to make up for it.
[00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:31.720]   He's on Rome's most wanted list,
[00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:35.120]   and God says, "He's been on my most wanted list
[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:39.720]   "since the day he was born, and I've paid for all of it."
[00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:44.600]   And he's totally accepted, totally forgiven,
[00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:46.960]   before he had done anything right.
[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:48.800]   God says, "I love Onesimus.
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:52.240]   "I was crucified so he wouldn't have to be."
[00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:54.800]   And that brings us really to the first point
[00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:56.840]   of tonight's message, of just this idea
[00:16:56.840 --> 00:17:01.560]   that there is no past more powerful
[00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:03.080]   than the forgiveness of God.
[00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:04.760]   There is no past in this room,
[00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:07.000]   there is no present condition in this room,
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.280]   there is nothing that you have done or that I have done
[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:11.800]   that is more powerful than the blood of Jesus.
[00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:14.560]   And here's why I think Onesimus probably could accept
[00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:16.840]   like, "Hey, I'm a criminal, but God forgives me.
[00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:19.480]   "God who is there forgives me,
[00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:20.680]   "despite everything that I've done,
[00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:22.640]   "despite having turned my back on my master,
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:23.840]   "God forgives me."
[00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:28.280]   Because of the man who told him about the forgiveness.
[00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:30.920]   You remember, it was Paul.
[00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:32.040]   But Paul wasn't always Paul,
[00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:34.960]   Paul was the artist formerly known as Saul, right?
[00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:38.720]   Saul was a man who had murdered Christians.
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:41.480]   If anybody can take the excuse off the table of,
[00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:43.520]   "No, but you don't know what I've done.
[00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:45.080]   "God's grace couldn't be enough for me.
[00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:46.240]   "You don't know my past."
[00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:50.280]   There is no past more powerful than God's forgiveness.
[00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:53.320]   And Paul, who had murdered Christians,
[00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:56.640]   says it's been paid for Onesimus,
[00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:58.040]   it's been totally paid for.
[00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:01.120]   I mean, even today,
[00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:03.680]   Paul removes this excuse for anyone in this room
[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:07.120]   who's going, "Yeah, but you don't know what I've done."
[00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:08.880]   A lot of times we'll meet with people down here
[00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:11.200]   and I'll hear that all the time.
[00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:14.240]   "Yeah, but you don't know, it's worse than you think.
[00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:16.720]   "In five years, I've never met with someone
[00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:19.200]   "who has murdered Christians down here."
[00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:22.120]   Maybe you're in the room, but let us know.
[00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:25.080]   (audience laughing)
[00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:25.920]   Bad joke.
[00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:30.760]   But Paul removes that excuse,
[00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:32.080]   that regardless of what you've done,
[00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:35.400]   there is no sin, past, present, future
[00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:37.560]   that is more powerful than the blood of Jesus,
[00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:39.560]   than what Jesus has done on the cross.
[00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:41.760]   If you're going, "No, but I had an abortion.
[00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:44.360]   "I live in a homosexual relationship right now.
[00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:46.000]   "I am addicted to pain meds."
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.400]   Whatever the case is,
[00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:50.880]   there is nothing in your past or your present or future
[00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:53.640]   that is more powerful than the forgiveness of God
[00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:55.480]   if you've trusted in Christ.
[00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:57.920]   That's the message.
[00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:04.160]   There is nothing in your past.
[00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:05.680]   And so remove that off the table
[00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:09.160]   if you're going, "Yeah, but I've done some bad things."
[00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:10.920]   You're worse than you think.
[00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:15.840]   But as bad as you are in reality and I am in reality,
[00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:19.800]   there's no past more powerful than the forgiveness of God.
[00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:22.520]   And he offers it to all of us who will accept it.
[00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:24.480]   And if you have trusted in Christ
[00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:27.920]   and you don't believe your sin is forgiven,
[00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:31.920]   that's like looking God in the face and saying,
[00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:35.040]   "Your son's murder was not enough.
[00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:37.640]   "I need two Jesuses.
[00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:40.200]   "I need Jesus," and you throw in something else.
[00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:42.640]   It wasn't enough.
[00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:49.200]   And Paul to Onesimus says, "It's been paid for.
[00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:52.880]   "You're totally forgiven the moment you accept it,
[00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:57.360]   "the moment you put your trust in what Jesus has done."
[00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:00.040]   Your past doesn't define you, Jesus does.
[00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:06.760]   One day Paul goes to Onesimus and Paul's in prison
[00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:09.320]   and Onesimus is coming back and forth to him
[00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:12.360]   and Paul says, "Onesimus, you gotta go back.
[00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:15.440]   "I want you to go back to Colossae.
[00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:17.880]   "I want you to go back to Philemon."
[00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:20.520]   And Onesimus is going, "No, Paul, I'm gonna be murdered.
[00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:22.280]   "I'll be killed, I'll be crucified."
[00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:25.840]   The most common crucifixions were to slaves,
[00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:27.240]   many of whom had run away.
[00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:28.760]   That was the penalty.
[00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:31.200]   And Paul says, "No, no, no, I want you to go back
[00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:35.240]   "and I'm gonna pay for whatever you've done.
[00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:37.000]   "I'll cover it."
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.480]   And he hands him, along with Tychicus,
[00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:42.480]   who we read of earlier, he gives them these two letters,
[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:46.680]   one named Colossians and one named Philemon.
[00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:50.080]   And he says, "Give this one to the church in Colossians.
[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:51.640]   "Give this one to the church in Colossians,
[00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:54.520]   "but first to Philemon."
[00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:55.960]   And they set off on this journey,
[00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:58.120]   which had to be a long journey for Onesimus,
[00:20:58.120 --> 00:20:59.320]   who's going, "Am I gonna be killed?
[00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:00.520]   "What's gonna happen?"
[00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:04.080]   And when they show up, the letter is handed to Philemon
[00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:05.920]   and I just wanna read you parts of it
[00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:07.960]   that help further unfold this story.
[00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:11.880]   Paul, a prisoner of, this is verse one of Philemon,
[00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:13.800]   if you wanna turn there or you can follow along later.
[00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:18.240]   Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus and Timothy, our brother,
[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:21.080]   to Philemon, our dear friend and fellow worker,
[00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:23.560]   and also to Appiah, who's his wife,
[00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:25.720]   and to Archippus, we read of him earlier,
[00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:27.280]   our fellow soldier,
[00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:30.080]   and to the church that meets in your home.
[00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:33.440]   I prefer to appeal to you on the basis of love, verse nine.
[00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:36.880]   It is none other than Paul, an old man,
[00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:39.480]   and now a prisoner of Christ Jesus,
[00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:42.920]   that I appeal to you for my son, Onesimus.
[00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:45.640]   He became my son, spiritually speaking,
[00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:48.520]   when I was in chains.
[00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:51.440]   Formerly, he was useless to you,
[00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:53.560]   but now he has become useful,
[00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:57.480]   that he's been changed, that he's trusted in Jesus,
[00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:01.200]   and he's a changed man, Philemon, both to you and to me.
[00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:05.840]   I'm sending him, who is my very heart, back to you.
[00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:07.960]   I love this next verse, verse 15.
[00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:10.820]   Perhaps the reason he was separated from you
[00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:15.360]   for a little while was that you may have him back forever.
[00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:17.040]   Perhaps the reason, Philemon,
[00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:19.360]   that God allowed Onesimus to steal from you
[00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:21.480]   and run to the edge of the earth
[00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:23.360]   is in order that he would bump into a man
[00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:25.200]   who would tell him the forgiveness of Christ,
[00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:27.540]   and then he would live forever with you.
[00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:29.240]   Perhaps that's what God was doing,
[00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:31.040]   taking what we intended for evil,
[00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:33.560]   and using it for good, Philemon.
[00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:35.640]   Verse 16, you would have him back forever,
[00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:39.960]   no longer as a slave, but better than a slave,
[00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:41.160]   as a dear brother.
[00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:43.920]   He's very dear to me and even dearer to you,
[00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:47.000]   both as a fellow man and as a brother in the Lord,
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.240]   this criminal convict.
[00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:56.160]   If he has done anything wrong or owes you anything,
[00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:58.400]   charge it to me.
[00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:01.880]   I, Paul, write this with my own hand.
[00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:03.240]   I will pay it back.
[00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:05.400]   Oh my gosh, I love that.
[00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:08.400]   Here's what's so powerful about this story.
[00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:12.880]   We're all Onesimuses.
[00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:17.040]   That's your story and my story.
[00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:20.360]   Just like Paul said, I will pay it.
[00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:23.260]   Whatever he's done, I didn't do it, but I will pay for it.
[00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:25.040]   Martin Luther said the story of Onesimus
[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:26.440]   is the story of the gospel.
[00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:29.800]   He steps in and Jesus says, I will pay for it.
[00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:33.480]   Let them go free and crucify me.
[00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:35.760]   I'll pay for it, because here's our second point.
[00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:40.040]   Jesus loves the runaway, like you.
[00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:44.200]   Jesus loves runaways like you and like me.
[00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:47.840]   And the story of Onesimus is a man who stole,
[00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:49.400]   took what didn't belong to him.
[00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:52.000]   Just like you taking your life
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.320]   and living it any way you want,
[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:56.160]   that's taking what does not belong to you to God,
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:58.800]   from God, who says, you are mine.
[00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:00.000]   You're on borrowed time.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.320]   Taking what doesn't belong to you,
[00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:04.920]   turning his back on his master.
[00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:05.960]   That's what Onesimus did.
[00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:08.340]   The story of us all is turning our back.
[00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:09.920]   This is the story of the Bible.
[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:13.240]   Ever since the beginning, man has been turning his back
[00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:16.080]   on his master or on God, saying, I'm gonna live
[00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:17.680]   whatever I wanna do, do it my way.
[00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:19.640]   From the very beginning, the Garden of Eden
[00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:21.560]   is the story of man and woman saying,
[00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:24.280]   God, I can do it my own way.
[00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:25.280]   I know what I'm gonna do.
[00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:26.320]   I know better than you do.
[00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:29.600]   And turning their back on God, running from God,
[00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:31.680]   running from him.
[00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:36.480]   And yet the story inside of the Bible tells us
[00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:37.640]   that what does God do?
[00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:41.100]   God looks down at humanity who is running away from him.
[00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:44.420]   God looks down at you and me who are running away from him.
[00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:46.360]   And does he get angry?
[00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:47.920]   Does he say, I'm just gonna destroy you?
[00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:50.060]   I'm God.
[00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:51.560]   You think you know better?
[00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:53.600]   And what does he do?
[00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:55.240]   What does the heart of God move him to do?
[00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:58.280]   He becomes a man, takes on the form of man,
[00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:00.800]   says, I will die for these people.
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:03.280]   I will die for the runaway so that the runaway goes free.
[00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:05.080]   Like Paul said, I'll pay for it.
[00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:07.560]   Jesus said, I will pay for it.
[00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:10.360]   How amazing is this God?
[00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:12.520]   That when he looks at his enemies,
[00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:15.800]   those who have run from him, he says, I'll pay for it.
[00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:18.560]   The probably best verse that I know that displays this
[00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:22.160]   is Romans five, where it says this in verse six and eight.
[00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:27.660]   For while we were still weak, at the right time,
[00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:29.320]   Christ died for the ungodly.
[00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:34.040]   Verse eight, verse, God, but God demonstrates his love
[00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:37.600]   for us in this, in that while we were still sinners,
[00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:41.280]   Christ died for us.
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:44.420]   While we were running ungodly, unaware,
[00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:47.080]   enemies and thieves, Jesus stepped in and said,
[00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:48.880]   I will pay for it.
[00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:50.040]   And why did he do it?
[00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:54.220]   Love, love for you and for me.
[00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:58.260]   The idea of this God being a God who dies for his enemies,
[00:25:58.260 --> 00:26:00.640]   he dies for those who oppose him.
[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:02.380]   This is who God is.
[00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:04.780]   He's a God of incredible love that moves them
[00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:06.260]   when the worst are at their worst.
[00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:09.560]   When they're running from God, he says, I'll die for them.
[00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:10.600]   What kind of God is this?
[00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:12.160]   You study other religions,
[00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:14.080]   you don't find a God represented like this.
[00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:17.540]   You see in Islam, hey, if anyone doesn't believe in Allah,
[00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:20.460]   kill them in the Quran.
[00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:22.660]   You see in other religious texts from other religions
[00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:25.380]   and other anxious Jewish writings outside the Bible,
[00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:27.540]   they speak of do not help your enemies.
[00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:30.480]   God's a God who says, I'll die for my enemies.
[00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:31.980]   What kind of love is that?
[00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:34.520]   I love Onesimus.
[00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:39.980]   I love you, David, I love you, Alex.
[00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:46.300]   This is the God who is there, a God who dies for the worst
[00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:47.820]   when they're at their worst,
[00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:49.800]   before they could do anything right,
[00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:51.260]   when they're still sinners.
[00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:55.700]   And if you're in the room and you struggle like I do
[00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:58.500]   to just believe that, yeah, I know God can love me
[00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:00.620]   and that's gonna get me in, but now I really,
[00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:01.660]   if I'm gonna make him love me,
[00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:04.820]   I need to try a little harder and have more quiet times.
[00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:06.300]   It's insane.
[00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:07.660]   That's insane thinking.
[00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:10.540]   God is a God who dies for his enemies,
[00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:15.420]   not just for fun, but because he loves them.
[00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:17.740]   What kind of God is this?
[00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:20.200]   It's the God who is there in the story of Onesimus
[00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:21.960]   throughout time has echoed the story
[00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:24.080]   of the God who loves the runaway.
[00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:26.120]   Jesus loves the runaway.
[00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:28.760]   And I'll step in and I'll take what they deserve.
[00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:30.200]   Crucify me, not them.
[00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:36.000]   All right, point three.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.280]   Rough transition, okay.
[00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:43.320]   (audience applauding)
[00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:46.920]   All right, more bad transitions.
[00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:49.940]   Point three.
[00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:53.220]   The final point I just see in this amazing story
[00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:56.580]   is your past is often God's greatest platform
[00:27:56.580 --> 00:27:58.300]   for the ministry you're gonna have.
[00:27:58.300 --> 00:27:59.980]   The past that you right now have,
[00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:04.620]   the past that you, when you look back behind you have
[00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:07.020]   is your greatest platform for ministry.
[00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:07.860]   That's what God does.
[00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:10.980]   He takes the story, he takes what we intend for evil,
[00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:12.500]   and he turns it for our good.
[00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:18.080]   Onesimus comes back home,
[00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:21.080]   and we're told in church history
[00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:23.280]   that Philemon takes him and welcomes him in,
[00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:25.280]   forgives him, and restores him,
[00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:28.000]   which must have been so powerful to the Colossian church.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.380]   Wait, Onesimus is back?
[00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:30.380]   Why is he back?
[00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:31.840]   Was he led back and changed?
[00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:34.160]   Did they arrest him and bring him back?
[00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:35.920]   No, he chose.
[00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:37.200]   He came.
[00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:38.820]   He wasn't forced.
[00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:40.020]   Well, why would he come?
[00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:43.000]   Because he'd been changed.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:43.960]   He trusted in Christ.
[00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:46.840]   How much does that testify to the power of Christ
[00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:50.240]   inside of someone's life to change?
[00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:52.880]   And Onesimus comes back in, and he was a changed man.
[00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:55.320]   And not only that, gosh, I love this part of the story.
[00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:56.640]   It's so good.
[00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:58.160]   Hopefully it's somebody else but me.
[00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:01.640]   And not only that, here's what happens next.
[00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:03.600]   Onesimus goes back to the church.
[00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:06.160]   He's totally forgiven and accepted.
[00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:07.720]   And he's there inside a Colossae,
[00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:10.720]   and something happens about seven years later.
[00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:12.640]   And you could put that map back up there.
[00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:15.200]   At Colossae, we know in 67 AD,
[00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:17.040]   there was an earthquake that destroyed.
[00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:18.680]   So that was about 61 AD.
[00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:24.760]   67 years later, in 67 AD, an earthquake destroyed Colossae.
[00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:26.200]   It was totally destroyed.
[00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:27.920]   To this day, it hasn't been rebuilt.
[00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:31.340]   So everyone that lived there relocated to different cities.
[00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:33.200]   Many of them went to Ephesus.
[00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:37.400]   Among them was a man named Onesimus.
[00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:39.560]   Onesimus relocates to Ephesus,
[00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:41.120]   and he's trying to live out this new life
[00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:43.080]   and get used to the new port city of Ephesus,
[00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:45.800]   which is pretty cool, it's on the coast.
[00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:48.520]   And he's living there, and he joins the church that's there.
[00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:50.400]   And here's what's so cool about the church in Ephesus.
[00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:53.280]   Scholars, if you study or like to study this stuff,
[00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:57.040]   across the board will say Ephesus, around this time,
[00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:59.080]   and especially at the end of the first century,
[00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:01.840]   was the most important church in the ancient world.
[00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:04.880]   When Rome came in and took Jerusalem down,
[00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:06.400]   and they basically destroyed Jerusalem,
[00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:07.640]   the church there spread out,
[00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:10.360]   and Ephesus became a hub of influence
[00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:12.880]   and the most important church in the ancient world.
[00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:14.860]   So Onesimus is part of a really cool church.
[00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:15.700]   He's joining it.
[00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:18.200]   It was the largest church in the thousands.
[00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:20.600]   And he joins us, and he's a part of this group
[00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:22.560]   who's led by the apostle John.
[00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:24.680]   Remember John, who was close to Jesus?
[00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:27.060]   He watched Mary, Jesus' mom.
[00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:28.440]   So John's in Ephesus.
[00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:29.280]   He's leading the church.
[00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:30.520]   Mary's there with him.
[00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:32.380]   And we're told a lot of this is coming
[00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:33.760]   from the church father's writings,
[00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:35.320]   which is around this time.
[00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:36.520]   And so they're leading the church,
[00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:39.580]   and Onesimus is there, and then John dies.
[00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:41.700]   And they look around and they go,
[00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:43.620]   who should we replace John with?
[00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:46.340]   How do you go after that?
[00:30:46.340 --> 00:30:48.220]   And they decide Timothy.
[00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:50.440]   Oh, of course it's gotta be Timothy.
[00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:53.820]   I mean, Timothy is like, he's the protege of Paul.
[00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:55.700]   Of course, he's Batman and Robin.
[00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:56.520]   We got Robin.
[00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:57.360]   This is awesome.
[00:30:57.360 --> 00:30:59.660]   And so Timothy becomes the head pastor
[00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:02.340]   of the most influential church in the ancient world.
[00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:05.780]   And then in around 110 AD,
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:11.700]   Timothy is killed by a mob in the streets of Ephesus.
[00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:18.700]   And in deciding who should we replace Timothy with,
[00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:22.200]   God moves the hearts of whoever made the decision
[00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:23.300]   or whoever was there.
[00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:27.640]   And he was replaced by a man named Onesimus.
[00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:32.960]   This convicted criminal runaway slave,
[00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:34.760]   a rebel who turned his back,
[00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:39.280]   who turned his back on those who had cared for him,
[00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:42.040]   is now running the largest church in the world.
[00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:44.040]   He becomes the lead pastor.
[00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:45.560]   I mean, how insane is that?
[00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:48.040]   God takes this mess of a life,
[00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:49.560]   and he makes a missionary out of him.
[00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:50.740]   Who's gonna lead the biggest,
[00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:53.680]   most important church in the world, God?
[00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:54.520]   Onesimus.
[00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:57.400]   A man with a past.
[00:31:57.400 --> 00:32:01.280]   But a man who's been changed.
[00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:03.680]   God takes mess and makes it a missionary.
[00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:04.780]   It's amazing.
[00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:06.960]   But it's really nothing different
[00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:08.620]   than what God's been doing all along,
[00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:10.040]   and God continues to do,
[00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:12.320]   and is doing today all over our ministry.
[00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:15.480]   Honestly, that's what we see God doing in spite of us,
[00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:18.160]   is he takes messes and he makes them into missionaries.
[00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:19.060]   That's what God does.
[00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:20.360]   And if you're in the room and you're going,
[00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:21.640]   man, I am a mess.
[00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:23.480]   Okay, none of this is really applicable to me.
[00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:24.680]   Onesimus, who's that?
[00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:25.520]   If you're in the room going,
[00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:27.640]   you don't know what I've done,
[00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:28.480]   here's what I do know.
[00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:30.320]   You'll probably be the best missionary we have
[00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:32.000]   out of this entire group.
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:32.880]   That's what God does.
[00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:34.600]   He takes messes and makes them missionaries.
[00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:37.280]   Here, we could go for a while here,
[00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:38.360]   depending on how much time we have.
[00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:39.240]   Ali Wall.
[00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:43.720]   Ali is a girl who directs and leads the women at the porch.
[00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:45.640]   Ali's one of the most trusted people we have
[00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:46.600]   inside of our ministry.
[00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:48.440]   Ali was a girl who, when she came here,
[00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:49.960]   she had run from a past.
[00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:52.400]   She was numbing her pain through partying.
[00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:54.160]   She was a divorcee with an abortion
[00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:56.480]   who wouldn't wanna ever talk to anybody about it,
[00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:57.840]   who was running and hiding.
[00:32:57.840 --> 00:33:02.800]   And then she had countered the love of the same God
[00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:05.520]   that changed Onesimus and it changed Ali.
[00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:09.120]   Lance Throku, who did announcements in Dallas, Fort Worth.
[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:11.780]   And Lance was up here a few minutes ago doing announcements.
[00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:13.240]   Lance was the guy who threw the party
[00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:14.600]   for the who's who in Dallas.
[00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:16.040]   Lance was the guy that if you didn't know Lance,
[00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:17.200]   you probably weren't in the who's who.
[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:18.580]   He was the guy that threw the party
[00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:19.720]   for everyone on the scene.
[00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:21.720]   That's literally what he did for a living.
[00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:24.120]   I don't mean like, yeah, we're doing a barbecue at my house.
[00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:27.280]   He threw parties in clubs for people for a living.
[00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:29.360]   Now Lance is one of the most influential volunteers
[00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:31.680]   we have who throws the parties here for the porch.
[00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:34.800]   He takes prodigal sons and he throws parties for prodigals
[00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:37.400]   to come home to their father who loves them all the time.
[00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:38.280]   That's what God does.
[00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:40.920]   He takes messes and he makes missionaries out of them.
[00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:45.700]   JP, you can clap, but JP, look at JP.
[00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:47.880]   I mean, 10 years ago, you look at JP's story,
[00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:49.920]   a porn addict who's a manipulator,
[00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:53.260]   who now runs the largest young adult ministry in the world.
[00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:56.880]   Man, how amazing is this God?
[00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:59.040]   That's just what he does.
[00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:01.800]   He takes messes and he makes missionaries out of them.
[00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:03.840]   JP's one of the godliest men I know,
[00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:05.120]   and he tells this story, and I'm like,
[00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:07.160]   really, really, you did that?
[00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:08.320]   I can never imagine you.
[00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:10.240]   Bottle service, what is bottle service?
[00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:14.540]   Church kid, hashtag, okay.
[00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:17.320]   That's just what God does.
[00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:20.040]   And he takes church kids who are prideful,
[00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:22.600]   arrogant, stuck up men, and he continues
[00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:25.720]   to soften their heart and make them a little less prideful.
[00:34:25.720 --> 00:34:27.640]   He takes messes and he makes missionaries,
[00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:29.360]   and that's what he wants to do in your life.
[00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:30.560]   That's what he's always been about,
[00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:31.960]   and that's the story of Onesimus.
[00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:34.320]   And I'll just close with this, 'cause,
[00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:35.600]   in fact, let me read the last thing
[00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:37.240]   about Onesimus' change.
[00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:42.040]   This is from Ignatius, who writes about Onesimus,
[00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:43.360]   and he writes about this pastor
[00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:45.800]   who's been placed to lead the biggest church.
[00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:46.840]   Here's what he says.
[00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:50.620]   "I received," this is Ignatius in 111 AD.
[00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:53.020]   He was a church leader, and he wrote a letter
[00:34:53.020 --> 00:34:54.660]   to the church in Ephesus, and here's what he said.
[00:34:54.660 --> 00:34:55.720]   This is in the Bible.
[00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:59.420]   You can Google it later, Ignatius to the Ephesians.
[00:34:59.420 --> 00:35:02.940]   "In God's name, therefore, I received your large congregation
[00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:07.400]   "and the person of Onesimus, your bishop in this world."
[00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:12.240]   Here's how he describes this criminal, hardened slave
[00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:14.700]   years later as an old man,
[00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:19.360]   "a man whose love is beyond words.
[00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:20.980]   "My prayer is that you should love him
[00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:22.400]   "in the spirit of Jesus Christ
[00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:25.400]   "and all be like him, Onesimus."
[00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:27.560]   Ephesian church, biggest church in the world.
[00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:29.260]   I want you to be like your pastor.
[00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:31.940]   That's what God does.
[00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:35.480]   Shortly after that, he's martyred for his faith.
[00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:40.440]   This mess of God made a pastor
[00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:42.880]   of the biggest church in the world.
[00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:45.220]   And I think what,
[00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:49.360]   I'll read the final verses of the letter
[00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:50.920]   as we wrap up Colossians.
[00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:52.100]   This is verse 16.
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:57.820]   "After this letter," Colossians, "is read to you,
[00:35:57.820 --> 00:36:01.880]   "see that it is also read in the church of the Laodiceans."
[00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:05.400]   So after you read this letter, the Colossian letter,
[00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:07.440]   I want you to take it to the church in Laodicea,
[00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:09.560]   which is just a small drive away,
[00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:11.280]   or a small camel ride away,
[00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:14.080]   and I want you to have them read it while they're there.
[00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:17.780]   "And see in turn that you read the letter
[00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:19.400]   "to the Laodiceans."
[00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:23.260]   Wait, there's another letter, Paul?
[00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:27.100]   There's another letter, but we don't have it.
[00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:28.220]   It wasn't preserved yet.
[00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:31.460]   There's New Testament writings that we don't have,
[00:36:31.460 --> 00:36:32.580]   or they're not a part of the New Testament.
[00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:33.900]   They were letters written by apostles,
[00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:35.700]   and God chose in his sovereignty.
[00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:37.540]   I'm not gonna have you preserve them.
[00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:42.100]   Verse 17, "Tell Archippus,
[00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:44.100]   "'See to it that you complete the ministry
[00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:45.120]   "'you've received from the Lord.
[00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:47.880]   "'I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand.
[00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:49.700]   "'Remember my chains.
[00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:50.900]   "'Grace be with you.'"
[00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:55.740]   I think what stands out to me, and it's so powerful,
[00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:56.780]   is I was thinking this week,
[00:36:56.780 --> 00:36:58.300]   like, why do we not have that letter?
[00:36:58.300 --> 00:36:59.360]   That's weird.
[00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:00.780]   Why, God, would you not want us?
[00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:03.260]   Maybe it was something in there that was said,
[00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:04.860]   but that led me to this thought.
[00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:08.100]   Why do we have the letter of Philemon?
[00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:12.260]   Why, Colossians, what made you choose those?
[00:37:12.260 --> 00:37:13.940]   Why would you choose Philemon,
[00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:16.180]   which is sent together with Colossians?
[00:37:16.180 --> 00:37:17.400]   Why would you choose that one?
[00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:19.180]   It's written about a slave and a master.
[00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:22.140]   That's gonna be really irrelevant to us
[00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:23.740]   for hundreds of centuries,
[00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:25.500]   who in the West don't have slavery,
[00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:27.460]   so it won't be really universally applicable.
[00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:31.420]   Why would you save this slave letter, Paul, or God?
[00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:33.700]   And then it hit me.
[00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:36.540]   If we didn't have that letter,
[00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:40.220]   we wouldn't know the story of Onesimus.
[00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:42.020]   We would not know the story of the man
[00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:44.320]   who pastored the largest church in the world.
[00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:47.580]   We would not know the story of the runaway slave criminal
[00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:49.260]   who had turned his back on God,
[00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:51.020]   who had turned his back on his master,
[00:37:51.020 --> 00:37:53.300]   and who God stepped in and said,
[00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:58.300]   "I love you, I've died for you, and I'll change you."
[00:37:58.300 --> 00:38:00.140]   And that's exactly what happened.
[00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:02.420]   We wouldn't have the story, we wouldn't know.
[00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:03.540]   And it's though what God said,
[00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:06.520]   I want you to know that I'm a God who loves the runaway.
[00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:11.620]   I'm a God who wants you to know that I take messes
[00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:14.840]   and I turn 'em into missionaries.
[00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:17.140]   I don't know of another story outside of Paul.
[00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:19.380]   That's as powerful and compelling,
[00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:21.220]   and arguably, this one's even more.
[00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:23.620]   A slave criminal becomes the head pastor
[00:38:23.620 --> 00:38:25.380]   of the largest church in the world.
[00:38:25.380 --> 00:38:28.620]   That's how our God works.
[00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:29.980]   That's just what God does.
[00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:31.620]   The God who dies for his enemies,
[00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:34.460]   who goes after the runaway,
[00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:38.700]   and he'll never stop running after you.
[00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:39.900]   And the moment you turn,
[00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:42.340]   which is exactly what Onesimus did,
[00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:45.500]   you're not met with anger and condemnation,
[00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:48.860]   you're met with the love of the God
[00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:53.380]   whose hands tell the story of his love for you, Scars.
[00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:57.300]   The moment that you turn,
[00:38:57.300 --> 00:38:59.860]   that's all repenting is, is it's turning.
[00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:03.380]   As far as Onesimus ran, he did not run from God,
[00:39:03.380 --> 00:39:05.340]   and the moment he turned, he was there.
[00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:11.340]   Some of you in the room are running, and you know you are.
[00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:13.100]   And what I want you to know more than anything
[00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:14.860]   is that God has not given up on you.
[00:39:15.860 --> 00:39:19.900]   And the moment you turn from that relationship,
[00:39:19.900 --> 00:39:21.820]   addiction, the moment, and by turn,
[00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:24.500]   I don't even mean stop it, that's not what I'm saying.
[00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:28.500]   I'm saying you go, God, help me, I can't stop.
[00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:31.980]   I need you, I'm not gonna make it on my own, I need you.
[00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:37.100]   In that moment, that's what repentance is.
[00:39:37.100 --> 00:39:40.100]   If it's just based on you, there's no hope,
[00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:41.220]   there's no change.
[00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:45.340]   We don't gather here to worship and sing,
[00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:46.620]   and then we stopped.
[00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:50.620]   Worship the only one who can help, the only one who saves,
[00:39:50.620 --> 00:39:52.300]   the God who dies for his enemies,
[00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:56.060]   the God who brings change to those who will trust
[00:39:56.060 --> 00:39:59.140]   and just accept and turn to him and his love.
[00:39:59.140 --> 00:40:01.060]   I'm gonna pray that we do that tonight.
[00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:04.900]   Father, we love you, and we thank you.
[00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:08.220]   I thank you just for the story of Onesimus,
[00:40:08.220 --> 00:40:09.660]   the story that you preserved.
[00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:12.980]   I thank you that you're the God who chases
[00:40:12.980 --> 00:40:17.020]   after runaways like me, chases after my heart that runs,
[00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:19.820]   that thinks I should turn my back on you,
[00:40:19.820 --> 00:40:22.780]   and you step in and you change everything.
[00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:24.540]   Thank you that in your wisdom and your love,
[00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:28.580]   you preserve this incredible story for us
[00:40:28.580 --> 00:40:30.220]   in the book of Colossians.
[00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:34.980]   I pray for anyone in this room right now who's just running.
[00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:36.500]   God, would you make 'em tired?
[00:40:38.180 --> 00:40:42.020]   And would they come to you and find hope and love
[00:40:42.020 --> 00:40:44.540]   and no condemnation?
[00:40:44.540 --> 00:40:49.220]   Thank you for Jesus who bled so we didn't have to
[00:40:49.220 --> 00:40:50.860]   and don't have to.
[00:40:50.860 --> 00:40:52.980]   Thank you that you're a God who dies for your enemies,
[00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:56.460]   who loves the worst when they're at their worst.
