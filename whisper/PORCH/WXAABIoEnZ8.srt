00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 [MUSIC]

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 >> That was awesome.

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 I haven't seen that yet.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 I've been gone the last couple weeks.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 What's up, friends in the room?

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 What's up, friends in Fort Worth and in Houston and downtown?

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 It is going to be such a fun night, and I am so glad to get to watch it along with you

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 and be back hanging out with you guys as we continue the series A.D.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 I'm going to start with a little bit of a story.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 Do you guys remember swine flu?

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 Anybody remember this, when somehow pigs ended up spreading a virus throughout America?

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 And the swine flu -- anybody get swine flu in here?

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 Anybody?

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 Oh, yeah.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Hey, I like that.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 Okay.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 So I'm going to tell a story of my only interaction with it.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 I was here on staff at Watermark, and I just started here.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 I was part-time here.

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 I was at Dallas Seminary or grad school, and so I was part-time here, and I had a job at this coffee shop.

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 So I spent my time in one of three places, working at the coffee shop, in class at DTS or Dallas Seminary,

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 or here at Watermark working part-time, one of those three places.

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 All of a sudden, one day, I go to the coffee shop.

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 I'm working there, barista, making some lattes,

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 and I start feeling a little sick, got a cough, got something going on, headache.

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 You know when you, like, start to feel achy, and you're like, "Man, something is about to hit me like a freight train.

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 I feel it coming."

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 That's where I am.

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 I'm at the coffee shop.

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 Man, something's not going well.

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 I'm not feeling good.

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 Go to class that day, continue to not feel good, can't focus, go back to Watermark, working here.

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 I'm like, "I got to go home.

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 I do not feel good."

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 I don't have insurance at this time.

37
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 Hashtag Obamacare didn't exist.

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 And so I go to a doc in the box to get treated by -- that's not a political statement, by the way, just saying I didn't have insurance.

39
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 I go to a doc in the box.

40
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 I go in there.

41
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 He begins to take temperature, do all these different things.

42
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 He comes back in the room and begins to say, "Well, I can tell you why you're not feeling well.

43
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 You have the swine flu and strep throat at the same time."

44
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 Yeah, talk about a bad day.

45
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 So I get loaded up on all kinds of meds.

46
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 He's like, "Hey, an antibiotic.

47
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 We're going to give you a Z-Pak, but we really can't.

48
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 You just got to ride out the swine flu, go home, crush some Gatorade, and relax for a few days."

49
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 So I go home.

50
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 I'm taking the Z-Pak.

51
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 I'm trying to rest.

52
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 I'm letting everybody know, "Hey, can't work today, and I got to go home and rest."

53
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 A couple days go by.

54
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 I'm beginning to feel a little bit better, and I think, "Oh, no, I need to work or else I can't pay bills.

55
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 And so I need to go to this coffee shop and make some cash."

56
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 Call them up.

57
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 "Hey, I'm ready to come back into work feeling a lot better."

58
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 They say, "Look, don't show up here for another 7 to 10 days.

59
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 You had the swine flu.

60
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 Don't bring that contagion in here.

61
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 Go get well before you can come back in here."

62
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 And I'm like, "No, I really am feeling better.

63
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 We do not want you handing out swine flu lattes.

64
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 You go home.

65
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 You get feeling better.

66
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 Don't come in here for another 7 to 10 days," which was kind of the length of a period of time of contagiousness.

67
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 I'm like, "Great, unbelievable."

68
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 So I call, and I get ready to go to class.

69
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 I get an email from Dallas Seminary, from the grad school that says, "If you have been infected with the swine flu, do not attempt to come on campus."

70
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 It's like, "What?

71
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 Unbelievable.

72
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 What kind of seminary is this place?

73
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 Don't come here for 7 to 10 days until after."

74
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 I'm like, "Well, I'll go to Watermark, a church.

75
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 They'll accept me."

76
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 At Watermark, I contact them, and they're like, "No, you cannot come here.

77
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 Go home.

78
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 Get well.

79
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 Don't come in here until you get well.

80
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 Get over this sickness.

81
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 Stay out of here 7 to 10 days."

82
00:03:51,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 So I end up having to work and do everything from Panera, the island of misfit toys, all by myself, working there for the next 7 to 10 days.

83
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 I just remember being like, "Man, people do not want to be around me.

84
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 This is unbelievable.

85
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 I got the plague.

86
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 I am just this outcast."

87
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 I'm like, "Extra, extroverted.

88
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 Anybody extroverted in the room?"

89
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 So I'm like, "This was a miserable 7 to 10 days in my life where I'm like, 'Please, someone be my friend.'"

90
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 So for the next 7 to 10 days, I'm waiting so I can get well to go back into normal life, to get clean before I can reenter into these three places.

91
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 The reason you may be going, "What does swine flu have to do with the Bible?"

92
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 Nothing.

93
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 I just had to get that off my chest about this.

94
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 That's not it at all.

95
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 I'm totally kidding.

96
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 The reason I started with that is because just like in that scenario where I had this sickness or something about me where everywhere that I looked,

97
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 people were like, "Hey, get well.

98
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 Don't come back here until you're healthy.

99
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 Get clean and then you can come back in, but not until then."

100
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 As it relates to church, as it relates to Christianity, really, one of the more common beliefs or common perceptions that people have, you may have,

101
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 and maybe this is why for a while you had a season where you didn't go to church, is you thought that in order to come inside, you had to get clean,

102
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 not physically sick over swine flu, but spiritually.

103
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 You had to stop struggling.

104
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 You had to get over the struggles, the hurts, habits, the hangups, whatever it was.

105
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 Before you could come into the church, you had to really clean it up and get it together.

106
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 Whether it's the fault of the church or really just your misperception or misstep on the church's fault, it's not at all what the church was ever intended to be.

107
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 More common even than that belief, they're like, "Man, in order to be a part of church, you've got to really be cleaned up and get it together."

108
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 Even more common than that false idea is that in order to have a relationship with God, you have to get it cleaned up.

109
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 You have to be cleaned up and have your life together.

110
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 One of the more common beliefs really in our country, and I would guess if you guys are honest in this room, is that in order to have a relationship with God,

111
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 like when God looks down, if I'm going to have a relationship with him, if he's going to accept me, then I have to have my act together.

112
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 I've got to get it cleaned up.

113
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 When God looks at me, he's probably a little disappointed, saying, "Hey, get it together and then we can talk.

114
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 Get your life in order and then we can have a relationship."

115
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 If that's what you believe, even at a micro level, you have either misunderstood something about God or you don't know him at all.

116
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 Tonight, we're going to explore what I mean by that because we're going to be introduced to Jesus, God in a bod on the planet.

117
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 God comes down, puts flesh on, he stands around, shows us what God is like, and he's going to display for us that if you believe that God is a God who says,

118
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 "Get it together before me and you can talk," you have not been introduced to the God who's there.

119
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 So tonight, hopefully, will be your chance to encounter him.

120
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 We're continuing AD.

121
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 AD stands for the year of our Lord, where we are basically going through the New Testament.

122
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 We're looking at snapshots of people and their encounter with Jesus.

123
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 JP, two weeks ago, taught on the Rich Young Ruler.

124
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 If you do not have the Porch app or you weren't here that night, go download the Porch app.

125
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 You can go re-listen to that message.

126
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 And last week's on another story of a man called the Garrison Demoniac.

127
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 And if you don't know what that is, go listen to it.

128
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 And both those messages were incredible.

129
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 Would highly encourage you to go listen to them.

130
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 Tonight, we're going to continue this series as we look at men and women who encountered Christ in hopes that we will encounter him for the first time.

131
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 Or maybe in a fresh way.

132
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 So we're going to be in Matthew chapter 8.

133
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 If you have a Bible, flip open to Matthew chapter 8.

134
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 Matthew, the very first book of the New Testament.

135
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 We're going to explore a story of a guy.

136
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 We're going to look at four verses.

137
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 I'm going to walk you through his story.

138
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 We're going to read his story.

139
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 And then we're really going to talk about some of our story inside of it.

140
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 So Matthew chapter 8.

141
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 Matthew is a gospel.

142
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 That means good news.

143
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 It was Matthew's account of just the life of Jesus.

144
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 Matthew was a disciple of Jesus.

145
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 Matthew 8.

146
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 So that's kind of what this book is.

147
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 If you want to know, like, where are we in the book?

148
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 If I started the 8th chapter of a book, where would we be?

149
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 What just happened in Matthew chapters 5 through 7 was something called the Sermon on the Mount.

150
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 Jesus just taught the most famous sermon in human history.

151
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 And he's with this huge crowd on this mountainside.

152
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 He begins to walk down the mountain.

153
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 And that's where we are in this story.

154
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 Verse 1 of chapter 8.

155
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 When Jesus came down from the mountainside, large crowds followed him.

156
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 A man with leprosy came and knelt before him and said, "Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean."

157
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 Jesus reached out his hand to this leper, and he touched the man.

158
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 "I am willing," he said.

159
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 "Be clean."

160
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 Immediately, he was cleansed of his leprosy.

161
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 Then Jesus said to him, "See that you don't tell anyone, but go and show yourself to the priest and offer the gift Moses commanded as a testimony to them."

162
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 So Jesus teaches the Sermon on the Mount, comes down the mountain.

163
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 He's with the crowd.

164
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 All of a sudden, the crowd begins to part because this leper shows up out of nowhere.

165
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 He throws himself at the feet of Jesus.

166
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 Luke tells us he's not just a leper.

167
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 He is full of leprosy.

168
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 Luke was a physician.

169
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 If you don't know that, Luke wrote another gospel, and Luke was a doctor.

170
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 He was a physician.

171
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 So he's like, "Hey, time out.

172
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 Let me give you a medical opinion.

173
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 This dude was full of leprosy, not just a little rash.

174
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 I mean, it was everywhere."

175
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 And so we're told that this man covered in leprosy throws himself at Jesus' feet, begins begging, "Lord, if you were willing, you could heal my leprosy."

176
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 Jesus reaches out and touches the man, and he's healed.

177
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 And Jesus says, "I'm willing.

178
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 Be clean."

179
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 And immediately, the leprosy leaves, and Jesus tells him, "Hey, go and tell the priest or show yourself to the priest, and don't tell anyone else."

180
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 The reason Jesus didn't want him to tell is because Jesus didn't show up to be universal health care.

181
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 He came for a purpose.

182
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 He didn't want the miracles to get in the way of the message.

183
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 He didn't want everywhere he went for people to just be handing for free handouts.

184
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 He came to die.

185
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 He came for a purpose.

186
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 So he tells him, "Go and show yourself to the priest who would allow him to reenter into society."

187
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 It's an amazing story.

188
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 But the reason why we picked this story is because it's so much more than maybe what originally meets the eye.

189
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 Not only in the details that we're going to talk about of what just happened in a more full version, but inside of this story is your story and my story.

190
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 And I believe the reason it is in the New Testament and even placed the way and place that it is inside of the gospel narrative right after the Sermon on the Mount is because it shows us that.

191
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 And I'll tell you what I mean here in a second.

192
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 So we're going to look at three ways that this foreshadows, really parallels our story.

193
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 If you're ever going to know the God who doesn't say you need to clean yourself up before I will touch you and interact with you.

194
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 But before that, we're going to look at just the leprosy because you may be going, "Wait, what is leprosy?

195
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 I don't even know what leprosy is."

196
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 Nobody in here ever said, "Hey, who's had leprosy before?"

197
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 Probably not a lot of show of hands like chickenpox.

198
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 It's not a very common thing in our context where people have leprosy.

199
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 But here's what we know about leprosy.

200
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 Leprosy was a much more common disease in the first century.

201
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 Leprosy defined this guy's life.

202
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 Physically, like here's what's crazy about leprosy.

203
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 Even in studying this week, I thought it was like a rash on the outside.

204
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 This is a disease that comes into your body and kills you from the inside.

205
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 It literally takes over your nervous system.

206
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 It takes over different cells and it begins to war against your own body and kill you.

207
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 I thought about showing pictures of leprosy.

208
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 So we go, "Man, here's what full leprosy would have looked like."

209
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 This man that came out of nowhere and everyone gasped, "Ah, get away. Here's what it would look like."

210
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 But the pictures, honestly, I was like, they were too graphic.

211
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 This is a man who his face was deformed.

212
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 His limbs, what happens is your fingers begin to fall off.

213
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 Your nose eventually falls off.

214
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 You lose your voice in the same way that it was.

215
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 It takes over your vocal cords and you have a hoarse voice from there.

216
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 Eventually you go blind. It was incurable.

217
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 You were essentially, Josephus, a Jewish historian at this time, said, "Lepers are walking dead men.

218
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 They must be treated as walking dead men."

219
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 This man dealt with incredible pain for a very long time because it doesn't rapidly develop.

220
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 It was a disease that progressed over time, so to be full of it meant he had suffered for many years.

221
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 It numbed your senses so you could no longer feel things.

222
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 You would burn your hands, burn things, and not be able to feel it.

223
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 This life physically, or his life physically, was deeply impacted by this.

224
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 Not only that, though, but probably the worst thing about being a leper is you are outcast.

225
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 Like that little experience of like swine flu, "Hey guys, can I come inside?"

226
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 That little experience that I had was this man's life.

227
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 One day he woke up with this rash, which is the first external sign.

228
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 All of a sudden, he would no longer be able to hug his kids if he had them.

229
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 He could no longer hold his wife's hand if he had one.

230
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 Like he was taken out.

231
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 There's a law, the Old Testament commands, that if you have leprosy, because it's so contagious,

232
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 this deadly disease, you are to live outside of the camp for the rest of your life.

233
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 Here's what it says in Leviticus 13, where it talks about leprosy.

234
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 It says, "The leprous person who has the disease," it even tells him what they're supposed to wear,

235
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 "shall wear torn clothes," so all their clothes are to be torn up so they look like a crazy person,

236
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 "and let their hair hang loose, and he shall cover his upper lip and cry out, 'Unclean, unclean!'"

237
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 Everywhere he goes, there's people, so you know to stay away.

238
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 "He shall remain unclean as long as he has the disease."

239
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 He is unclean. "He shall live alone.

240
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 His dwelling shall be outside the camp."

241
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 Like he's told, "Hey, not only is it so bad," like they're literally saying,

242
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 "Hey, you gotta look like a crazy person so people know, stay away from this dude.

243
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 You gotta be like Zach Galifianakis with weird clothes on.

244
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 Your hair's all going crazy places, and you gotta yell out, 'Unclean, unclean!'"

245
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 Everywhere you go, you can no longer be around people.

246
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 I mean, even emotionally, this guy's life is deeply impacted.

247
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 Even the fact that he can't have anyone touch him.

248
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 Like psychologists today say, "If you don't have human touch, it will mess you up.

249
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 It will mess up your mind. You are more prone to violence, depression, all kinds of things."

250
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 And this dude is a walking dead man who knows there's no cure.

251
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 "I will never be home again.

252
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 I will live like this for the rest of my life,"

253
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 or whatever, if it's even fair to call it a life.

254
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 Until one day, this man shows up, Jesus.

255
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 And he reaches out, and he touches this leper, and he gives him his life back.

256
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 Now, here's why I say this story is our story.

257
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 Because just like leprosy, and if you take notes, we're gonna look at three different ideas

258
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 where we really find ourselves in the story.

259
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 Leprosy was seen as a curse from God.

260
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 If you had it, people believed wrongly, "Hey, you've been cursed by God.

261
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 You must have done something, 'cause he is taking you out right now."

262
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 It was seen as this curse, and it was a curse that killed you from the inside out.

263
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 We, as humanity, have a curse ourselves that kills us from the inside out.

264
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 The first point I want to talk about is the curse that infects all of us, the curse of sin.

265
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 Just like leprosy, even in the Bible, leprosy is synonymous with sin.

266
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 It's like a picture of it. They use it over and over again.

267
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 I'm like, "Man, that is what sin does to a person's life."

268
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 Here's five ways. Look at the sin that infects all of us.

269
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 Your disease and my disease is even worse than that of the lepers.

270
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 If you don't believe me, hopefully I'll portray that to you.

271
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 Five ways that sin is like leprosy. Here's one of them.

272
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 Just like leprosy kills you from the inside out, this is how sin works.

273
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 You notice this? Leprosy will war your body against itself.

274
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 When you think about the things that make your life hard, that you're responsible for,

275
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 they're all coming from inside of you.

276
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 Things that come naturally out of you, that kill you from the inside.

277
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 Like, "Hey, I struggle with addiction, or anger, or lust, or anxiety."

278
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 All these emotions inside. You don't have to work at them.

279
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 You don't have to try for them. They just come naturally to us.

280
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 They kill us because we've been infected with the disease of sin.

281
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 It's killing all of us from the inside out.

282
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 What I mean by, "You don't have to work hard." They just come naturally.

283
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 It easily comes. Nobody in the room was like, "Hey, here's a resolution for 2016."

284
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 "I'm really going to work on my anger. I'm going to be more angry than ever before."

285
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 "I'm really going to work on my anxiety this year. I feel like I've got so much peace."

286
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 "I really could use some anxiety." Nobody has to work at any of these things.

287
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 They all come naturally. They kill us from the inside out because all of us have been infected

288
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 by what the Bible says is the disease of sin.

289
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 That's the reason those things come naturally. It's sin nature.

290
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 The second way that it's like that is it cuts you off.

291
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 Just like leprosy in the Bible is synonymous with sin,

292
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 it cuts you off from relationships with God and with people.

293
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 Just like leprosy cuts them off. You cannot live here anymore. You have to leave.

294
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 It is illegal for a leper to come inside the city to be around the crowd like that one was.

295
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 That was illegal. It is illegal. You cannot be in a relationship.

296
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 Sin is the thing that cuts us off in relationships from people.

297
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 It's the thing that makes us want to hide.

298
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 It's the thing that makes us lie about the things that we've done,

299
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 things that we've messed up with. It's the thing that cuts off.

300
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 Some of you guys, like dating relationships have fallen apart because of sin.

301
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 Relationships, maybe you have parents who divorce because of sin.

302
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 It cuts us off from one another. Just like leprosy,

303
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 sin is this disease that infects the human race,

304
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 infects my heart and yours, and has the ability to cut us off in relationship.

305
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 Just like leprosy numbs you to the effects, the third way,

306
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 just like leprosy numbs you to its effects, that's kind of how it works.

307
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 The worse it progresses, the more numb you are. You can't feel things.

308
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 One scholar said one of the best feelings a leper can feel is pain

309
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 because they can't feel anything. Their mouth will get raw.

310
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 They'll burn their mouth, burn their tongue because they can't feel anything.

311
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 It numbs you the more it progresses. Isn't this how sin works?

312
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 It's the same exact way. That first time you got hung over or drunk,

313
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 you're like, "Oh my gosh, I can't believe that I did that."

314
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 Now it's an every weekend thing. The first time you gave up your virginity,

315
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 you're like, "Oh my gosh, what was I thinking? I cannot believe that I did that."

316
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 Gosh, now it's the goal that you have in life, or it's just a part of dating.

317
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 It numbs you to where it goes from, "Oh man, I shouldn't have done that,"

318
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 to, "Man, I should always do that."

319
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 The same way that leprosy numbs you, sin numbs you to its effects.

320
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 The fourth way is that just like leprosy distorts your appearance,

321
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 it would make them physically unattractive. Sin does the same thing.

322
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 How unattractive does sin make people?

323
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 Have you thought about this? Sin, greed, anger, lust,

324
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 any of those different, whatever vice that it is, it makes a person pride.

325
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 It makes someone unattractive. Remember when Michael Jordan,

326
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 his speech for the Hall of Fame, before that, it was like,

327
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 "Everyone wants to be like Mike," and then you saw who Mike was,

328
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 and you're like, "Nobody wants to be like Mike."

329
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 It makes you unattractive. In the same way, like dating,

330
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 nobody's like, "Oh my gosh, let me tell you what I'm looking for.

331
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 I'm looking for a guy who is greedy. That's what I want.

332
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 He's got an anger problem, Mom, and I love it."

333
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 Nobody wants to have, even if you're like, "Yeah, I like bad boys."

334
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 I like bad boys who punch things. It's unattractive.

335
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 In the same way that it distorts the outside appearance,

336
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 that is the same way that sin works.

337
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 The fifth way is just like leprosy is incurable by itself.

338
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 It is impossible. The human body, you cannot.

339
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 If you have leprosy, you will not be able to conquer leprosy

340
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 by your immune system. You have to have something outside of yourself.

341
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 In this day and age, it was just Jesus.

342
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 Today, they've got antibiotics, which is why,

343
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 if you're familiar with the ways that leprosy has receded in our world,

344
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 but in this day and age, you had to have, and still even today,

345
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 you have to have something. You cannot cure it yourself.

346
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 Sin, you cannot cure sin yourself.

347
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 You may be going, "I don't know. I can conquer bad habits.

348
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 I'm a disciplined person." Even if you're the most disciplined,

349
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 type A person in the room, all you do is you move sins around.

350
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 All of a sudden, you conquer that one, and something else pops up.

351
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 You cannot conquer it yourself.

352
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 Sin, like leprosy, is incurable alone or by yourself.

353
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 But just like we cannot cure ourselves,

354
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 so also just like the leper in this story,

355
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 Christ alone can cure us.

356
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 Just like the leper in this story where they're like,

357
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 "Hey, look, I'm going to throw myself at the mercy of God."

358
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 I mean, what the man does is illegal.

359
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 He shows up and the crowd is going, "What is everybody?

360
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 Back up, back up. There's a leper."

361
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 At this time, you had to remain at least six feet away from a leper.

362
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 It was illegal for a leper to enter a city or a community or be around people.

363
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 Like the punishment one rabbi said was that he should be stoned.

364
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 The punishment outright was at least 40 lashes on his back.

365
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 It was illegal for this man to show up, but why did he show up?

366
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 Why did he say, "Look, I'm going to break the wall"?

367
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 Because he knew that there was this man that he believed was his savior.

368
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 And he said, "Look, even if I die, even if they kill me in this crowd,

369
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 Jesus, you're my only hope. I'm dead already.

370
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 Either you can save me and I'll be able to go home.

371
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 I'll be able to have my life back or I'm dead already.

372
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 Of course, I'm going to come break the wall. I'm going to fall at your feet, Lord.

373
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 You alone are my cure."

374
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 In the same way as it relates to sin,

375
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 Christ alone is your cure and my cure.

376
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 Like in the story of the leper, inside of the story, you and I, we are the leper.

377
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 Who comes and we have no other place, nothing.

378
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 We cannot heal ourselves.

379
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 Our only option, if we are to be accepted by God, to be in relationship,

380
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 is to throw ourselves at the mercy of God and say,

381
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 "Lord, if you're willing, you can clean my life.

382
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 You can take away my sin. You can save me, Lord. Will you save me?"

383
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 This is the message of Christianity.

384
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 If you ever become a Christian, it will not be by you cleaning yourself up.

385
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 It will be by you accepting the God who will reach out his hand,

386
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 touch you, and make you whole, heal you.

387
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 Just like the leper got healed and then he was allowed to re-enter into the city.

388
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 You will never enter into the city of God if you do not throw yourself at the mercy of Jesus.

389
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 That's all a Christian is.

390
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 So when he says, "Look, I don't need a second chance.

391
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 I'm not going to be able to save myself. I can't be good enough.

392
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 The standard according to Jesus is much higher than I'm ever going to be.

393
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 No matter how good you think you are, you'll never get there."

394
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 And Jesus says, "I'm here to save you.

395
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 You don't need a second chance and a third chance. I'm going to try harder this week.

396
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 You need a Savior, and so do I."

397
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 That's why Jesus came. That's the point.

398
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 Christ alone is the cure.

399
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 Even the placement of the Sermon on the Mount.

400
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 Even the fact that this story takes place right after the Sermon on the Mount.

401
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 What is the Sermon on the Mount?

402
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 Jesus gives all kinds of incredible teachings,

403
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 right out of the Sermon on the Mount.

404
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 At every turn, in every corner, he basically says,

405
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 "You're not good enough.

406
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 Whatever you think the standard is, it is way higher than that.

407
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 You think, 'Oh man, I've never committed adultery.'

408
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 If you've ever lusted, even if you're a virgin,

409
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 you have committed adultery.

410
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 Sorry. If you are angry at someone,

411
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 you may think, 'Oh, but I've never murdered somebody.'

412
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 If you are angry, you're a murderer, Jesus says, before God.

413
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 I mean, at one point, he even says this.

414
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 "Unless you are as righteous or more righteous,

415
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 unless your righteousness exceeds," he says in Matthew 5, verse 20,

416
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 "unless it exceeds that of even the Pharisees and the scribes,"

417
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 or another way of saying it,

418
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 "unless you are more pure than the Pope,

419
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 unless, brother Pope, unless you are more pure than him

420
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 and Mother Teresa and every single nun that's out there,

421
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 unless you are more pure than all of them,

422
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 you will not go to heaven," is what he says.

423
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 I mean, at every turn, you're going,

424
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 "Jesus, oh my gosh, we'll never get there."

425
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 And he would say, "That's the point.

426
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 That's why I'm here, to die in your place."

427
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 I mean, at one point, if all that wasn't bad enough,

428
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 he says, "You must be perfect,

429
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 as your heavenly Father is perfect."

430
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 And we could try to explain that away and be like,

431
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 "By perfect, he means, you know, imperfect."

432
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 But the word is perfect.

433
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 You must be perfect, Jesus.

434
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 I got to be perfect? Yeah.

435
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 I mean, imagine if the sermon was that today.

436
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 "Hey guys, you got to be perfect."

437
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 Let me close in prayer real quick.

438
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 Everyone would be like, "What? What kind of message?"

439
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 Jesus is going, "That's the point.

440
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 You'll never get there alone yourself.

441
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 You need someone who can save you.

442
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 You cannot do it alone.

443
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 Christ alone is the cure.

444
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 That's the whole point."

445
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 And then after he finishes this message,

446
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 it's like he goes down the mountain with the crowd.

447
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 "Come on, guys, I'm going to give you an illustration

448
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 of the fact that you cannot do it on your own.

449
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 Throw yourself in the mercy of God.

450
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 Ask the name of Him who would save you."

451
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 He goes down the mountain with the crowd,

452
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 and all of a sudden, this leper who has no hope in the world,

453
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 who's able to say, "God, I need you to save me."

454
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 Right after the sermon on the mount,

455
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 he goes down and he says,

456
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 "Let me show you an illustration of what this is going to look like."

457
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 Jesus comes down the mountain and saves a man

458
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 who does nothing but be unclean and asks for mercy.

459
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 As though Jesus is saying, "This is the point.

460
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 This is why I'm here.

461
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 This is what it's all about."

462
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 If you think Christianity is about you trying to be a good person,

463
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 you do not know the Christ behind it.

464
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 You do not know what Christianity biblically is all about.

465
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 You do not know what the Bible teaches.

466
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 It is not Jesus didn't come to be like,

467
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 "Hey, I'm going to make you a good person."

468
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 He came to make you alive,

469
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 to make you a new person,

470
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 to cure you and I of the infection

471
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 that is killing the human race called sin.

472
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 He alone is the cure.

473
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 Even the placement of it,

474
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 right after the sermon on the mount,

475
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 is God sending a message.

476
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 You cannot do it alone.

477
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 Christ alone is the cure.

478
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 If you and I will simply throw ourselves in the mercy of God.

479
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 Man, I love getting to do what we do here

480
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 because every single week what happens is people come in

481
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 and they were raised in a kind of church,

482
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 went to VBS,

483
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 "I was Catholic, I had something."

484
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 All of a sudden they never heard the gospel.

485
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 They trust in Jesus.

486
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 They just go, "Oh my gosh, man, God loves me.

487
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 He died for me.

488
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 Before I could even do anything,

489
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 that's what Christianity is about?

490
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 How did I never hear this?"

491
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 They give their lives to Jesus.

492
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 They surrender and they just say,

493
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 "Man, it's not about me trying to work my way to heaven.

494
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 God came to me.

495
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 I accept you, Lord."

496
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 What happens is this incredible miraculous change.

497
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 Just like the leper.

498
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 Have you been standing there?

499
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 I mean, how crazy would that be

500
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 if you saw someone with leprosy,

501
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 which would be like Ebola,

502
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 someone walking up to someone with Ebola,

503
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 touching them and you see it disappear.

504
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 You'd be like, "Oh my gosh, what just happened?"

505
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 That's miraculous.

506
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 In the same way, every single week,

507
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 people at this porch or at the porch here in Fort Worth

508
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 and in Houston and in downtown,

509
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 all over the place and other churches as well,

510
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 people come to trust.

511
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 They surrender their life to Christ.

512
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 They ask him for mercy.

513
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 "Lord, will you help me?

514
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 Will you heal me?

515
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 I accept you."

516
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 And miraculous life change begins to take place.

517
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 Like if you're in the room and you're going,

518
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 "Man, but you don't know what I've done.

519
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 I look around at my circumstance

520
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 and everywhere that I look, I've just messed up.

521
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 I've ruined things.

522
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 I'm still ruining things.

523
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 I ruined things like 45 minutes ago.

524
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 I'm planning to ruin stuff later tonight."

525
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 You don't know.

526
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 I mean, God can't accept me.

527
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 I'm telling you, whatever your story is,

528
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 you're surrounded by people in the building

529
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 who have that same story, but only yours is part one.

530
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 And all of a sudden, Jesus comes in

531
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 and part two gets written,

532
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 and they have been radically changed.

533
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 Let me read some of them, fly through them.

534
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 Here's stories of people.

535
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 This happened today.

536
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 I heard from a girl today, this girl named Kelly.

537
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 She was living with a boyfriend,

538
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 trying to numb her pain and numb her anxiety,

539
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 overwhelmed with anxiety, through alcohol and weed.

540
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 She was smoking so much weed

541
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 that she became a weed dealer to pay for her weed.

542
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 Girl looks like the girl next door.

543
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 You're like, "Really?

544
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 A weed dealer?

545
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 Interesting."

546
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 She all of a sudden encounters Christ.

547
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 He stretches out the same hand that touched the leper.

548
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 Radically, her life has changed.

549
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 Now, all of a sudden,

550
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 she begins to be a part of ministering to women

551
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 on a weekly basis.

552
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 She's on staff now at Watermark.

553
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 A frat party leader named Travis,

554
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 he meets downtown.

555
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 He's one of the leaders down there,

556
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 was chasing the next high,

557
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 was a frat star that didn't leave it in college,

558
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 was trying to hook up with every girl that he could,

559
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 was numbing whatever pain from life

560
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 through alcohol, through weed, whatever it was.

561
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 He has an encounter with Christ,

562
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 turns his life around,

563
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 one of the best ministers of the gospel we have.

564
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 A guy named Todd,

565
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 who was using and abusing drugs, alcohol,

566
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 was using and abusing his girlfriend

567
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 and having sex with her

568
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 and manipulating her to allow him to have sex

569
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 with other girls.

570
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 This is the guy who all of a sudden encounters Christ.

571
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 God stretches out his hand.

572
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 Now, he is no longer in that relationship.

573
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 He's pursuing purity.

574
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 He's one of the leaders in Fort Worth.

575
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 I'll let you boy, Todd.

576
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 (audience laughing)

577
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 Another girl, Jordan,

578
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 living in relationships defined by sex,

579
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 hung over every weekend,

580
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 got pregnant, aborted the baby.

581
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 All of a sudden, despite all the pain from that,

582
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 encounters Christ,

583
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 who stretches out his hand,

584
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 changed her life,

585
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 found meaning and purpose,

586
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 meets with women every year

587
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 who have the fear of leaving an unhealthy relationship.

588
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 Now, she's using her past as a platform to showcase

589
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 Jesus is a God who brings dead people back to life.

590
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 And every week, she meets with girls

591
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 who struggle with fear

592
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 of leaving an unhealthy relationship

593
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 or sex or the Dallas life scene.

594
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 Another girl, Katie,

595
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 was partying three to four times a week,

596
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 slaved to how she looked.

597
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 She was defined by how I looked on the outside.

598
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 I was empty and alone.

599
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 I was surrounded by millions of people in New York City,

600
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 but I'd never felt so alone.

601
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 I encountered Christ through a porch volunteer on a plane.

602
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 I trusted Jesus.

603
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 And now, I serve each week in the ministry

604
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 that Christ used to change my life.

605
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 Another one, a porn addict

606
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 who used to call in sick to work

607
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 to look at porn all day,

608
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 encounters Christ, stretches out his hand.

609
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 Now, he's an incredible minister of the gospel

610
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 with an incredible marriage and children.

611
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 Another girl who didn't even have a desire to know God

612
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 runs off into a marriage she should never have been in.

613
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 Her marriage falls apart.

614
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 She has a divorce.

615
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 She ends up getting pregnant, has an abortion,

616
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 encounters Jesus.

617
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 Now, she's one of the best ministers of the gospel that I know.

618
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 She's happily married.

619
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 She serves in this ministry.

620
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 A bunch of other people with similar stories to that

621
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 or maybe similar stories to mine

622
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 where like, "Hey, I was raised,

623
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 "I tried to be a pretty good person,

624
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 "hung my hat on how good or things that I hadn't done

625
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 "and God stretched out his hand and saved me from pride,

626
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 "from thinking that I didn't need a savior."

627
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 Even if that's your story in the room,

628
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 man, that's one of the more miraculous stories out there

629
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 because you haven't bought into the lie

630
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 that tons of people in this room have that,

631
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 "Hey, I'm a good person, man.

632
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 "I don't do any of that stuff.

633
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 "I don't smoke weed.

634
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 "I try to, I pay my taxes.

635
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 "I'm a good person."

636
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 And God awakened your eyes and you go,

637
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 "Man, I am not a good person.

638
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 "There's something dark inside of me.

639
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 "I need a savior."

640
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 And that's a miraculous story.

641
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 Every single day, every week, we see stories around you.

642
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 And the reason I'm camping there

643
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 is because here's what I know.

644
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 I know there's people in this room

645
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 who think that, "Man, God, if there is a God,

646
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 "he didn't want anything to do with me."

647
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 And you know what?

648
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 Godly environments or godly people,

649
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 whatever God could have had for my life, it's gone.

650
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 It's not there anymore.

651
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 I'll never have the marriage that I wanted to have.

652
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 I'll never have the story that I wanted to have.

653
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 And the reality is, whatever your story is,

654
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 there is no past God cannot redeem.

655
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 There is no past that's a problem for his grace.

656
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 But it can be a platform for it.

657
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 This is personal.

658
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 I have a close family member

659
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 who I talk to all the time.

660
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 She's a believer.

661
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 And I'm always like, "Man, I wish you came to the porch."

662
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 One, and she has made, she's had a past where

663
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 she had a season of running.

664
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 She has a couple kids out of wedlock.

665
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 And she feels like, "Man, why would I go to the porch?"

666
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 Even if I was to meet someone or engage in a relationship,

667
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 godly guys would never want something to do with me.

668
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 And I tell her what I would tell you.

669
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 A godly guy will not see you defined by your past.

670
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 And if he does, that is not a godly guy.

671
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 And the reason that he wouldn't have anything to do with you,

672
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 it doesn't have anything to do with your past.

673
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
 It may have something to do with your present

674
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 that is not fully surrendered, going,

675
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 "God, you can change.

676
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 "You can write any story."

677
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 And the reason why she's held back

678
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 is not 'cause God's holding her at distance.

679
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 She's bought a lie that that's the God that's there,

680
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 that God holds people at a distance.

681
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 The God who is there doesn't hold at a distance.

682
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 He is reaching out to hold onto her.

683
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 And if that's your story in the room,

684
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 that's the same case for you.

685
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 But Christ alone is the cure,

686
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 and he does miraculous things still today.

687
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 The final point of no matter what your story is,

688
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 is Christ's compassion towards you.

689
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 Christ's compassion towards you.

690
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
 Like the leper, we look at this man,

691
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 and Mark tells the same story.

692
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 Mark chapter one.

693
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 What does Jesus do?

694
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 What moves Jesus to stretch out his hand?

695
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 It tells us he was filled with compassion.

696
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 And he looked at this leper who said,

697
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 "Lord, I have nowhere to go.

698
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 "God, if you're willing, you can make me clean.

699
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
 "I could go home and hold my kids, God.

700
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 "Will you heal me, Lord?

701
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
 "Will you save me, Lord?"

702
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
 And Jesus, filled with compassion,

703
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 stretches out his hand, and he heals him.

704
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 While he was still unclean, he touches him.

705
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 What does God do for you and me?

706
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 What is the feeling that he expresses

707
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 towards those who are unclean?

708
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 Compassion.

709
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 Christ's compassion towards us is our third point.

710
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 Like what does God feel for you right now in the room?

711
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
 Compassion.

712
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 Like regardless of where you are,

713
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 the God of the universe is filled with love

714
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
 as he looks out and says,

715
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
 "That's my boy, that's my girl.

716
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 "I wanna have a relationship with him.

717
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
 "I'm the God who moves towards them before they're clean."

718
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
 Let me say this again, let me try to make it as good.

719
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
 Before you do anything right,

720
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 God is reaching out towards you.

721
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 Before you've ever cleaned yourself up,

722
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 no matter what you have done, God is going,

723
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 "I got open arms, come on in here!"

724
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 That's the God who is there.

725
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 He reaches out, he's filled with compassion and love,

726
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
 and wants you to know him,

727
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 wants to have a relationship with you.

728
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
 That's the God that exists.

729
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 He's filled with compassion towards you and I,

730
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 just like that leper,

731
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 and he's made the first move towards you and I.

732
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
 Like in any relationship,

733
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 somebody makes the first move, right?

734
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 Like in a dating relationship,

735
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 if you're in a dating relationship,

736
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 like somebody at some point made the first move.

737
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 You know what I mean?

738
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 Like somebody was like, either the guy or the girl.

739
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 The guy was like, "Hey, I'd love to take you to coffee,

740
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 "or get to know you, and how you doing?"

741
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
 Whatever the pickup line is.

742
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
 And it's either the guy or the girl who's like,

743
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 "Hey, I would love to give you these cookies

744
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 "that I made in between my quiet time

745
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
 "and working out like I do every day."

746
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 (congregation laughing)

747
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 Somebody makes it, puts it out there.

748
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
 God has made the first move in the relationship.

749
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
 If you ever have one,

750
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 it will be in response to the God

751
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 who's reaching out to you now

752
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
 and has made the first move.

753
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,000
 If you just accept it, what he feels towards you

754
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,000
 and all of the broken, hurting humanity is compassion.

755
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 God loves the unclean.

756
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
 And he loves the broken.

757
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,000
 He loves sinners.

758
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 Like that's mind boggling to me.

759
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,000
 He even says a few verses later in Matthew 9,

760
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
 "I came to heal the sick."

761
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 I came, he says, "It's not the healthy that need a doctor,

762
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
 "it's the sick, that's why I'm here."

763
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
 Jesus, you're saying we're all sick.

764
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 You're all sick.

765
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
 And I'm the one who can make you clean.

766
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
 I can make you healthy.

767
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
 I can make you come back to life.

768
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 I can give you life.

769
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
 I can give you like that,

770
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
 left for your life back.

771
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
 If you'll accept it.

772
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:18,000
 How great, even the fact that he touches him,

773
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
 like how great is Christ's love.

774
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 This ministered to me so much this week

775
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
 as I was thinking about it.

776
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
 Even the fact that he touches him.

777
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
 Like why, Jesus?

778
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
 It says this in verse three,

779
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
 "Jesus reached out his hand."

780
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
 The crowd is backed away going,

781
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
 this man, he deserves to die.

782
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
 He's come in the middle of the crowd.

783
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
 What is he doing?

784
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
 Everyone back up.

785
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
 This contagion of Jesus.

786
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
 And not like the crowd were calling,

787
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,000
 God reaches out to the man and he touches him.

788
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
 Why do you touch him, Jesus?

789
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
 This is why I ministered to me.

790
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
 Was it because you had to to heal him?

791
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
 That's just how you did it?

792
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 No.

793
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
 The very next story, four verses later,

794
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
 he heals the guy with just a word,

795
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
 you're healed.

796
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 He never even goes to see him.

797
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
 He says, "The man is healed."

798
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
 Jesus in this moment,

799
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
 he reaches out to touch the leper,

800
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
 not 'cause he has to,

801
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
 not 'cause he needs to,

802
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
 because he wants to,

803
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
 because he loves him.

804
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
 And the God that is there

805
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
 doesn't reach out to you because you're clean.

806
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
 He doesn't reach out to me because I'm clean.

807
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
 He reaches out to you and to me

808
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
 and to all who will just accept him.

809
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
 He reaches out in general,

810
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
 even when they don't.

811
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
 And he reaches out,

812
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
 not 'cause he has to,

813
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
 'cause he wants to,

814
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
 'cause he loves you,

815
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
 wherever you are.

816
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
 He's a God that reaches out

817
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
 in the midst of that

818
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,000
 and touches a man who hadn't been touched in years.

819
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,000
 And he heals him.

820
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
 How great is God's compassion?

821
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
 This is the God who was there,

822
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
 and I'm gonna close,

823
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
 and we're gonna land the plane right here.

824
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:53,000
 The tragedy is, I think,

825
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
 so many people, as it relates to God,

826
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
 and as it relates to thinking of even Christianity,

827
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
 is they think,

828
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
 man, they gotta clean up first.

829
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
 And God says, "I touch you when you're unclean."

830
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
 This is how it works.

831
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
 I'm the one who makes you clean.

832
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
 I mean, how crazy would it have been

833
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
 if, like, when I got swine flu,

834
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
 I called the doctor,

835
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
 and I was like, "Hey, I'm a little under the weather.

836
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
 "I wanna make an appointment."

837
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
 And they were like, "Oh, tell me your symptoms."

838
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
 "Oh, a cold, headache, oh, yeah."

839
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
 "Yeah, we're not gonna see you.

840
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 "Get feeling better, get healthy,

841
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
 "and then you can come to the doctor."

842
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
 You'd be like, "What?

843
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
 "That's, what kind of doctor is this?"

844
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
 Doctors are there to make clean.

845
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
 I mean, that's one of the primary things

846
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
 they hang their hat on,

847
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
 is they make clean.

848
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
 They make healthy.

849
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
 That's why they do practice medicine.

850
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
 "You're not gonna see me 'til I get clean."

851
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
 That would be crazy.

852
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
 Why is it that we think that that's how God is?

853
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
 Why is it that so many have bought a lie

854
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
 that is not in the Bible,

855
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
 that I need to clean up,

856
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
 and God says, "I am the one who makes clean.

857
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
 "If you're gonna be clean, you come to me.

858
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
 "I'm the one who heals you

859
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
 "of whatever you're struggling with."

860
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
 It's not by your own self-righteousness,

861
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
 your own self-discipline.

862
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
 I make clean.

863
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
 That's why I came.

864
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
 That's why I'm here.

865
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
 That's the God that exists.

866
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
 And wherever you are tonight,

867
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,000
 he's reaching out to you and to me,

868
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
 filled with compassion,

869
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
 as he's always been,

870
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
 for humanity to heal

871
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
 before they're ever clean.

872
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
 And he's reaching out to touch

873
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
 'cause he wants to,

874
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
 'cause he loves you.

875
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
 This is why we do ministry.

876
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
 This is why we take this message every single,

877
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
 we were talking in the green room

878
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
 with the team before.

879
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
 This is why we do what we do with the porch.

880
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
 If you would've told me I'd be in ministry,

881
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
 I'd be like, "What?

882
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
 "There's no way I'm getting in ministry.

883
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
 "I want a lake house.

884
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
 "I'm not getting in ministry."

885
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
 I never would've wanted to do this.

886
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
 But honestly, the thing that keeps

887
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
 my heart connected to this

888
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
 is this is seeing what God does,

889
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
 and honestly, telling people

890
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
 about the God who is there.

891
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
 This is the God that is there.

892
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
 This is our God who reaches out,

893
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:57,000
 who heals before you do anything right.

894
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
 And we're gonna take this message

895
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
 every place that we can get in,

896
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
 to every street, to every place,

897
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
 every space in this town,

898
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
 in Fort Worth, in Houston,

899
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
 in every place that we can get,

900
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
 'cause there's a world out there

901
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
 that does not know the God who is there.

902
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
 They think they have to clean themselves up.

903
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
 It is a tragic, heartbreaking, unbiblical idea,

904
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
 but they have bought into the lie

905
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
 that if they're gonna have a relationship with God,

906
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
 get it together!

907
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
 And God's holding 'em back.

908
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,000
 And the reality is God is reaching out

909
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
 towards them.

910
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
 That's the God who is there.

911
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,000
 That's the God who lives.

912
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
 That's the God who changes.

913
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
 And if you're ever gonna know the God that exists,

914
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
 that's the God you will encounter.

915
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
 I'm gonna pray that you would.

916
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
 Father, thank you just for allowing us

917
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
 to see some of your character.

918
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
 That you don't reach out,

919
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
 and you don't change us,

920
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
 and you don't love us

921
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
 because we've made ourselves clean.

922
00:40:53,000 --> 00:41:00,000
 That you make us clean because you love us.

923
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
 You alone are our only hope, Lord.

924
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
 I don't have anything to offer,

925
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
 and I throw myself on your mercy.

926
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
 All of us do who know you, Lord.

927
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
 And we say you are our only hope,

928
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
 just like that leper, Lord.

929
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
 If you are willing, you can make us clean.

930
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
 You can heal us, Lord.

931
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
 And thank you that your response

932
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
 is I am willing.

933
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:28,000
 Be healed, be clean, be new, be alive.

934
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,000
 For anyone in this room who doesn't know you, God,

935
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
 would you reach out your hand,

936
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
 and would you save them?

937
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
 Would you allow them to see

938
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,000
 because we're told that they've been blinded

939
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
 to the God who is there,

940
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,000
 even believing that they need to work their way to heaven

941
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:54,000
 and not trust in the God who came down the mountain

942
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:59,000
 for them, to save them.

943
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
 Even their rejection or the belief

944
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
 that they could earn their way up the mountain is a lie, God.

945
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
 Would you shatter that lie with your truth,

946
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
 with your love, with your compassion?

947
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
 We worship you now, Lord.

948
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:19,000
