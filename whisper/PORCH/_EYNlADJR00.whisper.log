[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.340]   (drum roll)
[00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:08.960]   - Hello, Porch!
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.320]   What's up?
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.560]   I like it, this is good.
[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.320]   We got the crew that's gonna make it happen
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:15.920]   for the next several decades right here.
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.960]   And I know some of you guys
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.800]   may not be drinking Millard Light like JP,
[00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.120]   but something better,
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.960]   still hanging out in lower Greenville.
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.800]   (audience laughs)
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.620]   And you're thinking, if I'm your future, bro,
[00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:29.720]   you got some real problems, all right?
[00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.960]   I'm here for anything but to be your future tonight.
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.280]   But I'm gonna tell you, man, our hope and our prayer
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.040]   is that something's gonna hit you
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.720]   in the midst of looking around and seeing
[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.880]   that some other people apparently have discovered a truth
[00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.000]   that maybe you haven't,
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.880]   that there's life somewhere other than the world
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.280]   tells you where you can find it.
[00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.340]   It might be tonight.
[00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:50.440]   We're praying that somewhere,
[00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.800]   as you interact with people in this room,
[00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.080]   that have been recipients of mercy like I have.
[00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.100]   I love that I have been asked to jump in
[00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.900]   and have a little bit to do with this great series
[00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.420]   called Battle of the Sexes.
[00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:06.660]   Man, we battle, don't we?
[00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.900]   We're very, very different.
[00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.500]   I just wanna just take a moment,
[00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.900]   because I know girls, I've got three little girls, right?
[00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.580]   And so I'm very, very engaged
[00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.220]   when it comes to thinking about
[00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.420]   how young men should treat young women,
[00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.740]   especially now that I'm not one of those young men
[00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.820]   that's gonna have to live underneath my laws
[00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:28.820]   of what is right.
[00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.340]   But I will tell you, men, if you understand
[00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.220]   about a law of love, about how to treat women,
[00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.900]   it's gonna change everything.
[00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.260]   And little girls, I'm telling you, young ladies,
[00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:41.380]   there is a Father in heaven,
[00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:42.380]   even if you don't have a heartily Father,
[00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.060]   that cares about how you're treated.
[00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.820]   And so as a public service announcement,
[00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.580]   what I wanna do is just explain something to gals
[00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:49.660]   as we get started,
[00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:51.180]   and I'm just gonna basically explain to you
[00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.540]   why guys never call back after a successful first date.
[00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.580]   (congregation laughing)
[00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:57.820]   All right?
[00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.220]   So let me just explain that.
[00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.900]   So today we are going to explore the mysterious topic
[00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.700]   of how guys think, which baffles women in general
[00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.780]   and the editors of Cosmopolitan magazine specifically
[00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:12.940]   for thousands of years.
[00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.580]   The big question, of course,
[00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.220]   is how come guys never call after successful dates?
[00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.620]   I mean, you single women out there
[00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:21.460]   know what I'm talking about.
[00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.300]   You go out with a guy, you have a great time,
[00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.820]   he seems to have a great time,
[00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.780]   and at the end of the evening, he says, quote,
[00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:28.820]   "Can I call you?"
[00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:34.060]   And you, interpreting this to mean, "Can I call you?"
[00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.040]   (congregation laughing)
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.740]   You answer and say, "Sure."
[00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.340]   Well, listen, the instant you say this, of course,
[00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.220]   the guy's body begins to dematerialize
[00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.220]   right there in front of you.
[00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.120]   Within a few seconds, you can stick a tire iron
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.780]   right through him and wave it around.
[00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.180]   In a few more seconds, he will have vanished entirely,
[00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.340]   gone into the mysterious guy-Bermuda Triangle
[00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.820]   where whole squadrons of your dates
[00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.460]   have disappeared over the years,
[00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.000]   never to be heard from again.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.740]   Eventually, you start to wonder,
[00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.100]   is there something wrong with you?
[00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.320]   Some kind of emotional hangup that you have.
[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:06.620]   This is silly.
[00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:07.660]   There's nothing wrong with you.
[00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.700]   In fact, you should interpret the behavior of your dates
[00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.420]   as a kind of a guy compliment to you
[00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.660]   because when a guy asks you if he can call you,
[00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.020]   what he's really asking you in guy code is,
[00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.100]   "Will you be willing to marry him?"
[00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.740]   (congregation laughing)
[00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:20.900]   Let me explain that.
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.020]   You see, your basic guy goes straight ahead,
[00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.140]   bottom line kind of thought process
[00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.780]   that does not really work as well
[00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.340]   with the infinitely subtle complexities
[00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.340]   of normal human relationships.
[00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.260]   So here's what the guy's thinking.
[00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.700]   If he calls you, you'll go out again
[00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.240]   and you'll probably have another great time,
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.140]   so you'll probably go out again and have another great time
[00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.940]   and so on until the only possible option will be
[00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.260]   that you will get married.
[00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.620]   This is classic guy logic.
[00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.240]   So when you say, "Sure," in your bright and cheery voice,
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.500]   you may think you're simply indicating
[00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:51.980]   your willingness to go out again,
[00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.260]   but as far as he is concerned,
[00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.140]   you're endorsing a lifetime commitment
[00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:56.940]   that he's quite frankly not ready to make
[00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.020]   after only one date.
[00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:03.140]   So he naturally decides he can never see you again
[00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.980]   at the risk.
[00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:10.220]   From that day forward, if he spots you in the street,
[00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:11.540]   he'll sprint in the opposite direction
[00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.380]   to avoid the grave risk that you might actually talk,
[00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.020]   which means you might actually have a good time,
[00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:17.620]   get a cup of coffee again,
[00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.120]   and start the whole process over
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.660]   where you're enjoying each other's company
[00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:21.820]   and then suddenly out of nowhere,
[00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.460]   JP will appear at your table and you'll get married.
[00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:30.860]   Now you might think this is crazy, right?
[00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.620]   Well, you guys are probably out there going,
[00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.740]   "That's exactly right."
[00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.740]   So my advice for single gals here tonight is this.
[00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.740]   If you're on a date with a guy and you like him
[00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.460]   and he asks you in a non-threatening way,
[00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:47.420]   can I give you a call again?
[00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.340]   Respond with a, "No."
[00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.840]   Or a rather disinterested, "I guess,
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.440]   "but bear in mind I am planning on becoming a nun."
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:02.160]   See, this will make him comfortable about seeing you again.
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.000]   And each time he'll get more courage
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.600]   to more closely approach you in a manner of a timid,
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.720]   maybe easily scared woodland creature like a chipmunk.
[00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:16.520]   And in a few years, if the two of you have a common interest
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.680]   and common personalities, you might reach the point
[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.020]   where he'll be willing to take a big step
[00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.060]   like eating granola out of your hand
[00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:23.560]   or something like a chipmunk.
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.700]   So no matter how close you become, remember this.
[00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:29.020]   Do not pressure the guy to face
[00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.600]   his innermost sense of thoughts and feelings with you.
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.640]   Guys hate this and I'll tell you why.
[00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:36.020]   'Cause if you were to probe inside a guy's psyche,
[00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:37.900]   beneath that macho exterior and the endless dronings
[00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.580]   about things like the 2011 World Series,
[00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.260]   you would find down deep inside in his passion little heart,
[00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:47.440]   he has a deep felt interest in the 2011 World Series.
[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.000]   [congregation laughing]
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.120]   So girls, you just need to understand.
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.880]   That's why you're not getting a call back.
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.000]   I've kept this, you guys might have heard this before.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.280]   This one, this makes me laugh, you know,
[00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:04.320]   because it's continuing education courses for women.
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:07.480]   Written by obviously some bitter guy,
[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:09.440]   but nonetheless, here they are.
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:10.640]   Here's a class for you.
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.920]   It's called Silence, The Final Frontier,
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:15.000]   Where No Woman Has Ever Gone Before.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.420]   [congregation laughing]
[00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:22.280]   How's this one?
[00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.940]   It's called The Undiscovered Side of Banking,
[00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:27.460]   Making Deposits, it's a class for women.
[00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:33.400]   Here's one, Parties, How to Go Without a New Outfit.
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:37.520]   It's a class a lot of gals maybe need, all right?
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.200]   Here's a class, Man Management,
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.560]   Discover How Minor Household Chores Can Wait
[00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:43.560]   Until After the Game Is Over.
[00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.140]   That's for future reference.
[00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:49.900]   There are many.
[00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:52.520]   Later when you're married, you'll be one,
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.320]   the guy wants you to take a class called Cooking 101,
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:58.480]   Bringing Back Bacon, Eggs, and Butter, Cooking 102,
[00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:01.000]   Bran and Tofu Are Not for Human Consumption,
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.680]   and Cooking 103, How Not to Inflict Your Diets
[00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:05.520]   on Other People.
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:06.880]   [congregation laughing]
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:07.840]   I love that.
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:09.600]   So here's one, the girls responded, right?
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.240]   Well, here's some basic classes for men
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.880]   that men need to take, right, in continuing education.
[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:18.640]   Introduction to Common Household Objects, number one,
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:19.480]   the mop.
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:22.200]   [congregation laughing]
[00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:25.640]   Introduction to Common Household Objects 102, the sponge.
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:31.160]   Refrigerator Forensics, Identifying and Removing the Dead.
[00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:32.000]   [congregation laughing]
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:32.820]   That's a good one.
[00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:38.200]   Here's one, Design Pattern or Splatter Stain
[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:39.220]   on the Linoleum.
[00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:41.320]   You can tell the difference.
[00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:44.600]   [congregation laughing]
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:49.600]   Accepting Loss 101, if it's empty, you can throw it away.
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:54.280]   Accepting Loss 102, if the milk expired three weeks ago,
[00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:57.400]   keeping it in the refrigerator won't bring it back.
[00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:58.240]   Get it out of there.
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:01.700]   [congregation laughing]
[00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:04.040]   Knowing the Limitations of Your Kitchenware.
[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:05.960]   No, the dishes won't wash themselves,
[00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:07.320]   and it goes on and on.
[00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.380]   If you're around the opposite sex very much,
[00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:11.700]   you'll learn that there is some unique differences about us,
[00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:13.260]   and they're not just in those kind of silly things
[00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.220]   that I'm reading right there.
[00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:17.100]   Now, I'll take you all the way back
[00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:21.340]   to a guy that when God was so pleased with this guy,
[00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:22.940]   said, "I'll give you anything that you want.
[00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:23.940]   "You just name it.
[00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:25.220]   "Give me anything you want."
[00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:27.460]   He asked that God would give him wisdom.
[00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:31.420]   And God was so pleased with that, he gave him wisdom.
[00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:32.780]   He blessed him with a lot of other things,
[00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:34.580]   but as this guy went on throughout his life,
[00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:36.340]   writing down the things that he learned,
[00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:38.060]   at the very end of his life,
[00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:40.800]   as he's jotting down different things that he's learned,
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:43.120]   I want you to watch what he wrote down
[00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:44.640]   in Proverbs chapter 30.
[00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:47.640]   This is what the guy says.
[00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:48.880]   The wisest man that ever lived.
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:52.360]   Proverbs 30, verses 18 through 19.
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:55.360]   It says, "There are three things which I do not understand,
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:59.600]   "four of which are too wonderful for me."
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:02.900]   Number one, he says, "The way of an eagle in the sky."
[00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:04.360]   He didn't understand how an eagle could fly.
[00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:06.880]   Number two, "The way of a serpent on a rock."
[00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:09.580]   This thing's got no legs and then he moves powerfully.
[00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:13.120]   Number three, it just says, "The way of a ship
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:14.400]   "in the middle of a sea."
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:18.240]   And number four, he says, "The way of a man with a maid."
[00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:20.680]   I just can't figure out the whole guy-girl thing.
[00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:23.520]   This is the wisest guy that ever lived.
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:30.100]   And so, as we find ourselves here in our 20s, 30s,
[00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:31.800]   I don't know, you might be going,
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:32.800]   "Hey, I'm trying to figure this thing out,
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:35.280]   "this little battle, this little relationship thing
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:37.320]   "that we're moving into and I can't quite make it."
[00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:38.320]   Let me just tell you something,
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:40.760]   God doesn't want this mystery to be out there forever.
[00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:44.520]   He created us different for a very specific reason.
[00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:46.960]   I'm gonna explain to you why God made us different tonight.
[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:50.840]   I'm gonna explain to you why God wants us to take
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:53.680]   our commitment to each other, specifically in the context
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:56.360]   of a covenant relationship, extremely serious.
[00:09:56.360 --> 00:10:00.200]   Let me just tell you this, man, God loves marriage.
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:03.440]   God loves you.
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:07.080]   And he wants you to know that you'll never have
[00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:09.600]   a healthy marriage until you go into that marriage
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.120]   as a healthy person.
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:13.320]   Any relationship is only as healthy
[00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.880]   as the least healthy person in it.
[00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:18.240]   And the problem is, is that most people go into marriage
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:20.480]   thinking that this other person is gonna meet their needs.
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:22.160]   And what you're gonna find out very quickly
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:24.920]   is there is no person on earth that can ever give you
[00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:26.500]   what you need and what you're looking for.
[00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:30.120]   That is why as a dad, when I started shepherding
[00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:33.120]   my little girls, I did this with my guys,
[00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:36.280]   I said, okay, the Bible says this, it tells me
[00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:39.240]   in 1 Corinthians 16, 13 and 14, it says, man,
[00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:44.240]   be on the alert, stand firm in the faith, act like men.
[00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:46.880]   Be strong, let everything you do be done in love.
[00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:48.560]   I have three boys, so I'm supposed to raise
[00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:50.920]   these three boys to learn how to act like men.
[00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:53.360]   And if you wanna just bring silence into a room of men,
[00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:55.560]   you just say, hey man, define what a man is.
[00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:00.360]   And what you'll find is guys will immediately run
[00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:04.660]   to some macho expression that they've picked up
[00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:09.220]   from some action movie or from some fleeting whisper
[00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:13.400]   in culture that doesn't really match what a real godly man
[00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:14.640]   is supposed to look like.
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:20.480]   Or you'll find out that guys are been so beaten down
[00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:24.400]   that maleness and manhood is not anything worth honoring
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:27.720]   and pursuing that you'll find emasculated men.
[00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:31.400]   And so, not to be crass, but what you basically find
[00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:34.400]   with guys that are not informed by a God who designed them
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:37.760]   to be loving and strong, tender warriors,
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:39.760]   you'll find guys that either wanna be badasses
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:42.060]   or scared to death they're gonna be a bad boy.
[00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:45.920]   And neither of those things is what God says
[00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:46.760]   a man should be.
[00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:49.840]   And so I just sat down and said, hey boys,
[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:51.880]   this is what it means to be a man,
[00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:53.240]   and I've written down definitions for them.
[00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:55.320]   For my young ladies, I said this is what it means
[00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:57.320]   to be a godly woman, I want you to know.
[00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:00.320]   And the very first thing I told my little girls
[00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:03.220]   as a principle for them to understand what it means
[00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:04.880]   to be a godly woman, and both of these things,
[00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:06.400]   by the way, are available if you're curious
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:08.240]   at wordsfromwags.com.
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:09.600]   I just threw them on there.
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:11.340]   All the verses that go with each one of them,
[00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:13.300]   you can go there, there's all kinds of little hyperlinks
[00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:15.280]   you can click and just see and read those verses
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:16.760]   and understand why I've chosen them
[00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:17.880]   if you're curious about this stuff.
[00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:18.720]   But let me just tell you this,
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:20.560]   the number one thing I told my little girls
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:24.800]   is don't you ever buy the lie that anyone or anything
[00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:28.040]   other than Jesus Christ, who is a perfect,
[00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:31.100]   loving, tender warrior, can satisfy you.
[00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:34.760]   Don't you dare buy the lie that your worth
[00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:39.320]   is gonna come from some guy, from some man,
[00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:41.920]   'cause you'll never get your value from man.
[00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:44.720]   God gives you your value by saying you're my daughter.
[00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:46.000]   I tell my little girls all the time,
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.400]   and you are our treasure, and treasures don't do the hunting.
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:50.480]   You don't need to advertise, flaunt, flirt,
[00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:53.720]   give yourself away, compromise, you are a treasure.
[00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:56.680]   And that is why still to this day,
[00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:57.520]   you wanna know something?
[00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:59.000]   To this day, I've got girls in college,
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.280]   and when a guy wants to take them simply to a dance,
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:02.440]   they call me.
[00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:05.440]   And you might go, are you kidding me, man?
[00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:07.200]   What kind of control freak are you?
[00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:09.820]   I'm not a control freak.
[00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:12.480]   I just want those guys to know that little girl matters.
[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:15.180]   Every little girl matters.
[00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:16.220]   And you need to know that one,
[00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:18.160]   someone's paying attention to that one.
[00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:20.960]   And so you might just be wanting to take her out
[00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:22.340]   for an evening, but I'm gonna tell you something.
[00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:24.880]   I've been taking her out for 18, 20 years,
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:27.720]   and I'll continue to court her, honor her,
[00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:30.200]   love her, protect her, value her,
[00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:33.080]   until some other man steps up and say, I got it from here,
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:36.320]   in the same way that you did it, dad,
[00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:40.160]   with a tremendous sense of responsibility and stewardship,
[00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:43.340]   focusing on her interest and not yours.
[00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:45.340]   I got it from here, man.
[00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:46.840]   I'm gonna love her, cherish her, and honor her,
[00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:50.480]   serve her in every way that a man should.
[00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:52.640]   And until that time, they call me, man.
[00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:56.360]   And they go, hey, I, you know,
[00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:57.960]   they go to my little girl, and they'll just ask her
[00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:59.720]   right now, they'll say, hey man, can you,
[00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:00.960]   you wanna do something with me?
[00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:02.720]   And they'll say, hey, you know what?
[00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:05.480]   I'd love to talk to you about that,
[00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:07.680]   but before you do, you gotta call my dad.
[00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:10.880]   And by the way, this word gets out pretty quickly,
[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:13.400]   that that's what's gonna have to happen.
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:15.000]   And I've had amazing conversations.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.480]   I don't grill guys, I don't put 'em through some big test.
[00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:19.520]   I just share with them why I do this.
[00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:21.040]   And I let 'em know what's gonna, you know,
[00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:23.180]   happen with them that night when they're
[00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:24.340]   with my little girl.
[00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:28.040]   And why I expect them to treat her a certain way
[00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:30.480]   and to leave her in better shape than they found her.
[00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:32.600]   That's just to hang out for a night.
[00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:33.680]   My older one,
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:38.120]   my older one had one about a year and a half ago come
[00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:39.680]   and just say, hey, I don't wanna just hang out
[00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:41.240]   with your girl for a night, I'd like to intentionally
[00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:42.680]   begin to pursue her, and that entered into
[00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:44.720]   a whole different level of conversation.
[00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:46.240]   (congregation laughing)
[00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:48.280]   And appropriately so.
[00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:50.560]   And you know, man, it's been awesome.
[00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:51.400]   It has been awesome.
[00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:52.840]   I'll tell you one quick story about Allie
[00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:53.720]   that's worth you knowing.
[00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:55.720]   When Allie first got to Oklahoma State University,
[00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:59.760]   she went to a little party that her sorority
[00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:01.480]   and one of the fraternities there on campus,
[00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:02.600]   that was called a stoplight party.
[00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:04.600]   You ever been to one of those?
[00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:06.640]   Okay, a stoplight party, I'd never heard of one either.
[00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:08.480]   But a stoplight party is where everybody
[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:10.080]   either wears green, which means I'm here, baby,
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:12.400]   and I'm ready to go, all right?
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:16.360]   Yellow is it's complicated, and red is I'm committed,
[00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:19.320]   you know, and so I'm not really here
[00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:21.560]   to really mingle and mix.
[00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:24.240]   And so when you show up, what they do is they break you up
[00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:25.280]   into three different rooms, you know,
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:27.240]   the people that are available and free.
[00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:28.640]   You guys might go, hey, I like this.
[00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:30.080]   Where's the green section at the porch?
[00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:31.400]   I'm looking for it.
[00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:34.740]   (congregation laughing)
[00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:38.680]   All right?
[00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:42.880]   St. Patrick's Day every day, right?
[00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:47.400]   So green goes one place, yellow goes another,
[00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:48.440]   and red goes in the other room.
[00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:49.400]   They can just hang out and talk
[00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:50.240]   'cause they know everybody here
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:51.600]   has already got something going on.
[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:53.640]   And so Allie says, hey, Dad, you know what I did?
[00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:55.000]   You wanna know what I wore?
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.820]   I go, sure.
[00:15:56.820 --> 00:15:59.240]   She goes, I wore white.
[00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:02.840]   She goes, 'cause I'm not defined
[00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:04.680]   by my relationship with a guy.
[00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:07.160]   And she said, I showed up.
[00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:08.000]   I go, well, what rooms you go to?
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.680]   She goes, I went into all of them.
[00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:10.880]   I had the best time.
[00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:13.040]   I'll hang out with the green people for a while.
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:14.840]   And every one of them wanna talk to me.
[00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:17.080]   Why are you wearing white?
[00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:18.000]   And she looked them in the eye.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.880]   She goes, because in relationships,
[00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:21.360]   one day I'll have one, but that's not my thing.
[00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:22.400]   That's not how I'm defined, man.
[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:23.240]   How about you?
[00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:24.060]   Have a good day.
[00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:24.900]   She walked to the yellow room.
[00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:25.920]   Had great conversations.
[00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:27.480]   Hey, it shouldn't be complicated, man.
[00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:28.520]   It should be really easy.
[00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:29.360]   You're valuable.
[00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:31.040]   You don't need each other to validate one another.
[00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:32.880]   She moved into the red room.
[00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:33.720]   All right?
[00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:35.500]   She said, everybody said,
[00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:36.600]   if I ever go to another one of these things,
[00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:37.840]   I am wearing white.
[00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:39.360]   That's what they all told her.
[00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:40.640]   And here's the deal, gang.
[00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:42.200]   Wouldn't it be, and Allie got that
[00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:43.800]   because from the time she was little,
[00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:44.620]   I kept telling her,
[00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:47.320]   you're not gonna be defined by another person.
[00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:49.520]   You're gonna be defined by your value as a person.
[00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:50.560]   You're so valuable that God
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:52.360]   wouldn't redeem you from your lostness.
[00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:54.720]   Wouldn't you love to have a father that told you that?
[00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:57.280]   That didn't leave you
[00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:02.400]   vulnerable,
[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:04.000]   longing for somebody who could protect you
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:04.820]   and care for you,
[00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:05.840]   and then when some guy showed up
[00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:07.280]   and said he cared for you and valued you
[00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:09.360]   and honored you and gave you some affection,
[00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:12.560]   you let him give you all kinds of affection
[00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:13.760]   'cause he told you that's what you would do
[00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:14.740]   if you loved him?
[00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:19.080]   And you go, that didn't feel like a father's love.
[00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:21.480]   That felt very selfish
[00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:22.920]   and makes me feel very insecure
[00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:24.580]   and I don't feel like a treasure.
[00:17:24.580 --> 00:17:27.880]   I feel trashed.
[00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:31.280]   Man, God doesn't want you to feel that way.
[00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:35.120]   See, you matter a lot to God.
[00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:37.720]   This whole thing matters a lot to God.
[00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:39.440]   Marriage is a big deal to God.
[00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:42.080]   It's the foundation and the strength of our culture.
[00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:43.760]   God intended for you to be raised
[00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:45.680]   by a mom and a dad like that
[00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:48.360]   that taught you what it was to be a man,
[00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:50.000]   that taught you what it was to be a little girl,
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.200]   to protect you and honor you and value you
[00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:55.100]   and to teach you how to protect, honor, and value others.
[00:17:55.100 --> 00:18:01.760]   That loved and modeled commitment and tenderness
[00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:02.920]   and oneness with each other
[00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:04.720]   and you grew up and you were secure.
[00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:07.520]   You know, you maybe have heard this in the Bible.
[00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:09.680]   The Bible says God hates divorce.
[00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:12.080]   You ever heard that?
[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:15.360]   Well, some of you guys
[00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:18.080]   that are children of divorce households,
[00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:19.840]   you might go, well, you know, the Bible says God is love
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:21.360]   and if God is love, he better hate divorce
[00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:23.680]   'cause I'm gonna tell you what divorce did to me,
[00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:26.720]   how it left me scared and vulnerable,
[00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:31.720]   insecure, bitter, angry, alone.
[00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:36.520]   Can I encourage you with something, man,
[00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:37.560]   for some of you in this room?
[00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:39.880]   The Bible never says God hates divorcees.
[00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:44.640]   The Bible never says God hates sinners.
[00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:47.200]   The Bible says God demonstrates his love for sinners
[00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:49.700]   and for little girls that let themselves be treated
[00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:54.000]   like a sexual object because he loves them
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.760]   and wants to redeem them from that kind of abuse
[00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:58.160]   and misinformation.
[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:02.200]   And he's not even angry at guys
[00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:04.120]   that abuse those little girls.
[00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:08.880]   He's just like, hey, man, all that looking for love
[00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:10.400]   and all that trying to establish your strength
[00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:11.400]   and significance by doing that,
[00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:12.360]   it's not making you real happy.
[00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:14.100]   In fact, it leaves a series
[00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:15.620]   of destructive relationships around.
[00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:19.240]   I'm not mad at you, I'm just really sorry for you.
[00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:20.720]   And by the way, there's gonna be a consequence
[00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:21.940]   that's even bigger than that emptiness
[00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:23.920]   in your heart that's coming.
[00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:25.440]   It's gonna be a real emptiness
[00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:29.000]   and a real separation from what is good eventually
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.240]   if you don't deal with it.
[00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:34.320]   God loves every single person in this room.
[00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:36.160]   I don't care what you've been through.
[00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:39.720]   And tonight, what I wanna just share with you
[00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:42.320]   is what God intended marriage to be.
[00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:44.320]   And I'm gonna show you a metaphor in the midst of marriage
[00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:46.040]   that really does relate to every single one of us.
[00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:47.800]   And we have to do it really quickly.
[00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:51.000]   But I want you to see why marriage is a big deal to God
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.120]   and so why you oughta to right now
[00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:55.240]   start preparing yourself for it.
[00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:57.080]   And when you get into it, you oughta understand
[00:19:57.080 --> 00:20:00.360]   why it's more than just some agreement
[00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:01.860]   you make for a little while.
[00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:04.560]   It reminds me of a cartoon I saw one time
[00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:05.920]   of a couple that was there and the guy
[00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:06.880]   was just sweating profusely.
[00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:08.600]   He goes, "Man, what are you so nervous about?"
[00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:09.840]   And he goes, "I'm getting married."
[00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:11.040]   And the guy goes, "Well, man, I understand.
[00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:13.480]   "Seven or eight years can be a really long time."
[00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:17.600]   And you know, man, it kinda comes down to that now
[00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:21.040]   where we start to look at any relationship
[00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:23.720]   like I'm in this thing as long as it works for me.
[00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:26.080]   See, that's what needy people do.
[00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:28.200]   That is why the way, man, we're not here
[00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:30.320]   to talk about sex tonight, but one of the,
[00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:31.760]   let me just tell you, man, sex will keep you
[00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:34.280]   in a bad relationship long past its time
[00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:36.680]   and it also will drive you out of a relationship
[00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:37.920]   that could've been good and life-giving to you
[00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:39.840]   before you needed to be driven out.
[00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:44.440]   When you find people that really understand
[00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:46.040]   what love is, love gives.
[00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:48.900]   Love can't wait to give.
[00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:51.820]   It's lust that's constantly wanting to get.
[00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:55.000]   And you find somebody that all they wanna do
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.840]   is get, get, get from you and get after it with you,
[00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:57.840]   I'm gonna tell you, that person,
[00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:59.600]   no matter what they're whispering in your ear,
[00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:02.100]   let me just tell you, they are not driven by love.
[00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:05.820]   Okay, because love can't wait to give,
[00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:09.000]   not themself in pleasure, but themself
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.360]   in surrender and death.
[00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:13.840]   If you define love by anything less than a cross,
[00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:16.120]   you have cheapened love to something
[00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:17.560]   God never intended it to be.
[00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:19.680]   When the Bible describes love,
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:21.520]   it doesn't have anything to do with emotion.
[00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:24.240]   It is patient, it is kind, it is not proud,
[00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:26.000]   it is not arrogant, it doesn't boast,
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.360]   it does not act unrighteously,
[00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:28.480]   it does not act unbecomingly,
[00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:30.400]   it doesn't seek its own, it's not provoked,
[00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:33.340]   it does not take into account a wrong suffered.
[00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:34.960]   It bears all things, believes all things,
[00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:36.400]   hopes all things, it endures all things,
[00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:37.900]   it never fails.
[00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:40.000]   That's the love you want anyway, isn't it?
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.920]   But some of you guys are just, you know,
[00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:44.400]   you go, man, love is that feeling I feel
[00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:45.720]   when I feel like I've never felt before.
[00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:46.600]   No, it's not.
[00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:49.880]   Man, love is when I can't wait to give myself
[00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:50.780]   and get from that person.
[00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:52.720]   No, that's lust.
[00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:54.960]   And so many people go into a marriage relationship
[00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:57.760]   and what they're wanting to get
[00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:59.840]   is a sense of worth and value and fun.
[00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:02.880]   And man, marriage is work because it's two people
[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:04.820]   who are distinct in person,
[00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:06.680]   who are working to become one in essence.
[00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:09.220]   And that means there has to be a constant surrender to self.
[00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:11.440]   I'm gonna give you an amazing image of that tonight.
[00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:12.800]   And we should tell you what happens
[00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:14.540]   when you have a marriage the way God intends.
[00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:15.800]   Some of you were blessed to grow up
[00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:18.040]   in a marriage like that, in a home like that.
[00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:21.880]   And it's a tremendous gift of grace.
[00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:23.960]   Some of you guys have gotta learn
[00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:25.720]   what that really looks like 'cause you've never seen it.
[00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:28.240]   God's gotta re-parent you big time.
[00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:29.360]   And he wants to.
[00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:31.400]   And I hope tonight's a little bit of that.
[00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:36.660]   This is what God said marriage is all about.
[00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:41.660]   Marriage, biblically, has really five big purposes.
[00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:43.460]   I'm gonna move rather quickly through these.
[00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:45.040]   But the first one is to mirror his image.
[00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:46.920]   See, the person of God is very complicated.
[00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:48.200]   The word trinity, you guys do know,
[00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:49.640]   never shows up in the scripture.
[00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:52.480]   You might hear that we are what we call Trinitarians.
[00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:53.840]   And people go, "Well, what's that mean?"
[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:56.200]   It means basically that we are describing
[00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:57.920]   using a word that's not in your Bible
[00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:00.360]   what God has described himself to be like
[00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:02.560]   in multiple places throughout the scripture.
[00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:06.280]   The Bible says God is one.
[00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:09.680]   But it also reveals God in the person
[00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:11.520]   of the Father and the Son and the Spirit.
[00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:13.680]   We don't believe there are three gods who are one God.
[00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:15.160]   That's a contradiction.
[00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:18.880]   We believe there is one God who is revealed in three persons
[00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:20.800]   and there's all kinds of analogies
[00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:23.960]   that people try and use to explain the trinity to you.
[00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:25.960]   And the most famous one is water.
[00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:27.080]   And so what they'll say is like,
[00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:29.000]   you know, God's kind of like H2O,
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.840]   two parts hydrogen, one part oxygen.
[00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:32.480]   And depending on what's going on,
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:34.360]   he's either a liquid, a solid, or a gas.
[00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:36.600]   And he kind of morphs with the environment
[00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:38.040]   and what he needs to do.
[00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:39.640]   And so there was a time when he walked on earth
[00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:42.060]   and he needed to kind of morph into a solid.
[00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:46.760]   And so we beheld the solid.
[00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:47.980]   And we called the sun solid.
[00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:49.200]   Bro, you solid, we love you.
[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:50.760]   You died for us, that's solid.
[00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:56.120]   But that's not consistent with what the scriptures teach.
[00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:57.100]   Okay?
[00:23:57.100 --> 00:23:58.880]   We don't believe in what's called modalism,
[00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:00.840]   where God just shifts his mode.
[00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:02.000]   That's the problem with that analogy.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.440]   There's all kinds of different analogies
[00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:04.360]   to explain the trinity.
[00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:05.480]   But can I tell you something?
[00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:10.480]   The Bible only gives us one that he says really explains it.
[00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:12.200]   And it's a mystery.
[00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:17.400]   And it's when two very distinct person, this is key,
[00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:21.300]   who are equal in value and dignity,
[00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:24.700]   and who in this case are both sempternal.
[00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:27.360]   Meaning from some point, they came into being
[00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:28.880]   and they exist forever.
[00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:31.120]   That's every man and every woman that ever existed.
[00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:33.520]   God is not sempternal, he is eternal.
[00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:35.120]   He always was and always will be.
[00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:38.760]   And God said that he has always existed forever
[00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:40.680]   as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
[00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:45.800]   And companionship and completion and love
[00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:49.220]   have eternally existed in the character and nature of God.
[00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:50.320]   They're not human inventions.
[00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:52.860]   They're not the highest metaphysical ideas of men.
[00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:54.200]   They've been eternally there.
[00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:55.880]   And what God says, you wanna really see the mystery
[00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:56.780]   of what I'm like?
[00:24:56.780 --> 00:24:58.000]   It's when you've got two persons
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.200]   who are equal in dignity and essence.
[00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:04.740]   Choose to give themselves to one another,
[00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:07.120]   not because it's easy, not because they feel like it,
[00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:08.780]   not because they get pleasure from it,
[00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:10.480]   but because they are going to say,
[00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:12.080]   we are going to love each other.
[00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:15.320]   And the two shall become one.
[00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:17.800]   You know, the old joke is that most couples,
[00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:19.260]   when they get married, they spend the first five years
[00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:21.660]   fighting over which one they're going to become.
[00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:24.320]   And that's not the picture.
[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:28.840]   The picture is that there's something really beautiful
[00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:32.480]   about JP and Monica, about Todd and Alex,
[00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:37.680]   as we live in mutual subjection, remember that.
[00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:39.520]   Mutual subjection.
[00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:42.120]   So marriage mirrors God's image.
[00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:44.040]   When it's done the way God says it should be done.
[00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:45.740]   There is no way to mirror God's image
[00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:48.440]   unless you are walking with the Lord
[00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:49.540]   and have been redeemed from the Lord
[00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:51.600]   to walk in the way that our relationships walk.
[00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:54.220]   By the way, what was the very first casualty of the fall?
[00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:56.380]   It was that these two people that lived
[00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:57.480]   in relationship with God,
[00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:59.300]   therefore they were at peace with one another.
[00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:01.480]   And the very second that they chose
[00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:04.320]   to find and find life apart from God,
[00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:06.160]   immediately it was a blame game.
[00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:07.020]   You're not like me.
[00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:08.620]   I'm embarrassed in front of you.
[00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:10.640]   Why'd this happen?
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:11.460]   It's your fault.
[00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:13.040]   No, it's your fault.
[00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:14.800]   And they hid from God and they hid from each other.
[00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:17.980]   The very first casualty of sin was relationship.
[00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:22.560]   Relationship with God and relationship with one another.
[00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:24.300]   Now I'm gonna show you, remember this.
[00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:25.360]   In Genesis one and two,
[00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:26.820]   I'm gonna show you in just a second
[00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:28.660]   what God said the order of creation was.
[00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:31.280]   And it was beautiful and it was without conflict.
[00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:32.980]   And we mirrored his image.
[00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:36.260]   Two people together who were one
[00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:38.000]   had distinct and specific roles,
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.120]   but lived in mutual exaltation, admiration,
[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:42.620]   and subjection to one another.
[00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:45.240]   The son says, "The Father is greater than I."
[00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:46.340]   The father says to the son,
[00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:48.260]   "This is my beloved son in whom I'm well pleased.
[00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:49.160]   "Listen to him."
[00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:52.840]   The spirit says, "I live to exalt the son."
[00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:53.880]   The son says, "I don't do anything
[00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:56.000]   "that's not the will of the father."
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.280]   The father says, "The son is the one
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:58.420]   "with the name above all names."
[00:26:58.420 --> 00:27:00.380]   It is a mutual admiration society.
[00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:04.400]   It's not one trying to get the other to serve him.
[00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:07.240]   They're both saying, "I'm all about you."
[00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:09.480]   And in a marriage, when we yield to Christ,
[00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:12.480]   and that's what happens in our heart as we're regenerate,
[00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:13.680]   it becomes a really beautiful thing.
[00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:14.720]   I'm gonna show you a picture of this.
[00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:17.280]   It's gonna blow you away in a minute.
[00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:18.920]   It mirrors God's image like nothing else.
[00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:21.140]   There's no other metaphor or analogy out there.
[00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:26.140]   Secondly, in Genesis 1, 28, it multiplies.
[00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:28.480]   Marriage was the means that God gave us
[00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:30.140]   to multiply a godly heritage.
[00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:30.980]   God blessed them.
[00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:33.360]   God said to them, "Be fruitful and multiply."
[00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:35.200]   In other words, when he gave this command,
[00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:36.600]   it was a man who walked with God,
[00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:38.440]   a woman who walked with God, who loved one another,
[00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:40.340]   and he said, "You raise others to know me
[00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:42.120]   "and the goodness of my will and way."
[00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:44.260]   And they will follow you as you follow me.
[00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:48.600]   Now, by the way, just like good seed brings forth good fruit
[00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:50.320]   when Adam and Eve rebelled against God,
[00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:53.040]   guess which kind of fruit they brought forth?
[00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:54.400]   Other little rebels.
[00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:58.800]   That's always the law of creation,
[00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:01.020]   that creatures produce after their kind.
[00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:05.280]   And ever since that moment, there's been nothing
[00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:08.960]   but fallen humanity which comes forward.
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:10.680]   All of us are imperfect.
[00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:12.640]   All of us are in need of redemption.
[00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:14.480]   And God offers redemption to all of us.
[00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:15.560]   And I'm gonna show you what happens
[00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:17.740]   when you receive that redemption.
[00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:20.040]   But we were to mirror his image.
[00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:22.520]   We were to multiply, and then we were to manage.
[00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:25.000]   Watch this, it also says, "And let them rule
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.320]   "over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky
[00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:29.820]   "and over the cattle of the fields.
[00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:30.900]   "And over every other creeping thing
[00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:31.880]   "in the face of the earth."
[00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:33.240]   They were to rule together.
[00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:34.400]   They were to manage the world.
[00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:36.200]   They weren't supposed to let the world manage them.
[00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:38.120]   Together, husband and wife, male and female,
[00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:40.960]   with all their complexity and differences and components.
[00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:44.920]   Guys with their ability to kind of segment
[00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:46.680]   and guys with their individual strength
[00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:50.060]   and guys with all the ways that he made them had a role.
[00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:54.120]   And in concert with women who were tender,
[00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:56.040]   much more complex, much more in tune,
[00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:58.440]   who can't wall things off,
[00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:01.260]   who speak clearly and lovingly to their husband,
[00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:03.160]   with all the input in the world,
[00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:05.040]   as the husband confidently listens to them
[00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:07.400]   because he understands that he needs that girl.
[00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:09.760]   I'm gonna show you how he knows that.
[00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:13.420]   See, marriage is God's means to mirror to the world
[00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:15.720]   his image that he is desperate to know
[00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:18.960]   who he is, what he's like, and why they should love him.
[00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:21.080]   It is his means through which the world
[00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:24.260]   will be multiplied with others that can enjoy him forever.
[00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:27.860]   It is his means through which the world can be ruled
[00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:30.600]   and managed in a way that reflects his honor and glory.
[00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:34.300]   And marriage, in Genesis 2:18,
[00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:37.220]   when God retells the creation story
[00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:39.960]   by focusing on the pinnacle of this creation,
[00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:42.280]   which is man and woman, is when he says,
[00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:44.000]   hey, it's not good for man to be alone.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.160]   He shows Adam that.
[00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:48.480]   Before he allowed Adam to have the woman,
[00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:52.780]   he showed the man, you aren't perfect yet.
[00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:54.640]   God said it was good, it was good, it was good.
[00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:56.500]   And when he completed and finished creation
[00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:58.960]   by bringing the fullness of the revelation
[00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:00.760]   of what he decided to do through humanity
[00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:02.360]   into that with woman and man,
[00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:05.080]   that's when he said it is very good.
[00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:07.300]   What he did with Adam is he had Adam
[00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:09.220]   of all the animals of the earth parade before him,
[00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:11.100]   and he saw for every Mr. Hippo there was a Mrs. Hippo,
[00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:13.660]   every Mr. Kangaroo there was a Mrs. Kangaroo.
[00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:15.940]   And he goes, there's no Mrs. Adam for Adam.
[00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:22.860]   And so God said to him, I'm gonna put you to sleep,
[00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:24.980]   and from the flesh of your flesh and bone of your bone,
[00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:28.700]   I'm gonna bring forth the woman that you need,
[00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:30.340]   and it's not good for you to be alone.
[00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:31.300]   You need one another.
[00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:35.280]   There's a mutual completion that happens in marriage.
[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:39.720]   Let me just tell you, when you get into marriage,
[00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:42.240]   you'll find out that we both, as I said in the beginning,
[00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:46.360]   we're two persons, very distinct,
[00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:48.140]   equal in dignity and honor,
[00:30:48.140 --> 00:30:51.040]   but we have different strengths,
[00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:53.200]   and we have different roles.
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:57.480]   Many guys go, my role is to lead the wife.
[00:30:57.480 --> 00:30:59.400]   The wife's job is to be subject to the husband.
[00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:00.340]   By the way, guys, do you know this?
[00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:03.440]   The Bible never tells the man to lead his wife.
[00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:05.280]   The Bible tells the man to love his wife.
[00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:08.440]   By the way, women, you are not called to submit to men.
[00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:10.760]   You are called one day when you find a man
[00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:13.320]   who follows Christ and loves as Christ has loved
[00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:15.240]   because he's been loved by Christ,
[00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:17.600]   to covenant with that man as he promises
[00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:20.080]   to give himself to you the way Christ gave himself
[00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:23.440]   for the church, and to that one man you submit.
[00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:27.600]   What kind of man, a man that does nothing
[00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:29.040]   from selfishness or empty conceit
[00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:30.580]   but with humility of mind considers you
[00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:32.140]   as more important than himself,
[00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:36.420]   and would never tell you what to do for him
[00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:40.200]   because he's gonna love you the way Christ loves the church?
[00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:41.860]   Man, you find a guy like that,
[00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:44.580]   you find a God that dies to redeem you,
[00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:47.640]   and I'm like, what wouldn't I do for that God?
[00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:49.900]   I'm not trying to earn his love,
[00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:51.540]   I'm just trying to respond to it.
[00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:55.660]   Every woman dreams of giving herself wildly
[00:31:55.660 --> 00:32:00.660]   and recklessly to a man who wildly, recklessly surrenders
[00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:06.460]   to cherish and honor, celebrate and sanctify her.
[00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:07.300]   Right, ladies?
[00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:09.820]   That's what you're dreaming of.
[00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:14.460]   That's why every fairy tale has this noble guy
[00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:17.400]   who risks his life to rescue you.
[00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:22.380]   See, you don't need to be rescued, you're already rescued.
[00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:26.820]   But what he should do is model the great rescuer's love.
[00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:31.620]   Ladies, don't you dare, don't you dare marry a guy
[00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:33.780]   who doesn't understand what love looks like.
[00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:37.060]   Love can't wait to give.
[00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:39.460]   Those guys that tell you they love you
[00:32:39.460 --> 00:32:43.060]   and all they're doing is getting, they're lying.
[00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:45.840]   They're lying.
[00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:49.580]   Marriage is God's way to mirror his image to a world
[00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:50.820]   that he's desperate to reveal himself to.
[00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:52.340]   It's his way to multiply godly heritage
[00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:53.780]   through which one day evil would be defeated.
[00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:55.220]   It's his way to manage and rule the world
[00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:58.220]   in a way that would speak of his complexity and glory.
[00:32:58.220 --> 00:32:59.500]   It is his way to mutually complete
[00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:00.860]   his most cherished creation, and watch this.
[00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:02.440]   This is the one I wanna spend a little bit more time on.
[00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:06.260]   It's his way to model to the world his infinite love.
[00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:11.700]   And so when you get to Ephesians chapter five,
[00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:15.500]   what you see right here is God starting to really speak
[00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:19.460]   about this metaphor of marriage.
[00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:23.140]   And what I love about this is I'm gonna show you tonight,
[00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:25.820]   as you one of what really makes a relationship work,
[00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:27.300]   what really makes a relationship work
[00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:32.240]   is when the stronger one loves and serves the weaker.
[00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:38.420]   When the stronger one gives their life for the weaker
[00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:41.600]   and doesn't use their strength emotionally and physically
[00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:43.180]   to lord it over the weaker.
[00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:51.020]   This is what the scripture says in Ephesians chapter five.
[00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:54.060]   The M I'd give you for this is just simply to model.
[00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:59.060]   It says, we'll start right there in verse,
[00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:00.760]   let's start in 18.
[00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:04.420]   'Cause verse 18 says, "Don't get drunk with wine,
[00:34:04.420 --> 00:34:07.220]   "for that is dissipation, but be filled with the Spirit."
[00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:08.900]   This is talking to people that have already come
[00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:11.780]   to understand what it means to know about the goodness
[00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:13.100]   and the greatness of God.
[00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:14.860]   And it's saying that God that you acknowledge
[00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:17.820]   is good and great, yield to him, follow him.
[00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:20.020]   Now that you have the Spirit of truth in you,
[00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:22.060]   and this is the Spirit of truth, that God is good
[00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:23.980]   and that he loves you and he's not trying to rip you off
[00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:25.740]   and keeping you from fun and party.
[00:34:25.740 --> 00:34:27.860]   God's trying to lead you to where the party is.
[00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:29.620]   He is the party.
[00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:30.780]   Read your Bible.
[00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:35.020]   Your Bible doesn't say that God is a rule monger
[00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:36.620]   that's trying to slap your hands
[00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:38.900]   every time you reach for something sweet.
[00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:42.340]   The Bible says, "In his presence is fullness of joy,
[00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:44.980]   "and in his right hand is pleasures forever."
[00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:48.100]   Get that little small-minded, deceitful lie
[00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:51.240]   out of your mind that God is here to rip you off.
[00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:54.500]   It is why you keep looking to a liar
[00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:55.860]   who tells you that you can find life
[00:34:55.860 --> 00:34:57.060]   where there is no life at all.
[00:34:57.060 --> 00:34:58.980]   There is emptiness.
[00:34:58.980 --> 00:35:00.420]   And he tells you you are so treasured
[00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:01.500]   you can be your own king.
[00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:03.300]   What he doesn't tell you is you are in no condition
[00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:05.380]   to be a king, because you are broken.
[00:35:05.380 --> 00:35:11.260]   And you follow a spirit of error in a world of error.
[00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:13.980]   And there's a God who's over there whispering,
[00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:15.900]   here's a spirit of truth,
[00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:18.780]   and there's a kingdom that is perfect.
[00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:20.900]   Come, come here.
[00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:24.620]   And so what this verse is basically saying,
[00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:26.380]   when you come to know that God,
[00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:28.420]   the spirit of rebellion, the spirit of deceit,
[00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:30.940]   the spirit of error, is now replaced
[00:35:30.940 --> 00:35:35.480]   with a spirit of truth, that God is freely given
[00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:38.020]   to all of us who know him and love him.
[00:35:39.580 --> 00:35:41.460]   We see him for who he is,
[00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:43.620]   and we're not running away from him anymore,
[00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:45.500]   but we're finally saying, man, if it's true
[00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:48.040]   that you are God and you died for me,
[00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:49.520]   then what else wouldn't you do for me?
[00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:51.140]   Is that good thinking?
[00:35:51.140 --> 00:35:52.060]   Isn't that good thinking?
[00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:54.340]   What if I told you this was the story?
[00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:57.500]   God was there, he created you, he put you in paradise.
[00:35:57.500 --> 00:35:59.080]   You thought you could do better than him.
[00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:01.460]   You flipped him off, scoffed at him,
[00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:03.340]   and you suffered for it, and that paradise
[00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:05.780]   became a place of destruction and insecurity.
[00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:07.560]   And God should have killed you right then,
[00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:08.700]   but he didn't kill you.
[00:36:09.580 --> 00:36:11.620]   He brought forth an atoning sacrifice
[00:36:11.620 --> 00:36:14.100]   that anticipated the one day that he himself would come
[00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:17.040]   and be a perfect eternal sacrifice to atone
[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:18.660]   for the perfect eternal debt you had
[00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:20.060]   before a perfect eternal God.
[00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:21.400]   What if I told you that story,
[00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:23.780]   and I could show you it was true?
[00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:25.300]   And what if I told you that God doesn't want you
[00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:27.200]   to earn his love, but just receive it?
[00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:29.940]   And he tells you to come here,
[00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:31.500]   and all you gotta do is acknowledge
[00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:33.820]   this little paradise you're trying to create
[00:36:33.820 --> 00:36:35.540]   is not a paradise.
[00:36:35.540 --> 00:36:37.500]   It's a place of loneliness and unwanted pregnancy,
[00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:42.500]   and sexually transmitted diseases, and insecurity.
[00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:47.380]   And he's just saying, I'm not mad at you.
[00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:48.660]   You're just reaping what you're sowing.
[00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:49.860]   I'd love you to come out.
[00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:52.020]   I'd love to touch you and make you whole
[00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:53.020]   and beautiful again.
[00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:57.260]   And so he says, quit following that Arab deceit.
[00:36:57.260 --> 00:36:59.100]   What he's saying is, look, sometimes when you drink wine,
[00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:00.220]   that's why they're called spirit shops,
[00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:01.820]   you drink wine, you become less than the person
[00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:02.660]   you should be.
[00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:04.420]   When you don't walk in the spirit of truth,
[00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:06.040]   you become less than the person you should be.
[00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:07.460]   That's why what it's saying right here
[00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:08.940]   is not you're empty, you need something else,
[00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:10.100]   but it's saying, having come to understand
[00:37:10.100 --> 00:37:13.540]   that God is good, let that truth control you.
[00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:15.060]   And so when you think of being filled with something,
[00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:17.100]   it's not something empty, getting something poured in,
[00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:19.660]   it can mean that, but it also means control, right?
[00:37:19.660 --> 00:37:21.180]   Man, that dude's filled with lust, that's why he does it.
[00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:22.300]   That dude's filled with road rage,
[00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:24.620]   that's why he just shot that guy.
[00:37:24.620 --> 00:37:25.940]   That guy's filled with insecurity,
[00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:27.900]   that's why he always acts that way.
[00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:29.660]   That's the way the words use right here.
[00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:31.100]   Be filled with the spirit.
[00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:33.760]   Be continually controlled by the spirit of God.
[00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:34.980]   Now watch what happens when you do that.
[00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:36.300]   It changes your tongue.
[00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:38.540]   You speak to one another differently.
[00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:40.500]   It changes your attitude towards God.
[00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:41.960]   You're no longer bitter and wanting more.
[00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:42.860]   You know what he's done for you,
[00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:44.660]   and all you do is thank him, because even the trouble,
[00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:46.180]   he says he's gonna work out.
[00:37:46.180 --> 00:37:47.660]   He said, "Don't be surprised by the trouble.
[00:37:47.660 --> 00:37:48.580]   "That's 'cause you live in a world
[00:37:48.580 --> 00:37:49.840]   "that I've not completely redeemed yet,
[00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:52.740]   "although there are redeemed ones living in it."
[00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:54.060]   That's why some of you guys come here
[00:37:54.060 --> 00:37:55.300]   and you live hell as his life,
[00:37:55.300 --> 00:37:56.460]   but every time you leave, you go,
[00:37:56.460 --> 00:37:58.780]   there was something sweet about that place tonight.
[00:37:58.780 --> 00:38:03.140]   It's because there's some people here
[00:38:03.140 --> 00:38:05.140]   that are reminding you of something that's so wonderful,
[00:38:05.140 --> 00:38:07.460]   and you still don't have the faith to believe it's true.
[00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:12.300]   And then the third thing that happens is, watch this.
[00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:13.140]   This is so important.
[00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:14.180]   It's in verse 21.
[00:38:14.180 --> 00:38:15.380]   People that are filled with the spirit
[00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:18.580]   are subject to one another in love.
[00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:20.740]   Everybody forgets that verse.
[00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:23.100]   They go right to verse 22, and they freak out.
[00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:26.620]   But remember, what is marriage?
[00:38:26.620 --> 00:38:27.740]   It mirrors the Trinity.
[00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:30.620]   The Father is subject to the Son.
[00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:32.720]   The Son is subject to the Father.
[00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:34.020]   The Spirit is subject to the Son.
[00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:35.660]   The Son is subject to the Spirit.
[00:38:35.660 --> 00:38:42.420]   It says now, "Wives, to these men
[00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:46.460]   "that are redeemed by this God and this God of grace
[00:38:46.460 --> 00:38:47.580]   "who loves you and is gonna love you
[00:38:47.580 --> 00:38:48.820]   "in a way I'm about to teach you,
[00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:50.880]   "be subject to that guy.
[00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:52.320]   "Let him do what I created him to do.
[00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:54.180]   "You do what I created you to do.
[00:38:54.180 --> 00:38:56.340]   "Wives, be subject to your own husbands."
[00:38:56.340 --> 00:38:58.340]   It doesn't say women, be subject to men.
[00:38:58.340 --> 00:39:02.700]   It says, "Wives, be subject to your godly husband."
[00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:07.060]   "As to the Lord, for the husband is the head of the wife,
[00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:08.860]   "as Christ also is the head of the church,
[00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:11.180]   "he himself being also the savior of the body."
[00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:14.460]   Watch this, "But as the church is subject to Christ,
[00:39:14.460 --> 00:39:16.100]   "so also the wives ought to be subject
[00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:17.700]   "to the husband in everything."
[00:39:17.700 --> 00:39:19.340]   Now I'm gonna remind you of something in just a second.
[00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:20.160]   Watch this.
[00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:21.300]   Now it says this to the guys.
[00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:25.220]   "Husbands, love your wives just as Christ
[00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:27.340]   "also loved the church and gave himself up for her."
[00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:28.220]   So here's what I wanna do.
[00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:29.060]   I'm gonna take this to the moment.
[00:39:29.060 --> 00:39:30.780]   I'm gonna show you the husband's job description
[00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:32.060]   and the wife's job description.
[00:39:32.060 --> 00:39:34.180]   And I'm gonna give you a little compassion
[00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:35.680]   for each other as you battle.
[00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:39.260]   All right, when you get married,
[00:39:39.260 --> 00:39:41.140]   it's not gonna be easy because even though
[00:39:41.140 --> 00:39:42.520]   I've been redeemed by the blood of Christ,
[00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:44.780]   I still am not sanctified completely yet.
[00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:46.180]   I'm learning his ways and there are times
[00:39:46.180 --> 00:39:48.340]   I'm not filled with the spirit, I'm filled with Todd,
[00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:51.180]   and so I act in an unloving, abusive way towards my wife.
[00:39:51.180 --> 00:39:54.380]   And it's never sweet and there's never oneness
[00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:55.820]   when I do that, it's just like the garden.
[00:39:55.820 --> 00:39:57.220]   It's your fault, no, it's your fault.
[00:39:57.220 --> 00:39:59.380]   And we turn into two junior high kids.
[00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:00.480]   And it's just pitiful.
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.160]   (congregation laughing)
[00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:05.720]   But watch this, this is the husband's job description.
[00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:07.000]   We'll just kinda rip 'em off.
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.240]   The husband's job is to love Christ,
[00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:10.800]   and love the wife as Christ loved the church.
[00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:12.840]   That means he is to love unconditionally.
[00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:16.900]   Not just unconditionally, but constantly.
[00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:18.640]   Not just constantly, but completely.
[00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:20.340]   And not just a little bit, but sacrificially,
[00:40:20.340 --> 00:40:22.940]   even to the point of death, which is completely selfless.
[00:40:22.940 --> 00:40:24.580]   There's that, the point of the death thing.
[00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:28.260]   Endlessly, eternally, constantly initiating.
[00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:31.680]   Not waiting for the wife to come to her senses,
[00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:35.820]   but while she is still stuck in whatever it is
[00:40:35.820 --> 00:40:38.940]   that she's stuck in, to initiate love and grace with her.
[00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:41.820]   With great patience that's tender, unshakable,
[00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:43.860]   and we're to do all of that like Christ did,
[00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:45.740]   at which is to say, perfectly.
[00:40:45.740 --> 00:40:47.180]   Look at that job description.
[00:40:47.180 --> 00:40:52.140]   That is how Todd Wagner's supposed to love Alex Wagner.
[00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:53.340]   Y'all think that's easy?
[00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:57.300]   There's no chance in the world I have got
[00:40:57.300 --> 00:40:59.700]   to love anybody that way unless Christ
[00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:01.260]   is informing my entire life.
[00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:03.220]   All the time.
[00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:04.580]   And I am being filled with the spirit.
[00:41:04.580 --> 00:41:06.180]   Now watch, real quickly, we'll come back to that
[00:41:06.180 --> 00:41:08.360]   in a moment, let me show you the wife's job description.
[00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:10.620]   The wife is to be subject to the husband
[00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:12.360]   as the church is to be subject to Christ.
[00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:15.140]   So how is the church to be subject to Christ?
[00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:17.980]   How is the wife to relate to this husband
[00:41:17.980 --> 00:41:19.420]   who loves her that way?
[00:41:19.420 --> 00:41:22.740]   They're to be responsive, respectful, obedient,
[00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:24.740]   submissive, there's that word, humble,
[00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:27.660]   enduring, fully committed, and devoted.
[00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:30.300]   I could give you more words, but there basically
[00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:33.100]   is the job description of a woman in the context
[00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:35.900]   of a relationship with a man that has been redeemed.
[00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:39.260]   This is how the redeemed get along.
[00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:42.620]   And so let me just remind you, take a good look
[00:41:42.620 --> 00:41:45.060]   at these two job descriptions right there.
[00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:46.900]   And I want you to just have a little bit
[00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:48.260]   of compassion for each other.
[00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:50.060]   Hey, gals, it is not easy
[00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:55.540]   to have to try and love you the way Christ loves you.
[00:41:55.540 --> 00:41:57.540]   And we're gonna need mercy, and we're gonna need grace,
[00:41:57.540 --> 00:42:00.180]   and we're gonna need your patience and forgiveness.
[00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:01.620]   But I mean, honestly, look at those two.
[00:42:01.620 --> 00:42:03.740]   What's harder, to respond, be respectful,
[00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:05.940]   obedient, submissive, humble, enduring, full, and devoted,
[00:42:05.940 --> 00:42:08.460]   or to love unconditionally, constantly, completely,
[00:42:08.460 --> 00:42:10.260]   sacrificially, selflessly, to the point of death,
[00:42:10.260 --> 00:42:11.940]   endlessly, eternal, initiating with great patience,
[00:42:11.940 --> 00:42:13.700]   tender, unshakable, and do it perfectly?
[00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:15.780]   Which of those two do you think is harder?
[00:42:15.780 --> 00:42:18.020]   It's not the guy.
[00:42:22.180 --> 00:42:23.700]   It's not the guy, and I'm gonna tell you why.
[00:42:23.700 --> 00:42:24.660]   Are you ready, man?
[00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:28.940]   Because just remember for a second,
[00:42:28.940 --> 00:42:30.680]   this isn't just the guy's job description
[00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:32.140]   and the wife's job description.
[00:42:32.140 --> 00:42:34.260]   This is what Christ really did,
[00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:37.740]   and what we're supposed to do to respond to him.
[00:42:37.740 --> 00:42:38.820]   So let me ask you a question.
[00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:41.000]   Is there any guy in the history of the world
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:44.100]   that has loved the way that Christ did?
[00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:46.060]   Say no with me.
[00:42:46.060 --> 00:42:46.900]   No.
[00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:48.780]   Here's my question.
[00:42:48.780 --> 00:42:50.500]   Is there any Christian in a church
[00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:52.020]   in the history of the world that has a God
[00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:53.860]   that did what Christ did?
[00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:54.940]   All of us.
[00:42:54.940 --> 00:42:58.540]   Which means my bridegroom loves me unconditionally,
[00:42:58.540 --> 00:43:00.340]   constantly, completely, sacrificially, selflessly,
[00:43:00.340 --> 00:43:01.740]   to the point of death, endlessly, eternally,
[00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:03.780]   initiating with me in my sin, with great patience,
[00:43:03.780 --> 00:43:06.240]   tenderly, unshakably, and perfectly loving me.
[00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:10.020]   I've got a perfect husband, a perfect bridegroom.
[00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:11.180]   My question is this, Todd,
[00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:12.580]   how are you doing at responding to him
[00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:14.460]   and living respectfully, obediently before him,
[00:43:14.460 --> 00:43:18.020]   being submissive to him, humbly adoring him,
[00:43:18.020 --> 00:43:20.220]   fully devoted to him?
[00:43:21.220 --> 00:43:24.900]   And I've got a perfect husband.
[00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:30.220]   Can you imagine, guys, how hard it would be
[00:43:30.220 --> 00:43:33.940]   to do that when you've got a moody, insecure,
[00:43:33.940 --> 00:43:39.940]   constantly changing, misinformed leader?
[00:43:39.940 --> 00:43:47.020]   How'd you like to serve that God?
[00:43:47.020 --> 00:43:48.420]   Who's good in the days that he wants to be,
[00:43:48.420 --> 00:43:50.420]   who uses his strength to intimidate you,
[00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:53.260]   who uses his wisdom and his verbal skills
[00:43:53.260 --> 00:43:55.460]   to just shut you up and wear you out,
[00:43:55.460 --> 00:43:58.740]   and say, "Why don't you just submit to me?"
[00:43:58.740 --> 00:44:00.540]   You see, God doesn't lead like that.
[00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:03.420]   And ladies, I know some of you have been told,
[00:44:03.420 --> 00:44:04.680]   you'll never submit to a man.
[00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:06.340]   I don't want you to submit to a sinner either.
[00:44:06.340 --> 00:44:10.300]   I want you to know a guy that is doing everything he can
[00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:13.140]   to respond to a lover like this,
[00:44:13.140 --> 00:44:16.180]   so that they would begin to imitate him.
[00:44:18.140 --> 00:44:19.660]   That you might have a man that,
[00:44:19.660 --> 00:44:20.820]   at least when he doesn't do that,
[00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:22.660]   doesn't tell you just to submit,
[00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:25.340]   repents before you and seeks your forgiveness,
[00:44:25.340 --> 00:44:29.380]   and loves you the way that God says he should all over again.
[00:44:29.380 --> 00:44:30.220]   Do you see why?
[00:44:30.220 --> 00:44:31.100]   Let me tell you something, guys.
[00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:32.660]   This is why Jesus is saying to you,
[00:44:32.660 --> 00:44:34.460]   "Hey, don't rush into this metaphor,
[00:44:34.460 --> 00:44:36.620]   "this thing called marriage, too quickly.
[00:44:36.620 --> 00:44:39.060]   "And please don't do it with somebody
[00:44:39.060 --> 00:44:40.700]   "who has not been loved by me,
[00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:43.580]   "because they will not love you.
[00:44:43.580 --> 00:44:47.320]   "And what you'll have to do is take up arms against them."
[00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:51.160]   "And it will not be pretty, and you will suffer,
[00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:52.480]   "and your children will suffer,
[00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:54.320]   "and the society you live in will suffer,
[00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:56.040]   "so much so that you'll want to start loving
[00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:57.880]   "somebody like you instead of a man."
[00:44:57.880 --> 00:45:01.160]   And when that starts happening,
[00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:03.280]   it gets really, really lonely.
[00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:07.120]   And God's just saying to you,
[00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:09.640]   "I'm not mad at you.
[00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:12.700]   "There's no way you guys are gonna get along without me.
[00:45:12.700 --> 00:45:13.640]   "From the moment you left me,
[00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:16.320]   "you've been pointing fingers at each other.
[00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:17.920]   "But can I show you something really beautiful?
[00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:19.420]   "I'm gonna give you the metaphor right here,
[00:45:19.420 --> 00:45:20.960]   "and then I'm done."
[00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:23.320]   I stumbled across this in 1996.
[00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:27.620]   I came across two little girls that were six years old.
[00:45:27.620 --> 00:45:29.560]   One's name was Abigail, and one name was Brittany.
[00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:31.320]   I want you to see a picture of them.
[00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:33.840]   They're co-joined twins.
[00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:40.760]   And Abigail and Brittany have what is called dicephalus.
[00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:44.640]   And so, let me just show you a picture of their body
[00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:45.820]   and what's going on.
[00:45:45.820 --> 00:45:47.800]   They have two separate trunks.
[00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:50.400]   And so, from the waist up, they're two different people,
[00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:51.240]   but they're co-joined.
[00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:52.880]   And from the waist down, they're one person.
[00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:54.060]   They each got one leg.
[00:45:54.060 --> 00:45:56.040]   They couldn't separate them
[00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:59.340]   because neither person could survive without the other.
[00:45:59.340 --> 00:46:00.320]   And even if one could,
[00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:03.600]   how would they choose which one was gonna die,
[00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:04.440]   the parents said.
[00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:07.600]   And so, as these little girls grew up,
[00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:08.960]   let me just tell you a little bit about them.
[00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:11.080]   Each of them has their own heart, their own stomach,
[00:46:11.080 --> 00:46:13.640]   but together they rely on three lungs.
[00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:15.160]   Their spines join at the pelvis,
[00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:17.840]   below the waist they have organs of a single person.
[00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:19.780]   Each controls the limbs and trunk
[00:46:19.780 --> 00:46:22.400]   and feels sensations on her own side exclusively.
[00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:25.140]   If you tickle the ribs on the right, only Abby giggles.
[00:46:25.140 --> 00:46:27.840]   And yet the girls manage.
[00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:31.120]   No one knows exactly how, watch this, to move as one being.
[00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:34.920]   No one knows how they're doing it
[00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:37.000]   because they have completely different nervous systems
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.360]   and yet they're completely aware of one another.
[00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:43.200]   They have learned to swim, they have learned to ride bikes,
[00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:45.080]   they've learned now as they're older
[00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:48.700]   to ride motorcycles, drive cars.
[00:46:48.700 --> 00:46:51.360]   They can run, they can skip.
[00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:52.560]   They're completely different.
[00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:53.400]   Everything is different.
[00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:55.560]   Abby likes blue, Brittany prefers pink.
[00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:57.900]   Brittany's an animal, Abby loves to draw.
[00:46:57.900 --> 00:47:02.600]   Brittany loves milk, Abby despises it and loves orange juice.
[00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:06.080]   Abby is strengthened from the calcium that Brittany drinks.
[00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:07.800]   Brittany is strengthened from the vitamin C
[00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:08.800]   that Abby gives her.
[00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:12.320]   (audience laughing)
[00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:21.360]   Brittany finds food boring, Abby tends to be the leader.
[00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:24.240]   Brittany, the one on the left,
[00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:27.640]   is a little bit more quiet and reflective.
[00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:29.380]   Sometimes they argue.
[00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:32.160]   One time, Brittany hit Abby in the head with a rock.
[00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:35.960]   But they have obvious incentives
[00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:38.260]   to arrive at a consensus very quickly.
[00:47:38.420 --> 00:47:39.900]   (audience laughing)
[00:47:39.900 --> 00:47:41.740]   When they can't agree on which way to go,
[00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:45.340]   which is a rare occurrence, they can't go anywhere.
[00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:47.860]   They literally cannot move.
[00:47:47.860 --> 00:47:51.780]   When one misbehaves, they're both sent to the room.
[00:47:51.780 --> 00:47:54.780]   (audience laughing)
[00:47:54.780 --> 00:47:55.620]   It's beautiful.
[00:47:55.620 --> 00:47:59.340]   I watched this and the more I read, the more I go,
[00:47:59.340 --> 00:48:00.660]   man, that's my marriage.
[00:48:00.660 --> 00:48:06.620]   And the amazing thing is is when I love my wife
[00:48:06.620 --> 00:48:09.660]   as my own body, which is what Ephesians 5 tells me to do,
[00:48:09.660 --> 00:48:11.660]   through the mystery of becoming like Jesus
[00:48:11.660 --> 00:48:15.940]   as I yield to his spirit and I die to myself day by day
[00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:18.140]   as a response to the God who loved me
[00:48:18.140 --> 00:48:20.740]   and gave himself for me, I don't just,
[00:48:20.740 --> 00:48:21.900]   when my wife says to me,
[00:48:21.900 --> 00:48:24.020]   hey, you're not making me feel very valued,
[00:48:24.020 --> 00:48:25.580]   I don't say something like this.
[00:48:25.580 --> 00:48:27.220]   Well, if you didn't feel that way,
[00:48:27.220 --> 00:48:28.580]   we wouldn't have a problem.
[00:48:28.580 --> 00:48:34.120]   I go, hey, man, it really doesn't matter how I feel.
[00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:36.860]   If that's how you feel, I gotta change what I'm doing.
[00:48:36.860 --> 00:48:39.060]   I wanna understand why you feel that way.
[00:48:39.060 --> 00:48:43.420]   Because if one of us is not doing well, we both suffer.
[00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:48.000]   And there are days that I do that because I love Jesus
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:50.480]   and Jesus is patient with me and guides me.
[00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:53.180]   And man, it's beautiful.
[00:48:53.180 --> 00:48:55.060]   Let me read you this line.
[00:48:55.060 --> 00:48:57.740]   It says, bound to each other but defiantly independent.
[00:48:57.740 --> 00:49:00.220]   One, is that just a beautiful description of marriage?
[00:49:00.220 --> 00:49:03.200]   Bound to each other but defiantly independent.
[00:49:04.100 --> 00:49:05.660]   God doesn't want you to lose your personage
[00:49:05.660 --> 00:49:06.900]   when you come into a relationship with him
[00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:08.180]   and you don't lose your personage
[00:49:08.180 --> 00:49:09.500]   when you come into a relationship with another,
[00:49:09.500 --> 00:49:11.100]   but both of you guys become what Jesus
[00:49:11.100 --> 00:49:12.340]   wants you to be together.
[00:49:12.340 --> 00:49:16.060]   It says, these little girls are a living textbook
[00:49:16.060 --> 00:49:19.220]   on camaraderie and compromise, on dignity and flexibility,
[00:49:19.220 --> 00:49:22.020]   on the subtler varieties of freedom and togetherness.
[00:49:22.020 --> 00:49:27.100]   These little girls have volumes to teach us about love.
[00:49:27.100 --> 00:49:31.700]   Can I just make a suggestion to you, man,
[00:49:31.700 --> 00:49:33.600]   if you can ever figure this thing out,
[00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:36.900]   and you live together with a woman that just goes,
[00:49:36.900 --> 00:49:38.300]   you wanna know why I'm subject to that guy?
[00:49:38.300 --> 00:49:40.360]   'Cause all that guy does is serve me, love me,
[00:49:40.360 --> 00:49:42.500]   honor me, cherish me, and value me.
[00:49:42.500 --> 00:49:46.060]   I can't wait to have sex with him.
[00:49:46.060 --> 00:49:47.820]   I can't wait to wash his underwear.
[00:49:47.820 --> 00:49:51.100]   I can't wait to pick up his dirty laundry
[00:49:51.100 --> 00:49:53.920]   because if you knew what that guy did for me,
[00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:55.620]   if you knew the way he treated me,
[00:49:55.620 --> 00:49:58.620]   you know what, I can't wait to vacuum up the mud
[00:49:58.620 --> 00:50:00.460]   that his boots drag across this floor
[00:50:00.460 --> 00:50:02.780]   because on those boots carry the man
[00:50:02.780 --> 00:50:07.540]   who loves me like no man has ever loved a woman.
[00:50:07.540 --> 00:50:10.140]   That's my man, and I'm his woman.
[00:50:10.140 --> 00:50:11.780]   And when you see a guy do that,
[00:50:11.780 --> 00:50:13.380]   and it's all about her feelings,
[00:50:13.380 --> 00:50:15.140]   and it's all about what's important to her,
[00:50:15.140 --> 00:50:18.140]   the world just goes, who are you to?
[00:50:18.140 --> 00:50:20.100]   You've got something to teach us about love,
[00:50:20.100 --> 00:50:22.260]   and we can say, you know how this is happening?
[00:50:22.260 --> 00:50:25.200]   To insecure, fallen, selfish creatures,
[00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:28.580]   we have been redeemed, and we don't battle anymore.
[00:50:29.740 --> 00:50:31.340]   Selfless people don't battle.
[00:50:31.340 --> 00:50:34.300]   Love can't wait to give, and I serve the king
[00:50:34.300 --> 00:50:38.980]   who has loved me, and I love much.
[00:50:38.980 --> 00:50:43.540]   You see, God's not looking to rip you off, man.
[00:50:43.540 --> 00:50:44.940]   He's looking to set you free.
[00:50:44.940 --> 00:50:47.540]   And I just close by telling you this.
[00:50:47.540 --> 00:50:49.580]   Listen, every relationship is only as healthy
[00:50:49.580 --> 00:50:51.740]   as the least healthy person in it.
[00:50:51.740 --> 00:50:53.180]   And so if you're gonna have a successful marriage,
[00:50:53.180 --> 00:50:54.960]   instead of wondering who it is you're gonna marry,
[00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:57.140]   start focusing on who you're going to be
[00:50:57.140 --> 00:50:58.980]   when you get married.
[00:50:58.980 --> 00:51:01.300]   And I would beg you not to marry somebody
[00:51:01.300 --> 00:51:03.540]   who isn't already well married.
[00:51:03.540 --> 00:51:04.640]   What do I mean by that?
[00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:08.300]   What I mean by that is you find a guy
[00:51:08.300 --> 00:51:11.260]   who is responding to Jesus, yielding to Jesus,
[00:51:11.260 --> 00:51:14.180]   submitting to Jesus, living purely,
[00:51:14.180 --> 00:51:16.660]   because that's what Jesus says is the right
[00:51:16.660 --> 00:51:18.380]   and pleasant and pleasing and right
[00:51:18.380 --> 00:51:19.940]   and glorious thing to do.
[00:51:19.940 --> 00:51:22.780]   Gals, can I just tell you something?
[00:51:22.780 --> 00:51:25.020]   If you got a guy who says he loves Jesus
[00:51:25.020 --> 00:51:28.220]   and isn't doing what Jesus says he wants him to do,
[00:51:28.220 --> 00:51:30.060]   and Jesus is a perfect lover,
[00:51:30.060 --> 00:51:32.980]   what makes you think he's going to be faithful to you
[00:51:32.980 --> 00:51:34.020]   in your imperfection?
[00:51:34.020 --> 00:51:37.500]   I would just tell you guys, man,
[00:51:37.500 --> 00:51:40.060]   don't lower your standards, lengthen your patience.
[00:51:40.060 --> 00:51:45.060]   I have a good friend, when she turned 40,
[00:51:45.060 --> 00:51:48.580]   her Christmas card was a picture of a cow chip and her.
[00:51:48.580 --> 00:51:52.220]   And she said, "Do you wanna know what women
[00:51:52.220 --> 00:51:54.580]   "and cow chips have in common?"
[00:51:54.580 --> 00:51:55.420]   And because she was single,
[00:51:55.420 --> 00:51:57.900]   and she just put her cell phone number down
[00:51:57.900 --> 00:52:00.260]   so we'd all call her on Christmas.
[00:52:00.260 --> 00:52:02.140]   She said, "Call me on Christmas and I'll tell you."
[00:52:02.140 --> 00:52:03.980]   And so it was a riddle, and I love that.
[00:52:03.980 --> 00:52:06.060]   And I called her, I go, "Kathy,
[00:52:06.060 --> 00:52:08.780]   "what do women and cow chips have in common?"
[00:52:08.780 --> 00:52:10.260]   And she goes, "The older they get,
[00:52:10.260 --> 00:52:12.100]   "the easier they are to pick up."
[00:52:12.100 --> 00:52:13.540]   I thought that was hilarious.
[00:52:13.540 --> 00:52:16.880]   (congregation laughing)
[00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:20.940]   The year she turned 40, that was her Christmas card.
[00:52:20.940 --> 00:52:23.180]   And I wanna tell you something,
[00:52:23.180 --> 00:52:26.940]   Kathy was a virgin, and Kathy remained a virgin
[00:52:26.940 --> 00:52:28.220]   for three more years.
[00:52:28.220 --> 00:52:31.460]   Kathy never lowered her standards.
[00:52:31.460 --> 00:52:34.540]   She lengthened her patience.
[00:52:34.540 --> 00:52:36.580]   She found her significance in Jesus Christ.
[00:52:36.580 --> 00:52:39.180]   And now she is married to an incredible guy
[00:52:39.180 --> 00:52:41.460]   that loves her the way Christ loved the church.
[00:52:41.460 --> 00:52:43.780]   I don't know if you're gonna get married,
[00:52:43.780 --> 00:52:45.820]   but you gotta get out of that lie
[00:52:45.820 --> 00:52:47.340]   that a good marriage is 100,
[00:52:47.340 --> 00:52:49.340]   and not being married is a zero.
[00:52:49.340 --> 00:52:51.660]   And so if I get in a bad marriage, at least it's a one.
[00:52:51.660 --> 00:52:53.060]   That is a lie from the pit of hell.
[00:52:53.060 --> 00:52:55.120]   Can I tell you something?
[00:52:55.120 --> 00:52:58.780]   A good marriage might be 100, but a bad marriage is no zero.
[00:52:58.780 --> 00:53:00.520]   It's a negative 100, friends.
[00:53:00.520 --> 00:53:05.840]   And so Jesus says, "Come to me.
[00:53:05.840 --> 00:53:09.560]   "Don't worry about who's gonna marry you.
[00:53:09.560 --> 00:53:11.500]   "Let me show you how much you're worth.
[00:53:11.500 --> 00:53:13.040]   "And you grow in relationship to me.
[00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:14.240]   "And one day as you're seeking me,
[00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:15.900]   "maybe you'll run up against somebody
[00:53:15.900 --> 00:53:19.100]   "who's doing battle against their selfishness,
[00:53:19.100 --> 00:53:21.260]   "and they might jump in the ring of faithfulness with you,
[00:53:21.260 --> 00:53:23.140]   "and it will be a glorious thing."
[00:53:23.140 --> 00:53:24.500]   Amen?
[00:53:24.500 --> 00:53:26.780]   Father, I pray for my friends,
[00:53:26.780 --> 00:53:28.460]   that they would believe those words,
[00:53:28.460 --> 00:53:32.420]   that they would come to a place where they understood
[00:53:32.420 --> 00:53:35.220]   that you love them,
[00:53:35.220 --> 00:53:36.820]   and that you're not looking to rip them off,
[00:53:36.820 --> 00:53:39.920]   but you want them to have a picture
[00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:41.300]   of what real love looks like.
[00:53:41.300 --> 00:53:43.020]   It's not some erotic feeling.
[00:53:43.020 --> 00:53:44.820]   It's not some emotional welling up.
[00:53:44.820 --> 00:53:47.340]   It is a selfless surrendering,
[00:53:47.340 --> 00:53:50.900]   a shedding of blood, a tearing of flesh, a sacrifice
[00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:56.520]   that is perfect, that initiates with somebody
[00:53:56.520 --> 00:53:58.320]   that was not lovable at all
[00:53:58.320 --> 00:53:59.600]   for the purpose of redeeming them.
[00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:02.240]   Oh, Father, that we would know that love,
[00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:05.120]   and that we would then begin to respond to the Spirit
[00:54:05.120 --> 00:54:06.720]   that informed that love,
[00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:07.640]   and it would indwell us,
[00:54:07.640 --> 00:54:10.920]   and we would begin to love others as we have been loved.
[00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:12.520]   And that there might be a day that we share, then,
[00:54:12.520 --> 00:54:15.280]   a life and a covenant with to mirror to the world
[00:54:15.280 --> 00:54:18.640]   how two distinct persons equal in dignity can become one,
[00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:20.380]   even as you're three in one.
[00:54:20.380 --> 00:54:22.240]   That we might together manage our lives
[00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:23.680]   in mutual subjection to one another
[00:54:23.680 --> 00:54:25.240]   in a way that would bring dignity and glory
[00:54:25.240 --> 00:54:26.920]   to a family and to children.
[00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:29.520]   That we would multiply a godly heritage
[00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:30.960]   as we live in subjection to you
[00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:34.360]   and raise our kids to walk with a God that redeems.
[00:54:34.360 --> 00:54:36.600]   And that we would model in a way that the world would say,
[00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:39.060]   you two have much to teach us about love.
[00:54:39.060 --> 00:54:41.280]   And we would say,
[00:54:41.280 --> 00:54:43.760]   do you wanna know the solution to this mystery?
[00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:45.200]   It's Christ in us.
[00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:47.960]   And apart from this, we have no hope.
[00:54:47.960 --> 00:54:51.080]   So, Father, that relationship will start
[00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:54.480]   as people in this room begin to seek you first
[00:54:54.480 --> 00:54:56.240]   and not a spouse.
[00:54:56.240 --> 00:54:57.280]   Would you do that?
[00:54:57.280 --> 00:55:00.700]   For your glory and their good.
[00:55:00.700 --> 00:55:01.540]   Amen.
[00:55:01.540 --> 00:55:05.280]   - There's such a danger in preaching and teaching
[00:55:05.280 --> 00:55:07.640]   because in so many ways, I feel like those
[00:55:07.640 --> 00:55:11.400]   that open the word of God really defined your view of God.
[00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:17.120]   And they kinda show you who God is and what he's like.
[00:55:17.120 --> 00:55:18.580]   And then when you sit alone with him,
[00:55:18.580 --> 00:55:20.240]   you think back on the things you learned,
[00:55:20.240 --> 00:55:22.360]   and you're like, oh, that's who you are.
[00:55:22.360 --> 00:55:23.380]   I know you.
[00:55:23.380 --> 00:55:28.000]   That's the man who taught me who God was.
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:29.520]   Can we thank him one more time?
[00:55:29.520 --> 00:55:33.020]   (congregation applauding)
[00:55:33.020 --> 00:55:42.620]   He talks about Ali and Kirby and Landry and his kids,
[00:55:42.620 --> 00:55:43.720]   and he just said that,
[00:55:43.720 --> 00:55:48.020]   don't you wish you had a father like that?
[00:55:49.720 --> 00:55:52.840]   And I want you to know you do.
[00:55:52.840 --> 00:55:56.800]   You do have a father like that.
[00:55:56.800 --> 00:55:58.800]   It's like he's asking you, what do you want me to do
[00:55:58.800 --> 00:56:00.880]   to show you that I love you?
[00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:02.840]   I've done a lot of weddings, and I love how they're,
[00:56:02.840 --> 00:56:05.080]   I watch the groom, I love how he watches the doors
[00:56:05.080 --> 00:56:09.120]   as the doors come open and the bride comes through,
[00:56:09.120 --> 00:56:11.740]   and she gets blurry because he begins to cry,
[00:56:11.740 --> 00:56:13.000]   and he's just beaming, you know?
[00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:15.480]   And it's like, that's the moment,
[00:56:15.480 --> 00:56:17.000]   that's what we're waiting for.
[00:56:17.880 --> 00:56:21.040]   And that's how Christ looks at you, right now,
[00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:24.960]   not when you get right, man, not when you get clean,
[00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:28.780]   not when you clean up your act right now,
[00:56:28.780 --> 00:56:32.640]   and I'm talking about you, specifically you.
[00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:36.320]   He's like, man, I love you so much.
[00:56:36.320 --> 00:56:37.580]   I died for you.
[00:56:37.580 --> 00:56:40.320]   I paid the price for you.
[00:56:40.320 --> 00:56:42.480]   (silence)
[00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:44.640]   (silence)
[00:56:44.640 --> 00:56:46.800]   (silence)
[00:56:46.800 --> 00:56:56.800]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
