[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.920]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.800]   Across the world, pain comes in many forms.
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:23.000]   War, poverty, persecution.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.160]   We hear bad news every day.
[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.160]   Your ability to worship is restricted or forbidden.
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.360]   And in the hardest to reach places in the world,
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.280]   bad news isn't just on social media or TV.
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.320]   It's on their streets.
[00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.920]   It's breaking up their homes.
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.320]   It's attacking their churches.
[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.120]   These distant places are home to billions
[00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.360]   of people who have never heard the name of Jesus.
[00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.160]   How will they hear?
[00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.640]   Who will tell them there is hope for the hopeless,
[00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.600]   food for the hungry, water for the thirsty?
[00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.400]   The gospel of Jesus for broken sinners.
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.000]   You have heard of it.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.600]   But who will tell them?
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:23.600]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.000]   Really good to be at the porch.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.880]   I only have a few minutes tonight
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.880]   to talk about the greatest injustice in the world.
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.480]   So I'm just going to jump right in, if that's all right.
[00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:46.760]   Let me tell you where the next few minutes are going.
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.280]   At the end of our time together, I'm
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.440]   going to offer you a specific invitation
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:04.720]   to stand right where you are in this room,
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:10.760]   or I know I've prayed over those of you who are in Fort Worth,
[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.040]   and Houston, and Austin, and Midland, and Scottsdale,
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.320]   and Boise, and Tulsa, and Cincinnati, and Des Moines,
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.680]   and Indianapolis, and Lafayette.
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.040]   So even though you're not in the room,
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:30.760]   this invitation is for you to stand right where you are.
[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:38.640]   If you would be willing to put a stake in the ground tonight
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.880]   and say the following--
[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.800]   I'm going to put it up here on the screen.
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.960]   If you'd be willing to say, God, I
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:57.480]   will do whatever you call me to do, no matter what it costs,
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.240]   to get the gospel to people who have never heard it.
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:08.000]   God, I will do whatever you call me to do,
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.680]   no matter what it costs, to get the gospel to people who've
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:13.240]   never heard it.
[00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:19.880]   So key words in the statement would be God.
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.760]   This is you standing before God.
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.000]   It's not about standing because somebody else is standing,
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.560]   or you think you should stand, or you feel bad sitting.
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:40.920]   It's about you soberly saying to the God who made you,
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:47.480]   who loves you, before whom you will stand one day,
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.760]   and to say that you will do whatever,
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.800]   so no strings attached.
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.760]   God, if that is to pack my bags and move somewhere else,
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.000]   anywhere else in the world, I will do it.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.200]   If that is to sell my possessions, any possessions,
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:13.240]   if that is to stay single, or if that is to only marry somebody
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.620]   else who's saying the same thing,
[00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.680]   it would make no sense to say this and then marry somebody
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.040]   who's not saying this.
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.040]   So you're at a minimum reducing the number
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.000]   of people you would marry.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.480]   So we're talking about major decisions in your life,
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.280]   now, in the future, and the rest of your life.
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.960]   This is saying, God, whenever, wherever, however,
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:43.400]   whatever you call me to do, no matter what it costs,
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.400]   knowing that there is absolutely no way for you
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.360]   to carry out this commitment without cost,
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.800]   without sacrifice.
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.800]   This is not for everybody.
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:59.240]   Many of you are not ready to say this, so don't stand.
[00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.080]   We're talking about sacrifice to do what?
[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:09.360]   To get the gospel, it's the good news of God's love in Jesus,
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:16.680]   to people, to men, women, and kids, and young adults,
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:25.920]   just like you and me, who follow this, have never heard it.
[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:32.800]   And people who've never heard the gospel.
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.400]   I'm gonna show you a map up here on the screen
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.640]   that is based on a Research Joshua project,
[00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.520]   and we as Radical have worked with them together on,
[00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.600]   but there's obviously three main colors on this map.
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.120]   You've got green, yellow, and red.
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:50.280]   The green areas of this map represent places
[00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:54.800]   where the gospel has gone, where there are Christians
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.880]   in churches spreading the gospel.
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.480]   Obviously, it doesn't mean that everybody
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:01.640]   in those green areas is a follower of Jesus.
[00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.000]   We know that. It's not true in Texas,
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.320]   and there's a lot of Christians in churches in Texas.
[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:10.520]   So the green areas are places where disciples have been made
[00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:11.720]   and churches have been planted,
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:16.560]   and there's gospel spreading that's able to happen.
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.600]   Yellow areas are places that are less reached by the gospel,
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.640]   and it's usually going in one of two directions.
[00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.280]   So either like, picture Europe.
[00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:26.160]   These are places, some of them,
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.280]   where the gospel used to be prevalent
[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:31.400]   and has waned in influence,
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.960]   and so there's a lot less gospel access now,
[00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.320]   or it could be going the other way.
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:38.120]   The gospel's recently come to a place,
[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:42.440]   and it's growing, but it's still not widespread.
[00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:45.560]   And then there's the red areas on this map,
[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:51.080]   and the red areas are where unreached people live.
[00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:55.560]   And what that word "unreached" means is not just lost.
[00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.120]   It's not just that they are sinners
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:02.200]   who are separated from God by their sin.
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:06.880]   People are just like that in Dallas, Texas.
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.480]   The difference is there's Christians
[00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:11.520]   in churches in Dallas, Texas.
[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:14.280]   In the middle of Saudi Arabia,
[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:16.280]   there's very few Christians in very few churches,
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:19.400]   and what that means is if you live in Saudi Arabia,
[00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:22.080]   the likelihood is you've not been reached by the gospel.
[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:24.360]   You don't have access to the gospel around you.
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:28.680]   You don't have a Christian or a church near you
[00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:30.440]   where somebody can share with you
[00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:32.400]   the good news of God's love in Jesus.
[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:33.640]   You're unreached by it.
[00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:37.800]   Practically, what that means is you'd be born,
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.000]   and you'd live, and you'd die,
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.680]   and the likelihood is you'd never hear the gospel.
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:47.320]   This is why we don't say, "I don't know why we talk
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:48.520]   "about unreached people around the world.
[00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:50.080]   "I mean, there's unreached people in my office,
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:51.600]   "or there's unreached people in my neighborhood.
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:54.200]   "Those people are not unreached."
[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:55.480]   You say, "How do you know?"
[00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:59.600]   'Cause they're in your office or your neighborhood.
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:01.000]   Like, they have access to the gospel.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.840]   You're it.
[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:04.960]   We're talking about people who don't have access
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:06.560]   to the gospel in this red area,
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:11.560]   and that red area includes about 3.2 billion people.
[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:25.640]   3.2 billion people who will die
[00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:27.720]   without ever hearing the gospel
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:31.720]   if somebody doesn't go there,
[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:34.200]   or if the few believers who are there
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:38.320]   don't get help and support.
[00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:41.160]   They're unreached.
[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:42.080]   And here's the deal.
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:46.320]   I actually believe we can reach them.
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:48.120]   Not any one of us individually,
[00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:51.160]   but all of us together as the church.
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:53.400]   Think about the world we live in today,
[00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:56.600]   globalization, urbanization, the move of people to cities,
[00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.920]   ease of travel, new technologies.
[00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:01.760]   We have more opportunities to spread the gospel
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:05.120]   in the world than we've ever had before in history.
[00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:08.760]   The church in the first century could have only dreamed
[00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:11.520]   about the opportunities we have to reach the nations.
[00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:16.120]   It took them months to sail from one city to the next.
[00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:17.760]   You and I can get to the other side of the world
[00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:18.800]   in a day.
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:22.960]   They had to write letters that would take weeks,
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:27.160]   months to be delivered between social media,
[00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:28.920]   translation software, the metaverse,
[00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:30.720]   and we can communicate with people around the world
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:33.480]   in real time from what's in our pocket.
[00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:38.960]   I look out across this room,
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:41.640]   and I think about others in different places,
[00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:45.640]   and whether it's some who are college students
[00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:47.680]   getting degrees that will open doors,
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:49.720]   others who have degrees, have jobs,
[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:53.080]   that have opened doors to get into places in the red.
[00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:58.880]   For any nurses, doctors, medical students,
[00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:02.480]   I could point you tonight to hundreds of jobs
[00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:05.120]   right in the heart of the Middle East for you to get,
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:11.160]   where they will pay you to come share the gospel there.
[00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:15.560]   I mean, they don't know that's what they're paying you to do.
[00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:19.120]   But the same's true for teachers, engineers,
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:22.040]   entrepreneurs, business leaders, fitness specialists.
[00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:23.400]   I could go on and on and on.
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:25.480]   In addition to all the jobs we can get here
[00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:28.960]   in one of the wealthiest places in the history of the world
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:30.680]   that can support work in the red.
[00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:34.840]   But it all starts with saying,
[00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:38.320]   God, I will do whatever you call me to do,
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:39.720]   no matter what it costs,
[00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:43.200]   to get the gospel to people who have never heard it.
[00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:47.400]   In order to lead to this invitation
[00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:50.760]   for some of you to stand and to say this,
[00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:52.400]   I actually wanna do something a little different.
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:55.480]   I wanna flip this idea around for a moment
[00:10:55.480 --> 00:11:00.480]   and ask the question, what if we don't stand and say this?
[00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:05.160]   In other words, what happens if we don't do
[00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:06.760]   whatever God calls us to do?
[00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:08.680]   What happens if we don't sacrifice,
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:12.000]   we don't get the gospel to people who've never heard it?
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   What happens to 3.2 billion people when they die
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.840]   if we don't get the gospel to them?
[00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:23.520]   That's a pretty important question, isn't it?
[00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:26.840]   For like 3 billion people in the world?
[00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:33.480]   And I think for most Christians in America
[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:35.120]   where the gospel has come,
[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:40.480]   either we don't realize there are 3 billion people
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:43.560]   in the world who've never heard the gospel,
[00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:49.480]   or we think they'll be okay when they die,
[00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:50.560]   they'll go to heaven.
[00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:54.840]   That's the only answer I can come up with
[00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:56.920]   for why we are not talking about this
[00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:58.680]   all the time in our churches
[00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:03.200]   and everywhere in Christianity today.
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:06.400]   Like if we believed 3 billion people were dying
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:10.320]   and going to hell without ever hearing about heaven,
[00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:11.960]   I think we'd be talking about that all the time.
[00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:13.480]   Like we have to do something.
[00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:17.120]   And not just a few of us here or there, like all of us,
[00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:20.200]   we gotta do something, we gotta pull our resources together,
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:22.600]   we gotta go, we gotta send, we gotta get behind
[00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:23.640]   brothers and sisters who are already there.
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:25.760]   Like this is not tolerable.
[00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:30.320]   We're passionate about justice.
[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:35.320]   Is there any greater injustice than 3 billion people
[00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:39.000]   going to an eternal hell while all the people who know
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.040]   how to go to an eternal heaven sit back
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:42.320]   and do little to nothing?
[00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:46.920]   Which is, by the way, what we are doing.
[00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:49.960]   Like we've done the research.
[00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:56.120]   We spend most of our money on ourselves.
[00:12:56.120 --> 00:13:01.400]   We give some of our money to churches and ministries.
[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:06.200]   And we spend most of that money in churches and ministries
[00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:09.480]   on making ourselves more comfortable in our churches
[00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:11.960]   and ministries.
[00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:15.040]   And then there's a small percentage of the money
[00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:16.600]   that we give to churches and ministries
[00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:19.400]   that goes toward what we normally call it, like missions,
[00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:24.040]   overseas to other countries, to work in other countries.
[00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:26.360]   We give a very small percentage to that.
[00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:30.280]   But out of that percentage that we give to missions,
[00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:34.480]   do you know how much of that goes to red areas on the map?
[00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:40.480]   Approximately 1% of our missions giving.
[00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:49.360]   We spend 99% of our missions giving on green areas,
[00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:52.320]   Latin America, Sub-Saharan Africa, Europe.
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:58.560]   I'm not saying it's bad to give to what God is doing
[00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:00.840]   among our brothers and sisters in green areas.
[00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:06.480]   But we're fooling ourselves if we think we're passionate
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:09.240]   about giving to missions while we're ignoring
[00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:12.000]   3 billion people who've never heard the gospel.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.880]   And even missionaries, most missionaries who go,
[00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:19.280]   go to places that are green on this map,
[00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:23.240]   which I guess makes sense if the people in the red
[00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:24.240]   are going to heaven.
[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:30.200]   But it makes no sense if they're going to hell.
[00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:34.800]   So what does the Bible say?
[00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:37.120]   What does God tell us happens to them?
[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:42.040]   I just want to show you what the Bible says about them
[00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:48.480]   in a way that I hope will leave us with a clear answer
[00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:52.520]   to what happens if we don't do whatever God calls us to do
[00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:54.760]   no matter the cost to get the gospel to them.
[00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:58.800]   So could I just encourage you to write this down
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:01.520]   either physically in some way,
[00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:04.640]   or at least imprint it on your mind and your heart
[00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:07.920]   so there's clarity about what happens to them,
[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:10.840]   to this 3.2 billion people?
[00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:16.000]   So first thing we know about them,
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.680]   this is all, if you want to follow along in your Bible,
[00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:21.280]   I want you to pull it out, Romans.
[00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:22.800]   We'll start in chapter one and then we're going to be
[00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:25.440]   in Romans for all these different things
[00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:27.400]   we're going to learn about them.
[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:28.920]   So starting in Romans one, verse 18,
[00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:31.760]   if you don't have a Bible, you can follow along on the screen.
[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:36.200]   So first thing we know about these 3.2 billion,
[00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:37.680]   they have knowledge of God.
[00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:41.160]   They have knowledge of God.
[00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:44.400]   This is Romans chapter one, verse 18.
[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:46.240]   The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven
[00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:48.400]   against all the godlessness and wickedness of men
[00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:50.160]   who suppress the truth of God by their wickedness
[00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:54.920]   since what may be known about God is plain to them
[00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:58.720]   because God has made it plain to them.
[00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:00.680]   For since the creation of the world,
[00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:02.240]   God's invisible qualities, his eternal power
[00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:04.080]   and divine nature have been clearly seen,
[00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:05.480]   being understood from what has been made
[00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:10.480]   so that men are without excuse, clearly seen who God is.
[00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:15.680]   Then it says in verse 21, although they knew God,
[00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:17.800]   they have knowledge of God.
[00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:22.480]   All the people in the red, no matter where they live,
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:25.240]   who they are, have knowledge of God.
[00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:27.800]   God's revealed himself in creation
[00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:29.320]   to every single one of them.
[00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:36.120]   Of course, they don't all acknowledge or believe in God,
[00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:39.160]   which leads to the second thing about them.
[00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:42.240]   They have all rejected God.
[00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:46.440]   Romans chapter one, verse 21 makes this clear.
[00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:49.840]   Although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God
[00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:52.480]   nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile
[00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:54.400]   and their foolish hearts were darkened.
[00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:56.240]   Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools
[00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:58.880]   and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images
[00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:00.160]   made to look like mortal man and birds
[00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:01.680]   and animals and reptiles.
[00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:02.640]   Therefore God gave them over
[00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:03.960]   from the sinful desire of their hearts
[00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:05.720]   to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies
[00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:06.680]   with one another.
[00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:09.080]   They exchanged the truth of God for a lie
[00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:12.080]   and they worshiped and served created things
[00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:15.360]   rather than the creator who is forever praised.
[00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:18.280]   So they all rejected God.
[00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:19.840]   They've not glorified him as God.
[00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:21.960]   They've turned aside from him as God.
[00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:24.240]   And to be clear, this is not just talking about
[00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:29.000]   them, it's talking about every single person in the world,
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   yellow, green, red, including every single one of us
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.800]   in this gathering tonight.
[00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:42.240]   This is the reality of sin in every single person's heart,
[00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:45.720]   in my heart, in your heart, and in every person
[00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:46.560]   around the world.
[00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:48.840]   We have all sinned against God.
[00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:51.560]   We've turned aside from God's ways to our own ways,
[00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:54.360]   from God's truth to our thoughts.
[00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:58.920]   We have rejected God and they have all rejected God.
[00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:03.320]   Which leads to the third truth about them.
[00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:04.560]   And again, this is not even just talking
[00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:05.400]   about those in the red.
[00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:07.240]   In a way, this applies to all of us.
[00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:10.240]   None of them are innocent before God.
[00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:13.520]   Not one of them.
[00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:16.920]   These initial chapters in Romans are so sobering.
[00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:21.920]   From Romans 1, 18 to 2, 16, you see the sinfulness
[00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:25.280]   of Gentiles outside of the covenant people of God.
[00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:26.640]   Then around chapter two, verse 17,
[00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:28.240]   all the way to chapter three, verse eight,
[00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:30.360]   you see the Jewish people, covenant people of God,
[00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:31.760]   described in their sinfulness.
[00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:34.640]   And then you get to verse nine, or verse 10,
[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:37.680]   it says, "As it is written, there is no one righteous,
[00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:39.840]   "not even one."
[00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:41.080]   No one.
[00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:42.920]   So see the repetition here, who understands?
[00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:44.480]   No one who seeks God.
[00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:46.000]   All have turned away.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.400]   They've become worthless.
[00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:51.740]   There is no one who does good, not even one.
[00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:55.280]   Could it be any clearer that all people
[00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:58.000]   are guilty of sin before God?
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.760]   And here's why this is so important,
[00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:04.680]   because I think about how this question is most often asked.
[00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:08.600]   Somebody will say to me, "What do you think happens
[00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:11.240]   "to the innocent man or woman or child
[00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:14.040]   "in X part of the world who never hears the gospel?"
[00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:18.360]   If you ask me that question, I would say,
[00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:21.400]   based on the word of God,
[00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:24.520]   that person without question goes to heaven,
[00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:28.020]   even though they've never heard the gospel.
[00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:33.200]   If they're innocent, why do they need to hear
[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:34.760]   how they can be saved from sin?
[00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:38.120]   Of course they go to heaven.
[00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:40.520]   The only problem is they don't exist.
[00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:44.000]   There's no innocent people in the world
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.600]   just waiting to hear the gospel.
[00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:47.480]   There's guilty people all over the world.
[00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:49.480]   That's why they need to hear the gospel.
[00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:52.000]   See how even when we ask the question,
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.640]   we always bias it against God and toward us
[00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:58.560]   as if God is unjustly putting innocent people
[00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:00.560]   in a state of condemnation.
[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:04.480]   We have no clue the depth of the sinfulness
[00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:05.600]   of our own hearts.
[00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:10.320]   The sinfulness in the world around us.
[00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:13.080]   There is no one who is innocent before God,
[00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:17.520]   including every single person in the red
[00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:21.520]   who is guilty before God, which leads to truth number four.
[00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:26.520]   They all stand condemned for rejecting God.
[00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:31.680]   This is the end of this argument,
[00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:33.720]   this part in Romans chapter three, verse 19.
[00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:35.000]   We know that whatever the law says,
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.360]   it says to those who are under the law,
[00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:39.640]   so that every mouth is silenced.
[00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:43.320]   The whole world is held accountable to God.
[00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:45.200]   And no one, there it is again,
[00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:47.160]   will be declared righteous in God's sight
[00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:48.040]   by the works of the law.
[00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:50.120]   In other words, by what he does.
[00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:52.960]   Rather through the law, we become conscious of sin.
[00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:57.560]   Not only are all people guilty,
[00:20:57.560 --> 00:20:59.440]   but there's no amount of good we can do
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:01.200]   to overcome our guilt.
[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:05.960]   All people are condemned for rejecting God.
[00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:08.960]   And that's true regardless of whether or not
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:10.840]   someone has heard the gospel.
[00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:14.840]   And this is really significant because,
[00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:16.360]   well, let me ask you a question.
[00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:18.120]   Like, think about this with me.
[00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:23.120]   Do you think it would be just for God
[00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:29.520]   to condemn someone to hell for not believing in the gospel
[00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:34.000]   if they never had a chance to hear the gospel?
[00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:40.360]   Do you think it would be just for God
[00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:44.680]   to condemn someone to hell for not believing in the gospel
[00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:49.240]   when they never even had a chance to hear the gospel?
[00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:54.000]   I think the answer to that question is no.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:59.560]   Not accountable for what they've not heard.
[00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:05.080]   At the same time, that doesn't mean they go to heaven
[00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:08.240]   because they're condemned for rejecting the God
[00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:10.520]   that has been clearly shown to them.
[00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:14.920]   And here's why this is so important,
[00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:16.320]   'cause people start to think,
[00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:18.760]   well, maybe, maybe if,
[00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:20.960]   because they haven't heard the gospel,
[00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:23.920]   that God will let them into heaven.
[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:27.080]   God is loving, gracious.
[00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:29.400]   We know he wants them in heaven.
[00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:30.680]   If they haven't heard the gospel,
[00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:33.920]   maybe he will let them in because they haven't heard.
[00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:36.560]   But let's think about that for a second.
[00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:38.800]   If that were true,
[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:40.720]   then what is the worst thing we could do
[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:42.280]   for all the people in the red?
[00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:45.920]   Tell them the gospel.
[00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:50.800]   If they have not heard the gospel,
[00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:53.000]   and that is some kind of pass into heaven,
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.040]   and we get there and we're like,
[00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:56.560]   I wanna tell you the good news,
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:59.560]   and because we've come with the good news,
[00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:02.120]   now there's a chance they could go to hell,
[00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:04.760]   they'd be like, just keep it to yourself.
[00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:07.040]   And just think about it practically.
[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:09.560]   You walk up on the streets of somebody in Dallas,
[00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:12.040]   you say to someone, have you heard
[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:14.080]   the God's love for you and Jesus?
[00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:16.360]   They say, no, I don't know anything about that.
[00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:18.280]   If you believe that person is going to heaven
[00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:20.040]   precisely because they've never heard,
[00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:21.440]   then what do you say to them?
[00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:25.200]   Say, well, somebody tries to tell you about Jesus,
[00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:26.720]   just put your fingers in your ears
[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:29.360]   and start yelling really loud and run the other way.
[00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:33.840]   And this is the whole point of the enterprise of the church,
[00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:36.800]   this is what we do, this is good news
[00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:40.520]   that we proclaim to people who have rejected God.
[00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:43.560]   The point here is that regardless
[00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:45.880]   of whether or not someone has heard the gospel,
[00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:48.760]   all people stand guilty before God and sin
[00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:51.720]   and deserve eternal separation from Him.
[00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:56.440]   They all stand condemned for rejecting God.
[00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:00.800]   And at this point, I picture Paul writing the book of Romans
[00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:03.080]   and it's been two chapters worth
[00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:04.560]   of just the sinfulness of man,
[00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:07.000]   all the way to chapter three, verse 20.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.280]   Picture him with tears in his eyes,
[00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:13.280]   but then I picture him picking up the pen
[00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:18.280]   and writing, but now, our righteousness from God,
[00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:20.480]   apart from the law has been made known.
[00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:22.800]   And this righteousness from God comes through faith
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:25.200]   in Jesus Christ for all who believe.
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:27.440]   There is no difference for all have sinned
[00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:32.120]   and fall what, short of the glory of God and our.
[00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:36.680]   Oh, don't just memorize the bad news.
[00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:38.320]   They are, I think I got it up here,
[00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:41.480]   justified freely by His grace
[00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:43.920]   and the redemption that came by Christ Jesus.
[00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:47.200]   Truth number five, God loves them
[00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:49.800]   and God has made a way of salvation
[00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:52.640]   for all 3.2 billion of them.
[00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:59.200]   God loves them just like God loves us.
[00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:03.760]   This is the gospel.
[00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:07.920]   God has made a way for us to be saved from our sin.
[00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:13.480]   I don't assume everybody who's here tonight
[00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:15.200]   has put your faith in Jesus.
[00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:16.120]   Hear this good news.
[00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:19.240]   Maybe this is the first time you are hearing the gospel.
[00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:21.240]   It's the greatest news in the world.
[00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:23.200]   Though you have sinned against God
[00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:24.720]   and are separated from Him
[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:26.840]   and deserve eternal separation from Him,
[00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:29.280]   God has not left you alone in this state.
[00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:32.560]   God has come to us in the person of Jesus.
[00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:34.640]   He has lived the life we could not live,
[00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:36.760]   a life of no sin.
[00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:39.680]   And then even though He had no sin for which to die,
[00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:42.680]   He chose to die on a cross to pay the price
[00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:44.960]   for the sins of anyone who would trust in Him.
[00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:46.520]   He lived the life we couldn't live.
[00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:49.200]   He died the death that we deserve to die.
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:50.800]   And the good news keeps getting better
[00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:52.840]   'cause He didn't stay dead for long.
[00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:55.400]   Three days later, He rose from the grave
[00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:58.000]   in victory over sin and death
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:59.800]   so that anyone, anywhere,
[00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:01.360]   including anybody in this gathering
[00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:03.720]   and anybody in the red who turns from their sin
[00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:05.000]   and trusts in Jesus,
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.320]   God will forgive you of all your sin
[00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:10.800]   and restore you to relationship with Him for eternal life.
[00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:12.080]   (congregation applauding)
[00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:14.080]   It's the gospel.
[00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:18.240]   It's the greatest news in the world.
[00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:22.400]   (congregation laughing)
[00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:24.040]   And it's not just for us.
[00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:27.480]   It's for them too.
[00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:31.680]   Which leads to truth number six.
[00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:37.720]   They cannot come to God apart from faith in Jesus.
[00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:44.320]   This is the way to eternal life.
[00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:49.840]   Faith in Jesus, verse 27 in Romans 3.
[00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:50.840]   "Where then is boasting?
[00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:51.680]   "It's excluded.
[00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:52.520]   "On what principle?
[00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:53.340]   "That of observing the law?
[00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:54.920]   "No, but on that of faith.
[00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:57.800]   "A man is justified, made right before God
[00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:01.080]   "by faith apart from observing the law."
[00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:01.960]   Not based on what we do.
[00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:03.040]   Is God the God of Jews only?
[00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:04.080]   Is He not the God of Gentiles too?
[00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:05.120]   Yes, of Gentiles too.
[00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:07.760]   So there's only one God who will justify
[00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:09.320]   the circumcised, the Jewish people,
[00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:11.280]   by faith and the uncircumcised,
[00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:13.480]   the Gentiles, through that same faith.
[00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:18.600]   This is how they can be saved from their sin,
[00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:21.080]   by faith in Jesus.
[00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:25.280]   Which is, well,
[00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:32.240]   3.2 billion people living with all kinds of ideas
[00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:33.240]   of how to get to God.
[00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:34.520]   I think about, I think about standing
[00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:39.120]   in one of those red areas, outside a temple.
[00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:40.600]   One guy worships at that temple,
[00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:43.140]   another guy worships at a different temple
[00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:44.440]   for a different religion.
[00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:47.720]   And I'm standing there, we're talking.
[00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:49.800]   And they're talking to me like,
[00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:52.320]   "Hey, our religions are fundamentally the same.
[00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:53.860]   "They're just kind of superficially different.
[00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:56.200]   "Like we all, we may use different terms,
[00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:58.100]   "we all can't believe the same thing."
[00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:00.000]   I'm just listening.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.720]   And after a while I said,
[00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:04.100]   "It's almost like you guys picture God,
[00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:05.180]   "or whatever you wanna call Him,
[00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:06.180]   "at the top of a mountain,
[00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:08.600]   "and we're all at the bottom of a mountain.
[00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:10.640]   "And you may take this path up,
[00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:11.680]   "and I may take this path up,
[00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:14.420]   "but in the end we'll find ourselves in the same place."
[00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:15.520]   And they smiled, they said,
[00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:17.020]   "Exactly, you understand."
[00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:21.600]   I said, "Well, what if I told you
[00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:22.980]   "that the God at the top of the mountain
[00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:24.680]   "didn't wait for us to find our way up there,
[00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:27.540]   "but He actually came down the mountain to where we are,
[00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:29.020]   "and took us up Himself?"
[00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:30.000]   They said, "That would be great."
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.280]   I said, "Let me introduce you to the difference.
[00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:35.560]   "This is Jesus, God has come to us.
[00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:37.900]   "It's taken His hand, it's trusting in Him.
[00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:39.920]   "This is how people can be saved,
[00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:42.440]   "through faith in Jesus."
[00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:47.120]   But that brings us back to the question, doesn't it?
[00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:49.460]   Like how can people put their faith in Jesus,
[00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:52.580]   when they've never heard about Jesus?
[00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:57.200]   And that's the exact question that Paul gets to
[00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:58.040]   in Romans 10.
[00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:00.040]   So if you've got your Bible, just keep turning over there.
[00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:02.460]   Romans chapter 10, verse 13,
[00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:07.460]   "Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.
[00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:09.820]   "How then can they call on the one
[00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:11.560]   "they've not believed in?
[00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:14.100]   "And how can they believe in the one
[00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:16.260]   "of whom they've not heard?
[00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:19.360]   "And how can they hear without someone preaching to them?
[00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:20.860]   "And how can anyone preach unless they're sent?
[00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:22.220]   "As it's written, how beautiful are the feet
[00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:23.660]   "of those who bring good news."
[00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:25.420]   The picture here is crystal clear.
[00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:28.060]   People can't put their faith in Jesus
[00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:30.140]   if they don't hear about Jesus.
[00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:36.260]   And if they can't put their faith in Jesus,
[00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:38.180]   because they've not heard about Jesus,
[00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:40.100]   then they can't be saved from their sin.
[00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:41.320]   That's why when you get down to verse 17,
[00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:42.500]   you can read it, I don't have it up here,
[00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:44.020]   but faith comes by hearing,
[00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:46.320]   and hearing through the word of Jesus.
[00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:48.600]   So get the picture.
[00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:51.780]   Three billion people
[00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:56.340]   that can't go to heaven
[00:29:56.340 --> 00:30:01.340]   if they don't hear about the one who makes heaven possible.
[00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:04.540]   And it's symbol logic.
[00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:07.800]   They won't hear unless somebody tells them.
[00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:12.700]   Which leads to the last thing about them,
[00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:15.320]   and it's where you and I come in.
[00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:21.980]   Jesus has left us in this world
[00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:23.860]   to get the gospel to them.
[00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:32.300]   Jesus has left you and me in this world
[00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:35.260]   to do whatever he calls us to do,
[00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:38.820]   no matter what it costs, to get the gospel to them.
[00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:42.780]   Right before Jesus went to heaven,
[00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:45.280]   what did he tell his followers to do?
[00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:48.660]   One thing, make disciples, where?
[00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:51.020]   All the nations.
[00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:53.820]   Not just in one place.
[00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:55.020]   It's not an option for my people.
[00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:56.180]   We don't focus just on one place.
[00:30:56.180 --> 00:30:57.860]   We're going all the places.
[00:30:57.860 --> 00:31:04.020]   All the peoples, nations, ethnic groups of the world.
[00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:07.420]   You'll receive my power when my Holy Spirit comes upon you,
[00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:11.220]   so you'll be my witnesses to the ends of the earth,
[00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:13.340]   to all the people.
[00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:16.780]   Let me show you this in what we just read in Romans 10.
[00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:20.660]   Look at the verbs in this passage in reverse,
[00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:23.500]   and as you do, you'll see God's plan
[00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:26.460]   for the gospel go into the red.
[00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:29.060]   Watch this, so sent.
[00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:33.880]   So it all starts with Jesus sending his followers,
[00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:39.060]   and when he sends them to go out,
[00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:40.780]   what do they go out to do?
[00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:41.780]   To preach.
[00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:43.100]   That doesn't mean stand on a stage
[00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:43.980]   in front of a bunch of people.
[00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:45.980]   That means just tell somebody, right?
[00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:48.560]   Speak about the good news of God's love in Jesus.
[00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:49.940]   Proclaim it.
[00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:53.780]   So Jesus sends his followers, his followers preach,
[00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:57.540]   and when they preach, people will hear.
[00:31:57.540 --> 00:32:01.420]   Makes sense, unless we're preaching to a wall.
[00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:04.940]   All right, share, somebody will hear,
[00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:08.220]   and when they hear, what will happen?
[00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:10.180]   They'll believe.
[00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:12.860]   Now, we know not everybody who hears believes.
[00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:14.060]   Obviously, we know that.
[00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:17.340]   At the same time, think about this.
[00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:19.260]   Revelation chapter seven, verse nine and 10 says,
[00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:20.980]   "One day is coming when a multitude
[00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:22.960]   "that no one could count from every nation,
[00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:24.600]   "every tribe, every people, and every language
[00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:25.620]   "is gonna gather around the throne
[00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:27.580]   "of our God singing his praises."
[00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:28.460]   You know what that means?
[00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:30.540]   You can go to any people group in the red,
[00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:32.300]   any nation, any language in the red,
[00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:33.560]   you can share this good news.
[00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:36.020]   You know somebody's coming out.
[00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:38.180]   Somebody's gonna be there, it's guaranteed.
[00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:43.660]   So people will hear, and somebody's gonna believe,
[00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:47.140]   and when they believe, they will call,
[00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:50.700]   and when they call on the name of the Lord,
[00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:52.860]   they will be what?
[00:32:52.860 --> 00:32:53.700]   Saved.
[00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:56.460]   So there's the plan.
[00:32:56.460 --> 00:33:01.300]   God's designed for the gospel to get to the red,
[00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:03.680]   so let's look at the plan and just ask the question,
[00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:06.320]   where is the only place this plan can break down?
[00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:10.160]   Well, let's start from where we left off.
[00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:12.120]   Everyone who calls the name of the Lord will be saved,
[00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:13.840]   so we know that.
[00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:16.600]   Will those who believe call on his name?
[00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:17.960]   Yes.
[00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:20.080]   Will those who hear believe?
[00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:21.320]   Again, like we said, not everybody,
[00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:23.200]   but some will, guaranteed.
[00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:28.880]   Will those who, followers of Jesus,
[00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:30.700]   who are sent proclaim the gospel?
[00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:31.660]   Will they hear?
[00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:33.240]   Yeah, that'll happen as long as we're not preaching
[00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:34.440]   to a wall.
[00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:38.420]   The only place where this potentially breaks down
[00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:43.080]   is if those who are sent by Jesus refuse to go
[00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:45.880]   and proclaim this good news.
[00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:48.040]   That's the only potential breakdown.
[00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:51.060]   And we'll ask the question,
[00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:52.920]   is Jesus still sending his followers?
[00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:55.680]   Has he taken a generation off?
[00:33:56.660 --> 00:34:00.580]   Has he said, you know, I'm gonna find another way.
[00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:04.540]   People say to me, well, surely God has other ways.
[00:34:04.540 --> 00:34:06.260]   Like he works in dreams and visions
[00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:07.660]   and all kinds of different places in the world.
[00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:08.940]   And I could tell you all kinds of stories
[00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:10.460]   about dreams and visions.
[00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:11.500]   We see those in the Bible.
[00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:14.020]   You won't find a one verse in the Bible
[00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:15.260]   where the gospel is going forward
[00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:18.020]   apart from a human instrument proclaiming it.
[00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:19.780]   I got all kinds of stories about dreams and visions
[00:34:19.780 --> 00:34:21.540]   where God is also providing people.
[00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:25.860]   God could write Romans in the sky tonight
[00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:27.020]   and take care of this.
[00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:30.020]   Everybody be reached just like that.
[00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:33.740]   But he's chosen not to do that.
[00:34:33.740 --> 00:34:37.520]   Instead he's chosen in his grace to invite you and me
[00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:39.440]   to join with him in doing this
[00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:41.160]   and making the greatest news in the world
[00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:43.360]   known all over the world.
[00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:44.620]   And the only potential breakdown
[00:34:44.620 --> 00:34:46.760]   is when followers of Jesus say,
[00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:49.000]   no, we're just gonna live our lives
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.200]   in places where the gospel has gone.
[00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:54.320]   And we're gonna turn a blind eye and a deaf ear to them.
[00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:57.960]   We're basically gonna create a whole culture of Christianity
[00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:01.000]   cultural, comfortable, casual Christianity
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.640]   that revolves around us and ignores them.
[00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:05.740]   And that's how we're gonna live our lives.
[00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:11.160]   Maybe we'll throw pennies to them.
[00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:16.160]   Maybe a few people will go and do something about that.
[00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:19.880]   And tonight I'm inviting you to change that.
[00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:23.880]   I'm inviting you to refuse to settle
[00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:27.360]   for a casual, comfortable, cultural Christianity
[00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:29.040]   that turns a blind eye and deaf ear
[00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:31.760]   to 3.2 billion people on their way to hell
[00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:33.680]   who need to hear the greatest news in the world
[00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:37.360]   about how life forever in heaven is possible with Jesus.
[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:43.160]   You say, well, what can I do to change that?
[00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:44.200]   I'm only one person.
[00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:46.640]   Well, of course you are.
[00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:48.160]   We all are.
[00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:50.040]   God made us that way.
[00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:51.440]   But so are they.
[00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:55.440]   I know I've mentioned 3 billion
[00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:57.320]   over and over and over again.
[00:35:57.320 --> 00:36:00.460]   But these are individual people, see them.
[00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:05.040]   We're talking about Hajira in Afghanistan.
[00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:06.920]   Her people groups Pashtoon,
[00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:09.260]   largest people group in Afghanistan.
[00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:12.000]   She and her close knit tribe live by a code
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:13.520]   of protecting each other's honor
[00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:16.860]   and showing generous hospitality.
[00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:19.440]   She works hard for her family day in and day out
[00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:22.560]   in a barren mountainous region where they live
[00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:25.180]   that is totally unreached by the gospel.
[00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:28.920]   We're talking about Tahil in Somalia.
[00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:31.000]   Lives in the capital Mogadishu.
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.900]   Port city just north of the equator on the Indian Ocean.
[00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:37.760]   Most of the men he knows have left Somalia.
[00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:42.040]   He's stayed in the middle of this impoverished country,
[00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:44.160]   convinced this is the best way he can care for his parents
[00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:45.660]   and his wife and his children.
[00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:52.400]   We're talking about Amir and Aliyah in Yemen.
[00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:54.600]   Older brother, younger sister.
[00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:58.040]   Picture childlike zeal for life,
[00:36:58.040 --> 00:36:59.400]   even though they live in one of the largest
[00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:03.680]   humanitarian crises in the world right now.
[00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:07.200]   Surrounded by war and conflict, they were born into it.
[00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:08.760]   They have parents who are struggling every day
[00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:09.880]   to find food for them.
[00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:16.840]   And here tonight, in a way maybe you didn't see coming,
[00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:18.440]   what Jesus is saying about each of them.
[00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:23.440]   'Cause they all, Hajira, Tahil, Amir, and Aliyah,
[00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:27.080]   they all have knowledge of God.
[00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:30.640]   They have all rejected God.
[00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:33.120]   They're all guilty of sin.
[00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:36.120]   They all stand condemned before God in their sin.
[00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:42.920]   Yet God loves all of them so much.
[00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:46.880]   God loves Hajira and loves her.
[00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:48.600]   God loves Tahil.
[00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:51.760]   God loves Amir.
[00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:55.840]   God loves Aliyah so much that he sent his son,
[00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:58.080]   Jesus God, in the flesh to give his life
[00:37:58.080 --> 00:38:00.520]   so they could have eternal life with him.
[00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:04.840]   But they can't experience eternal life
[00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:08.360]   if nobody tells them about Jesus.
[00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:14.000]   And Jesus is saying to a room full and other gatherings
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:17.080]   full of young adults who have this good news,
[00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:20.120]   I've left you here for a reason.
[00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:25.840]   And it's not to waste your life coasting out
[00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:28.560]   a comfortable Christian spin on the American dream.
[00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:31.880]   You were created for so much more than this.
[00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:36.320]   You've been put in a time and a place
[00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:37.720]   where there are more opportunities
[00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:39.440]   to get the greatest news in the world
[00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:41.600]   to people in the world than ever before.
[00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:48.480]   So don't spend your life on stuff that won't last.
[00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:53.400]   I know it's like college football season.
[00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:57.960]   We get so consumed with superficial battles.
[00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:00.000]   They're not real battles.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.760]   They don't matter.
[00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:07.520]   Open your eyes and see what's worthy of your affections.
[00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:12.520]   Three billion Hagiras and Tahils and Amirs and Alias
[00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:14.880]   are on a road right now that leads to hell.
[00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:17.640]   Nobody's ever told them how they can go to heaven.
[00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:21.640]   And some of us are still thinking,
[00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:23.480]   how can that be just of God?
[00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:29.560]   And isn't it just like us in our sinfulness
[00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:36.120]   to point the finger at the supposed injustice of God
[00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:41.480]   in our minds while we excuse ourselves
[00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:43.760]   from obeying the command of God,
[00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:45.880]   clear command of God in our lives?
[00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:49.320]   I see it.
[00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:50.320]   Do you want justice?
[00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:52.920]   Then give your life.
[00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:54.200]   Do whatever it costs you to do
[00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:57.440]   to alleviate eternal suffering, eternal poverty,
[00:39:57.440 --> 00:40:01.520]   eternal slavery to sin for billions of people.
[00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:03.160]   That's the invitation.
[00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:09.360]   No matter who you are, regardless of your age,
[00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:12.080]   your giftings, your wiring,
[00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:14.320]   no matter what you bring to the table
[00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:18.160]   to put a stake in the ground tonight
[00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:22.960]   and say, God, I will do whatever you call me to do,
[00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:24.320]   no matter what it costs,
[00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:28.520]   to get the gospel to people who have never heard it.
[00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:34.440]   So will you bow your heads with me?
[00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:36.840]   (gentle music)
[00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:40.040]   I invite you to bow your heads and close your eyes.
[00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:41.160]   I really wanna challenge you
[00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:43.800]   to keep your eyes closed during this time.
[00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:46.720]   Like this invitation is not about anybody else
[00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:48.200]   but you and God.
[00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:52.560]   It's not about seeing what anybody else does.
[00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:56.520]   It's sure not about letting the way they respond
[00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:58.960]   affect the way you respond.
[00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:00.000]   Like as best as I can,
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:03.120]   I just wanna help you look to God alone right now.
[00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:05.320]   In this room and all those other gatherings.
[00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:11.120]   Just see the one who's speaking to your heart,
[00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:13.440]   tune everyone else out.
[00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:15.960]   And in just a minute, I'm gonna ask you to stand
[00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:17.120]   if you would say,
[00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:21.880]   God, I will do whatever you call me to do,
[00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:22.760]   no matter what it costs,
[00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:25.920]   to get the gospel to people who have never heard it.
[00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:30.320]   And really, I only wanna encourage you to stand
[00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:33.080]   if you're willing to put a stake in the ground tonight
[00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:34.320]   and say that before God.
[00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:37.160]   And some of you, for a host of reasons,
[00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:39.600]   are not at a point where you're ready to say that.
[00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:43.480]   Please don't treat this lightly.
[00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:46.880]   At the same time, others of you
[00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:49.200]   may have said something like this in the past.
[00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:52.240]   I want you to feel free to stand and say in a fresh way,
[00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:54.240]   that stake's still in the ground in my life.
[00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:56.400]   Here I am, God, whatever you call me to do.
[00:41:56.400 --> 00:42:01.440]   Obviously, I'm not saying you gotta have it figured out.
[00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:02.720]   What's gonna flow from this?
[00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:04.080]   That's the point.
[00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:05.280]   It's no strings attached.
[00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:06.560]   Whatever flows from this.
[00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:10.160]   That you alone know what's going on in your heart,
[00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:11.160]   your life right now.
[00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:15.920]   Just pray and God will awaken a church
[00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:19.200]   to say we're gonna do whatever God calls us to do
[00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:21.320]   to get the gospel to people who've never heard it.
[00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:23.120]   And tonight is an opportunity
[00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:25.760]   for some of you to join in that.
[00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:26.960]   So God, I pray.
[00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:30.620]   I pray that you would help every person
[00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:35.620]   in this gathering to respond with honest authenticity
[00:42:35.620 --> 00:42:42.420]   and humble courage in this moment.
[00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:46.360]   Whether that means standing or sitting.
[00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:51.720]   So right now, before God, just you and God.
[00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:57.120]   If you would say, God, I will do whatever you call me to do,
[00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:01.220]   no matter what it costs, to get the gospel
[00:43:01.220 --> 00:43:02.820]   to people who've never heard it.
[00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:07.060]   Would you just quietly stand up where you are?
[00:43:07.060 --> 00:43:09.220]   Just you before God.
[00:43:09.220 --> 00:43:11.800]   (gentle music)
[00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:33.200]   Oh God,
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   before you, I pray that you would be pleased
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:46.480]   and glorified
[00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:52.840]   and surrender if brothers and sisters
[00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:57.740]   all across this gathering and trust in different places.
[00:43:57.740 --> 00:44:02.960]   God, I pray for them.
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   I pray that you would give them deeper
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:15.400]   and deeper and deeper knowledge of understanding
[00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:20.200]   of your great glory and their great need
[00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:26.920]   for your grace in their lives
[00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:30.240]   and the nation's great need for your grace in their lives.
[00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:35.400]   God, that you would grip them with an urgency
[00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:39.280]   that says, I got a mist, I got a few years here
[00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:42.640]   on this earth to live for the glory of my God.
[00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:44.240]   I wanna make this mist count.
[00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:47.440]   It's like a vapor here one second, gone the next.
[00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:51.760]   God, I pray that you would lead, guide,
[00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:55.400]   direct their steps in the days ahead
[00:44:55.400 --> 00:45:02.160]   to however, wherever they can most faithfully make disciples
[00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:03.920]   who make disciples of the nations.
[00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:09.920]   Whether that's staying in Dallas the rest of their lives,
[00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:14.720]   according to the leadership of your spirit, if that's so,
[00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:17.520]   praying and giving and going as they have opportunity
[00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:19.600]   and being a part of getting behind work and the red,
[00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:22.400]   living, God, I pray that you would deliver them,
[00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:25.480]   give them holy discontentment with casual,
[00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:27.000]   comfortable, cultural Christianity.
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:29.200]   May they not settle for it.
[00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:33.000]   May they leave it behind in any way
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:35.680]   and the battle against it, may they live
[00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:41.360]   in all that obedience to you using time,
[00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:45.800]   treasure, talents for your glory among the nations.
[00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:49.440]   God, I pray that trust, you're gonna send some of them out
[00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:51.360]   to move to places in the red.
[00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:54.200]   You're gonna open doors for nurses and doctors
[00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:58.400]   and engineers and teachers and lawyers and business leaders
[00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:01.400]   and all kinds of people to go in all kinds of different ways
[00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:05.000]   and God, I pray, we pray tonight
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:06.880]   that there would be people in the red
[00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:08.600]   who hear the gospel for the first time
[00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:11.520]   from lips in this room, from feet,
[00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:13.040]   bringing the good news to them.
[00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:14.960]   God, we ask that boldly before you,
[00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:17.960]   would you cause unreached people to be reached
[00:46:17.960 --> 00:46:20.080]   because of what you are doing by your spirit
[00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:21.320]   in this place tonight?
[00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:27.400]   God, I pray that you would give them increasing faith.
[00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:28.880]   If we can trust you to save us
[00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:30.520]   for the next 10 trillion years,
[00:46:30.520 --> 00:46:33.840]   we say we can trust you to lead us on this earth
[00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:36.280]   and not be afraid of what you might lead us to do.
[00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:39.760]   And God, I pray, I pray that over those who are sitting
[00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:42.240]   for any number of reasons, God, I pray for anyone
[00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:45.920]   who's yet to put their faith in Jesus.
[00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:48.680]   God, I pray that they would feel right now
[00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:53.160]   your love for them, that you would draw them
[00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:54.960]   to your love for them in Jesus.
[00:46:54.960 --> 00:47:00.200]   You'd grant them a heart of humility to trust in you.
[00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:02.920]   God, others who are for any number of reasons,
[00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:05.040]   holding onto this, concerned about that,
[00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:07.000]   just not ready to say this, God, I pray,
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:12.800]   I do pray that you would draw them into faith
[00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:16.920]   with every facet of their lives in you.
[00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:22.800]   An awareness of the beauty of this gospel,
[00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:27.080]   not just for them, but for the nations.
[00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:28.480]   And that you would just work in their heart,
[00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:31.760]   however is best to draw them to yourself
[00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:34.120]   and into your mission in the days to come.
[00:47:34.120 --> 00:47:38.280]   God, we praise you that we are among those
[00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:40.880]   who have been reached by the gospel.
[00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:44.560]   Why were we not born in the red, living in the red?
[00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:48.680]   We had nothing to do with where we were born.
[00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:51.480]   This is only your mercy that we're in this room,
[00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:52.320]   in this gathering, right?
[00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:54.000]   We praise you for your mercy,
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:56.560]   and we pray that your grace toward us
[00:47:56.560 --> 00:47:58.880]   would be the great effect for your glory through us
[00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:00.960]   among the nations.
[00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:04.120]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:07.920]   Can I invite everybody to stand?
[00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:15.880]   We're gonna sing a song of praise,
[00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:18.960]   honor and glory.
[00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:25.200]   Our God has invited us into this mission.
[00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:28.760]   Mission, at the same time I do,
[00:48:28.760 --> 00:48:31.440]   I think we have something to put on the screen
[00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:34.640]   that has a QR code, maybe.
[00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:39.200]   There it is.
[00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:42.200]   I would just say, for those of you in particular who stood,
[00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:46.800]   if there's, yeah, if you click on this QR code,
[00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:49.480]   it's just a simple page that says,
[00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:53.720]   all right, you stand, what's step number one?
[00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:56.680]   And what does that look like from here?
[00:48:56.680 --> 00:48:59.400]   And what does tomorrow look like?
[00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:00.960]   What does tonight look like?
[00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:05.240]   And so if you want to click on that QR code,
[00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:08.920]   just a way to kind of help put next steps to that.
[00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:12.760]   And I know there's all kinds of steps, Lord willing,
[00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:15.480]   that you can take in local church, this local church,
[00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:17.480]   or any local church that you're a part of.
[00:49:17.480 --> 00:49:21.440]   So let's praise the God who's worthy,
[00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:25.480]   not just of our glory, but worthy of the glory of all
[00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:27.040]   the nations of the earth.
