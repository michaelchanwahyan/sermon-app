[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.660]   (phone ringing)
[00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:03.500]   (phone dialing)
[00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.360]   - You have seven unheard messages.
[00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.040]   - Hey, sorry I haven't texted.
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.080]   I'm just not really sure what I'm feeling right now.
[00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.540]   - Hey yo, Danny!
[00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.240]   Where you at, bro?
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.080]   I'll see you soon, all right?
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.200]   - Hey, so I have moved on,
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.560]   but I feel like the Lord keeps putting me back
[00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.800]   on my heart for a reason.
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.480]   So please call me back.
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.820]   - Hey, bro, hey, I know you're going through it right now,
[00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.120]   but listen, I found another girl at the farmer's market now.
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.600]   She's not a farmer, but she is on the market, okay?
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.040]   So hit me back, love you, bro.
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.800]   - Not sure if this is the right number,
[00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.720]   but last night was a mistake.
[00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.640]   I was just hoping we could keep that between us.
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:41.880]   - Hey, just wanted to say,
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.680]   I don't think I can make it tonight.
[00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.960]   Yeah, I've just been thinking about us a lot lately,
[00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.400]   and we need to talk.
[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.680]   - All right, Porch, how we doing tonight?
[00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.320]   We doing okay?
[00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.720]   Hey, it's great to be with you.
[00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.360]   Thanks for making the time to join us here
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.760]   on a Tuesday night.
[00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:06.080]   I'm so grateful that we get to do this every single week.
[00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.280]   I talk to the Lord early in the morning on Tuesday,
[00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.040]   and at the end of every day Tuesday,
[00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.960]   and what I find myself praying are prayers of gratitude
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.720]   that he is moving in the lives of people just like you
[00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.360]   in a generation just like ours.
[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.680]   And so I'm so glad that you're here with us in Dallas.
[00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.520]   Thanks everybody that's tuning in online with us too.
[00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.480]   We're so grateful that God's not limited
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.360]   to just this one room, that he can meet with you
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.960]   anywhere, anytime, any place.
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.080]   And that includes right now, special shout out
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.440]   to Porch Live, Dating Fort Worth, and Wheaton.
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.680]   Well, Porch, I don't know if you've heard the news,
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.880]   but after two years of dating,
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.520]   Travis Michael Kelsey and Taylor Allison Swift
[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.080]   are officially engaged.
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.080]   (audience cheering)
[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.840]   Taylor did the impossible.
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.160]   Like somehow in a single moment,
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.040]   she simultaneously fulfilled the hopes
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.920]   of all her adoring Swifties,
[00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.880]   while crushing the dreams of so many guys,
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.840]   I thought they actually stood a chance.
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.440]   And it could not have come a day too soon,
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.080]   because it's today that we are actually wrapping
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.560]   our dating series called We Need to Talk.
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.880]   It is no surprise.
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.400]   It's no surprise that many of you have been gathering
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.600]   with us in this room over the course
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.320]   of the last several weeks, because you wanna end up
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.480]   where these two lovebirds find themselves right now.
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.840]   You wanna move through this world,
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.600]   not alone, but with someone.
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.800]   And so you've stepped into this space alongside us,
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.360]   and we've been exploring what does God have to say
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.880]   about dating in romance, in relationships?
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.720]   Like as we look at the landscape of love,
[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.880]   how do we navigate what feels like a tumultuous territory?
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.440]   And as we've been doing it, what we've said repeatedly
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.200]   over the course of this series is that dating
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.600]   is not a period of attachment, it's a period of assessment.
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.640]   And what you need to know is that that period
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.920]   of assessment is never more difficult.
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.720]   The great dating dilemma stands before you
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.520]   when you look at someone and say, you are so great.
[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:15.360]   So why am I not attracted to you more?
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.620]   And that's the question we're gonna get into tonight,
[00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.580]   because we all know this feeling.
[00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.180]   Like on paper, you've looked at someone and said,
[00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.560]   man, they're the perfect match.
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.820]   Like they care about their body
[00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.320]   and they're motivated in life.
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.000]   Like they're actually trying to contribute to society.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.120]   They're moving up in the career world.
[00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.160]   And whenever we have a disagreement,
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.080]   like they don't bail out or pull away.
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.040]   Like they lean in and they try to process things with me.
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.680]   And I know that whenever I've taken them around my friends,
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.360]   my friends don't like any guy or girl
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.400]   that I ever bring around, and yet they all love them.
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.960]   And I never have to carry the conversation.
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.520]   I've had to do that so many times.
[00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:51.640]   But with this person, I don't have to carry
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.040]   the conversation, they actually contribute
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.260]   to the conversation.
[00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.000]   And yet, despite the fact that they look good on your arm,
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.520]   or they have the perfect romantic resume,
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.400]   and you've read it through multiple times,
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.760]   you can't help but look at them and say,
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.920]   man, you're so great, but something is still missing.
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.880]   What do you do in that situation?
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.020]   Well, that's what I wanna talk about with you tonight.
[00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.100]   Like any good diagnostic, what we have to do
[00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.880]   first and foremost though, is we have to triage
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.820]   the underlying issue if we're actually going to develop
[00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.440]   a suitable treatment plan.
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.440]   Which means that we need to get to the heart
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.440]   of why you're just not that into them.
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.320]   Which is a really easy question to ask,
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.360]   but admittedly, it is a harder question to answer.
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.560]   And the reason for that is the mind and the heart,
[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.040]   they don't always agree.
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:41.120]   And we know this, like Bella, she knew.
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.400]   Jacob is a better suitor for me, but you know what?
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.340]   Like the heart wants what it wants,
[00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.360]   and I've gotta be with Edward instead.
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.960]   Like Rachel, she should have stuck with Bruce,
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.200]   but she ended up choosing Harvey Dent.
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.240]   Anyways, Katniss knew, Gail makes the most sense,
[00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.320]   and we all know that too.
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.120]   And yet she ended up with Peeta in the end.
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.400]   The heart wants what it wants,
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.720]   though the mind knows what it needs.
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.360]   And when those two things run in opposite directions,
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.080]   what happens is it leaves you more confused
[00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.640]   and less convinced about a relationship.
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:13.920]   You'll look at them and be like,
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:17.160]   you're legitimately amazing, a great person,
[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.360]   but I'm just not attracted to you.
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.880]   I wish there was more there.
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.000]   Why is that the case?
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.120]   Because I don't wanna bail out on this thing.
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.920]   What is going on?
[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.520]   What are you supposed to do?
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.460]   What is it that's missing?
[00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.040]   I'll tell you what's missing.
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.100]   It's chemistry.
[00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:38.040]   It's chemistry.
[00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:39.280]   That's what's missing.
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.120]   When they're so great,
[00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.200]   but you're just not attracted to them more.
[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.360]   Like they have the right combination of character,
[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:45.400]   but they have the,
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.420]   y'all have the wrong combination of chemistry.
[00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:49.120]   So what is the right combination then?
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.680]   Well, I was listening to an interview
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.280]   between Chris Williamson and a guy named Charlie Hooper,
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.920]   and they were answering the question,
[00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:01.200]   what do attractive men have most in common?
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.320]   You see, Charlie was answering this question
[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:04.920]   as a guest to this podcast.
[00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:09.920]   And he is the primary voice
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:14.080]   when it comes to charisma coaching on YouTube.
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.960]   He has the biggest channel committed to this specific topic.
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.980]   And as they were discussing it,
[00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:23.980]   what Charlie said is that guys who are attractive,
[00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:27.320]   most often have in common these three things,
[00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.600]   that they are interesting in the sense
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.600]   that they can carry a compelling conversation.
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.240]   Number two, that they have standards,
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.760]   both how they want to live their life
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:37.700]   and who they want to live their life.
[00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:38.840]   They care about those things.
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.200]   And then lastly, they can build sexual tension,
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:42.700]   meaning they can be romantic,
[00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:44.180]   which I thought was just so interesting.
[00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:45.600]   Not because I thought, man, Charlie,
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.120]   you've really cracked the code on chemistry.
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:47.960]   That's not what I thought.
[00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:49.520]   I thought it was interesting because Charlie
[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:53.660]   is catching up with God and his code for chemistry.
[00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:55.520]   You see, it's fascinating.
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:56.960]   The biblical concept of love
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.520]   is not like our English concept of love.
[00:06:58.520 --> 00:06:59.360]   Some of you know this,
[00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:01.960]   but in English, we only have one word for love,
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:03.360]   but actually in the Greek,
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:06.280]   there are four different words for love.
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:07.480]   And the first word is a word
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.240]   that we're so very familiar with.
[00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.480]   It's that word agape.
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:12.600]   It's the idea of godly love,
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.440]   the love that Jesus has shown for us himself,
[00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:17.000]   because it is self-sacrificing love.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.360]   And this love is the kind of love
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.280]   that marks a person's character.
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:23.040]   You want to find someone with character,
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:25.200]   and so they need to have an agape love.
[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:27.480]   But what you also know is that while the first love,
[00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:29.800]   agape, is all about character,
[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:33.560]   the other three loves are all about chemistry.
[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:35.920]   And what's interesting is those three loves
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:38.960]   correspond with the three things Charlie said
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.680]   in that podcast.
[00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:45.260]   You see, the first love is all about social chemistry.
[00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.440]   The second is all about romantic chemistry.
[00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:50.160]   And the third is all about emotional chemistry.
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:56.720]   You see, they characterize the kind of feeling
[00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:59.480]   you should have whenever you're engaged
[00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:01.000]   with another person in a relationship.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.200]   So here's the truth.
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:04.080]   If you're lacking that loving feeling
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:06.360]   with somebody in a relationship,
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:09.920]   you're more than likely lacking one of these loves
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:12.040]   in that relationship.
[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:13.840]   So what are they then?
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:15.040]   Well, that's what I want to talk with you about.
[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:17.040]   I want to walk through these three loves.
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:19.660]   And really what I'm hoping you gather from it
[00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:23.480]   is there are three reasons you might feel reluctant
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:25.960]   in a relationship with someone.
[00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:30.040]   So the first one out of the gate is called phileo.
[00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:30.880]   Phileo.
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:33.360]   And it's brotherly love, which is why,
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:34.600]   and this is your very first point,
[00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:38.760]   a lack of friendship leads to a lack of love.
[00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:41.120]   A lack of friendship leads to a lack of love.
[00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:43.540]   The easiest way of remembering what phileo is about
[00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:46.840]   is it's the root of the word Philadelphia,
[00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:49.680]   which is the city of brotherly love.
[00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:51.080]   Now, when we say brotherly love,
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:52.880]   what we're saying there is that it's not love
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:54.260]   between two literal brothers,
[00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.560]   it's actually love between two friends.
[00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:59.880]   It's brotherly or friendship love.
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:01.400]   And we know that this type of love,
[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:04.640]   it's meant to be characteristic between believers,
[00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:07.160]   brothers and sisters, as we relate to one another.
[00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:08.640]   Romans 12 10 tells us,
[00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:11.840]   "Let love be genuine, abhor what's evil,
[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:13.300]   hold fast to what's good,
[00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:15.380]   love one another with brotherly affection."
[00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:17.140]   There it is, phileo.
[00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:19.440]   "And outdo one another in showing honor."
[00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:22.860]   But it's also the type of love
[00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:26.140]   that we should share in a romantic relationship.
[00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:29.340]   Song of Solomon 5 16 says this,
[00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:33.900]   "His mouth is most sweet, and he's altogether desirable.
[00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:35.980]   This is my beloved, and this is my friend,
[00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:38.440]   O daughters of Jerusalem."
[00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:41.500]   Notice the way the woman identifies her husband
[00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:43.100]   in this passage.
[00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:47.420]   She doesn't just say, "He's my beloved,
[00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:48.980]   he is my darling, my soulmate,
[00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:50.620]   he is the father of my unborn children."
[00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:53.020]   That's not what she says alone.
[00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:55.240]   She says, "He is her beloved,"
[00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:58.460]   but she also says, "He is my friend,"
[00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:00.660]   which means the basis of their relationship
[00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:03.940]   is not just this bottomless pit of passion.
[00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:06.500]   Like they just don't have this deep angst of desire
[00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:07.860]   where they have to spend every waking moment
[00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:09.500]   with each other.
[00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:13.260]   What she just said is our relationship is fun.
[00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.420]   There's an element to our time together
[00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:18.660]   that is actually enjoyable.
[00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:19.980]   Because that's the major distinction
[00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:21.620]   when you think about friendship.
[00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:24.420]   Like what value does friendship offer?
[00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:27.500]   You don't have to be roommate,
[00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:29.180]   you don't have to be friends with your roommates.
[00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:30.660]   You don't have to be friends with your colleagues.
[00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:32.580]   You don't have to be friends even with your family.
[00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:33.900]   It doesn't have to be productive in that sense.
[00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:35.660]   So then what good are friends for?
[00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:40.140]   Friends, they're good for joy.
[00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:43.540]   That's what they provide in this world.
[00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:45.580]   That's what they principally exist for.
[00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:50.020]   As C.S. Lewis said, "Friendship is unnecessary,
[00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:51.740]   "like philosophy, like art.
[00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:53.700]   "It has no survival value.
[00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:55.480]   "Rather, it is one of those things
[00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:57.820]   "which gives value to survival."
[00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:02.720]   I've been visited with so many young adults
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:04.220]   who find themselves in a dating situation
[00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:06.420]   where the other person is top of class
[00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:08.060]   in so many different ways.
[00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:10.340]   They have impeccable character.
[00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:11.920]   They've got an incredible job.
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:13.220]   They're motivated in life.
[00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:15.700]   They are not just trying to serve themselves.
[00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:17.300]   They're really trying to serve other people.
[00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:20.060]   They volunteer at the local homeless shelter.
[00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:22.900]   They're trying to make sure that they're giving
[00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:25.100]   of their wealth for the benefit of other people.
[00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:27.020]   They also want two and a half kids too.
[00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:29.940]   And yet, though all of this is true,
[00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:32.220]   they bore you to tears.
[00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:35.580]   [audience laughs]
[00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:36.980]   And it's not their fault.
[00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:41.500]   You see, the reality is you just don't have
[00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:43.380]   anything in common with that person.
[00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:48.300]   No mutual interests, no shared hobbies,
[00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:50.840]   no like-minded pastimes.
[00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:52.460]   And that stuff matters.
[00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:55.720]   Like in 1926, Clive Staples Lewis
[00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:58.860]   met one John Ronald Ruhle Tolkin.
[00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:00.100]   Initially upon the meeting,
[00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:02.140]   Lewis noted some apprehension about him.
[00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:05.100]   He wrote that Tolkin was a smooth, pale,
[00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:08.780]   fluent little chap who only needed a smack or so.
[00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:12.100]   And yet what's fascinating is it was through
[00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:14.420]   their mutual love and common interest
[00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:18.340]   in northern myths and storytelling and poetry
[00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:20.980]   and fantasy worlds that their friendship,
[00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:23.340]   it was not only born, but it blossomed.
[00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:26.020]   And these two fledgling novelists,
[00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:28.020]   they would encourage one another as they wrote
[00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:31.780]   to the point that Lewis eventually encouraged
[00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:34.980]   Tolkin to have published this little children's storybook
[00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:37.540]   that he was so self-conscious about,
[00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:39.620]   which we know is "The Hobbit."
[00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:40.600]   What's my point?
[00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:44.060]   Friendship is built on common bonds,
[00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:45.820]   and those bonds matter.
[00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:47.620]   They're not only good to have in life,
[00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:49.820]   they are really good to have in love
[00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:51.680]   because it's good to have things in common
[00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:52.820]   with the person you're dating.
[00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:55.620]   Now, am I saying that you have to have
[00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:58.220]   everything in common with that person?
[00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:01.300]   No, that's not what I'm saying.
[00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:03.140]   Like, you don't have to break up with her
[00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:05.200]   just because she's not into micro-brewing beer
[00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:07.900]   in her garage the way that you are.
[00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:11.420]   Like, Brooke and I, we don't have everything in common.
[00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:13.220]   Like, she loves running.
[00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:14.640]   I hate running.
[00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:17.120]   So we don't run.
[00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:20.300]   I like action movies.
[00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:22.460]   She likes rom-coms.
[00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:24.940]   So we watch action movies.
[00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:27.740]   Like, you don't need to have everything in common,
[00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:28.900]   but here's the thing, and listen to me,
[00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:31.580]   you need to have some things in common
[00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:33.780]   so that way the basis of the bond you build
[00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:36.380]   is bigger than, well, at least she's hot,
[00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:38.180]   or, you know, at least he's rich.
[00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:40.060]   Proverbs 18, 24 says,
[00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:42.900]   "A man of many companions comes to ruin,
[00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:47.180]   "but there's a friend who sticks closer than a brother."
[00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:48.700]   You hear that?
[00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:52.820]   Like, that's the kind of bond that friendship can build.
[00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:55.540]   Like, in a world where you can have many companions
[00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:57.600]   and yet still come to ruin,
[00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:00.580]   but there's a friend who can bond close to you
[00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:02.980]   so that way you're able to endure difficulty,
[00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:05.700]   that's a powerful force.
[00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:08.460]   That's the kind of bond available to you,
[00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:10.420]   one where someone sticks close,
[00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:12.500]   they hold fast, they push through,
[00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:16.100]   and you want that sort of bond in your marriage,
[00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:20.380]   which is why this kind of social chemistry matters.
[00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:22.880]   That's why friendship is important.
[00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:24.500]   I remember realizing this for myself.
[00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:27.060]   I was dating a girl in college
[00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:30.020]   who truly was one of the most incredible people
[00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:31.740]   that I had ever met.
[00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:33.220]   She was smart.
[00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:34.420]   Like, she was planning on graduating
[00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:36.720]   and going straight into getting her master's,
[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:37.600]   and she was goofy.
[00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:40.380]   Like, you never saw her without a smile on her face.
[00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:41.780]   She was always cracking a joke
[00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:44.820]   and trying to get the room a little bit brighter,
[00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:46.340]   and she was so selfless.
[00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:49.340]   Like, she volunteered her time every single week
[00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:51.580]   with the boys in the girls' club in town,
[00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:52.780]   and she loved Jesus.
[00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:54.340]   Like, not just the kind of love for Jesus
[00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:56.000]   where she's a Christian,
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.820]   but she really tried to walk with him
[00:14:57.820 --> 00:15:00.240]   and look like him and live like him.
[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:03.420]   And yet, I remember,
[00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:06.260]   it was a couple of months into our relationship
[00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.200]   that it dawned on me,
[00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:11.600]   we are two good people,
[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:15.480]   but we're not two good friends.
[00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:21.380]   You see, we didn't have much in common.
[00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:24.460]   Conversations would fall flat,
[00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:27.040]   though we would really work at them.
[00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:30.760]   Our time together, it just grew more difficult.
[00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:34.520]   And when I realized this, it just, it sucked,
[00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:37.640]   because she was amazing,
[00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:41.240]   and I saw, like, man, this would really work.
[00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:43.680]   And yet, I knew
[00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:48.000]   she deserves to be enjoyed
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.620]   in a way that I cannot enjoy her,
[00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:53.240]   and so we ended things.
[00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:57.300]   Friends, listen, every person you date
[00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:00.420]   is someone God deeply delights in,
[00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:03.060]   and so every person you date
[00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:05.700]   should be someone you deeply delight in.
[00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:07.100]   And if you don't,
[00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:09.500]   like, if getting together with that person
[00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:11.780]   just, like, stirs up in you some sort of dread,
[00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:14.740]   like, ah, man, it's so hard to ride in the car together
[00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:16.620]   or keep conversations going
[00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:19.340]   or to joke around or to be nonchalant,
[00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:21.000]   like, whatever it is,
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.340]   you need to know
[00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:25.580]   that maybe you're not feeling it
[00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:27.660]   because you're just not friends.
[00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:30.700]   And I wanna love you enough to say,
[00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:32.740]   that is so okay,
[00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:35.340]   but it is not enough.
[00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:40.220]   And the reason I know is because Jesus' love for you,
[00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:41.660]   for me,
[00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:46.660]   was formed not only on a foundation of duty
[00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:49.460]   that I need to save them from their sin,
[00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:54.080]   it was formed on a foundation of desire.
[00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:58.680]   I want to save my friends.
[00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:01.020]   Because John 15, 13 tells us,
[00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:03.620]   "Greater love has no one than this
[00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:06.420]   "that someone laid down his life for his friends."
[00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:10.120]   Meaning, if you want great love in this life,
[00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:11.820]   it'll take more than a great relationship
[00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:12.700]   with a really great person.
[00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:14.220]   It's gonna take a great relationship
[00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:17.120]   with a really great friend,
[00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:19.400]   the kind of friend that would lay down their own life
[00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:21.000]   for you too.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.160]   But it's also gonna take more than that.
[00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:25.120]   That's only one type of love.
[00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:27.680]   There's another kind of love that we need to look at next,
[00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:30.560]   which is the love of eros.
[00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:34.520]   Eros, which is passionate love, romantic love.
[00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:37.400]   And the reason why you need this love
[00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:41.200]   is because a lack of passion leads to a lack of love.
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.720]   A lack of passion leads to a lack of love.
[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:48.440]   You see, eros is the root of the English word erotic.
[00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:50.960]   And really what it represents is the kind of love
[00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:52.760]   two people share with one another
[00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:55.480]   in a romantic or sexual kind of capacity.
[00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:58.720]   It's really, it's intended to be reserved specifically
[00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:00.920]   for those husbands and wives bound together
[00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:02.280]   in covenantal union.
[00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:05.280]   And yet, because in the Greco-Roman world,
[00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:07.720]   as well as ours, we had our way with it.
[00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:08.760]   We see in the New Testament,
[00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:10.680]   they don't use this word specifically.
[00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:12.800]   Like it had become so debased
[00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:15.200]   at the time of the New Testament authorship
[00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:17.400]   that the authors themselves decided
[00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:22.400]   to not use this word for fear of confusing their readers
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:25.760]   that eros was okay outside of marriage.
[00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:28.620]   And yet, that doesn't mean that the word itself
[00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:31.920]   or the concept it represents is intrinsically evil
[00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:33.800]   or it's impure in any kind of way.
[00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:36.600]   In fact, this concept, sexual love,
[00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:38.880]   romantic love, passionate love,
[00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:43.320]   it is represented consistently across the scripture.
[00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:46.320]   (crickets chirping)
[00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:50.160]   And the reason why is because this kind of love
[00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:52.120]   is a beautiful thing.
[00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:54.640]   Like it's procreative,
[00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:58.720]   meaning it has the literal power to create life.
[00:18:58.720 --> 00:18:59.600]   Have you ever thought about that?
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:02.920]   Like the difference between no baby and a baby is eros.
[00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:03.920]   Like that's how it happens.
[00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:04.960]   I don't know if you've ever learned that,
[00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:06.160]   but that's the way this thing works.
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:08.640]   Like eros, passionate sexual love,
[00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:11.240]   literally has the ability to create life.
[00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:14.520]   That's why we call it the miracle of life
[00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:15.600]   because it's that powerful.
[00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:17.060]   But here's the thing, catch me on this.
[00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:21.160]   It's not just procreative, it's also recreative,
[00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:26.160]   meaning it's not just powerful, it's also pleasurable.
[00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:29.820]   Proverbs 5, 18, 19 says,
[00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:32.360]   "Let your fountain be blessed
[00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:36.100]   "and rejoice in the wife of your youth,
[00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:38.480]   "a lovely dear, a graceful doe.
[00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:41.680]   "Let her breasts fill you at all times with delight.
[00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:43.880]   "Be intoxicated always in her love."
[00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:45.680]   Every guy in the room just woke up.
[00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:46.760]   (audience laughing)
[00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:48.400]   Is that in the Bible?
[00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:51.240]   Yes, that's the Bible.
[00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:54.240]   Like it just told us something really important
[00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:55.400]   about this kind of love.
[00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:56.980]   And I'm not gonna get into all the mechanics
[00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:59.720]   of what that's really describing in that specific passage,
[00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:01.400]   but what you do need to know
[00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:03.400]   is that's not talking about procreation.
[00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:08.520]   That is talking about pleasure, enjoying one another.
[00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:09.720]   And this is so important.
[00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:11.920]   Sex is a gift.
[00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:14.840]   It is from God.
[00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:18.160]   It is meant to feel good.
[00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:21.320]   You should touch and there will be sparks.
[00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:23.360]   Things might get steamy at some point.
[00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:28.360]   And that's all true because romantic chemistry matters,
[00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:31.560]   which I know as I say that, like you're like,
[00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:33.120]   yeah, man, romantic chemistry matters.
[00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:34.720]   You know that, that feels so obvious
[00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:37.600]   because every time you touch, you get this feeling.
[00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:39.600]   Like that's true for so many of you.
[00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:42.480]   And yet that's not true for every one of you.
[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:44.640]   You see, so many of you, you live in a world
[00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:47.960]   where your romantic chemistry is at a surplus.
[00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:50.120]   And that comes with its own problems,
[00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:52.680]   which we have talked about in this series.
[00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:56.460]   But there are others of you where your romantic chemistry,
[00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:59.760]   it exists at a deficit.
[00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:03.220]   And it's why attraction struggles between the two of you.
[00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:05.400]   Why is that?
[00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:09.160]   Well, there's a couple of reasons why.
[00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:11.680]   The first is the absence of physical attraction.
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:16.260]   The absence of physical attraction.
[00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:20.120]   Like there's a reason why Conrad and Jeremiah
[00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:23.240]   got so in the belly when she came back from the summer.
[00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:24.840]   And it's because she turned pretty, right?
[00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:27.800]   Physical attraction ultimately matters.
[00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:29.480]   And the Bible isn't shy about this fact.
[00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:31.760]   And listen to me because this is really important.
[00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:33.320]   I'm not just telling you what I think.
[00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:35.080]   This is from the scripture itself.
[00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:38.560]   The Bible frequently introduces characters as attractive.
[00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:41.360]   We know, and this is not a comprehensive list,
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:43.300]   but these are just some examples.
[00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:46.560]   Sarah was so striking that both Pharaoh
[00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:49.120]   and King Abimelech took her from Abraham.
[00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:51.680]   Rachel was beautiful in figure and appearance.
[00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:54.040]   Joseph was well-built and handsome.
[00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:57.440]   David was ruddy with beautiful eyes and a handsome appearance.
[00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:01.000]   Absalom was flawless from head to foot
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.720]   with thick wavy hair.
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:05.600]   It was said that there was none like him in all Israel.
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:09.060]   Esther was so lovely that King Xerxes chose her
[00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:10.960]   to be his queen.
[00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:11.960]   And yet here's the thing,
[00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:15.360]   the Bible doesn't just introduce them as attractive people
[00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:16.520]   so that way you feel this need
[00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:17.880]   to become as beautiful as you can.
[00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:19.400]   That's not why they're introduced this way.
[00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:22.600]   Whenever the Bible takes time to really explain something,
[00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:24.200]   it's purposeful.
[00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:25.420]   And so it begs the question,
[00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:27.880]   what's the purpose that the scriptures are trying
[00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:32.140]   to tell us by way of introducing their physical features?
[00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:34.680]   What it's trying to help us understand
[00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:37.400]   is that attraction always leads to something.
[00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:38.460]   That's what happened for them.
[00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:40.880]   For some of them, it led them into political influence.
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:44.000]   For others, it put them in positions where their charisma
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.560]   ultimately served or disserved the people of God.
[00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:50.320]   But for many of them, it just led them into marriage.
[00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:54.480]   You see, catch me, attraction
[00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:57.240]   leads to desire.
[00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:00.540]   Attraction leads to desire.
[00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:02.980]   Song of Solomon four, seven through eight, it says,
[00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:06.380]   "You are altogether beautiful, my love.
[00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:08.180]   "There's no flaw in you.
[00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:10.960]   "So come, come with me from Lebanon, my bride.
[00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:12.620]   "Come with me from Lebanon."
[00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:14.100]   Do you hear it?
[00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:16.460]   Like he just articulated attraction.
[00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:19.300]   You are altogether beautiful.
[00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:22.020]   And it led to desire.
[00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:23.960]   So come on, come away with me.
[00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:24.980]   We gotta get out of here.
[00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:25.900]   Have you seen you?
[00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:27.200]   I've gotta get you away from this place.
[00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:28.320]   We need to escape to the hills.
[00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:30.540]   That's the kind of perspective Solomon has in this moment
[00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:32.900]   because he knows everyone deserves
[00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:35.300]   to be desired in a relationship.
[00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:38.700]   And attraction is one of the primary catalysts for that.
[00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:43.780]   So then what makes someone attractive?
[00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:46.940]   Well, if you ask evolutionary biologists
[00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:48.700]   or behavioral psychologists,
[00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:51.820]   what you'll find is they have a lot to say on the topic.
[00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:54.880]   I know because I did so much reading.
[00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:57.040]   Part of me cannot wait to be done with this series
[00:23:57.040 --> 00:24:00.000]   'cause I am so sick of researching dating
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.240]   and relationships in our modern world.
[00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:04.960]   And yet as I have listened to everything they have to say,
[00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:06.600]   some of which is really brilliant,
[00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:11.560]   what you need to know is it just depends.
[00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:14.360]   Like who you find attractive really depends.
[00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:16.740]   It depends on your context and your environment
[00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:17.980]   and the stressors in your life
[00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:19.560]   and the needs that you have.
[00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:21.900]   And it even depends on the economy.
[00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:23.300]   I thought this was fascinating.
[00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:24.780]   According to research,
[00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:27.380]   American playboy centerfolds correspond
[00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:29.860]   with our current economic condition.
[00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:34.300]   If the economy is bad, the model's weight goes up.
[00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:38.500]   And if the economy is good, the model's weight goes down.
[00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:40.540]   Why, why is that the case?
[00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:42.660]   Because throughout history,
[00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:47.660]   people have consistently found the exotic as attractive.
[00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:50.060]   It's the unfamiliar, it's the unnatural
[00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:52.620]   that people want to gravitate towards.
[00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:53.980]   And it's not just through history,
[00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:56.140]   it's even here in our modern moment.
[00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:59.180]   In America, the standard of beauty is you need to be tan
[00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:00.020]   and you need to be ripped up
[00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:02.060]   because it's a sign of health and status.
[00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:03.960]   But if you go back into the Renaissance era,
[00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:07.020]   what you find is that women were painted
[00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:10.260]   with formerly figures.
[00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:13.220]   And the reason why is because that was indicative
[00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:15.300]   of fertility and wealth.
[00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:17.300]   If you go to Japan and you look at the Geisha,
[00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:19.520]   they would paint their faces white
[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:21.980]   because it met the cultural standards
[00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:23.660]   and ideals of the day.
[00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:25.860]   It left them looking fair-skinned
[00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:29.540]   with very distinct features.
[00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:34.060]   You see, the point in all of this
[00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:37.320]   is there's no universal standard for beauty.
[00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:40.660]   Like you're going to find someone attractive
[00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:42.860]   that someone else doesn't and vice versa.
[00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:46.300]   But though there is no universal standard for beauty,
[00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:49.180]   there is a personal standard for beauty.
[00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:54.320]   Every one of us will find someone attractive.
[00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:55.780]   You have a standard.
[00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:59.560]   So then let me ask you, what is your standard?
[00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:02.060]   What's your standard?
[00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:05.860]   For some of you, your standard's too high.
[00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:10.460]   Like if you're only attracted to pictures of people
[00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:12.020]   that fill your explore page
[00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:14.980]   and you're never attracted to the faces of real people,
[00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:17.900]   then your standard is too high.
[00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:20.420]   If you walk into a room this big with this many people
[00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:21.260]   and you walk out and you think,
[00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:22.900]   "Yeah, you know, there's a couple of people there
[00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:24.020]   "that I might be interested in."
[00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:25.840]   I promise you, your standard is too high.
[00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:28.660]   If your dating poll is limited
[00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:31.260]   to the random people you choose to DM
[00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:34.100]   as opposed to the real people available in live,
[00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:36.280]   your standard is too high.
[00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:38.540]   If you're looking for the hottest this-is-her girl,
[00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:41.340]   then listen, you better be the hottest this-is-him guy
[00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:44.420]   because your standard will be too high.
[00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:46.180]   I remember I had a friend who looked at me
[00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:48.300]   when I was in college and this is advice
[00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:49.500]   that I have taken to the bank
[00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:51.100]   because I believe in it so much.
[00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:53.040]   You don't hold someone to some standard
[00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:54.940]   you are unwilling to hold yourself to.
[00:26:54.940 --> 00:27:00.500]   And I remember when he told me that, my jaw hit the floor.
[00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:04.900]   And it was so helpful because it helped me to realize
[00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:07.140]   just how unfair I was being.
[00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:09.900]   For others, it's not that your standard's too high,
[00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:11.800]   it's that your standard's too narrow.
[00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:16.460]   You have a very specific type, tall, dark, and handsome.
[00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:17.300]   And that's okay.
[00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:20.100]   You know, I'm not diminishing
[00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:22.620]   where preferences play into dating,
[00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:24.380]   but I do just wanna tell you this.
[00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:27.700]   If you let your type tyrannize your dating experience,
[00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:30.380]   then you're gonna miss out on really great people.
[00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:33.060]   It's a running joke in my marriage between Brooke and I.
[00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:34.500]   I'm not her type.
[00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:37.900]   She's dark-skinned, dark-haired,
[00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:39.180]   so she just always kind of assumed
[00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:40.660]   I'd find a dark-skinned, dark-haired guy,
[00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:42.140]   which is clearly not me.
[00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:43.840]   I'm not dark-skinned, dark-haired.
[00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:46.380]   Why do I tell you that?
[00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:49.340]   Because you don't wanna count someone out
[00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:51.640]   just because they don't fit what you expected.
[00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:56.180]   Like, if you're looking for a specific set of features
[00:27:56.180 --> 00:28:00.740]   in a partner, your standard is too narrow.
[00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:05.260]   Guys, listen, her waist-to-hip ratio
[00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:07.580]   doesn't need to be a perfect 0.7.
[00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:10.940]   Ladies, he does not need to have a perfectly groomed beard,
[00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:13.500]   a broad set of shoulders, and curly hair
[00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:15.520]   that you can run your fingers through.
[00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:17.680]   That is too narrow a standard.
[00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:23.080]   And lastly, for some of you, your standard's too low.
[00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:26.980]   If you're dating someone who is legitimately amazing,
[00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:28.120]   like they have great character
[00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:29.380]   and they're a really good friend,
[00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:30.900]   but you're just not attracted to them,
[00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:33.100]   it could be that your standard is too low.
[00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:34.700]   And I wanna be very clear with you.
[00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:37.200]   Physical attraction is not everything,
[00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:39.980]   but it is something.
[00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:42.780]   So what's the right standard then?
[00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:49.180]   The right standard is that they are attractive enough
[00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:51.700]   that you are grateful to be going out with them,
[00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:56.920]   but you're not gutted if they choose to leave.
[00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:59.420]   That's the right standard.
[00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:02.740]   And let me be clear, physical attraction can grow.
[00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:05.240]   Some of you, you're looking at the relationship you're in
[00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:07.420]   and you're like, man, they're amazing.
[00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:09.260]   Everything about them is so awesome.
[00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:10.300]   I'm like, yes, like Colin,
[00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:12.420]   they have everything we just talked about.
[00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:13.500]   We're amazing friends.
[00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:14.780]   Like we laugh together a lot.
[00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:16.180]   We've made some incredible experiences.
[00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:18.380]   We've gone out and we have shared in moments,
[00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:19.380]   the likes of which I'm gonna remember
[00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:20.460]   for a really long time.
[00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:22.460]   I don't know that I'll ever be attracted to them,
[00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:23.960]   but it's hard to give this up.
[00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:26.860]   You play the long game, you go slow.
[00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:30.100]   Physical attraction can grow.
[00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:33.460]   It's absolutely possible.
[00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:35.100]   But let me just say this.
[00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:42.900]   No person, no one is attractive to everyone,
[00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:46.300]   but everyone is attractive to someone.
[00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:48.320]   Assuming they try, you know,
[00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:49.940]   like they brush their teeth and they fix their hair
[00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:51.460]   and they don't just put on wrinkled clothes.
[00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:54.140]   They will be attractive to someone.
[00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:55.900]   So don't rob them.
[00:29:55.900 --> 00:30:01.760]   Please don't rob them of being found physically desirable
[00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:03.760]   in the same way that you want to be found
[00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:05.380]   physically desirable yourself.
[00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:10.380]   That's the first reason there might be a deficit
[00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:12.340]   in your romantic chemistry.
[00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:15.580]   The second reason is not the absence of physical attraction,
[00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:18.040]   but the presence of romantic apprehension.
[00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:20.900]   I think I've shared this in here before,
[00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:22.500]   but according to the National Sexual Violence
[00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:24.780]   Resource Institute, one in four girls
[00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:27.980]   and one in six boys have been sexually abused
[00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:29.960]   before the age of 18.
[00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:32.460]   I tried to look up and see, is there an average
[00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:36.620]   for how many dates or relationships someone will go through
[00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:38.100]   before they eventually get married?
[00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:39.620]   And there is no average for that.
[00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:41.860]   It varies across the board, but the reality is
[00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:43.720]   if it's one in four girls and one in six guys,
[00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:48.720]   more than likely in your dating journey,
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:51.260]   you're going to cross paths with someone
[00:30:51.260 --> 00:30:55.460]   that has been impacted by sexual abuse in their story.
[00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:57.100]   So what do you do in that moment?
[00:30:57.100 --> 00:31:01.140]   If you're dating someone who has been abused,
[00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:02.560]   let me speak very clearly.
[00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:09.080]   You do not push them or pressure them physically.
[00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:12.660]   You take your cues from them.
[00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:15.700]   You move on their time.
[00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:18.360]   And if they won't give you one,
[00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:20.380]   you anticipate you're gonna go slow.
[00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:24.860]   I remember I had a friend who asked me
[00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:27.680]   right before Brooke and I got married,
[00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:28.960]   and it's a question I've adopted,
[00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:32.100]   and I ask every groom that I officiate the wedding of.
[00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:36.700]   He said, "Kylin, what does it look like to love Brooke well
[00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:39.600]   "if things don't go as you expect on your wedding night?"
[00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:45.640]   And I thought that was the greatest recalibrating question
[00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:50.100]   because it reminded me what matters most.
[00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:54.720]   My love to that woman is service at all times
[00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:58.900]   and in all ways, even in our most intimate moment.
[00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:01.940]   Let that be the case for you.
[00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:04.900]   And then let me speak to the person in the room
[00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:07.660]   that's been abused at some point in the past.
[00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:09.780]   I just wanna look at you and I wanna say,
[00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:10.840]   it's not your fault.
[00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:15.520]   You didn't do that to yourself.
[00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:18.920]   You don't deserve to live with the damage.
[00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:22.540]   You take as much time as you need,
[00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:28.060]   but keep moving forward.
[00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:30.620]   You go little by little.
[00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:34.380]   You take the steps, whether they be big or they be small,
[00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:36.740]   but you keep moving.
[00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:41.180]   And the reason why is because God has really good plans
[00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:42.020]   for your life.
[00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:46.100]   And I want you to trust Him enough to believe it.
[00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:49.340]   Like, don't let the past that someone took from you
[00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:52.080]   rob you of the future God wants to give you.
[00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:53.860]   You trust Him.
[00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:54.680]   You walk with Him.
[00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:55.520]   You listen to Him.
[00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:57.300]   You move with Him.
[00:32:57.300 --> 00:33:00.280]   'Cause I promise He's leading you to a better place.
[00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:03.380]   Great relationships, they share really great romance.
[00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:05.740]   It's always within the confines of marriage.
[00:33:05.740 --> 00:33:08.020]   I'm gonna stop making that caveat.
[00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:10.900]   And yet it's why romantic chemistry matters.
[00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:11.860]   Here's the thing.
[00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:14.180]   How do you test for it?
[00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:15.980]   Well, I've got really good news for you.
[00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:17.580]   You never have to touch the other person
[00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:19.220]   in order to figure it out.
[00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:22.140]   Because you can simply consider,
[00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:26.660]   have I screenshot a text he ever sent to me?
[00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:29.860]   Like when he speaks, do those words like linger in my mind
[00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:32.520]   and make me feel all warm and fuzzy inside?
[00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:35.040]   When I come into a room, am I looking for her
[00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:35.880]   first and foremost?
[00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:37.680]   Do I wanna find her in this space?
[00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:40.080]   When our arms magically brush against one another,
[00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:40.920]   was that intentional?
[00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:42.040]   Did he mean to touch my arm?
[00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:42.960]   Did I mean to touch his arm?
[00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:43.920]   Should we touch arms again?
[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:46.680]   You know, like those are indicatives
[00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:48.680]   that there's some romantic chemistry.
[00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:53.640]   And there's some possibility for passion.
[00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:56.400]   Here's the last one.
[00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:00.420]   The third love is the love of storge.
[00:34:00.420 --> 00:34:01.260]   Storge.
[00:34:01.260 --> 00:34:03.980]   It's a familial or it's a natural love.
[00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:04.980]   And the reason you need to know it
[00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:08.380]   is because a lack of care leads to a lack of love.
[00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:10.780]   When I say natural, don't think basic.
[00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:11.600]   That's not what I mean.
[00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:12.860]   When I say natural, what I want you to think of
[00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:13.780]   is instinctive.
[00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:15.780]   Like it's an instinctive love.
[00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:18.120]   It's the kind of love that a mother shares
[00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:20.540]   with her newborn child.
[00:34:20.540 --> 00:34:22.700]   The early church, they represented this really well
[00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:24.340]   because they supported and they cared
[00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:26.760]   and they provided for one another.
[00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:29.700]   We see it in Acts 2, 44 through 46.
[00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:31.780]   And all who believed, they were together
[00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:33.060]   and they had all things in common
[00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:34.460]   and they were selling their possessions
[00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:35.940]   and their belongings and they were distributing
[00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:38.940]   the proceeds to all as any had need.
[00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:40.780]   And day by day, attending the temple together
[00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:42.220]   and they were breaking bread in their homes,
[00:34:42.220 --> 00:34:45.820]   they received their food with glad and generous hearts.
[00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:46.980]   And here's the cool thing.
[00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:48.980]   It's not just a picture of what should be true of us,
[00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:50.340]   it's a picture of what's true of God.
[00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:52.100]   Like if you go and you read through the Old Testament,
[00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:55.260]   you see that God is frequently represented
[00:34:55.260 --> 00:34:58.000]   with a paternal instinct.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:59.340]   There's a lot of scripture.
[00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:01.240]   I had to cut a bunch, but I'll give you this one
[00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:03.420]   'cause I think it's probably the most representative
[00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:04.740]   of this quality.
[00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:08.900]   Isaiah 49, 15 says, "Can a woman forget her nursing child?
[00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:12.720]   "That she should have no compassion on the son of her womb?
[00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:15.960]   "Even these may forget,
[00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:19.180]   "yet I, the Lord, will not forget you."
[00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:21.500]   See, the word compassion in this passage,
[00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:23.760]   it's really at the heart of what we're talking about
[00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:26.060]   conceptually when we consider storge
[00:35:26.060 --> 00:35:27.460]   this familial or natural love
[00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:31.200]   because compassion is closely related in the Hebrew
[00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:33.180]   to the word for womb.
[00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:35.220]   It's rakum and rakim.
[00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:36.460]   Those are the two words.
[00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:38.060]   And the reason that even matters to us
[00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:39.680]   is because what it tells us
[00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:42.540]   is the kind of love that God has for you
[00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:45.100]   is a love that is nurturing in nature.
[00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:48.980]   And because he has that, we should have it with one another.
[00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:52.480]   And yet when it's missing, that's really concerning.
[00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:55.660]   So if you're in a relationship where,
[00:35:55.660 --> 00:35:57.860]   and maybe they are awesome for all the reasons
[00:35:57.860 --> 00:35:59.480]   that we have already previously spoken about,
[00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:00.460]   like you look at them and it's like,
[00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:04.160]   you are everything and more that I should want in life.
[00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:05.780]   You have filled out my checklist.
[00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:08.100]   You have met every criteria I have ever thought.
[00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:11.220]   And yet when you start telling them about what your mom said
[00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:12.220]   and I think it really hurts you,
[00:36:12.220 --> 00:36:14.420]   and you know, like she just continues to project the fact
[00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:15.340]   that I don't love my sister,
[00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:16.700]   I care way too much about my job.
[00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:19.580]   If their response to you is, huh?
[00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:22.500]   Yeah, no way, that's crazy.
[00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:27.080]   So what do you want to do for dinner?
[00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:28.680]   That's concerning.
[00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:29.800]   Like that's not a great sign.
[00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:31.480]   Like you're looking for someone
[00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:33.040]   that you have emotional chemistry with.
[00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:33.920]   That's the idea.
[00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:35.320]   You want to marry someone
[00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:38.200]   that doesn't just care about hanging out and hooking up.
[00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:41.800]   You want to marry someone that cares about how you're doing.
[00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:42.840]   And I'll just level with you on this
[00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:45.180]   because I don't think this is going to catch anybody off guard
[00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:48.080]   but ladies, you're traditionally better at this than guys.
[00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:51.440]   Like you are more fluent in the language of your feelings
[00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:52.420]   than men.
[00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:54.260]   And I'm not trying to stereotype.
[00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:55.400]   You can look up the research.
[00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:56.600]   It makes perfect sense.
[00:36:56.600 --> 00:37:01.600]   Because for guys, our typical orientation is task leaning.
[00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:04.140]   Like we would all be quite all right
[00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:09.140]   if our day consisted of work, eat, TV, sleep.
[00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:18.260]   But in a relationship, it's not going to look like that
[00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:19.300]   because you're going to say work
[00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:21.180]   and she's going to want to say, oh my gosh, like what happened?
[00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:22.740]   I knew you were talking to your boss today.
[00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:23.580]   How did that conversation go?
[00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:24.700]   Did he accept your proposal?
[00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:26.340]   Wait, hold on, coworkers, what are their names?
[00:37:26.340 --> 00:37:27.220]   Remind me one more time.
[00:37:27.220 --> 00:37:28.420]   Okay, oh, I thought that was David.
[00:37:28.420 --> 00:37:29.260]   Okay, so, so sorry.
[00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:30.620]   Like you're going to hear that from her
[00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:31.780]   or she's going to walk in
[00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:32.900]   and she's going to see you watching a show.
[00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:34.580]   She's like, oh my gosh, like I don't even know what this is.
[00:37:34.580 --> 00:37:35.860]   What is this show?
[00:37:35.860 --> 00:37:36.740]   Should we watch it together?
[00:37:36.740 --> 00:37:37.580]   Catch me up.
[00:37:37.580 --> 00:37:40.120]   And you're like, I'm in season three, episode eight.
[00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:41.660]   And I don't have time to catch you up
[00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:43.340]   on what's happening in this moment.
[00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:44.780]   Like, this is the case.
[00:37:44.780 --> 00:37:47.300]   It's not that she's trying to be invasive.
[00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:50.060]   It's that she is actually invested.
[00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:51.560]   She cares about you.
[00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:55.320]   Like she doesn't need to know everything you're doing
[00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:58.500]   but she does want to know everything you're feeling
[00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:00.100]   because ladies have a tendency
[00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:04.440]   to have easier emotional chemistry with other people.
[00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:06.380]   You see, there's a major difference
[00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:07.940]   in falling in love with someone
[00:38:07.940 --> 00:38:10.680]   and falling in love with the idea of someone.
[00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:13.140]   And the distinction or difference
[00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:16.940]   is a lack of emotional availability.
[00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:18.260]   Like they can be the most incredible human being
[00:38:18.260 --> 00:38:21.860]   but are you the only one that opens up
[00:38:21.860 --> 00:38:23.420]   when things are going on in your life?
[00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:24.260]   Like you're willing to tell them
[00:38:24.260 --> 00:38:25.580]   like what went wrong at work
[00:38:25.580 --> 00:38:27.620]   or the difficult conversation that you just had
[00:38:27.620 --> 00:38:29.140]   or the troubles that you're facing,
[00:38:29.140 --> 00:38:30.960]   the insecurities you're dealing with.
[00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:34.660]   And they never have anything to offer in return.
[00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:36.900]   Or when something happens in their life,
[00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:39.380]   like when their work goes haywire
[00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:40.940]   or their relationships turn south
[00:38:40.940 --> 00:38:42.680]   or maybe you're in a disagreement,
[00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:45.340]   they pull away, they withdraw.
[00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:48.940]   They try to move back into the recesses away from engaging.
[00:38:48.940 --> 00:38:51.140]   That's not a healthy sign.
[00:38:51.140 --> 00:38:51.980]   How about this?
[00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:55.060]   Do they engage on topics that have nothing to do with them
[00:38:55.060 --> 00:38:57.060]   and everything to do with you?
[00:38:57.060 --> 00:38:59.400]   I remember I had to learn this one.
[00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:02.000]   This was not an easy one for me nor natural to me.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.060]   But when Brooke would come home from work,
[00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:06.340]   I would have to not just listen
[00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:07.780]   to the things she was saying
[00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:09.420]   but I would have to ask questions
[00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:11.740]   so that way I would ensure I'm engaged
[00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:14.380]   and emotionally available for her.
[00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:18.640]   Guys, if you want to build emotional chemistry
[00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:20.700]   with a young lady,
[00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:23.380]   then you need to think
[00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:24.820]   about what it looks like to become
[00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:26.820]   emotionally present with her.
[00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:29.220]   And I need to make a quick caveat
[00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:31.820]   because this is only within the confines
[00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:33.500]   of someone you're seriously pursuing.
[00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:35.420]   A lot of damage has been done
[00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:36.380]   by both girls and guys
[00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:37.940]   that emotionally dump on someone else.
[00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:39.660]   Get them deeply invested.
[00:39:39.660 --> 00:39:41.420]   You have no intention of doing anything with them.
[00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:43.100]   If you're doing that, please stop.
[00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:45.540]   For the love of God, don't do that to people anymore.
[00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:46.700]   And yet if you're a guy in the room
[00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:49.020]   and you actually are pursuing a young lady,
[00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:50.540]   you want to build emotional chemistry,
[00:39:50.540 --> 00:39:51.760]   then what you need to do
[00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:53.420]   is you need to learn three very important words.
[00:39:53.420 --> 00:39:54.260]   You ready for them?
[00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:56.260]   Tell me more.
[00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:57.140]   That's it.
[00:39:57.140 --> 00:39:58.140]   Tell me more.
[00:39:58.140 --> 00:39:59.820]   'Cause if you do that, what's gonna happen
[00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:01.700]   is she's actually going to light up
[00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:03.620]   and tell you things about what's going on in her life.
[00:40:03.620 --> 00:40:04.740]   I remember someone looked at me and told me,
[00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:07.500]   "Hey, whenever something's going on in your wife's life,
[00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:09.180]   "those are windows into her soul,
[00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:11.180]   "so pay very close attention."
[00:40:11.180 --> 00:40:12.020]   And guess what?
[00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:12.940]   There are bonus points
[00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:14.820]   if you can take old information she's shared
[00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:16.660]   and you can connect it to new information she's sharing.
[00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:17.660]   She's gonna look at you and be like,
[00:40:17.660 --> 00:40:19.300]   "Oh my gosh, you're the most thoughtful man
[00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:20.700]   "I've ever met in my entire life."
[00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:22.020]   (audience laughing)
[00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:23.420]   Emotional chemistry matters.
[00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:26.020]   You want a relationship where that's true of you
[00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:27.620]   because you want someone who can support you.
[00:40:27.620 --> 00:40:29.260]   Like in the goals you have, in the trials you face,
[00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:30.580]   in the dreams you hold, in the hardships ahead,
[00:40:30.580 --> 00:40:33.060]   you want someone that is like Jesus
[00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:36.020]   because this is how he cares for you.
[00:40:36.020 --> 00:40:39.340]   Matthew 9, 36 says, "When he saw the crowds,
[00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:40.740]   "he had compassion for them
[00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:44.280]   "because they were harassed and helpless,
[00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:45.920]   "like sheep without a shepherd."
[00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:49.360]   Jesus sees not simply what's on the surface,
[00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:51.480]   he sees what's under the surface
[00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:54.580]   because Jesus sees straight to the heart.
[00:40:54.580 --> 00:40:57.900]   He wants to know what's really going on
[00:40:57.900 --> 00:41:00.200]   because then he can really care for you.
[00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:02.260]   We should do the same thing.
[00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:04.500]   In closing, let me just say this.
[00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:07.580]   I know as I unpack all of that,
[00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:09.900]   some of you are sitting here and you're thinking,
[00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:13.340]   "Kylen, we have all of that.
[00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:16.380]   "Like in my relationship, that stuff is all true.
[00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:19.260]   "We have social chemistry, like we're best friends.
[00:41:19.260 --> 00:41:20.680]   "We've made some amazing memories.
[00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:22.080]   "We laugh all the time.
[00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:24.940]   "We have all the same mutual interests.
[00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:26.720]   "We've got romantic chemistry.
[00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:29.580]   "Like he flirts with me and we're playful together
[00:41:29.580 --> 00:41:31.860]   "and I've got goosebumps and all the butterflies
[00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:32.700]   "that should be true.
[00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:34.520]   "And we have emotional chemistry.
[00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:38.300]   "Like I never have to worry about where she stands.
[00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:40.160]   "I always know where she is
[00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:42.400]   "and she always knows where I am.
[00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:45.200]   "And yet, Kylen, we've got all of that chemistry
[00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:46.860]   "that you just unpacked.
[00:41:46.860 --> 00:41:49.100]   "And yet something is still missing for me.
[00:41:49.100 --> 00:41:52.320]   "Why, why is that the case?"
[00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:56.840]   I have only one question to ask you.
[00:41:56.840 --> 00:42:01.960]   Do they know Jesus?
[00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:07.960]   Like, do they really know Jesus?
[00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:14.760]   And that sounds like such the classic gospel turn
[00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:15.960]   at the end of the message,
[00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:18.520]   what should be proclaimed from this stage.
[00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:21.680]   But I am so serious.
[00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:23.400]   Do they know him?
[00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:25.360]   Because the truth of the matter is,
[00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:28.700]   you can have all of these three loves figured out.
[00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:33.080]   But if you don't have the first and the foremost love,
[00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:35.920]   then you don't have anything.
[00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:41.260]   Our world has figured out chemistry,
[00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:44.480]   but they have not figured out Christ.
[00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:49.240]   They exist in relationships where they're great friends
[00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:53.780]   and they do flirt and they find all the right feelings.
[00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:56.980]   And yet they have no faith.
[00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:03.520]   What ultimately binds a holy God to an unholy people
[00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:06.680]   is not chemistry or compatibility,
[00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:09.880]   for there was never a more incompatible couple
[00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:10.800]   in all history.
[00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:17.480]   It was commitment that he would sacrifice himself for us.
[00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:22.360]   It's that first love, that agape love,
[00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:25.500]   that love that is most characteristic of Christ.
[00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:27.060]   Because when we, listen,
[00:43:27.060 --> 00:43:31.400]   when we lacked friendship, phileo, with God,
[00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:35.760]   he never lacked love for you.
[00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:40.820]   When we lacked passion, eros for God,
[00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:43.180]   he never lacked love for you.
[00:43:43.180 --> 00:43:48.560]   When we lacked care,
[00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:51.180]   storge for God,
[00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:54.540]   he never lacked love for you.
[00:43:54.540 --> 00:43:58.540]   Instead, he swept in to make you his friends.
[00:43:58.540 --> 00:44:02.060]   He moved in and wooed you to himself.
[00:44:02.060 --> 00:44:04.140]   And he has called you his family,
[00:44:04.140 --> 00:44:07.580]   son, daughter, brother, sister,
[00:44:07.580 --> 00:44:11.980]   because he has a love which the world knows not.
[00:44:11.980 --> 00:44:14.360]   All other kinds of love will fail,
[00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:15.200]   but the love of God,
[00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:16.620]   the self-sacrificing love of Jesus
[00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:20.900]   is a love that will never, nor has it ever,
[00:44:20.900 --> 00:44:22.820]   failed.
[00:44:23.580 --> 00:44:25.780]   (gentle music)
[00:44:25.780 --> 00:44:29.900]   If you know him, you'll find them.
[00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:32.360]   Let me pray you would.
[00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:39.260]   God, you know that I have wrestled
[00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:41.700]   with insecurity around this series
[00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:43.900]   for the last half of it.
[00:44:43.900 --> 00:44:51.300]   And yet, God, what I know is there's not a day go by,
[00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:52.740]   nor a decision ever made
[00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:55.700]   that is not first and foremost sovereignly
[00:44:55.700 --> 00:44:58.060]   orchestrated by you.
[00:44:58.060 --> 00:45:01.220]   And so, God, I believe,
[00:45:01.220 --> 00:45:04.580]   God, I believe,
[00:45:04.580 --> 00:45:07.140]   here at the end of it all,
[00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:11.540]   on a message that may feel so very niche,
[00:45:11.540 --> 00:45:17.620]   you can take it and multiply it to the masses,
[00:45:17.620 --> 00:45:19.420]   and you can reach them, God.
[00:45:19.420 --> 00:45:21.420]   These friends of mine here,
[00:45:21.420 --> 00:45:24.280]   you can reach them right where they are,
[00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:27.980]   whatever their condition or status.
[00:45:27.980 --> 00:45:34.420]   And so, God, I'm praying you'd do it.
[00:45:34.420 --> 00:45:35.860]   I'm praying right now
[00:45:35.860 --> 00:45:39.840]   you would bring the dead to life,
[00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:40.680]   'cause that's the story.
[00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:43.660]   If you don't know Jesus, you're dead.
[00:45:43.660 --> 00:45:45.540]   You're dead in your trespasses and sins,
[00:45:45.540 --> 00:45:46.500]   and yet that's the good news.
[00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:47.420]   The gospel, he stepped in,
[00:45:47.420 --> 00:45:49.620]   so that way you would not have to have death
[00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:51.220]   as the final chapter,
[00:45:51.220 --> 00:45:52.940]   but instead you could have life
[00:45:52.940 --> 00:45:54.720]   in a story that goes on forever.
[00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:58.460]   All you have to do is
[00:45:58.460 --> 00:46:03.060]   accept the free gift of salvation
[00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:06.900]   by placing your faith and declaring him as Lord.
[00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:07.900]   Others, you're here,
[00:46:07.900 --> 00:46:11.900]   and there's another step for you to take.
[00:46:11.900 --> 00:46:13.220]   Listen to the Spirit,
[00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:17.700]   and then be responsive, obedient to your beloved.
[00:46:17.700 --> 00:46:20.660]   If you need to pray with someone down
[00:46:20.660 --> 00:46:21.500]   at the foot of the stage,
[00:46:21.500 --> 00:46:23.220]   we're gonna be here for you,
[00:46:23.220 --> 00:46:24.700]   but we're gonna respond in worship.
[00:46:24.700 --> 00:46:26.140]   God, we love you.
[00:46:26.140 --> 00:46:27.860]   We sing to you now.
[00:46:27.860 --> 00:46:30.420]   It is in your name we pray, amen.
[00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:40.420]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
