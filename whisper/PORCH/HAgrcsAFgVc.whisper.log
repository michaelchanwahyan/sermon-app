[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:18.060]   - Love it.
[00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.920]   We are continuing a series called Missing Out.
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.960]   If you're just joining us, I would highly encourage you
[00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.860]   to go back and listen to the first couple of messages
[00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.660]   so you can be totally caught up
[00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.400]   in where we are in the series.
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.560]   I'm gonna start by asking a question
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.160]   that I'm gonna need a little bit of help
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.200]   from kind of the first few rows.
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.400]   What is the most entertaining part of a wedding
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.800]   or wedding and reception?
[00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.340]   - Cake. - Cake.
[00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:38.540]   - The cake, okay.
[00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.140]   (audience laughing)
[00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.720]   Okay, bouquet throw.
[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.040]   I would have said bouquet and garter throw.
[00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.880]   And so I'm gonna tell you why.
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.420]   And it's really maybe the most entertaining for a long time.
[00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.680]   I feel like before I got married,
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.200]   it was like my least favorite part of a wedding
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.920]   because it felt like the cattle call
[00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.360]   made up by some married person
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.800]   trying to set their son up on a date or something.
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.300]   Where it's like, everyone who can't get a date
[00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.460]   on the dance floor right now,
[00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.800]   single ladies in the background,
[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.540]   and maybe the bouquet gods can help you.
[00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.280]   And so if that wasn't weird enough,
[00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.580]   and then the garter thing,
[00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.540]   I don't know where this tradition came from,
[00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.840]   but it's like, we're gonna have this guy
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.320]   take this thigh band off.
[00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.380]   And if you guys would be a little bit more diligent,
[00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.260]   you could pull off a thigh band as well
[00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:26.680]   and fire it off into the air.
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.960]   But it's definitely maybe the most entertaining part
[00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.600]   of a reception because it seems like at every reception,
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.960]   there's always like one person who came game face on,
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.360]   headband on, they're like ready to go up
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.360]   and they're gonna grab that bouquet or that garter.
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.240]   They are getting this one
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.240]   as though they think it really may work.
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.920]   And then there's others who are like intentionally missing
[00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.200]   'cause they don't wanna send the wrong message
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.240]   to their date who's there or something.
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.080]   All right?
[00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.720]   And here's what's funny is like now,
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:59.700]   this didn't used to be the case,
[00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.820]   but it seems like you go to weddings
[00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.000]   and people will like intentionally step back
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.840]   to stay away from it.
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.840]   You've seen this before, anyone?
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.080]   I heard a story today from a girl on our staff.
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.920]   She said she went to a wedding
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.320]   and the bride put a $100 bill in the bouquet
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.280]   because she knew all of her bridesmaids and girlfriends
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.640]   did not want to get married,
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.720]   but they would want $100 and she wanted a good photo.
[00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.700]   And so they were up there grabbing for this $100
[00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.180]   because there's something about our generation
[00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.100]   that we may not want marriage for some of us,
[00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.920]   though that may not be the case for all of us,
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.620]   but everyone wants $100, right?
[00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.780]   And so I think really most of us in the room
[00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.540]   probably fall into two camps as it relates
[00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.420]   to tonight's topic of missing out on love.
[00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.660]   And the first may be that camp of you going,
[00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.860]   hey, I'm great with missing out on love right now.
[00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.260]   I do not want a relationship
[00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.580]   that is not in the cards for me.
[00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.140]   I'm great in being in that camp.
[00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:58.460]   And then there's another camp
[00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.500]   where we are figuratively grabbing
[00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.340]   and we would love to take that bouquet home
[00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.580]   where we are so sick of missing out on love.
[00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.500]   And it's Valentine's Day week, which only makes it worse.
[00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.780]   Another thing invented probably by a married person
[00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.700]   where it's like, we're just gonna celebrate our love,
[00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.300]   the thing that I don't have
[00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.660]   and is totally absent from my life.
[00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.660]   And so this week is only made worse
[00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.060]   because it just seems like you wish you had a Valentine's.
[00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.100]   You're sick of watching bridesmaids at home
[00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.660]   with your girlfriends and not getting to hang out
[00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.580]   with a Valentine.
[00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.820]   Lots of blank spaces and no names to write in them.
[00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.140]   And so, I mean, it's true.
[00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.300]   And we wish we were not missing out on love.
[00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:45.820]   And so here's why I set up with all of that
[00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.500]   because inside of those two camps,
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.780]   both of them are in danger of missing out
[00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.240]   on what true love really is.
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.060]   Like both of those camps in some ways
[00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.120]   probably wrongly define what true love
[00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.060]   because the person who doesn't want it,
[00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.280]   if she knew or he knew what true love was,
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.600]   she would know it is the thing
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.700]   or he would know that he or she desires most.
[00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.400]   And that person who's reaching for it,
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.440]   I just want it and I just want someone to love me
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.420]   and pursue me and I just want someone to take me on dates
[00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:17.840]   or to go on dates with,
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.860]   that person in some ways has wrongly defined
[00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:22.140]   what true love is because even if she or he
[00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:23.640]   got all of those things,
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.580]   she could still be or he could still be
[00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.820]   missing out on love, on true love.
[00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.220]   And so that's tonight's topic of missing out
[00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:33.620]   on this idea of true love.
[00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.320]   And here's kind of the big takeaway
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.320]   in case I can't keep you engaged for the next 25 minutes
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.760]   and you start counting these wood things up here
[00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:45.760]   is that true love always involves God.
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.960]   The source of all true love that you and I
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.240]   will ever experience always involves God
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.440]   because God is love, we're told.
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.600]   And the very thing that you came into this world
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.680]   desiring most and the thing that you will die
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.160]   on your deathbed desiring most is that true love.
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.480]   And the good news for all of us is that God has made a way
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:12.080]   and opened a door so that no one would ever have
[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.160]   to be missing out on love,
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.140]   so that no one would ever have to lack that thing
[00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:22.140]   that they desire most and is found only in him.
[00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:23.840]   And so we're gonna be in Ephesians three,
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.240]   we're gonna jump around a little bit
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.040]   as we discover this topic of what really the Bible
[00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:31.040]   presents to us about this idea of love,
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:34.000]   what true love really is, what it isn't,
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.880]   and what it does inside of our life.
[00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.400]   And so we're gonna be in Ephesians chapter three,
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.520]   Ephesians was written by the Apostle Paul.
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.940]   If you have a Bible with you, you can open up
[00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:43.400]   Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Acts, Romans,
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.080]   Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians.
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.800]   If you hit any books before that, just flip back.
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.160]   And we'll be in chapter three where Paul is writing
[00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.640]   to this group in Ephesus,
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.560]   and he prays this really unique prayer.
[00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:01.040]   It's one of the only places where we see Paul
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:04.120]   say the things that he says and also start it with,
[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.880]   this is when I get down on my knees.
[00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:08.320]   I pray for you guys all the time,
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.580]   but when I get down on my knees,
[00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.800]   this is the thing that I pray.
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:13.920]   And here's what he says, we're gonna pick up
[00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.380]   in verse 14 of chapter three.
[00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:20.840]   For this reason, I, Paul speaking,
[00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:24.020]   kneel before the Father from whom every family
[00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:26.060]   in heaven and on earth derives its name.
[00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:28.800]   So what's unique about this is in this culture,
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.680]   we think prayer, we think, hey, I just,
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:32.120]   I get on my knees to pray.
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.600]   And in this culture, you didn't.
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:37.000]   It would be only really, really, really unique occasions.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.600]   Generally, prayer would involve standing
[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:39.760]   with your hands raised, and Paul says,
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:42.600]   no, I get on my knees and I get on my face,
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.640]   and I pray to the God, and then he tries
[00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:47.080]   to help us see who he's praying to,
[00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.560]   how big God is, before whom every family
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.360]   and every person that's ever lived
[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.760]   and ever existed comes from.
[00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:58.000]   And this is what I pray to that huge God, verse 16.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.740]   And I pray that out of the glorious riches,
[00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:05.320]   out of his glorious riches, he may strengthen you
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:08.600]   with power through his Spirit in your inner being
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:12.240]   so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith,
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:15.920]   that Christ would dwell in the deepest parts of your heart.
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:19.760]   And I pray that you, being rooted and established in love,
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:23.160]   may have power, think about this,
[00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:26.160]   together with all God's people,
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:29.360]   to grasp, here's what I want, and here's what I'm praying,
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.480]   here's what I'm begging God to give you power
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:36.480]   to be able to do, to grasp, hold onto,
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:40.800]   how deep, how wide, how long,
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:43.440]   and how deep is the love of Christ,
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:46.920]   to know this love that surpasses knowledge.
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:48.900]   I want you to be able, here's what I'm praying,
[00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:50.660]   when I get down, in unique occasions,
[00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:53.220]   I pray for you all the time, but when I really get down,
[00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:54.880]   if there was one thing I could pray,
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:57.080]   it's not God, will you protect this group,
[00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:00.520]   will you enlarge this group, will you bless them,
[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:02.680]   any of those things, if there's one thing I'm gonna pray,
[00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:05.360]   Paul says, it's that you would know
[00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:08.760]   how deeply loved you are, a love that is beyond
[00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:12.480]   anyone's ability to understand, a love, he says,
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:15.320]   that is so great, that if God does not
[00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:18.880]   supernaturally intervene, you will not be able
[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:21.180]   to understand it, you will not believe it.
[00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:24.840]   I mean, what a bizarre prayer.
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:26.840]   If you could pray anything in the world,
[00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:30.860]   why would you pray, I am begging the God of the universe
[00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:33.920]   from whom every family that ever existed has come,
[00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:38.920]   to do one thing for you, Ephesians, for you, Christian,
[00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:44.920]   that he would allow your heart to have strength,
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:50.180]   supernaturally, to know how deeply loved you are.
[00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:54.140]   And even this week, as I was thinking about
[00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:57.380]   why would you pray that, why is that such a big deal?
[00:08:57.380 --> 00:08:59.660]   'Cause most of us are like, yeah, I know God loves me,
[00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:02.740]   I know, I know he loves me, why would you spend
[00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:06.380]   your prayer, this big prayer, on that?
[00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:10.780]   And then it kinda hit me.
[00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:13.100]   There's one thing that all of us, including the Ephesians
[00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:15.580]   and all of us in the room, have in common.
[00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:20.380]   Like, we all share this deep desire to be loved,
[00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:24.980]   even the guys, we all share this deep longing
[00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:28.020]   for someone to love us, and then at the same time,
[00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:34.580]   we all share this resistance, that we don't feel lovable,
[00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:40.060]   we don't feel worthy of being loved, or we feel unlovely,
[00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:42.900]   like there's something inside of all of our hearts
[00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:47.300]   that both longs to be loved, and yet resists
[00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:51.300]   the idea that we're worth loving.
[00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:54.160]   And so Paul says, I'm praying that God would break through
[00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:56.060]   that resistance inside of your heart,
[00:09:56.060 --> 00:10:01.060]   that you wouldn't be insecure in how God feels
[00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:02.700]   and what God feels towards you,
[00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:06.540]   that you would be fully filled, he says,
[00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:10.500]   with a knowledge of how much God loves you.
[00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:12.820]   And think about it, how much of what you and I do
[00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:14.860]   is driven by the desire to be loved?
[00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:16.720]   And we may not call it that in that moment,
[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:20.620]   but on a daily basis, how much of social media life
[00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:23.760]   is driven by a desire to be loved, or to be accepted,
[00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:26.700]   or to be like, typing out a tweet, no, delete it,
[00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:30.240]   it's not witty enough, or taking a picture,
[00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:33.500]   but you take 16 times just trying to look casual at home,
[00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:35.600]   nothing going on here, and you're like,
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:39.900]   yeah, this is just how I woke up, and how much,
[00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:41.580]   or how many times, I feel like I hear this all the time
[00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:44.160]   from my wife, where we'll be in a scenario,
[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:48.780]   and someone will take a group picture, and what happens?
[00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:50.120]   Hey, can I see that?
[00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:52.940]   We're gonna delete this.
[00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:55.380]   Or it's, hey, can you send that to me,
[00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:57.680]   because I am looking good in this picture.
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:02.220]   Because we wanna project, we want to influence,
[00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:04.900]   and project out there, we're worthy of being loved,
[00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:07.500]   and we wanna control the parts of us that think,
[00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:09.420]   that's not worthy.
[00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:12.780]   I mean, how much of just the way we dress
[00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:18.380]   is driven by tighter, more stylish, whatever it is?
[00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:19.500]   Love me.
[00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:22.040]   Love me.
[00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:24.580]   The jobs that we work, I mean, I have friends
[00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:28.260]   that became doctors because they wanted to be loved.
[00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:29.420]   I'm worthy.
[00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:35.180]   Plastic surgery is at an all-time high right now.
[00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:38.160]   It's higher than it's ever been, percentage-wise.
[00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:41.320]   And in terms of numbers.
[00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:45.180]   Because I hate myself.
[00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:46.540]   I hate the way that I look.
[00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:50.780]   And Paul says, if there's one thing I could pray and ask
[00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:55.780]   that you would really believe, is how deeply loved you are,
[00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:59.320]   that God sees you as worthy of being loved.
[00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:02.920]   In the midst of the resistance,
[00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:07.020]   unloveliness, or I feel unlovable.
[00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:10.780]   I mean, this is why shame is powerful.
[00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:13.740]   This is why Adam and Eve in the garden
[00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:18.740]   ran and covered themselves, because I don't feel lovely.
[00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:20.620]   I don't feel worthy of being loved.
[00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:23.460]   I'm gonna cover it to hide it.
[00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:27.540]   This part of our heart, I mean, this is why you see
[00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:31.220]   famous people spiral out of control under addictive habits
[00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:32.380]   or self-destructive tendencies.
[00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:35.020]   This is why Kesha, in a Rolling Stones interview
[00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:37.020]   you probably may be familiar with, recently said,
[00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:39.420]   look, I'm a crusader for telling other people
[00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:41.380]   to love themselves, and I hate myself.
[00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:46.140]   Kesha, who's beautiful, who has all the fame,
[00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:48.780]   all the money, everything that any 26-year-old girl
[00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:52.900]   would, in worldly terms, want, and she says, I hate myself.
[00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:56.420]   And she's not the only one, because there's something
[00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:59.540]   inside of us that both yearns to be loved
[00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:01.260]   and yet feels that resistance.
[00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:05.380]   And so Paul, to the Ephesian church and to us, says,
[00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:10.380]   I'm praying that you would believe how much he loves you,
[00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:15.180]   that you would know his love, a love that is beyond
[00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:19.140]   human ability to understand how deep, how wide,
[00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:24.140]   how big it is for you, not just the world,
[00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:31.260]   for you, so that no one would have to be missing out
[00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.440]   on love, true love.
[00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:43.260]   I think there's a further kind of problem
[00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:46.900]   with our really thinking as it relates to love,
[00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:50.860]   and it's that we live in a world that's so tarnished,
[00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:52.820]   even what I mean by that word, because people
[00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:55.220]   kind of love everything, I love my dog, I love chocolate,
[00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:57.980]   love my wife, I love, love, love.
[00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:02.500]   And if that weren't enough, there's also influences
[00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:05.580]   constantly hitting our minds of what love looks like,
[00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:09.620]   whether it's The Bachelor, or whether it is Taylor Swift,
[00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:13.020]   song after song after song, or whether it is any
[00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:15.780]   romantic comedy you've ever seen, like this is what
[00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:19.620]   love looks like, and all of those provide poor definitions.
[00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:22.380]   And so God has given us actually a definition
[00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:25.720]   of what his love, what true love, what he feels
[00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:28.300]   when he looks at you is.
[00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:32.660]   And it's in 1 Corinthians 13, and I've never thought
[00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:34.260]   about this before, a lot of you are gonna recognize
[00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:37.280]   this passage, 'cause you've heard it at every wedding,
[00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:39.100]   or at many weddings that you've been to.
[00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:42.180]   And I've never realized this before.
[00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:45.940]   Like this is not, Paul's writing this passage,
[00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:47.820]   and if you go read it this week, and I would highly
[00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:51.100]   encourage you to, Paul writes this passage,
[00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:53.300]   and he says, hey, you need to love one another,
[00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:56.820]   love each other, let me tell you what love is like.
[00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:58.480]   And then he goes off, and I always thought,
[00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:00.860]   oh, that's how I'm supposed to react, or relate
[00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:02.500]   to other people, and that's true.
[00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:08.640]   But this is even more describing how God relates to you,
[00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:14.860]   and to me, the definition of true love for you and for me.
[00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:17.260]   And so that's our second point, the definition,
[00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:20.960]   we're gonna be in 1 Corinthians 13, pick it up in verse four
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:22.780]   of how God feels towards you.
[00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:25.620]   Love is patient.
[00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:29.740]   God is patient.
[00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:34.340]   Some of you need to hear that, that was, for me,
[00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:36.780]   one of the biggest ones of the next few verses this week,
[00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:38.820]   because here's what my heart runs to.
[00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:41.700]   I think that God thinks like I do, and I wonder
[00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:44.660]   if he just looks at me and goes,
[00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:46.420]   when are you gonna get it together?
[00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:48.860]   When are you gonna trust me?
[00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:52.700]   When are you gonna really believe that I'm for your good
[00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:55.020]   and everything you experience is passed through my hands?
[00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:56.820]   When are you gonna trust me, David?
[00:15:56.820 --> 00:16:00.680]   Does he ever get tired of me?
[00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:05.580]   And he says, no, my love with you is patient,
[00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:08.580]   in the midst of that addiction you're walking through.
[00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:11.500]   In the midst of that relationship you keep going back to
[00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:12.960]   that you know is not right.
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:16.820]   In the midst of whatever sin and whatsoever struggle,
[00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:19.820]   God says, my love for you is patient.
[00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:22.780]   Here's what else it is, it's kind.
[00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:25.720]   Everything you experience, it may not feel like it,
[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:29.640]   but it's passed through my hands, and it's kind.
[00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:34.220]   It does not envy, it does not boast.
[00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:37.320]   It is not arrogant or rude.
[00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:40.660]   It does not insist on its own way.
[00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:42.820]   That love, you may have the version that says,
[00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:46.780]   seeks the benefits of others,
[00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:48.860]   or seeks after the welfare of others.
[00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:52.140]   How much would it change a lot of our thinking
[00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:53.140]   if we really believe that?
[00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:54.300]   Like when God looks at you,
[00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:56.340]   when he governs life around you,
[00:16:56.340 --> 00:17:00.620]   he is seeking not for his own best, but for your best.
[00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:03.860]   And a lot of us have never known a love like that.
[00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:07.380]   As many broken families as we come from, mine included,
[00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:10.640]   where I didn't grow up in a home where I knew love
[00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:13.640]   from a fatherly figure that I could always trust
[00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:15.540]   was not self-interested.
[00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:20.520]   And God says, my love for you is always driven
[00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:25.400]   by not self-seeking, but other-seeking.
[00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:32.160]   It says that love is not irritable or resentful,
[00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:34.260]   or it keeps no record of wrongs.
[00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:37.060]   Your translation may have, that God, when he looks at you,
[00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:39.940]   there's not a clipboard and tallying up
[00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:41.980]   how many times are you gonna do this,
[00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:44.660]   but it keeps no record of wrongs.
[00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:46.580]   God is love.
[00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:48.660]   Love keeps no record of wrongs.
[00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:51.660]   God keeps no record of wrongs
[00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:54.460]   for those who have underneath his love in Christ.
[00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:57.900]   And somebody, that's the biggest thing
[00:17:57.900 --> 00:17:59.140]   you need to hear tonight.
[00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:01.860]   That for whatever reason, or the way you were raised,
[00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:05.040]   or your experience of church, when you think about God,
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:07.320]   he's a police officer, he's a judge,
[00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:10.900]   but he's not someone who says, the slate is clean.
[00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:13.200]   I love you.
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:17.460]   It does not rejoice in wrongdoing,
[00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:19.240]   but it rejoices with the truth.
[00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:21.160]   Love bears all things.
[00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:24.600]   God bears all things.
[00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:26.240]   It believes all things.
[00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:28.000]   It hopes all things.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.960]   Love, or God, endures all things,
[00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:32.440]   regardless of what you're walking through.
[00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:34.540]   He does not grow weary and tired with you.
[00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:36.940]   He loves you.
[00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:40.060]   His love, verse eight, never ends.
[00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:42.040]   His never fails.
[00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:43.660]   God cannot stop loving you.
[00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:45.580]   He will not stop loving you.
[00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:49.560]   And I think even the word,
[00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:51.300]   my biggest fear in this message right now
[00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:53.040]   is I don't know how to communicate
[00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:55.520]   how deep and how amazing the love of God is.
[00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:58.820]   So the spirit will have to root that in your heart
[00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:00.040]   if anything's gonna take place,
[00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:01.100]   but here's what I know.
[00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:03.120]   God will not stop pursuing you.
[00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:04.800]   He will not stop loving you.
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:08.520]   He loves you right now, not some future version of you.
[00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:10.120]   His love will never fail.
[00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:12.520]   His love will never bail out on you.
[00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:15.380]   He is aggressive in his love, and he,
[00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:19.520]   I mean, you can clap, but he is the only source
[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:21.080]   of true love that you will ever experience,
[00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:23.040]   the only love that you will know like that,
[00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:27.240]   and that's when he looks at you, what he feels.
[00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:30.820]   (audience member whispers)
[00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:38.120]   I think one of the ways that we've seen this so clearly
[00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:40.240]   is like God has made the first move.
[00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:44.440]   In any relationship, there's always someone
[00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:46.360]   who makes the first move, whether it's a guy
[00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:50.000]   who gives some pickup line or asks,
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.560]   hey, I've got tickets to this thing,
[00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:53.320]   just by chance, would you like to go,
[00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:56.920]   and makes the first move, or whether it's a girl
[00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:59.480]   who just tries to put herself in front of the path,
[00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:01.080]   and it's like, hey, I made these cookies
[00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:03.040]   in between memorizing the Bible and working out,
[00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:05.640]   and so, (audience laughs)
[00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:09.160]   just, it's what I do every day for people,
[00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:12.720]   and so there's always, right, I mean,
[00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:17.440]   there's always someone who makes some sort of first move
[00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:19.800]   in any relationship, and here's what happened.
[00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:21.880]   Here's what has happened for you and for me
[00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:26.400]   is that God has made the first move and said, I'm in.
[00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:29.880]   And he did it in a way that none of us would have predicted,
[00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:32.360]   none of us would have done it, and here's what he did.
[00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:35.360]   This is the demonstration of the true love
[00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:36.200]   that God has for us.
[00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:37.920]   This is Romans 5, eight.
[00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:42.920]   But God demonstrates his love for us in this.
[00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:47.840]   While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.
[00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:49.080]   That God has made the first move,
[00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:50.640]   and here's why I think this is so huge.
[00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:52.760]   It's 'cause most of us, we don't read it like this.
[00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:53.920]   We read it like this.
[00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:55.220]   Put the second one up.
[00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:58.200]   But God demonstrates his own love for us in this.
[00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:03.200]   When we agreed to become good, he died for us.
[00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:05.620]   When I agreed I'm gonna clean myself up,
[00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:07.880]   I'm gonna try harder, I'm gonna be better,
[00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:10.380]   then Christ died for us, and that's not it at all.
[00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:14.880]   That when we were still sinners, Christ died for us.
[00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:16.320]   Here's why I love that verse,
[00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:19.600]   'cause here's what it tells you about me, or about God.
[00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:22.800]   God is a God who loves bad people.
[00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:24.560]   He will not stop loving you.
[00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:27.200]   He will not stop, no matter what you ever do,
[00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:29.960]   for the rest of your life, he will chase and pursue you,
[00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:33.120]   and you can run, but you will not outrun his love,
[00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:35.600]   and you can reject it, or you can accept it.
[00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:38.400]   He is a God who loves bad people,
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:41.600]   even bad people who don't think they're bad.
[00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:45.200]   He loves you, regardless of what you will ever do
[00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:47.060]   or have ever done, right now,
[00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:49.480]   his perfect love is working inside of you,
[00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:51.680]   and he loves you if you've trusted in him.
[00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:53.280]   And he loves you if you haven't,
[00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:55.760]   but you have a unique place and a unique acceptance
[00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:57.280]   of his love if you have,
[00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:59.080]   regardless of what you've ever done.
[00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:01.980]   And he says, "I love you.
[00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:04.240]   "I will not stop."
[00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:05.840]   He's reckless.
[00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:09.480]   I mean, this is crazy, crazy love.
[00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:12.200]   This is why we go, we gotta tell everybody about this love
[00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:14.880]   of a God who is in love with the human race.
[00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:16.600]   He can't help himself.
[00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:17.840]   He cannot stop.
[00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:19.040]   He will not stop.
[00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:21.600]   He's crazy about you, and he'll give anything,
[00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:25.920]   including his son, anything.
[00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:31.520]   And Paul looks into his audience and says,
[00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:33.140]   "If there's one thing I want you to know,
[00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:35.680]   "if there's one thing I believe that could change
[00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:39.220]   "the course of your life, it's that you really believe
[00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:42.040]   "how desperately God loves you."
[00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:45.160]   But he's not a God who loves,
[00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:48.560]   when you clean yourself up, that he is crazy,
[00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:53.180]   insanely obsessed with you, in love with you.
[00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:58.440]   And he looks into all of our pasts
[00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:02.940]   and all of our future failures that he already sees,
[00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:06.760]   and he says, "I love you."
[00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:09.560]   And if you walked in here tonight and you're going,
[00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:11.080]   "I don't even know where I stand
[00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:12.800]   "if there is a God who's there.
[00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:14.600]   "I don't know what he thinks about me,
[00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:18.340]   "my current addiction, my homosexual relationship,
[00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:19.720]   "my abortion."
[00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:23.960]   He says, "I love you."
[00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:28.000]   And he wants you to accept his love,
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.220]   but he will not force you,
[00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:35.280]   and he will allow you to reject it.
[00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:37.720]   And it is the thing he wants most,
[00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:40.840]   and the thing that in all of his power he cannot do,
[00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:42.400]   which is force you to love him.
[00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:45.200]   And it is the thing he wants most
[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:47.000]   because he's crazy about you.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   Crazy about you, not some, in general, the whole world,
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.700]   you, alone in all creation.
[00:23:57.700 --> 00:24:00.240]   He said, "I'll die for you."
[00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:09.420]   I think, as I think about how to,
[00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:13.300]   really what the takeaway for me as I study this text,
[00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:14.300]   and I think for all of us,
[00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:16.540]   and the band is gonna come up in just a minute,
[00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:19.960]   and play a song that speaks a lot of these truths over us,
[00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:23.140]   I wanna invite and ask you to do something,
[00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:24.620]   and it'll be way more beneficial
[00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:26.820]   than anything that I've said for the past 20 minutes.
[00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:30.140]   I want you to pray if you know Christ,
[00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:31.900]   if you've trusted in him alone,
[00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:33.340]   and the work he did on the cross,
[00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:35.380]   not because you're a good person,
[00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:37.340]   but because you're not a good person.
[00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:39.340]   And he died, and he rose again,
[00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:41.860]   showing the check cleared.
[00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:43.700]   It was more than enough.
[00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:45.820]   If you're in that camp,
[00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:47.820]   I want you to pray during this next song,
[00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:50.760]   God, will you help me to believe how much you love me?
[00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:56.060]   Every addiction, according to leading psychologists,
[00:24:56.060 --> 00:25:00.900]   is fueled by one lie, I'm not worthy of being loved,
[00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:03.460]   and I can't find anything to convince me that I am.
[00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:07.740]   So much of what self-destructive tendencies
[00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:11.540]   we all experience are fueled by the lie
[00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:15.300]   that I'm not worthy, I'm ashamed.
[00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:18.340]   And so in the next few minutes as they play this song,
[00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:20.020]   I wanna invite and ask you
[00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:24.220]   to ask God to do what no message could ever do,
[00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:26.580]   which is God, will you help me to believe?
[00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:27.940]   Will you help me, as Paul said,
[00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:32.380]   to know how deep, how wide, how long,
[00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:36.140]   and how much you love me, how much you really love me.
[00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:41.260]   And if you want to,
[00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:45.500]   this actual prayer has repeated itself
[00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:47.220]   in two times in Scripture.
[00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:49.260]   And so you can pray this next prayer there,
[00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:51.260]   I'm about to show you, that's another verse.
[00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:52.460]   But this idea of like,
[00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:54.740]   Lord, will you satisfy us in your love?
[00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:59.020]   Ephesians is not the first place it came.
[00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:01.820]   The oldest psalm in the Old Testament,
[00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:04.700]   the book of Psalms, the oldest psalm we have
[00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:07.660]   is a psalm written by Moses.
[00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:11.620]   In the days when Israel wandered in the wilderness.
[00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:12.660]   And it's Psalm 90.
[00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:16.820]   And in it, there's this line that so captures this idea,
[00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:18.260]   and here's what it says.
[00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:20.260]   Lord, will you satisfy us in the morning
[00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:22.140]   with your unfailing love?
[00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:24.260]   Will you satisfy us?
[00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:26.820]   We just left Egypt, we're gonna be prone to wander,
[00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:28.620]   prone to chase after other gods.
[00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:31.020]   We don't have a Bible, we don't have a Pentateuch,
[00:26:31.020 --> 00:26:32.980]   we don't have anything, we're wandering in the desert.
[00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:37.060]   Lord, will you satisfy my heart with your unfailing love
[00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:41.340]   so that we may experience joy and gladness
[00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:42.400]   all the days of our life?
[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:44.540]   We will not chase it looking in other places,
[00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:46.220]   in the wells that are dry.
[00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:49.380]   Would you satisfy us?
[00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:50.700]   And so right now, if you're a believer,
[00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:52.380]   that's just what I wanna ask you to do.
[00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:54.220]   Say that in those words, say it in whatever your words,
[00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:56.500]   but will you just pray to the God of the universe,
[00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:59.020]   God, will you help me to know more deeply
[00:26:59.020 --> 00:26:59.940]   how much you love me?
[00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:02.140]   And if you're not a believer,
[00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:05.220]   there's two things that we want you to know.
[00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:08.140]   You are more sinful than you even realize.
[00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:09.500]   As bad as you think you are,
[00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:11.460]   and I don't say that in jest, so am I,
[00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:13.860]   you are more broken than you'll ever understand.
[00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:18.100]   But you're more loved than you could ever imagine.
[00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:21.420]   And the God who loves you doesn't wait with a hammer,
[00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:24.660]   he waits with his arms spread out on a cross saying,
[00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:27.660]   I love you, I'll do anything for you.
[00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:31.880]   Will you accept my love, my perfect love?
[00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:36.280]   And will cast out the fear, fear of death,
[00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:38.980]   fear of being loved, fear.
[00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:44.480]   I was asked to, I got a chance to speak at an event
[00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:47.040]   we've held this past weekend called D-Town.
[00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:50.600]   And yeah, some either high schoolers who snuck in here
[00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:53.260]   or leaders, just for high school and junior high,
[00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:56.820]   or if you're in junior high, PG-13.
[00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:58.720]   It was for our student ministry,
[00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:01.320]   and it was 1,000 kids, it was awesome, it's unbelievable.
[00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:02.280]   If you're looking to serve somewhere,
[00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:03.920]   student ministry's incredible.
[00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:05.720]   And in the midst of this weekend,
[00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:07.000]   they had 1,000 kids there,
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.440]   and all kinds of just exciting stuff was going on.
[00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:11.280]   And at one moment throughout the weekend,
[00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:14.360]   one of the directors, a buddy of mine named David Penuel,
[00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:15.520]   he got up on the stage and he said,
[00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:18.120]   look, I have $100 for the first person
[00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:21.200]   who's willing to go jump in the watermark pond.
[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:23.760]   First person who's willing to do it, 100 bucks.
[00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:25.400]   And as you can imagine, this is in a room
[00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:28.400]   of young adults where I have a job.
[00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:30.080]   This is like high school kids where it's like,
[00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:32.520]   oh my gosh, $100?
[00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:34.720]   It's like five years allowance.
[00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:36.160]   Unless I live in Highland Park.
[00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:39.480]   And I don't know if I could say that.
[00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:42.480]   If you live in Highland Park, will you please forgive me?
[00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:45.440]   I think, I don't know if I should or not.
[00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:47.560]   Anyways, so anyways, so of course,
[00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:50.280]   tons of hands went up, and one of the kids,
[00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:53.580]   he said, stretching his arm, you, you can do it.
[00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:56.480]   And he went and he grabbed it,
[00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:59.100]   and he grabbed his $100 that he so desperately wanted,
[00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:01.800]   and he totally submerged himself in the water.
[00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:06.800]   And then he came back inside, and he displayed,
[00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:09.760]   not only, he displayed really two things.
[00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:12.280]   How desperately he wanted that thing,
[00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:16.000]   and what it was worth to him.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.760]   Totally, I'll do that.
[00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:21.240]   I'll jump in the pond, it's worth it to me.
[00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:26.180]   When the question of what you were worth,
[00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:31.680]   how desperately you were wanted, was put in front of God.
[00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:38.460]   His answer was a cross and the brutal murder of his son,
[00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:40.100]   so that you would never have to wonder
[00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:42.360]   how deeply loved you are.
[00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:44.260]   It is the thing you were made for.
[00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:46.020]   It is the thing you came into this world
[00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:48.700]   longing to experience, to know and believe,
[00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:52.060]   and the thing you will want to know in your deathbed.
[00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:55.300]   And God has provided a way, provided his son,
[00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:57.240]   so that no one would have to wonder,
[00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:59.980]   and no one would have to be missing out on love.
[00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:02.900]   You guys pray with me?
[00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:11.240]   Father, we pray now, and I pray now
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:13.680]   that you would do what I will never be able to do,
[00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:14.960]   what JP could never do,
[00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:18.100]   what Shane's singing a million songs could never do,
[00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:22.420]   which is allow us to know how deeply you love us,
[00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:28.480]   how crazy you are about us, how you will not stop,
[00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:33.240]   you cannot stop, and how you have displayed
[00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:35.460]   that love perfectly.
[00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:37.580]   You define love perfectly.
[00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:40.380]   Would you convince my heart right now,
[00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:42.820]   would you convince my friend's hearts in the room
[00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:43.960]   of how deeply they are loved,
[00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:46.100]   would you convince the hearts of those
[00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:48.660]   who maybe don't know you through your son?
[00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:53.020]   They don't know that perfect display of love
[00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:54.300]   that you've given us.
[00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:57.140]   Would you grab hold of their hearts right now?
[00:30:57.140 --> 00:30:58.880]   We love you, amen.
