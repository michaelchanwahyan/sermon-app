 All right.

13
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:39,880
 Welcome, everybody, to the porch.

14
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,440
 How you doing?

15
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:41,940
 Good.

16
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:42,440
 Good.

17
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,320
 Sounds like a lot of new people here tonight.

18
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,600
 That's exciting.

19
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,400
 Introduce myself.

20
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,520
 My name is JP.

21
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,240
 I'm Jonathan Picluda.

22
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,800
 Glad to be here with you guys.

23
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,720
 Glad you could finally make it.

24
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,040
 I'm kidding.

25
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:53,740
 My name's Adam.

26
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:55,080
 I get to lead the college ministry here

27
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:55,580
 at Watermark.

28
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:57,480
 Any college students here tonight?

29
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:57,980
 All right.

30
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:59,920
 Couple of Aggies doing their whoop thing, whatever.

31
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,360
 All right.

32
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,040
 That's awesome.

33
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,960
 Well, I'm excited you guys are here.

34
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,280
 Here's what we're doing at the porch this summer.

35
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,680
 We're doing this thing called Summer on the Mount,

36
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,160
 where we're going through the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus'

37
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,440
 most famous sermon.

38
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,840
 It's recorded in Matthew chapter 5, chapter 6, and chapter 7.

39
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,680
 And so I'm here tonight, and we are going to pick this up.

40
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,260
 Where we left off last week, tonight

41
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:20,440
 is the fifth week with all of this.

42
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,440
 And so that's where we're going to go tonight.

43
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,800
 So before I get started, I got a story I want to start with.

44
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,480
 How many people in here, just by show of hands real quick,

45
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,120
 rent an apartment right now?

46
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,480
 How many of you guys are renters?

47
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,360
 Large majority.

48
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,080
 God bless you.

49
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:32,640
 OK.

50
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,720
 How many of you, though, rent a house?

51
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,920
 How many of you rent a house?

52
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,240
 That is the way to go.

53
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:37,920
 All right.

54
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,720
 I want to tell you a story about a time

55
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,400
 when my wife and I were renting a house.

56
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,720
 It was 2010.

57
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,880
 It was late summer of 2010.

58
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,600
 We were renting a house up in Richardson,

59
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,640
 just a little couple miles north here of Watermark.

60
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,680
 We had this great house in a great neighborhood.

61
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,720
 We loved it.

62
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,920
 And at this time, we had two kids in our life.

63
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,240
 We had-- our oldest was like a little over two,

64
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,240
 and our youngest had just been born.

65
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,720
 Jake and Joshua had just been born.

66
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,360
 Joshua had just been born at that point.

67
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,720
 And so our lease was coming up.

68
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,640
 We were about two months away from the lease being up.

69
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,440
 We had been in this house for about a year.

70
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,480
 And so the landlord gives me a call.

71
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,960
 And he was a friend of ours, and we

72
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,880
 were renting just from an individual owner.

73
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,320
 And he gives me a call, says, hey, Adam,

74
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,480
 your lease is coming up in about 60 days.

75
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,240
 And if you're going to move out, I need to have 60 days notice.

76
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,800
 And so I don't know if you and your wife

77
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,920
 have talked about it or not, but I

78
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,480
 need to know if you guys are going to sign the lease again.

79
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,560
 And I just right there on the phone

80
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,040
 was like, I'm going to sign the lease again.

81
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:32,840
 We love this house.

82
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,640
 We love the location.

83
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,720
 We love the neighborhood.

84
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,440
 We love the cost.

85
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,320
 We love all of it.

86
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,920
 We will sign the lease.

87
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,440
 We want to stay here another year.

88
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,320
 He says, great.

89
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,160
 So here's what I'm going to do.

90
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,920
 I'm going to drop off a new lease.

91
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,280
 I'll drop it off in your mailbox.

92
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,560
 When your rent's due in a couple of weeks,

93
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,240
 you just go ahead and sign that lease.

94
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,600
 You and your wife sign the lease,

95
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,040
 include that with your rent check, and we'll be fine.

96
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,800
 I said, great.

97
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,640
 That's what we'll do.

98
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,440
 A couple of days later, the lease shows up.

99
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,280
 A couple of days after that, we get a phone call.

100
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,000
 And to make a long story short, the contents

101
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,400
 of this phone call really changed our life.

102
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,120
 We got a phone call, and basically my wife and I

103
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,120
 had an opportunity to buy a house.

104
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,280
 Up to this point, we'd been married about seven years.

105
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,200
 We had just been renting, and we had this amazing opportunity,

106
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,200
 something you couldn't plan for, something

107
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,640
 we weren't planning for.

108
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,920
 Everything kind of aligned, and we had an opportunity

109
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,600
 to buy the house.

110
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,440
 And so Jackie's like, this is amazing.

111
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,600
 Like, we're going to have an opportunity to buy a house.

112
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,480
 Aren't you excited?

113
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,560
 And I'm like, yeah, I'm excited, but I don't know

114
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,360
 what we're going to do, because I just told the landlord

115
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,920
 that we're going to sign the lease.

116
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,120
 And she sits there and goes, well, hold on.

117
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,120
 Did you actually sign it?

118
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,480
 I said, no, we haven't signed it.

119
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,400
 It's sitting right over there on the table.

120
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,560
 She goes, well, if you haven't signed it,

121
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,680
 then we're not bound.

122
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,040
 Here's one thing you need to know about my wife.

123
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,160
 When she used to be a lawyer.

124
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,640
 [LAUGHTER]

125
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,840
 So in these areas, I tend to trust her.

126
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,800
 I tend to go, hey, you're the expert.

127
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,240
 And so she put that little lawyer hat on,

128
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,920
 and she's looking at this going, no, no, no, no.

129
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,960
 If you just told somebody you're going to sign it,

130
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,840
 that doesn't obligate you.

131
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,520
 It obligates you when you sign it.

132
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,760
 That's when you're obligated.

133
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,120
 And I said, that sounds amazing.

134
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,040
 Let's go with that, because you're an attorney.

135
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,720
 And so here's what I did.

136
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,240
 I wrote out a letter.

137
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,480
 I wrote a letter to the landlord.

138
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,520
 I said, hey, I know I told you I would sign it,

139
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,560
 but we had this awesome opportunity that popped up,

140
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,520
 and now we're going to go try to buy this house.

141
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,920
 And so I'm not signing the lease.

142
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,440
 Love, Adam.

143
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,040
 And I put that, and I wrote this letter.

144
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,800
 I signed it.

145
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,600
 I folded it up.

146
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,840
 I put it in an envelope.

147
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,880
 I took the lease, unsigned, put that in the envelope.

148
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,560
 I took my rent check, put that in the envelope,

149
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,800
 put all three of them in the envelope,

150
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,000
 get in my car to go drive over to his house to pay the rent,

151
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,120
 because that's the way we did it.

152
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,880
 I would drive over and drop it in his mailbox.

153
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,880
 And guys, I'm telling you, I will never forget.

154
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:49,880
 I pull up in front of his house, and he is out front.

155
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,920
 Now, he was on the phone, and so I was like,

156
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,400
 all right, all right, that's good.

157
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,440
 But when I saw him, I was like, my heart sunk.

158
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,320
 I was like, oh no.

159
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,360
 And so he's on the phone, and he's like getting in his car,

160
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,880
 and I kind of get out of my car,

161
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,960
 and I'm like waving this little envelope,

162
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,560
 like, hey, I got your rent check, you know?

163
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,520
 And I'll never forget, he goes like this.

164
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,840
 He's on the phone, and he goes, hold on.

165
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,640
 And he looks at me, and he goes, is the lease in there?

166
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,000
 And guys, I panicked.

167
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,600
 I looked at him, I go, yeah, it's in there.

168
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,720
 'Cause technically it was.

169
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,720
 I mean, it was in there.

170
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,160
 So again, legally, I was fine.

171
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,000
 I was not lying.

172
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,880
 I mean, it was there.

173
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,520
 And so technically it was in there.

174
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,520
 I knew what he was asking.

175
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,000
 What he was asking is, is the signed lease in there?

176
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,760
 But I just was like playing the technicality,

177
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,160
 and I said, yeah, the lease is in there.

178
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,320
 So I drop it off to him, and he goes,

179
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,280
 great, I'll call you later.

180
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,320
 And I'm like, I know you will.

181
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,760
 And so I get back in my car, and I go on,

182
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,160
 and then a couple hours later, the phone rings,

183
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,000
 and I look, and it's the landlord, and I pick it up,

184
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,840
 and I'm like, hello.

185
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,640
 And he goes, you told me you were gonna sign the lease.

186
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:54,000
 And I'm like, yeah, but these circumstances changed.

187
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,160
 I mean, I couldn't plan for this.

188
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:59,280
 And he's like, but you said you were going to sign the lease.

189
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,560
 This is confusing to me.

190
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,800
 This is frustrating to me.

191
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,560
 I don't understand why you said you were gonna do something,

192
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,080
 and now you're not doing it.

193
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,680
 He kept saying that over and over and over again.

194
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,800
 And I'm thinking probably what you're thinking.

195
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,480
 I'm like, man, that's kind of harsh.

196
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:13,520
 Like, how about a, hey, congratulations?

197
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,560
 Or hey, maybe I'll get you a housewarming gift

198
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,400
 or something like that.

199
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,440
 Like, aren't you excited that my wife and I

200
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,400
 don't have to rent anymore,

201
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,800
 that we're gonna get a chance to buy a house?

202
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,600
 He was not excited.

203
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,040
 He was frustrated.

204
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,640
 He was confused.

205
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,600
 And he kept saying over and over and over again,

206
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,240
 you told me you were gonna sign the lease,

207
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,400
 and he was right.

208
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,640
 And my wife and I learned something,

209
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,680
 and it was, when I say learned something,

210
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,320
 I mean, really, we were reminded of something

211
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,360
 that we had learned over and over and over again

212
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,880
 in our life, but yet we were seeing it anew

213
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,040
 with that situation.

214
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:50,320
 I mean, that whole situation was not one of

215
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,440
 my finest moments or my wife's finest moments.

216
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,320
 We look at that.

217
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,720
 In fact, I even told her that I was gonna open

218
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,440
 with that kind of story, or with this story,

219
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,280
 we were gonna talk about this,

220
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,880
 and she kind of had that cringe look.

221
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,120
 And both of us, when we think about that situation

222
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,760
 and what we did with that landlord,

223
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,000
 we both, we kind of, we just cringe sometimes

224
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,160
 'cause we know that was not one of the best moments

225
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,000
 in our life.

226
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,120
 And we learned something again that night,

227
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:17,120
 and what we learned is that our word matters.

228
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,680
 When we say we're going to do something that matters,

229
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,760
 and the reason why it matters is because when we say

230
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:29,200
 we're gonna do something, we're making a commitment.

231
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,040
 And the way that we handle our commitment

232
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,280
 reveals our character.

233
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:38,040
 And I start with all that tonight because that's,

234
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,560
 that's what we're gonna talk about tonight.

235
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,560
 The subject matter of our discussion tonight is commitments.

236
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,720
 And all the commitments that you and I make

237
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,920
 as we go on about interacting in our lives

238
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,040
 and in our daily lives,

239
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,520
 we're always and often making commitments,

240
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:00,720
 and we're gonna look specifically at what Jesus has to say

241
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,520
 about the commitments that we make in our life.

242
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:06,040
 And there's two reasons why this is so vitally important

243
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,280
 for every single one of us in the room tonight,

244
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,120
 and here's the first reason.

245
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,760
 The first reason this message is so important for us

246
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,880
 and what Jesus has to say about commitments

247
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,520
 is so important for us is because this,

248
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,040
 by and large, one of the reputations

249
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,840
 that 20 and 30-somethings have out there,

250
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:26,440
 one of the reputations that people in their 20s and 30s has

251
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,160
 is that they are flaky.

252
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,080
 You're flaky.

253
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:35,120
 Life, you're just flying by the seat of your pants.

254
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,360
 You're just doing whatever it is that you wanna do.

255
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,160
 You wanna keep all of your options open

256
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,680
 to make sure you don't miss out on anything.

257
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,560
 Like FOMO is not just a funny hashtag

258
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,480
 or something that you say before you go do something crazy.

259
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,640
 FOMO is a way of life for so many people

260
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,760
 in their 20s and 30s, which is basically,

261
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,320
 I wanna do what I wanna do,

262
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,520
 and I wanna keep all of my options open

263
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:01,240
 because I wanna make sure that I don't miss out on anything.

264
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,520
 I mean, let's be real honest.

265
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,640
 There's a lot of you in the room tonight

266
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:11,520
 because nobody else called you today.

267
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:16,960
 There's a lot of you that would not be in the room tonight

268
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:20,800
 had he called or had she called

269
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,200
 or had any other human being called you

270
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,040
 to ask you to do something tonight.

271
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,920
 You wouldn't be here tonight.

272
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,280
 So by and large, the reputation that's out there,

273
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,920
 20s and 30-somethings, is that they're flaky,

274
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,920
 and here's what we're gonna see tonight, guys.

275
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,040
 Jesus is not okay with that.

276
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,320
 He's not okay with that.

277
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,360
 The second reason why this is such an important message

278
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,720
 for all of us in the room tonight

279
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,880
 is because with every single commitment that we make,

280
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,400
 with every interaction that we have with people,

281
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,960
 what's at stake is not just our calendars.

282
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,800
 What's at stake is our character.

283
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,520
 Every interaction that we have,

284
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,320
 every commitment that we make,

285
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,960
 every time we tell somebody, "I'm going to do that,"

286
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,600
 or, "I'm gonna be there then," or, "I will call you,"

287
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,520
 or, "I will do that," every single commitment that we make,

288
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:13,720
 we are doing one of two things with our character.

289
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,600
 We are either building trust or we are eroding trust.

290
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,680
 We are either gaining credibility

291
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,360
 or we're losing credibility.

292
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,640
 We are either strengthening our reputation

293
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,400
 or we're weakening our reputation.

294
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:34,360
 Every one of those interactions reveals something

295
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:38,320
 about our character, and here's what's so scary

296
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,160
 about being flaky, is that if you're flaky

297
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,760
 or if I'm flaky, we're the last ones to know.

298
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:52,800
 Everybody else knows that we struggle with being flaky.

299
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,160
 Everybody else knows that we struggle keeping our word.

300
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,360
 Everybody, it's blatantly obvious to everybody in our life,

301
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,480
 and we are often the last one to know.

302
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,440
 That's what makes all of this so scary

303
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,960
 and why all of this is so important for us tonight.

304
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,760
 And so tonight, what we're gonna do

305
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,040
 is we're gonna hear what Jesus has to say

306
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,360
 about the commitments that we make.

307
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,240
 And so here's the message tonight.

308
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,600
 It's got three points as we look at this next section

309
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,520
 in the Sermon on the Mount,

310
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,960
 Matthew chapter five, verses 33 through 37.

311
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,560
 We're gonna draw three points out of this tonight.

312
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,840
 Number one, what we're gonna see

313
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,240
 is that every single one of us

314
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,120
 struggles with keeping commitments.

315
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,560
 Number two, we're gonna see

316
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,520
 that we come up with solutions sometimes.

317
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,080
 We come up with these soft commitments,

318
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,920
 and when we come up with these soft commitments,

319
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,160
 they don't help us, they actually condemn us.

320
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,320
 That's what we're gonna see second.

321
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,680
 And then the third thing that we're gonna see

322
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,040
 is that Jesus, Jesus has a solution,

323
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:51,200
 and his solution is for you and I to simply commit.

324
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,880
 And so let's open up our Bibles tonight

325
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:57,360
 and let's read Matthew chapter five, verses 33 through 37.

326
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,360
 And so this section of the Sermon on the Mount,

327
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,280
 what Jesus is doing is he is going through,

328
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,360
 it started a couple weeks ago

329
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,840
 when JP talked about anger and conflict

330
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:09,800
 and what happens when we get into conflict with one another

331
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,200
 and we need to reconcile with one another.

332
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,640
 That started this section in the Sermon on the Mount

333
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:17,360
 where what Jesus is doing is he is taking popular things

334
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,880
 that the Pharisees,

335
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,480
 the Pharisees are these religious professionals of the day.

336
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,280
 These were the ones who were leading

337
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,480
 the religious community.

338
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,640
 They were the ones responsible for teaching Jesus's,

339
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,680
 or excuse me, responsible for teaching God's word.

340
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,000
 The Pharisees had been teaching things,

341
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,840
 and they had been living a certain way,

342
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,760
 and it was not necessarily lining up

343
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,560
 with the original intent of Scripture.

344
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,760
 And so Jesus in this section in Matthew chapter five

345
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,040
 starts saying, "Hey, you've heard that it was said,

346
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,880
 "but I say, you heard that it was said, but I say,

347
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,560
 "you heard that it was said, but I say."

348
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,880
 And last week we looked at what David,

349
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:57,040
 when he was here, looked at the commitment of marriage

350
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,320
 and ended in verse 35, or excuse me, verse 32,

351
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,680
 and here's where we go in verse 33.

352
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,520
 Here's what Jesus says,

353
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,720
 "Again, you've heard that it was said

354
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,000
 "to the people long ago,

355
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,640
 "do not break your oath, but fulfill to the Lord

356
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,240
 "the vows you have made.

357
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,120
 "But I tell you, do not swear an oath at all,

358
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,960
 "either by heaven, for it's God's throne,

359
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,760
 "or by earth, for it's his footstool,

360
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,360
 "or by Jerusalem, for it's the city of the great king.

361
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,640
 "And do not swear by your head,

362
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:24,960
 "for you cannot even make one hair white or black."

363
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:28,680
 All you need to say is simply yes or no.

364
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:33,640
 Anything beyond this comes from the evil one.

365
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,440
 So point number one tonight is that we all struggle

366
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,160
 with commitment, we all struggle with commitment.

367
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,360
 I find it really, you know, it's interesting

368
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,640
 that right after Jesus talked about the commitment

369
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:47,480
 of marriage, that he goes in and he reminds the audience

370
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:51,840
 of what God's word says about keeping our word.

371
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,280
 And so when he starts off here in verse 33,

372
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,360
 "Again, you've heard that it was said

373
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,200
 "to the people long ago,

374
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,000
 "do not break your oath,

375
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,360
 "but fulfill to the Lord the vows you have made."

376
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,760
 I mean, this is not a specific quotation

377
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:08,320
 from any one verse in the Old Testament.

378
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,640
 But it is absolutely a theme that runs all throughout

379
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,080
 the Old Testament, in fact, Jesus here is most likely

380
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:17,200
 summarizing a verse that you can find in Leviticus,

381
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,000
 in Deuteronomy, and Numbers.

382
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,760
 All of which saying the same thing.

383
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:26,360
 God wants you and I to keep our word.

384
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,200
 He wants us to keep our commitments.

385
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,640
 And so why would Jesus start this section with that?

386
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:36,040
 Why would God include in his commands

387
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,880
 that he wants you and I to keep our word?

388
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,440
 Why is it there?

389
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,440
 The reason that it's there is so simple.

390
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,000
 The reason that it's there is because every single

391
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,120
 one of us struggles with this.

392
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,960
 Everybody in the room tonight, at some point in our life,

393
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:55,680
 we are guilty of breaking our word.

394
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,440
 We told somebody we were going to do something

395
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,120
 and we did not do it.

396
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,520
 We told somebody we were gonna be somewhere

397
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,640
 and we did not show up.

398
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:09,840
 What do you call somebody who says they're going

399
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,200
 to do something and they don't do it?

400
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,160
 What do you call somebody who breaks their commitment?

401
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:19,400
 That person is what?

402
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,400
 A liar.

403
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,920
 A liar.

404
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:28,640
 And Jesus is saying, hey, that's not okay.

405
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,640
 That is not okay to be a liar.

406
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,600
 And so we know that we all do this.

407
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,760
 It's not anything that our parents taught us.

408
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,960
 Like I'm sure your parents never sat you down and said,

409
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,880
 hey, here's just like a little tip for life.

410
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,480
 If something's not going your way,

411
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,720
 or if you get caught doing something,

412
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,960
 just say the opposite of what's true.

413
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,600
 Just do that, you know, just tell a lie.

414
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,920
 Like nobody's parents sat down and taught them

415
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:53,760
 how to do this.

416
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,680
 It's just something that just came with all of us.

417
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,880
 It's just there.

418
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,680
 It's like the clock app on your iPhone.

419
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,520
 It just comes with the phone.

420
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,440
 You didn't have to load it.

421
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,400
 It's just there.

422
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:09,000
 And that this ability and this tendency for us to lie,

423
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,920
 it's just there, it's just in us.

424
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,400
 And we know that it's there.

425
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,920
 And so what we try to do sometimes,

426
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,640
 we try to work around it.

427
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,640
 We try to come up with these solutions.

428
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,400
 And so we try to come up with all these like,

429
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,080
 quasi commitments, like kind of committing,

430
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,480
 but not really committing.

431
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,480
 I mean, who hasn't had a conversation,

432
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,160
 something like this.

433
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,120
 So let's imagine this text message conversation.

434
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,920
 So let's imagine that I'm texting with my friend Daniel.

435
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,840
 And so I text him, I said, "Hey man, you know, Ant-Man,

436
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:41,120
 "next Friday, 9.30 at North Park, you in?"

437
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:46,160
 Daniel texts, "Ooh, probs."

438
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,160
 (audience laughing)

439
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:56,240
 Anybody, yeah, that means probably.

440
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,600
 These text speak stuff.

441
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,160
 Okay, so anyway.

442
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,960
 So then I text him back, "Sweet, I'm on Fandango right now.

443
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,600
 "You want me to buy two tix and you can pay me back?"

444
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,840
 Wait for him to text back and he texts back,

445
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,640
 "Yeah, most likely, fist bump."

446
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,640
 (audience laughing)

447
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,600
 Right back, okay.

448
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,120
 So should I buy two?

449
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,720
 I should buy two or I shouldn't?

450
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,000
 Wait.

451
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,880
 I think you could probably get two.

452
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,880
 (audience laughing)

453
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:33,880
 Write him back.

454
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,040
 "Help me out, bro, is that a yes or a no?

455
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:39,080
 "'Cause I'm not getting all your little speak here

456
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,960
 "right now, okay?"

457
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,360
 So I sit there, text that, and then what happens?

458
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,640
 (audience laughing)

459
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,920
 All right, he's thinking about it.

460
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,520
 Then what happens?

461
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,360
 Ah.

462
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,120
 (audience laughing)

463
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,320
 But then what happens?

464
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,840
 It comes back, all right, maybe.

465
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,160
 (audience laughing)

466
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,560
 But then what happens?

467
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,400
 Ah.

468
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,200
 And I gotta go to Ant-Man by myself.

469
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,840
 It's just weird to go and do that.

470
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,040
 I mean, we all do this, man.

471
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,840
 We know we've got this problem.

472
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,120
 We know we've got this problem,

473
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,640
 and so we come up with these solutions.

474
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,080
 We try to soften our commitments.

475
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,440
 And what Jesus is reminding us is,

476
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,120
 hey, when you say you're gonna do something,

477
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,400
 do it, be clear.

478
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,800
 If you don't keep your commitments, you're a liar.

479
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:29,680
 If you don't keep your commitments,

480
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,800
 you're damaging your reputation.

481
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,760
 You're not building it, you're not strengthening it,

482
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,560
 you're eroding it.

483
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,000
 Our solution, it's insufficient.

484
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,160
 So point one, we all struggle with this.

485
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,680
 And then look where he goes next, point two.

486
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,240
 These soft commitments that we make, they condemn us.

487
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,880
 And so what we know about the Pharisees,

488
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,080
 these religious professionals,

489
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,880
 is that there seems to be this indication

490
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,680
 that they knew too that they were lying.

491
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,440
 They knew too that they were liars.

492
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,760
 They knew that they struggled to keep their commitments.

493
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,000
 But they also knew that there were times

494
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,600
 where they really were telling the truth.

495
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,400
 And so for those times where they were telling the truth,

496
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,840
 what they decided to do was,

497
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,760
 hey, when we're really telling the truth,

498
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,840
 we need to somehow call on some sort of outside source

499
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,480
 to bring some validation to our words.

500
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,560
 And so what the Pharisees had done is they developed

501
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,640
 what they thought was this great system,

502
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,160
 this great solution where they created this complex system

503
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,360
 of oaths and swearing.

504
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:29,040
 And swearing not like cuss words,

505
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,120
 like swearing like I swear to God,

506
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,080
 I'm really gonna do that, or I swear to God,

507
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,640
 I'm telling the truth right now.

508
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,440
 But they also understood that if they swore to God

509
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,520
 and then didn't follow through,

510
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,600
 that not only would that look bad on their character,

511
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,680
 it'd also look bad on God's character.

512
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,200
 And so they seemed to understand this,

513
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,160
 and so they developed this complex system

514
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,920
 and their calling on all of these things,

515
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:53,200
 but they decided, hey, let's leave God out of it.

516
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,600
 So when we're really telling the truth,

517
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:58,760
 let's do something like, let's swear to heaven,

518
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,800
 or let's swear to earth,

519
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:04,480
 or let's swear to the city of Jerusalem,

520
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,120
 or I know that if we wanna leave all of those things out,

521
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,520
 let's just swear by the hairs on our head.

522
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,080
 And Jesus is going, no, listen, that system does not work.

523
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,440
 That's not the solution.

524
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,160
 Look at what he says here, verse 34.

525
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:20,640
 "But I tell you, do not swear an oath at all."

526
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,840
 Don't try to call on these things from outside

527
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,680
 to bring validity to your statements.

528
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:31,480
 Either by heaven, because that's God's throne,

529
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,800
 or by earth, 'cause that's his footstool,

530
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,720
 or by Jerusalem, for it's the city of the great king,

531
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,000
 and don't swear by your head,

532
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,760
 for you can't even make one hair white or black.

533
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,960
 What the Pharisees thought they could do

534
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,640
 is if they kept God out of it,

535
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,740
 if they swore by all these other things,

536
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:50,200
 that maybe, maybe they were hiding their words from God.

537
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:54,080
 And Jesus is going, that's ridiculous.

538
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:54,920
 Heaven?

539
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:58,600
 Like, that's God's throne, he's there.

540
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,280
 Earth?

541
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,920
 That's his footstool, he's there.

542
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,660
 Jerusalem?

543
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:07,540
 That's the city of the great king, he's there.

544
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:09,240
 Oh, you think you own your head?

545
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:14,280
 You can't even change the color of your hair.

546
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:19,280
 What makes you think that somehow that is hiding from God?

547
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:24,080
 And there's this part of me that looks at this

548
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,880
 that wants to like cross my arms

549
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,920
 and just kind of shake my head at those Pharisees

550
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,360
 and go, man, they're so ridiculous.

551
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,800
 Did they really think, did they really think

552
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:36,260
 that they were gonna be able to hide from God?

553
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:38,600
 Did they really think if they developed a system of oaths

554
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,480
 to try to bring some validation to their statements

555
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,740
 that somehow people were gonna start to believe them

556
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:44,580
 because of that?

557
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,160
 I wanna sit there and I wanna point a finger

558
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,520
 and I wanna shake a head at them

559
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,140
 and then I just realize, you know what?

560
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:53,240
 We do the exact same thing.

561
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:57,800
 I mean, tell me, how many of us in this room tonight

562
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:02,800
 haven't heard these words or used these words

563
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,760
 at some point in our interactions with others?

564
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:10,240
 We too, we've developed this complex system of oaths

565
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,700
 where we, or swearing, where we try to call

566
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:15,840
 on outside sources to bring validity to our statements

567
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,420
 when we're really telling the truth.

568
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,260
 I mean, who hasn't said something like this

569
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,380
 or started a sentence like this?

570
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,220
 No lie.

571
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:25,840
 No lie.

572
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,700
 Tony Romo, he was at BuzzBrues last night, I saw him.

573
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:29,540
 No lie.

574
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:33,360
 You sit there and you hear that and you go, no lie?

575
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,620
 Like, that's not helping, dude.

576
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:38,660
 Does that mean everything else you say is a lie?

577
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:41,220
 But right now is no lie?

578
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:44,000
 So I can trust about 19% of what you say

579
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,840
 is what you're saying.

580
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,020
 You always gotta have that no lie.

581
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:48,860
 Or says this, who puts this out there?

582
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:49,700
 Seriously.

583
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:55,940
 Seriously, the best meal I've ever had right there.

584
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:56,780
 Seriously.

585
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:58,180
 Or who has this one?

586
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:01,280
 In this one we say very deliberately,

587
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,460
 I am not even kidding.

588
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:08,300
 If she posts another picture of her dog

589
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:13,860
 on Instagram, I'm not only unfollowing her on Instagram,

590
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,340
 I'm unfollowing her in life.

591
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:17,340
 Like, that's it, I'm done.

592
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:20,020
 If I see another picture of Bojangles the Chihuahua

593
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:22,460
 out there, I'm done with all of this.

594
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:23,580
 Or this one.

595
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,460
 I promise.

596
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:27,840
 Promise, my roommate.

597
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,940
 They eat Chipotle every day, I promise.

598
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,340
 Every day, they're gonna turn into one.

599
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:33,580
 Or this one, this is one of my favorite ones.

600
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:37,700
 Maybe this one when we cross the arms.

601
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,500
 Like, let me be honest with you.

602
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:44,220
 Like, as a dude, you use too many emoticons when you text.

603
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:45,500
 All right, I just wanna be honest with you.

604
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,020
 It's weird.

605
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:47,860
 It's weird.

606
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:51,420
 Just learn how to use, like, letters, okay?

607
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:53,940
 And here's my favorite one.

608
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,600
 My favorite one.

609
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,460
 This is the one, like, that we use the most

610
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:59,620
 where we're calling on this to try to bring

611
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:00,980
 some validity to our statement.

612
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,140
 You know what it is?

613
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,920
 Literally.

614
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:08,740
 Or maybe if there's, like, a lot of emphasis,

615
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,580
 it's literally.

616
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,460
 Like, there's, like, a chuh in there.

617
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:15,280
 Literally.

618
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:18,020
 And then that, which is clue for what is about

619
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:20,540
 to be said next is a wild exaggeration.

620
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:26,360
 Literally, that is the cutest outfit in the world.

621
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:29,740
 I know all outfits and I know everybody in the world

622
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:30,580
 and you've got it.

623
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:31,700
 That is the cutest one.

624
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:34,080
 Just yesterday.

625
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:38,180
 Yesterday, I was driving around listening to these guys

626
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:41,860
 on Sports Talk and they were talking back and forth

627
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:43,580
 about the Fourth of July.

628
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,260
 And one of the guys, they were saying, you know,

629
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:47,340
 hey, do you like going to the fireworks?

630
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:48,180
 And one of the guys was like,

631
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:50,060
 this may be the most un-American thing I've ever said.

632
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:51,940
 No, I don't like going to fireworks.

633
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:55,100
 Which, by the way, side point, I concur, I agree.

634
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,260
 I think they're way overrated.

635
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,280
 But anyway, so.

636
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:01,280
 But I cheered for US in World Cup soccer, all right?

637
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,940
 So does that make up for it?

638
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,460
 Okay, anyway, so.

639
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:05,540
 He sat there and he was like,

640
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,900
 so you don't like going to see fireworks?

641
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:07,740
 Like, why?

642
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:08,900
 Why don't you like to see fireworks?

643
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,980
 And this grown man, he said this, he goes,

644
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:13,200
 I don't like going to fireworks because they're so loud

645
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,820
 and when it gets loud, it literally scares

646
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:15,760
 the crap out of me.

647
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:22,380
 And I'm like, dude, like, so you're at the fireworks.

648
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:23,580
 Boom!

649
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:24,420
 Ooh.

650
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:28,860
 I gotta go, man, I gotta go.

651
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:36,020
 Man, we do this.

652
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:38,260
 Our solutions, our solutions.

653
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:41,180
 Like, we understand that because we all know

654
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:42,420
 that we're guilty of lying,

655
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:44,620
 we all know that we're guilty of not keeping our word,

656
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:45,660
 but we all know there's times

657
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:48,380
 where we really are being serious.

658
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,220
 And we've done the exact same thing the Pharisees have done.

659
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:52,440
 We're calling on these outside sources

660
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,120
 to try to bring validity.

661
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:57,720
 And it's not a solution.

662
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,140
 It's not a solution.

663
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:04,020
 It doesn't build our reputation, it damages it.

664
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,580
 And so we all struggle.

665
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:10,600
 Our solutions and these soft commitments,

666
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,020
 they don't help us, they condemn us.

667
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:13,560
 And this third point is this.

668
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:16,520
 Jesus has a solution.

669
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:20,180
 He's got something to say about this

670
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:22,900
 and he's got a solution and it's not complicated.

671
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:26,260
 It's incredibly simple.

672
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:29,660
 It's not easy, but it's incredibly simple.

673
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:32,420
 And so here's what he says in verse 37.

674
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:37,940
 All, all you need to say,

675
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:42,940
 all you need to say is simply yes or no.

676
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:45,060
 That's it.

677
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:51,240
 Anything else, anything beyond this,

678
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:54,380
 if you try to add anything else to your statements,

679
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:58,600
 that's not helping you, that's condemning you.

680
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,420
 That doesn't show that you're a person that can be trusted.

681
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:03,440
 That shows that you're a person who struggles

682
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,300
 with keeping your commitments.

683
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:10,560
 Anything beyond this comes from the evil one.

684
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:14,780
 And so Jesus is basically saying,

685
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:19,780
 hey, if you want, if you want to build credibility,

686
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:21,740
 if you want to have a reputation

687
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:26,020
 of being somebody who's trustworthy, don't lie.

688
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,100
 Keep your commitment.

689
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:33,060
 When you say you're gonna do something, just do it.

690
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:37,560
 If you said you're gonna call them back,

691
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,960
 you call them back.

692
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,040
 If you said you're gonna go to the birthday party,

693
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,800
 you go to the birthday party.

694
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,640
 If you told somebody you're gonna turn in the assignment

695
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:49,880
 at 8 a.m. on Friday, you turn it in at 8 a.m. on Friday.

696
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,480
 When you tell a story, you tell it accurately.

697
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,740
 If you said you were gonna do something, you do it.

698
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,140
 That's Jesus' solution.

699
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:02,480
 Jesus would say, don't call on all these things

700
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,280
 to try to bring validation to your statements.

701
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:10,640
 Let your reputation be all the validation you need.

702
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,720
 That's the solution.

703
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:16,400
 And so before we close, I wanna share with you guys

704
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,640
 three ways that I think that you and I tonight,

705
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,760
 like we can start to apply these things,

706
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:23,520
 three ways that we can take these principles

707
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,320
 from this passage and apply it to our life

708
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:28,320
 right now and in the way that we interact with others

709
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:32,240
 so that you and I can grow to be people

710
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,440
 who are trustworthy, people who keep our word.

711
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,280
 And so there's three of 'em.

712
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,320
 I'm gonna put 'em up here on the screen.

713
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,440
 The first one is this, is that we need to be clear

714
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,280
 with our intentions, be clear with our intentions.

715
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,560
 Because here's one thing I've noticed,

716
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:46,760
 is that a lot of us, I think we get ourselves into trouble

717
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:49,760
 when we just start just kinda talking.

718
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,320
 We start dreaming, we start talking about the future,

719
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,920
 we start talking about what we're gonna do,

720
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:56,520
 and what we end up doing is inadvertently,

721
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:59,120
 we end up making commitments for ourself

722
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,880
 that we never intended to make.

723
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,280
 And so for example, growing up in my household,

724
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:07,720
 we have what we call in my family,

725
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:10,560
 my dad and the Disney World incident.

726
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,520
 And so from like as far as I can remember,

727
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,320
 as far back as I can remember, when I was real little,

728
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,560
 my dad just started promising

729
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,600
 that he was gonna take us to Disney World.

730
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,640
 I'm gonna take you to Disney World,

731
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,480
 take you to Disney World.

732
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,600
 My brother, sister and I, maybe this year,

733
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,840
 I'm gonna take you guys to Disney World,

734
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,680
 take you to Disney World.

735
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,920
 I'm gonna take you to Disney World.

736
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,120
 Years go by, we're not going to Disney World.

737
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,320
 My dad finally took us to Disney World.

738
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,640
 You know how old I was?

739
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,760
 17.

740
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,240
 (audience laughing)

741
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,440
 It's like the most uncool age to go to Disney World.

742
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,080
 But he made good on it, and actually it was a lot of fun.

743
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:45,400
 But what we ended up, what really happened is that my dad,

744
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:49,520
 it really damaged his credibility in our family.

745
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,920
 Because when he would make other promises,

746
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,080
 we would say, oh, is this like a Disney World

747
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,440
 you're gonna take us to ice cream,

748
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,640
 or a real you're gonna take us to ice cream?

749
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,520
 Like, what is this?

750
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,480
 And all my dad needed to do,

751
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,960
 all he needed to do is he just needed

752
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,480
 to be clear with his intention.

753
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:08,600
 And just go, hey guys, I would love,

754
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,480
 I'd love to take you guys to Disney World one day,

755
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,920
 if I could.

756
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,280
 I don't know if we'll be able to,

757
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,720
 I don't know if we're gonna have the money to do it,

758
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,400
 but just know in my heart, I would love.

759
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,360
 I think that would be a lot of fun.

760
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,880
 I'd love to do that.

761
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,240
 He would've just been clear with his intentions.

762
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:26,080
 Now let me just talk to the guys in the room for a second,

763
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,440
 because if there's something that maybe

764
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,240
 one of the genders struggles with a little bit more,

765
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,000
 I think us guys, we struggle with this one

766
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,840
 a little bit more than the ladies do.

767
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,520
 Because we're just like, we're out there,

768
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,920
 we're dreamers, we're leaders,

769
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,840
 and we're just talking about what we're gonna conquer

770
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:41,760
 and what we're gonna do.

771
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,480
 And we, a lot of times, we are the ones

772
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,920
 who will get ourselves into a situation

773
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:49,080
 committed to something that we never intended

774
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,520
 to get ourselves committed to.

775
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,920
 And we'll say things that we have no intention

776
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,400
 of ever backing up or ever doing,

777
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,640
 and things that we really can't back up.

778
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,280
 And so guys, you in particular need to be

779
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,800
 very, very careful with this,

780
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,880
 because here's how this is gonna go down.

781
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,720
 You're gonna be dating someone

782
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:09,680
 for like five or six weeks in a row.

783
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:13,000
 (congregation laughing)

784
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,520
 And you're gonna have all kinds of these

785
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,800
 emotional ooey-gooey feelings going on,

786
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:21,200
 and you're gonna be like, this is so different.

787
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,200
 (congregation laughing)

788
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,720
 Never met anybody like her.

789
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:30,720
 And one night, you're gonna go out on a date,

790
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,960
 you're gonna take her to her door,

791
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,120
 and you're gonna be so nervous,

792
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,040
 not because it's like, are you gonna kiss her or not,

793
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,400
 'cause you're still in the handshake,

794
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,600
 side hug stage of the relationship,

795
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,960
 so you're good with that.

796
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,720
 But you really wanna communicate to her

797
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,720
 what you're feeling.

798
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,160
 So you're gonna look at her,

799
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,680
 and you're gonna get all this gumption up,

800
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,520
 and you're gonna look at her,

801
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,120
 and you're gonna go, baby,

802
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:58,640
 I love you.

803
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:05,280
 And I am never, ever, ever, ever, ever gonna hurt you.

804
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:10,560
 She's gonna look at you and just be like, oh my God.

805
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:14,240
 (congregation laughing)

806
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,880
 I cannot wait to journal about this tonight.

807
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,800
 (congregation laughing)

808
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,200
 This lady in waiting is almost done.

809
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,540
 (congregation laughing)

810
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:33,240
 Then like two weeks later, she's gonna start annoying you.

811
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:36,200
 (congregation laughing)

812
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,200
 And you're gonna go, and at the end of the day,

813
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,800
 you're gonna be like, you're so,

814
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:44,640
 just talking to the guys in my community group, and,

815
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,880
 (congregation laughing)

816
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,240
 I think you're becoming an idol for me.

817
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,640
 (congregation laughing)

818
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,960
 I don't even really know what that means,

819
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:58,940
 but I think that's what you're doing, and so like,

820
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:04,040
 so I think you're becoming, I mean, it's more me than you.

821
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,720
 I mean, it's a little bit you, but it's a lot of me,

822
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:08,840
 and so like, we're breaking up.

823
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:09,680
 We're done.

824
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:14,200
 She's gonna look at you, and she's gonna go.

825
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,080
 So this is love?

826
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,880
 This, this is love?

827
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:24,040
 You taking your hand and ripping my heart out,

828
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:27,600
 and squeezing it, and then putting it in a vice,

829
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,920
 and turning it, and then putting it in a blender,

830
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:34,320
 and pulsing it, and then pouring it down the drain,

831
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:38,520
 and putting the garbage disposal, like this is love?

832
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:41,200
 I don't know about you, but this hurts,

833
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,880
 and you said you were never gonna hurt me.

834
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:47,520
 You're a liar, and she'd be right.

835
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:51,200
 You can't back those words up, man.

836
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,680
 You cannot back those up.

837
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:58,000
 You've got to be careful what you get yourself into,

838
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,920
 all of us, guys and girls.

839
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:02,360
 We gotta be clear with our intentions.

840
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:05,520
 We gotta telegraph all of that, and so number two,

841
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:09,800
 number two practical thing, and how we can do this,

842
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,120
 and how we can live this out, number, it's this,

843
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,600
 is that if we've made a commitment,

844
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:17,880
 if we've made a commitment, and then something happens,

845
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,720
 and let's be honest, always,

846
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:22,720
 there's often something that happens.

847
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:25,200
 I mean, James is very clear in James chapter one,

848
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:29,400
 that when we, we don't know what tomorrow is going to bring,

849
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,440
 and so if you make a commitment for the future,

850
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,920
 there's things that happen,

851
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:36,520
 circumstances change that are legitimate,

852
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:39,880
 that will cause us that if we've made a commitment,

853
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:40,720
 and something happens,

854
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:42,640
 that we need to get out of that commitment,

855
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:45,760
 but even in that situation, when we've made a commitment,

856
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,080
 and we're gonna have trouble keeping it,

857
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,240
 there's still a way to get out of that,

858
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:53,040
 that's not gonna erode your credibility.

859
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,400
 There's a way to do that, that will do the opposite,

860
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,920
 it'll build your credibility,

861
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,640
 and I'll illustrate what you do this way.

862
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,400
 Let's say for your birthday, I bought you a watch,

863
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,800
 and I gave you a watch,

864
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,920
 and then let's say something happens in my life,

865
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,680
 a circumstance changes in my life,

866
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,640
 where I need that watch back,

867
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:14,760
 say my iPhone breaks, and I have no clue what time it is,

868
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:18,720
 and I need that watch back, all right?

869
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,240
 How do I get that watch back, what do I have to do?

870
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:24,080
 If I want that watch back, what I have to do,

871
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:27,480
 is I have to ask you for the watch back.

872
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,200
 I don't break into your apartment,

873
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:33,640
 and just find out where it is, and just take it back,

874
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,160
 I don't wanna see you shake your hand,

875
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,080
 and be like, oh, that watch, yeah,

876
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,240
 and just take it off your wrist,

877
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,600
 and be like, my phone broke, what are you talking about?

878
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,520
 I need this back.

879
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,960
 We don't demand it back, what you have to do,

880
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,920
 is you have to ask for it back.

881
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:47,640
 And so when we break our,

882
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:50,600
 when there is a commitment that we've made,

883
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,960
 and we need to break it, this is what we need to do,

884
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,960
 and this is going to be profound, listen to this,

885
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,320
 this is gonna be profound, and if you do this,

886
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,840
 it's gonna change your life, literally.

887
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:04,640
 (congregation laughing)

888
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:08,480
 Here's what you do, if you've made a commitment to somebody,

889
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,600
 and you need to break it,

890
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,080
 you handle it the exact same way with that watch analogy,

891
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:13,920
 what do you do?

892
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:18,400
 You don't demand for it, you have to ask to be released,

893
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,280
 and the reason you have to ask for it,

894
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,280
 is because what you gave, when you made that commitment,

895
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,640
 you gave somebody a gift, and what you gave them,

896
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,760
 is you gave them the gift of your time,

897
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:29,520
 and if you're breaking that commitment,

898
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:33,260
 you have to ask for that gift back.

899
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:37,920
 You call 'em up, you go down the office,

900
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:41,840
 you go to your apartment, you go wherever it is,

901
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:44,040
 you talk to them, and you go, hey listen,

902
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:47,960
 I told you that would be done at 8 a.m. on Friday,

903
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,640
 you give them the legitimate reason

904
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:50,920
 why it's not gonna get done,

905
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:54,600
 you don't make up an excuse, like something came up,

906
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,840
 and you say, I am not gonna be able to meet that commitment,

907
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,200
 can I have that time back?

908
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,600
 You say, hey, I know I told you Saturday,

909
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,680
 I was gonna drive you to the airport,

910
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:09,520
 but my sister is sick, and she needs me to watch her kids,

911
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,720
 can I please have that commitment back?

912
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,920
 You ask for it back, you don't demand it back.

913
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:20,560
 If we need to break our commitments,

914
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:24,200
 there's a way to do it, where we're building our credibility

915
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,160
 and I'm telling you what guys,

916
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,080
 you get in enough of those conversations,

917
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,320
 where you have to ask for that back,

918
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,720
 enough of those awkward conversations,

919
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:30,840
 you get in enough of those,

920
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,080
 what you're gonna start to do,

921
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,880
 is you're gonna go back to practical idea number one,

922
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,560
 you're gonna start to really be careful

923
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,600
 about what you actually commit to,

924
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:43,000
 but there's a way that you can do that,

925
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,360
 where you're not gonna be losing credibility,

926
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,400
 you're gaining it, and so if you've made a commitment,

927
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:50,920
 and you need to break it, you just ask for the time back,

928
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:53,080
 and the third is this,

929
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:57,160
 let's say you've made a commitment and you just broke it,

930
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,720
 and you didn't ask for it back,

931
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:03,560
 there's still a way, there's still a way to handle that,

932
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,720
 that's building credibility, not losing credibility,

933
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:08,320
 and what you do, is you talk to the person,

934
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:12,800
 and you ask them to forgive you,

935
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:17,400
 you call them, you go see them,

936
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,800
 you say, hey, I know I told you,

937
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,920
 I told you I was gonna be at your party Friday,

938
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,000
 and here's what happened, I got out of work late,

939
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,240
 this crazy deadline popped up, I got out of work late,

940
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:30,040
 I was hungry, by the time I got food, it was 9.30,

941
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,680
 I knew that your party started at eight,

942
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,600
 I thought it was gonna be over, I was exhausted,

943
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,080
 and so I just chose to go to sleep,

944
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,520
 and I know I told you that I would be there,

945
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:42,080
 and I didn't show up, will you forgive me?

946
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:46,800
 So you're careful, be clear with your intentions,

947
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,400
 if you made a commitment, you need to be released,

948
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,760
 you ask to be released from that commitment,

949
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:53,120
 and if you've made a commitment and you broke it,

950
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:57,800
 you ask to be forgiven, that's building credibility,

951
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:01,120
 that's strengthening our reputation,

952
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,320
 that's honoring God,

953
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:08,560
 that's living by our word.

954
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:12,880
 So that landlord, he called me that night,

955
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,440
 and was just saying, hey, you told me,

956
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,840
 you told me you were gonna sign the lease,

957
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,080
 you told me you were gonna sign the lease,

958
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,320
 you told me you were gonna sign the lease,

959
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:22,320
 and I was finally like, you know what, you're right, I did,

960
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:25,720
 let me talk to my wife about it,

961
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:26,800
 and let me call you tomorrow,

962
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,800
 and so I hung up the phone and sat down with Jackie,

963
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,400
 and I was like, hey, I told him,

964
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:36,000
 I told him that we would do this,

965
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,040
 and I know that we're legally covered right now,

966
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:44,640
 but being legally covered doesn't feel like good enough,

967
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,360
 being legally covered right now doesn't feel like

968
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:51,400
 that's the most God-honoring thing to do in this situation,

969
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,320
 and so we both talked about it, we both agreed,

970
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,240
 we both felt conviction

971
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:57,160
 over the way we had handled that situation,

972
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,520
 and we said, here's what we need to do,

973
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,040
 we need to sign the lease,

974
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:02,200
 and we need to make it very clear to the landlord,

975
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:05,640
 for the next 12 months, we are obligated to make sure

976
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:09,040
 that you are paid your fair rent for the next 12 months,

977
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,960
 so we signed the lease, and we told him,

978
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,600
 said, hey, I know that the way we've handled this

979
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:17,200
 has not been, or has been confusing,

980
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,840
 it's been frustrating to you, it's hurt you,

981
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,560
 thank you for telling us this,

982
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:24,560
 thank you for letting us know how confusing this has been,

983
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,560
 will you forgive us, and he was kind, and he forgave us,

984
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:31,600
 I said, we're on the line, he said, great,

985
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:34,200
 after that transaction was settled,

986
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:37,640
 then I went back to him, and I said, now, here's the deal,

987
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:41,120
 can we, I'm not gonna demand it, I'm asking,

988
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:43,480
 is there something we can work out?

989
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:46,560
 If we go find somebody, or if we put a sign in the yard,

990
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,360
 and we do the showings, like, if it's okay,

991
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,000
 if we go find you another tenant,

992
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:50,840
 will you be okay with that,

993
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:53,280
 if you go find me another tenant, I'll be okay with that,

994
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,960
 and we talked to a couple friends,

995
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,240
 we had some friends that were looking to move,

996
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,360
 and our friends moved in there,

997
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,440
 and they stayed there two years,

998
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,360
 and they found some friends to move in there,

999
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:03,160
 and stay two years, and it all, it ended up,

1000
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,760
 financially, it ended up all working out,

1001
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:09,200
 but relationally, relationally, it hurt.

1002
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:13,560
 And handling that situation,

1003
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:16,120
 I mean, even though we were okay legally,

1004
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:18,000
 it still didn't feel like the right thing to do,

1005
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,600
 just to leave him out there when we had given him our word,

1006
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,760
 and so, what Jackie and I decided to do was,

1007
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,640
 hey, let's handle this the right way.

1008
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,640
 And it cost us something, it cost us a lot of stress,

1009
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:33,080
 it cost us a lot of late night conversations,

1010
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:37,040
 it cost us money, but in the end,

1011
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:41,920
 in the end, our reputation was worth it,

1012
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,120
 and it was worth it to do the right thing.

1013
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:49,480
 And here's why, guys, I'm so excited about this.

1014
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:52,320
 The reason I'm so excited about this,

1015
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,680
 and what Jesus is saying tonight,

1016
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,280
 in this section of the sermon on the cross,

1017
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,440
 in the sermon on the mount we're looking at,

1018
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:59,360
 is that if you and I do this, if we do this,

1019
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,880
 if we become people of our word,

1020
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:04,440
 if we say we're gonna do something and we do it,

1021
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,560
 it's going to change the city,

1022
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,520
 and here's why it's gonna change the city,

1023
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:11,000
 because at the foundation of our faith,

1024
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:15,040
 at the foundation of our faith is the God of the universe,

1025
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,760
 and one of the prevailing characteristics

1026
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:20,240
 of the God of the universe is that he is faithful,

1027
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,920
 that he is trustworthy,

1028
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:24,920
 that he is a God who keeps commitments,

1029
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:28,680
 and this God of the universe, this faithful God,

1030
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:32,320
 this God that never backs down on his word

1031
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:35,400
 has given every single one of us who follow him a job,

1032
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:38,120
 and that job is to go and to be salt and light

1033
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:42,360
 in this city, and here's what we know to be true.

1034
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:45,120
 There's a bunch of people in this city

1035
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:48,000
 that do not trust God,

1036
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,800
 and one of the primary reasons that they do not trust God

1037
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:54,880
 is because they've met Christians and they don't trust them.

1038
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:58,960
 They see Christians that just say a bunch of stuff

1039
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:01,000
 and Christians that say they're gonna do one thing

1040
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:01,840
 and then they don't do it,

1041
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,920
 Christians that are out there just living for themselves

1042
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,880
 and selfishly and not keeping their commitments,

1043
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:08,760
 and they're sitting there and it just looks just like them

1044
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,160
 and all their other friends,

1045
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,520
 and they're going, yeah, yeah, like,

1046
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:14,760
 really, like, you want me to trust you

1047
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,120
 who can't be trusted for anything?

1048
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:18,400
 Like, you want me to trust you

1049
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:21,480
 about this God of the universe that loves me?

1050
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:25,080
 Sure, you look just like me.

1051
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:29,960
 And the other thing we know is this, guys,

1052
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:33,320
 is that we know is that when people do trust God,

1053
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:39,360
 they often trust a Christian first before they trust Christ.

1054
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:42,840
 I mean, all of us in here, I bet that's part of our story.

1055
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:44,080
 If we came to know Jesus,

1056
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:47,400
 it was because we trusted somebody else first,

1057
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:50,360
 then we trusted the claims of Christ.

1058
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:55,400
 And so we have this unbelievable opportunity

1059
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,480
 to go out there and to be salt and light

1060
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:00,440
 and to implore people to trust God.

1061
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:04,800
 And it's gonna be really, really difficult for us

1062
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,120
 to be salt and light if we cannot be people

1063
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,960
 who are trustworthy.

1064
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,440
 So we get to go out there

1065
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,200
 and we have this unbelievable opportunity

1066
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:16,800
 to represent this God who keeps commitments.

1067
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,880
 And when we do this, when we do this,

1068
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:23,640
 they will see a genuineness, a trustworthiness,

1069
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:28,240
 an authenticity in our lives that will point not to us,

1070
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,040
 but point to our Savior.

1071
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:34,600
 Your word matters.

1072
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:35,600
 It matters.

1073
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:39,080
 Let's pray.

1074
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:40,000
 God, we thank you.

1075
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:46,440
 We thank you, Lord, that you have kept your word with us.

1076
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:48,840
 That you have not left us alone,

1077
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:52,400
 that you have seen the predicament that we're in

1078
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,960
 and that the actions that we have engaged in

1079
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:59,280
 that has caused separation between us.

1080
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:04,440
 And you promised way back in the garden,

1081
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:05,920
 you promised that you were gonna do something

1082
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:07,880
 about this issue of sin and you followed through

1083
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:10,280
 and you sent your son Jesus and we are grateful.

1084
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:14,600
 God, we don't wanna be flaky people.

1085
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:16,360
 We don't wanna be people who are,

1086
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:18,640
 quite honestly, just normal.

1087
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:26,240
 We understand that it's not just our reputation

1088
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,200
 that's at stake with being people of your word.

1089
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,280
 What's at stake is ultimately your reputation.

1090
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:32,080
 The Pharisee's got that right, Lord.

1091
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:38,040
 So Lord, we come to you tonight and we beg you for help.

1092
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:42,440
 Will you help all of us to be people of our word?

1093
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:46,040
 That our yes will be yes and our no will be no.

1094
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:48,760
 Will you help us?

1095
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:50,960
 And we ask this in Jesus' name, amen.

1096
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:51,800
 Amen.

1097
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:52,960
 - Yeah. - Cool.
