[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:28.640]   >> Porch, how we doing? You doing all right? Hey, it's great to be back. It's great to see you.
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.960]   So glad you're here. Thanks for making the time to join us this evening. Not just those of you that
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.200]   are here in the room, though, it's so good to be with you. A special shout out to Porch Live
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.280]   and all of our locations that are tuning in, especially Porch Live Springfield,
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.600]   Porch Live Des Moines, and Porch Live Fresno. Can we give it up for Porch Live, everybody?
[00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:52.160]   It's great to be together. Hey, well, just two weeks ago today, my life got flipped upside down
[00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:59.200]   because on November 5th at 2.06 p.m., coming in at eight pounds and eight ounces, mine and
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.840]   Brooke Perry's very firstborn son, Cass Levi Perry, came into the world.
[00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:14.480]   Text over stripes, am I right? The guy looks good. It's so on brand that we would have a Tuesday baby
[00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:20.480]   that he would show up, and I'm so grateful to TA that he would be a pinch hitter for me. He would
[00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:26.160]   show up and he would bless our room. Now, I don't know if you've ever been on the fence about raising
[00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:32.080]   kids, but take it from somebody that's been at it for two weeks. I recommend it. I recommend it. I
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.840]   think it's certainly worth the commitment should the day ever come that you can do so. And I say
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:44.880]   that as somebody that's not ever been one that's totally infatuated with the idea of having a whole
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.520]   household full of kids. Like, I'm not the guy that thought, "Man, I can't wait to have a harem full
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.720]   of kids." Like, that's not what I was looking for. I knew I wanted to have a big family, came from a
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:02:04.000]   big family, and yet I knew what it would cost me to have a son. Like, I was under no presupposition
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.600]   that it would not cost me something. I knew that I was going to be giving up an immense amount of
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.360]   sleep. I knew that we'd be spending a lot of money on all the latest baby gear. And I also knew that
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:23.520]   I would be just piled up with pounds of dirty diapers. I knew it would cost me a lot. And what
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.160]   I also knew is that this little guy wasn't going to contribute anything to our house. Like, he
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.160]   wasn't going to offer to pay the bills. He wasn't going to offer to pick up around the place. I knew
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.800]   that he wasn't going to agree to try and clean up his own mess. Instead, he was going to rely upon
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:42.400]   us to do that. In fact, he really hasn't been pulling his weight at all to this point. And yet,
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.960]   despite knowing all of this beforehand and realizing it every single day since,
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:55.520]   I'm totally enchanted with the kid. Like, I love him. Like, I'm mesmerized by the fact that he's
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:02.080]   mine and he's Brooks, that he is made in our image, that he is from God for us. Like, I'm blown away
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:09.760]   by the fact that he is my child. Like, I didn't realize just how wonderful it would be, just how
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.800]   captivated I'd feel, just how mesmerized I would find myself sitting on the couch and just looking
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.840]   at him and just staring at him, just waiting for him to do the next thing. And yet, that has been
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:26.320]   my reality. Like, I am nonetheless totally enchanted with this kid. I am wholeheartedly,
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:32.720]   totally, undeniably in love with the little guy. Now, what's happened to me over the course of the
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:43.840]   last two weeks is I've had a revelation that the way I love my son, it's an accurate reflection of
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:52.000]   how we should love Jesus. Like, we should be totally enchanted with him. Like, absolutely
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.520]   mesmerized, like captivated, gripped, arrested by the fact that you're mine. Like, I get to have you
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:11.040]   forever. And yet, what happens is we realize what it costs us. And now it doesn't pound up in piles
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.760]   of dirty diapers, but it does look like inconveniences in life, troubles that may be ahead,
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:21.280]   some cost will incur in the eyes of other people as we walk with Jesus. And what happens along the
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:28.160]   way is our enchantment is replaced with disenchantment. It becomes disillusionment.
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.960]   It even becomes discouragement to walk with him any longer.
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:43.600]   It shouldn't feel that way. Like, that's what's hit me over the last two weeks. Like, I realized
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:49.520]   if all of this is true, like if Jesus really is wonderfully enchanting and he is totally
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:54.800]   mesmerizing and he captivates the hearts of any and every person because he is God, it doesn't
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:00.640]   make sense then that I would ever fall out of love with him. And yet, if we can be honest with
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:07.920]   ourselves, if you can look yourself in the eye tonight, you might find yourself in the spot where
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:14.160]   this is in fact true for you. Like, you may know that, man, I was totally enamored with him at
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:19.520]   first. I couldn't get enough of him. I wanted to spend time with him. I wanted to sit and learn as
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:24.720]   much as I could. I wanted to soak in the scriptures because it was the way that I was getting to
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:29.760]   understand who he was and I was learning who I now am. And yet, somewhere along the way,
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:38.400]   you fell off. You lost your love. Your excitement fell flat. Your passion burnt out and your
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:46.720]   affections ran dry. What do you do when that's the case? Well, that's the question that I want
[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:53.440]   to answer tonight. What do we do when we find ourselves totally disenchanted with the person
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:59.920]   of Jesus? And to answer it, what I want us to do is look at the book of Revelation. So, if you have
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:05.120]   a Bible, you can turn with me to Revelation chapter 2. Revelation is the last book in your Bible, so
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:08.480]   it's easy to find. If you don't have a copy of the scripture, don't worry. We'll have it on the
[00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:13.840]   screens behind me. We've been in a series called Disciple, where we've been looking at what it
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:19.280]   means to very simply walk with Jesus. And that idea is one that many of us hear and we kind of
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:25.120]   tune our ears out. We turn our brains off because we think we know what it means to walk with him.
[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:30.880]   And yet, what we've been challenging you is that this idea that to be a true disciple of Jesus is
[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:36.480]   not just to know about the guy, it's to know him personally. And we've been looking at it through
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:40.560]   the eyes of the guys that knew him best, that walked with him nearest, those disciples, which
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:45.520]   we read their stories in the gospel accounts. And yet, tonight, what I wanted to do as I came back
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:49.760]   is I actually wanted to break the script. Like, I wanted to pause our regularly scheduled programming.
[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:55.120]   I wanted to make an exception to our rule of being in this series because I wanted to tackle an idea
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:07:00.080]   that as I've sat with you over the last several months, many of you just in one-on-one coffees,
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:04.800]   like out in this coffee shop, spending time together and learning your story, what I realized
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:12.640]   is across this room, we have a big problem. I've been trying to talk to you about what it means to
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:18.240]   walk with Jesus. And yet, so many of us are convinced that we're walking with Christ.
[00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:28.720]   When in reality, we are just wandering about in the Christian life. Like, we're not moving with
[00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:35.440]   any kind of conviction. Instead, we're just meandering along in comfort because we know the
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:39.520]   right things to do. We know the right things to say. We know the right places to go. We know the
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:46.240]   right people to spend time with. And yet, we do all of these right things for all of the wrong reasons.
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:53.200]   And so, I wanted to take an evening to just challenge this idea and help us get on the
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:08:03.680]   same page of what it means to walk with Jesus rightly. And so, looking at verse 1,
[00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:07.680]   the right reason for walking with Jesus, we see it says this,
[00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:16.240]   "To the angel of the church in Ephesus write, 'The words of him who holds the seven stars in his right
[00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:22.240]   hand, who walks among the seven golden lampstands.'" Now, what you need to know is that Jesus is speaking
[00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:29.440]   to the apostle John, and John is receiving a revelation, a vision from God for us. And what we
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:33.760]   know is that it's speaking specifically to the church at Ephesus in this moment. And so, what we
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:39.360]   should do is we should be good Bible students, and we should ask, "What do we know about Ephesus?"
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:44.720]   Well, a couple things that you should know about the place of Ephesus. Ephesus was the capital city
[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:50.720]   of Asia Minor. It was socially advantageous to live there. It was an incredibly wealthy city,
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:57.200]   and it was politically strategic if you were a person of power. Like, it attracted the likes of
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:01.600]   anybody that was somebody. People like Alexander the Great, and Julius Caesar, and Cleopatra,
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:08.640]   and Mark Antony, they all made stops in Ephesus. It was like New York, right? Anybody that somebody
[00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:13.040]   lives there, if you can make it there, you can make it anywhere. And yet, what we know is it
[00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:18.480]   wasn't just an attractive spot for the rest of the world, it was also an attractive spot for
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:23.600]   Christians to go. Some of the most significant believers that we know of actually made their
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:28.400]   way through Ephesus. People like Paul, and Timothy, and John, Priscilla, Aquila, Tychicus,
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:34.400]   Apollos, all of them made their way through the church at Ephesus at some point. And I don't know
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:38.880]   about you, or who you podcast on Sundays, because the guy preaching up here may not be the guy that
[00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:41.760]   you want to listen to at different points, but what you need to know is that you don't need to
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:47.760]   podcast anybody else, because this is an NBA super team of talent. Like, their preaching rotation is
[00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:53.520]   stacked, because these people are unlike anybody else. These names may not mean much to you, and
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:10:01.760]   yet what you know is that the 27 books in the New Testament, 19 of them were pinned in some degree by
[00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:08.080]   these names in specific. Like, 19, 70% of your New Testament came from these people that taught at the
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:13.520]   church at Ephesus in some time. Like, this church had an embarrassment of riches when it came to
[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:19.120]   spiritual influence. And the results, they corresponded accordingly. Like, we read it in
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:24.080]   verse 2 and 3. It says, "I know your works, your toil, your patient endurance, how you cannot bear
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:28.400]   with those who are evil, but have tested those who call themselves apostles and are not, and found
[00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:32.640]   them to be false. I know you are enduring patiently, and you're bearing up for my namesake,
[00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:39.440]   and you have not grown weary." Like, can we just call it like it is? The Christians in Ephesus
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:46.960]   are better Christians than all of us. Like, what Jesus just said is he gave nine commendations,
[00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:54.160]   descriptors that approved of their religious zeal. Like, just how awesome they were,
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:58.960]   outwardly speaking. He says, "Hey, I know your works, your toil, patient endurance, you can't
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:02.240]   bear with those who are evil, tested those who call themselves apostles and are not, you found
[00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:04.960]   them to be false. I know you're also enduring patiently, bearing up for my namesake, and you've
[00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:11.760]   not grown weary." Like, these people are so zealous for the things of God to live the Christian life
[00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:17.600]   that if they were here in our modern time, like, they would literally, at five o'clock in the middle
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:22.800]   of rush hour, hop in their car, gas it up, and get out in the midst of traffic just so they could
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:28.160]   encourage people at the most heinous time of day. Like, that's how zealous they were for the
[00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:34.800]   goodness of God. They were zealous to live this life that God had called them to live. They're
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:39.840]   genuinely, hands down, more impressive than any one of us. And yet, the next thing that Jesus says
[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:47.280]   is pretty alarming, because he says in verse four, "But I have this against you, despite all of that,
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:51.680]   you've abandoned the love you had at first."
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:57.920]   So let's just make sure we have this straight. Here we have a group of successful,
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:05.920]   persevering, theologically interested, and resilient believers who, in the eyes of the world,
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:11.680]   are the type of people that Jesus should be most proud of. Like, they're radically counter-cultural,
[00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:20.720]   they're obedient to the word, and yet Jesus just said, "Hey, I observe all of your outward obedience."
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.080]   And yet, when I cut straight to the inward heart, what I see is someone that,
[00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:31.360]   you may do all of the right things, but you do them for all of the wrong reasons.
[00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:38.720]   Like, there's not a white hot flame of affection for me. Instead, all you have is a cold sense of
[00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:45.200]   duty and doctrine. They looked the part. Like, they sang the songs, and they prayed the prayers,
[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:49.040]   and they answered the questions, and they showed up on Tuesday nights, and they made sure to take
[00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:52.800]   down good notes, and make sure to take a picture to share with the rest of their followers on
[00:12:52.800 --> 00:13:01.760]   social media. They did all of the right things. They looked the part, but they had no heart.
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:07.200]   They abandoned their first love. That's what it says,
[00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:15.040]   which is an interesting way of describing what they did. They didn't forget their first love.
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:22.640]   They did not lose their first love. They didn't misplace their first love. They didn't lose that
[00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:28.640]   loving feeling at any given point in time. No, it says that they abandoned their first love.
[00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:33.840]   Like, this was a love that they did not lose. It's a love that they left. Are you tracking with me?
[00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:41.920]   Which begs the question, what did they do that led to that end? How did they fall out of love
[00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:47.760]   with God? Well, how do you fall out of love with anything? Well, one quick Google search,
[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:52.560]   and you can read what psychologists would describe as being the primary reasons we fall out of love
[00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:57.600]   with anyone or anything. What do you see? You stop communicating. You have unrealistic expectations
[00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:03.600]   of the other person. You lack intimacy. You grow bored. You break trust. You even fall in love with
[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:09.120]   someone else. I remember when I was 14 years old, me and some neighborhood buddies, we came up with
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:13.760]   this bright idea that we wanted to start a garage band. And so doing the only sensible thing, I
[00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:17.760]   decided I needed to buy a guitar because I wanted to be a part of the crew. And so I went and I bought
[00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:25.040]   a baby blue speckled Fender Stratocaster. And I love that thing. I love that guitar. Like, I love
[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:29.280]   showing it to people, and I love talking about it with people, and I love the credibility it gave me
[00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:35.360]   amongst other people. The fact that I was in the band. And yet, if you asked me today,
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:45.520]   "Hey man, can you play the guitar?" I would say no. Why? Because though I outwardly loved
[00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:52.080]   that guitar, I inwardly did not love that guitar. Though I publicly loved that guitar, I privately
[00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:58.240]   did not love that guitar. Like, I would pull it out of the case, and I would take it,
[00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:01.680]   and I would show it, and I would talk about it. And yet, whenever I would go home,
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:10.560]   I'd put it on its stand. I'd push it to the corner. Much of the same way many of us
[00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:17.520]   take God and push him into some corner of our life until it is
[00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:25.680]   benefiting to pull him out and show him to those that are in our sphere of influence.
[00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:35.120]   You see, we don't want God. We want what God gives.
[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:43.440]   And yet, it's not coincidental that in John 1:38, the very first question that Jesus ever
[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:50.240]   asks the disciples is one that points straight to the heart of their affection. He asks them,
[00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:57.520]   "What do you want?" Not, "What do you know?" or "What do you need?" or "What do you believe?"
[00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:01.440]   "Where did you come from?" No, the first question Jesus ever asks his disciples is, "What
[00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:12.640]   do you want?" Because he knows whatever it is that you desire will ultimately drive your life.
[00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:25.680]   Like, what you want in life determines where you go in life. At least that's what Proverbs 4:23
[00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:31.440]   says. It says, "Above all else, guard your heart." Why? Because everything you do flows from it.
[00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:35.120]   Everything you do, it flows from your heart. Like, literally everything. There's no exception.
[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:40.160]   What you want most determines what you want now. Like, what you want most determines what you want
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:43.840]   right now. Everything you do, everything you say, every place you go, every thought you think,
[00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:50.160]   everything you eat, it all points to the fact that you love whatever that is the most.
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:58.560]   So, when you look at your actions, how you spend your time, where it is you go, the words that you
[00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:09.520]   speak, what do those actions tell you about what you really, truly care about? Like, do you really
[00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:15.440]   care about your career? Like, you just want to have a seat at that table. You just want to ascend
[00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:19.680]   to that position. You just want to make it on Forbes 30 Under 30. Like, you're just trying to
[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:24.240]   bank a million in this next year. Like, what is it for you? Is it your career? Maybe it's
[00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:28.880]   your relationship. Like, maybe it's spending time with that guy or that girl. Maybe it's the reason
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:32.960]   why you're willing to push physical boundaries, because what you really want is you want to be
[00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:38.000]   connected to that person, and you're willing to even bend the rules to make it happen. You're
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:43.280]   willing to compromise your purity to make it happen. Maybe it's not a relationship. Maybe it's
[00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:48.960]   an experience. Like, what you want is you know the days are numbered. I don't have long, Kylan,
[00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:52.960]   and so what I want is I want to live it up. I want to have a good time. I want to be happy in life.
[00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:59.280]   I want to make my days count. Maybe it's not experience. Maybe you just really care about
[00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:06.800]   what others think of you, so much so that you're willing to morally compromise, bend your integrity,
[00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:11.920]   even blur the lines between what's right and what's wrong just so people will think well of you.
[00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:16.400]   Maybe that's not the case. Maybe you care what people think of you so much that whenever you
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:22.640]   walk away from a conversation you had and you said something stupid or you did something dumb,
[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:28.400]   you can't help but replay it over and over and over and over and over again, and all you do is
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:33.600]   beat yourself up over the fact that I can't believe I said that. That was so stupid. What do they
[00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:40.240]   think of me right now? You're riddled with social anxiety. Maybe you really care about Jesus,
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:50.400]   or you're just playing the Christian game. Like, do you say one thing but then do something else?
[00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:57.760]   Do you look the part when really you could care less?
[00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:10.080]   Friends, so many of us, we have an aptitude for God, but we do not have an appetite for God.
[00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:14.400]   Y'all tracking with me on that? We have an aptitude for God. We know
[00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:20.560]   this game is easy. It's not hard to be a Christian. Like, you just gotta be a good person.
[00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:24.880]   You just gotta do the right things. You just gotta say the right things. You gotta show up to the
[00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:29.120]   right places. Gotta spend time with the right people. Gotta make sure that you repent, you
[00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:34.240]   know? Like, it's not hard to play this game, and yet so many of us have, we have grown content with
[00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:39.760]   an aptitude for God, when in reality we need an appetite for God. Like, we have all the knowledge.
[00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:44.640]   We can handle ourselves in spiritual conversations. We can answer all of the questions, but we have
[00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:51.760]   lost the internal rumblings of wanting more of God for solely ourselves.
[00:19:54.240 --> 00:20:01.760]   We have no hunger pains for holiness. Like, seeing your friends and meeting other young adults and
[00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:06.240]   running into certain people here on Tuesday nights that you're really hoping you might
[00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:14.880]   bump into at some point, or serving even. Showing up on Sundays, singing the songs,
[00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:19.520]   enjoying the worship, taking notes down whenever the teaching's happening. Like,
[00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:25.280]   all of those are good things, but listen, they're not God things. They're not the best things.
[00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:29.680]   They're not the right thing. If you're showing up for those reasons and those reasons alone,
[00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:34.560]   then you want what God has to give, and you don't want God himself.
[00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:47.920]   So what do you do if this is you? Verse five tells us, "Remember therefore from where you've fallen,
[00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:54.720]   repent and do the works that you did at first. If not, I will come to you and I'll remove your
[00:20:54.720 --> 00:21:00.320]   lampstand from its place unless you repent." So how do you stir your affections for Jesus again?
[00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:04.320]   If you find yourself at a place tonight where, man, you're not actually walking in the warmth
[00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:10.000]   of his company, but you've subscribed instead to cold orthodoxy or comfortable Christianity,
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:15.920]   how do you reignite the flame of faith? How do you get your affections burning again?
[00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:25.120]   He tells us, "You remember, you repent, and you return." You remember. Like, you remember what
[00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:31.520]   it was like when you first met Jesus, where you were, how that felt. Like, you're reminded of the
[00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:36.320]   joy of your salvation, and then you repent. You look at these things which led you away from God,
[00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:42.240]   which distanced you away from his company, and you turn them aside. You push them off,
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:49.920]   and you move back towards him. You return. You go back to doing those things which catalyzed
[00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:55.440]   your love for God and all the affection he deserves in the first place. You remember,
[00:21:55.440 --> 00:22:00.960]   return. You remember, repent, and return. What you don't do is you don't recognize regret and repeat.
[00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:07.440]   Like, notice it doesn't say that. Like, you don't recognize that, "Yeah, man, like, I'm further away
[00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:12.080]   from God than I actually want to be, but I don't know necessarily how to get back." And then you
[00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:15.680]   regret the fact that, "Man, I shouldn't be here. I shouldn't have done that thing. I shouldn't have
[00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:20.000]   said those words. I shouldn't have heard that person." And then you, despite the fact that you
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:26.720]   know you shouldn't, you repeat it anyways. That's not what he's saying. He's not telling you to just
[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:32.480]   recognize it's wrong, regret the fact that it happened, but then still repeat it. Come tomorrow,
[00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:37.120]   and then come the day following, and come the day thereafter. He's telling you to remember,
[00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:42.240]   return. Remember, repent, and return. And as I was prepping this, like, I know there's some of you
[00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:46.720]   here in the room, and you're like, "But, Kylan, like, it's too late. Like, I started off this
[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:52.080]   year, and I had the best of intentions. Like, I really wanted it. Like, I wanted to walk with
[00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:57.680]   God this year. I wanted to give him my whole heart. I wanted to go all the way in. I wanted
[00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:05.920]   to push full tilt in my faith, and yet I did that thing, or I spent my time with that person, or I
[00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:09.600]   did that thing, and I can't take back. Like, I don't know what it is for you, and yet what you need to
[00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:20.240]   know is it's not too late. Your love may have run out, but your time has not run out. You can remember
[00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:28.720]   tonight. You can repent tonight, and you can return tonight. How do you do that? Well, we actually get
[00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:34.400]   a really good picture of what this looks like, some good handles to hold if we go back to the
[00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:40.480]   beginning of Ephesus. If we turn the page, if we rewind the tape, and we look at where they were
[00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:47.040]   before they abandoned their first love, and we see that in Acts chapter 19. You can turn there if you
[00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:51.760]   want. I'm going to have it on the screens, and I'll read it to you here, but what you need to know in
[00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:55.520]   Acts chapter 19, just for some background, is that Paul comes to the church in Ephesus, and he gives
[00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:59.520]   the Holy Spirit to some disciples he finds there, and what happens when he gives the Holy Spirit to
[00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:03.680]   these disciples is revival breaks out. Like, people start repenting of their sin. They commit their
[00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:08.480]   lives to Christ, and miracles are happening. Life for these people, it gets turned upside down,
[00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:12.880]   because that's what happens whenever you meet Jesus. Like, everything changes when you meet
[00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:18.640]   Jesus, and so we read this in Acts chapter 19, looking at verse 17, "And this became known to
[00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:23.520]   all the residents of Ephesus, both Jews and Greeks, and fear fell upon them all, and the name of the
[00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:29.520]   Lord Jesus was extolled. Also, many of those who were believers, they came confessing and divulging
[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:33.520]   their practices, and a number of those who had practiced magic arts, they brought their books
[00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:38.160]   together, and they burned them in the sight of all, and they counted the value of them, and they
[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:44.320]   found it came to 50,000 pieces of silver." It's a lot of literature. "So the word of the Lord
[00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:52.080]   continued to increase and prevail mightily." So what can we learn from the life of these Ephesians
[00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:57.680]   at the beginning? Three things that correspond with remembering, repenting, and returning. The first
[00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:04.000]   is that if you want to remember, you've got to get focused on Jesus. That's the first point.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:10.320]   If you want to remember, then you have to get focused on Jesus. If you're here, and the flame
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:19.440]   of faith has gone quietly dim in your life, you feel disenchanted with Jesus. You're not sure if
[00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:25.760]   this walk is really worth it. You feel like it might be too late. The first step you take
[00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:34.080]   on the road to remembrance is you get focused on Him. You get focused on Jesus. That's what it says
[00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:38.800]   in verse 17, that after seeing all that had been done in the name of Jesus, fear fell upon them all.
[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:43.760]   Everyone who witnessed the power of God in the story, in the preceding verses, their response
[00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:48.880]   is they extolled Jesus as Lord. They look at Him, and they're like, "You're the God. You're the Lord.
[00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:52.400]   You're the master. You're the one in charge." That's their response. Now, we don't use the word
[00:25:52.400 --> 00:26:00.000]   extoll a whole lot in modern English, but the idea of extoll is to worship or to praise or to celebrate.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.880]   It's what you do whenever you go to a big game, and you're supporting a team that you really love,
[00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:09.760]   and they score. You go to a concert, and that song comes on. "Boy, I've been waiting for that song."
[00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:15.360]   What response do you have? You lift your hands. You get a little bit indignified. You start
[00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:18.960]   bouncing around. You start slapping hands. You start cheering with the people around. You start
[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:26.480]   to celebrate because you are worshiping something that's worthy of your worship. That's what's
[00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:31.920]   happening right here. Like the Ephesians, they experience wonder and awe, and the response is
[00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:41.120]   revival breaks out. Psalm 22, 3, it says that, "Yet you, God, are holy, and you're enthroned on the praises of Israel."
[00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:51.040]   That word "enthroned," it means that God inhabits or he dwells in the praises of his people.
[00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:56.320]   That's what Israel is. It's the people of God, and what's so significant about that
[00:26:56.320 --> 00:27:04.080]   is the fact that when we praise God, guess what? He's here. He's present.
[00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:10.880]   Like, just let that sink in on you, that when we sing, here in just a minute,
[00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:15.920]   God delights to inhabit
[00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:22.480]   your song. He wants to be here with his people.
[00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:28.400]   Their response is one of radical reverence,
[00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:33.840]   and yet ours is so often a response of casual indifference.
[00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:39.440]   This song again, I've heard this one already. We sang this on Sunday,
[00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:43.120]   and what we do is we move through the motions,
[00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:49.600]   and raise our hands in the right moments, beat our fists because we don't want to just stand still.
[00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:54.400]   We look the part, but we've lost the heart,
[00:27:54.400 --> 00:28:00.800]   and yet what we see for these Ephesians is that at the appearance of God's presence and power,
[00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:09.200]   they realize just how big he is and how small they are, and we have to do the same thing.
[00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:15.840]   How do we do it? Well, you remember, every single day you get focused on Jesus.
[00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:20.480]   Every single day you think as often and as much of Jesus as possible.
[00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:24.880]   As often and as much of Jesus as possible. Like, you give him quantity of thought,
[00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:29.440]   and you give him quality of thought. In the same way, if you're trying to get good at anything,
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:32.000]   if you're trying to learn to hit a golf ball, if you're trying to learn how to shoot a basket,
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.200]   if you're trying to learn how to shoot a gun, whatever it is for you, what you have to do
[00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:42.400]   is you have to put up a lot of shots, a quantity of repetitions, but you have to make the reps count.
[00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:48.960]   You also have to add to them quality of effort. That's what we do. That's how we get focused on
[00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:54.000]   Jesus. That's how we remember who he is, and we take this first step. What does that actually look
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:59.760]   like? Well, it varies. It depends on the person. What stirs your affections? Like, when you gather
[00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:03.040]   in here on Tuesday nights, or when you come in on Sundays, or you're spending time with
[00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:07.200]   God in the mornings, or whatever it is for you, what actually leads you to love God more?
[00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:19.600]   Whatever that is, you should do it. A lot. And with great intentionality. Like, that's the idea.
[00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:24.800]   Like, what I know is that if you want to grow in your love for Jesus, what you're going to have to
[00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:28.080]   do as you spend time with him is you're going to have to do what you would do with anybody. If you
[00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:32.000]   want to spend time and grow a relationship, you're gonna have to listen to him, and you're gonna have
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:38.640]   to talk to him. What relationship thrives without communication? The way we communicate with Jesus
[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:45.200]   is we read his word, because all of this communicates who he is from him to us, and
[00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:51.040]   then we pray back. Because when we pray, we're not just lifting up empty thoughts and words that
[00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:57.360]   bounce upon the ceiling. No, we're talking to God. We're communicating with Christ. You read the word
[00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:07.280]   every single day. You pray often, in private and in company. You get outside, and you marvel at the
[00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:12.720]   spectacle of God's creation. You find reason to be grateful, because our world gives us plenty of
[00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:19.680]   reason to complain. You enjoy good food, because it's from God. You spend time with good people
[00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:25.760]   in a way that leaves you feeling innocent by the end of it all. You do whatever it takes for you to
[00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:33.120]   love God more by the end of the day than you did at the beginning of it. You got that? That's how
[00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:38.960]   you remember. That's where you first start. You do whatever it takes. And here's what you got to know,
[00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:46.560]   man. God comes wherever he's wanted. Like, if you're showing up, and you're wanting for God,
[00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:51.040]   and you're pursuing him in a way that accords with his word and is obedient to his will,
[00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:58.720]   he'll come to you. Like, draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. God comes wherever it is
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:05.920]   he's wanted. So, if God feels far off, the question is not, "Where has he gone?" The question is,
[00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:13.920]   "Where have you gone?" That's the first point. Second point is in verse 18. It says, "Also,
[00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:18.880]   many of those who were believers, they came, confessing and divulging their practices."
[00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:25.120]   So, the second step to remembering your first love, to growing your affections for Christ,
[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:30.240]   is you got to repent. And the way that you repent is you get honest about your sin.
[00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:35.600]   That's what we see here in verse 18. Like, that's how this works. Like, when you see Jesus for how
[00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:41.680]   perfect he is, you see yourself for how polluted you are. And the only natural thing to do in that
[00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:47.840]   moment, when you see how great he is and how wrong you are, is you repent. Like, that's what all
[00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:54.080]   revivals are forged upon. Like, that's the anvil upon which revivals are built. They're built upon
[00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:59.440]   repentance. Like, it doesn't start—like, a revival doesn't come to a city until it first comes to an
[00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:06.480]   individual. I think it's fascinating. I'll probably make some enemies for this. In our nation right
[00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:11.600]   now, people are so invigorated about the idea of revival. Like, they want a movement of God to just
[00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:16.880]   sweep over the nation. And I'm all for that. I think that's a great thing to desire. And yet,
[00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:22.160]   you cannot want for it to come to the nation before you want it to come to the person.
[00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:33.280]   It doesn't come to the masses. It comes to the one. National revival, it's birthed through
[00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:42.080]   personal renewal. Which is why we have to get honest about our sin. Like, personal renewal
[00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:48.880]   happens when we take a good, hard look inside of ourselves and we see, "Wait, what's wrong?"
[00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:55.840]   And we respond the same way they did. What we see from these Ephesians is they understand Jesus'
[00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:59.760]   willingness to forgive sins. And they're like, "What? What? Like, you're willing to forgive sins?
[00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:05.520]   Then, wait, wait. Here's everything I have. Here's all of my sin. If you're willing to forgive it,
[00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:10.480]   let me get it all out to you. Because I don't want any of it to go unforgiven. Like, I want all of it
[00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:16.800]   to be known. I want all of it to be—I want all of it to be covered. I want all of it to be washed.
[00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:23.120]   Jesus, this is everything I have. Let me tell you it all." Which is why it's so fascinating to me
[00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:29.520]   that we hide our sin from God and one another. Like, Jesus is wanting to forgive it. Like,
[00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:34.720]   he has the power to forgive sins, him and him alone. Like, he has the power to love the very
[00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:40.480]   worst version of you. And it's the very reason it came. Like, there is nothing in you that would
[00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:47.840]   ever turn him off, would ever turn him away, would ever lead him to say, "No, not you. You're
[00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:54.320]   the exception. Everybody else is great, but not you instead." No, like, your sin, it did not repel him.
[00:33:54.320 --> 00:34:01.040]   It compelled him. Like, it didn't push him off. It pulled him in. He saw where you were, and he's
[00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:06.480]   like, "I don't want that for my people. I'll do what it takes. I will swoop in and save the day.
[00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:12.080]   I will bear their sin. I will hang upon their cross. I will die their death, and I will rise
[00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:18.720]   from the grave for their sake." This is what Jesus is wanting, which is why we should be honest about
[00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:25.200]   our sin, and we should turn away from it. Second Peter 3, 9 says, "The Lord is not slow to fulfill
[00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:31.360]   his promises. Some count slowness, but he's patient towards you, not wishing that any should perish,
[00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:36.640]   but that all should reach repentance." Luke 15, 7 says, "I tell you in the same way,
[00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:44.080]   there will be more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents than over 99 righteous persons
[00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:53.200]   who do not need to repent." You want to send the heavens into a ruckus accord? Then repent.
[00:34:53.200 --> 00:35:01.040]   That's all it takes. And let me just be really clear on this, because I think often we can get
[00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:11.360]   this confused. When I talk about repentance, I'm not talking about remorse. Repentance is not just
[00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:18.880]   feeling bad about the bad thing you did. It's turning away from the bad thing you did
[00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:28.320]   and moving back towards the only good one, which is God. It's leaving it behind. It's turning it
[00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:39.680]   away. Some of you here, you're so grieved over your sin, but not so much that you're ready to let it go.
[00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:44.160]   You're so eaten up, the struggle's so hard,
[00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:53.280]   yet you're not so consumed that you would finally let Jesus win the battle for you.
[00:35:55.440 --> 00:36:00.640]   The best thing some of you can do tonight, the bravest thing some of you can do tonight,
[00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:10.000]   is actually repent of that sin, that lingering sin, which has plagued you for so long.
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:24.080]   And the formula is not hard. It's acknowledge it, confess it, accept his grace, and walk away.
[00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:32.880]   That's all it takes. This could be, for some of you, the single moment that you've been wanting
[00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:39.520]   for all year to finally feel the freedom that Christ has afforded you. If you would come down,
[00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:46.320]   would repent of your sin, and leave it here forever. Do you want that? Because that's
[00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:50.320]   on the table tonight. You can have that. That's available here.
[00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:57.280]   That's available here. If you want to stir your affections for Jesus, then you got to repent.
[00:36:57.280 --> 00:37:06.560]   Because God, he is closest to honest sinners than silent sufferers. The third thing we see
[00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:15.600]   if we want to remember our first love is we have to return, which means that we have to get really
[00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:20.720]   serious about surrender. We got to get really serious about surrender. That's what it says in
[00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:24.640]   verses 19 through 20. "And a number of those who had practiced magic arts, they brought their books
[00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:28.400]   together and they burned them in the sight of all. And they counted the value of them and they found
[00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:34.400]   it came to 50,000 pieces of silver." Like the Ephesians, they fall so in love with Jesus that
[00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:39.200]   they start regularly repenting and they burn up these books from their old way of life. Like all
[00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:45.360]   of these books about magical arts and divination, they once cherished them. And yet, the minute they
[00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:50.000]   realized that they stand in opposition to their true love, they strike a match and they get rid
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:55.600]   of them. Like they got so serious about their surrender that nothing would stand in the way
[00:37:55.600 --> 00:38:01.360]   of them getting more of Jesus. And we have to do the same. Like there are some things here tonight
[00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:08.640]   that are robbing you of your love for Christ. Robbing you. What do you do to prevent being
[00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:17.120]   robbed? You lock your doors. You set your alarms. You install some cameras. Like I remember when my
[00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:22.000]   wife and I bought our house in Houston, it came with a security system installed. And I loved it.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:26.880]   Not just because I could check out the footage, see what was going on down the street. But because I
[00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:38.240]   knew I was able to protect the ones I loved. Some of you are getting robbed and you're doing nothing
[00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:46.160]   about it. Like the enemy is swooping in to steal your joy, take your affection, and you're letting
[00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:53.040]   him. When in reality, there are steps you can take tonight. So let's talk about those. Like really
[00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:56.160]   practically. Like there are some things in your life, and here's the thing, like they may not be
[00:38:56.160 --> 00:39:02.800]   bad things. They may be totally morally neutral that you need to give up. Like social media that
[00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:06.400]   stirs up comparison. Staying over at your boyfriend's house because it's just too late.
[00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:10.080]   Playing sports because you get overly competitive. That was one for me. Hanging out with those
[00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:14.720]   friends that you always have one too many with. Listening to that music or watching that TV show.
[00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:19.760]   Whatever it is, and this is the point, we have to get serious about setting those things aside.
[00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:25.520]   Whatever's robbing your affection of Jesus, you have got to cut it out of your life.
[00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:32.880]   You have to light it on fire. You have to burn it where it stands. You've got to get serious about
[00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:40.880]   surrender. Here's the thing, and I know that this is a really heavy talk. I knew that coming in,
[00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:45.600]   I felt this pressure to like load this thing up with a bunch of stories, to get a bunch of laughs,
[00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:55.280]   and yet what I care more about than hearing your laughter is hearing your learning.
[00:39:56.960 --> 00:40:00.640]   Knowing that you're actually comprehending the truth of God's word.
[00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:04.480]   And so this is another hard thing that I want to tell you.
[00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:12.880]   Some of you, you want so badly for the anointing that God has on someone else's life, and yet you're
[00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:18.960]   not willing to pay the price to get it. Like some of you want so badly for the blessing that God has
[00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:24.160]   put on somebody else's life, but you're not willing to pay the price to get it. Like some of you want
[00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:31.760]   so badly to get the kind of adoration that God has given to someone else, and yet you're not willing
[00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:38.000]   to pay the price to get it. Here's what you have got to know. The price of what you lose in this
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:45.520]   world, it is nothing in comparison to the prize of what you will find in Christ. That's why you have
[00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:51.520]   to give whatever it takes, because you get everything and more. Like that's the promise of
[00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:59.840]   Christ. Like in him is all the riches and fullness and glory of God. Why would you look anywhere else
[00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:06.560]   for it? Like nothing's worth having if it keeps us from having him. So last story.
[00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:19.040]   It was this Tuesday, exactly one year ago, when I preached my final message here at the porch
[00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:24.800]   before I accepted the offer to become the director here in Dallas.
[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:31.760]   And I remember like when my wife and I made the trip down to spy out the land and see if this is
[00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:36.880]   where God wanted us, we were really conflicted. Which is funny for people when I say that,
[00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:40.800]   because they're like, "What are you talking about, man? Like it's the porch." And yet we were a part
[00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:48.080]   of something that was amazing. Like in a ministry where God was moving and lives were changing and
[00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:53.520]   stories were shaping and ministry was growing. Like we were a part of something so significant
[00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:59.920]   that was right at the heart of who God was and what he wanted for people. And so when we came
[00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:04.240]   here, I was like, "Man, it's going to take a lot to just get us out of where we've been. It's going
[00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:08.400]   to take more than just a big room with a lot of people and multiple streaming sites across the
[00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:12.400]   nation. Like that's not enough. Like I don't want to just show up and be the weekly entertainment.
[00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:17.280]   Like I don't care about the widespread crowds. I care about the lives of people.
[00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:22.240]   God moving in your story. And what I know is it's happening where we are. And so God, I need to know
[00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:28.240]   if it's going to happen where we're going. And so I showed up here and I preached a year ago today.
[00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:35.920]   And I remember asking God, "Lord, what I want to see when I'm begging you to give the confirmation
[00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:44.000]   I require, if you'd be gracious enough to give it, is I need to see hunger. Hunger.
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:52.080]   Desire in the lives of these people to not just hang their hat on the fact that, man, like the
[00:42:52.080 --> 00:43:00.720]   porch is awesome. Look at what God's done. But to believe that God's not finished. That he's still
[00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:09.680]   doing something in this city, in your city, and in every city. Not because of who we are,
[00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:18.240]   because of who he is. And as I preached that night, a stranger to this room and every single one of
[00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:29.840]   you in attendance, I remember I closed my Bible, shut my iPad, said amen, and walked off this
[00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:38.880]   platform. And as I did, I heard applause. Now that can feel really silly to you, like a trite
[00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:46.800]   confirmation. And yet it wasn't an applause that approved of me. It was an applause that approved
[00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:55.920]   of this, that agreed with the word and the God therein. It was an applause from a people
[00:43:57.440 --> 00:44:05.360]   that had been fed by this truth and were hungry for more.
[00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:10.400]   And I remember, like, when I walked off that platform,
[00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:18.880]   what I felt in that moment was what I feel still today, that God is far from finished in this place.
[00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:26.080]   Not just because we've got great facilities and a really talented band and all the right
[00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:34.320]   production equipment. No, none of those things. God is far from finished because of people like
[00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:41.440]   you and the hunger you have. Some of you are here and you have lost that hunger,
[00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:48.880]   but you can find it again tonight. God comes wherever it is he's wanted.
[00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:56.720]   Are you wanting for him this evening? We know that Jesus Christ has proven all of this to us
[00:44:56.720 --> 00:45:04.480]   because while we now know we should get focused on Christ, he never lost sight of you.
[00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:12.720]   Well, now we know we should be honest about our sin. Jesus loved your honest self most of all.
[00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:21.600]   And while we now know that we should be serious about surrender, Jesus was so serious
[00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:26.960]   about himself that he surrendered his life for your sake and mine.
[00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:39.280]   Are you hungry? He is wanting for you. He is willing to give the kind of life you want
[00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:48.240]   and even better still. Remember, repent and return. God, we're grateful for tonight.
[00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:57.360]   Thank you for this time. God, I just confess as I stand on this platform and I worked through
[00:45:57.360 --> 00:46:04.080]   this message, I was unsure of how this content would land. Knowing God that it's heavy,
[00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:10.640]   it can feel hard, even inaccessible to some, to those here, God, that don't know you.
[00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:14.080]   And yet, Lord, what I'm begging, what I'm praying
[00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:19.440]   is that people would know here at the porch
[00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:25.200]   and in the lives of those that gather in this room,
[00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:29.840]   we will not settle for disenchanted discipleship,
[00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:41.360]   but we want to walk in all the wonder and splendor and beauty you and you alone afford.
[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:54.000]   We want you. God, we want you. Come to us now. Come to us now.
