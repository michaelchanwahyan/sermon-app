[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:24.680]   - All right, let's do it.
[00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:25.520]   Let's do it.
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.360]   What's up, Porch?
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.600]   My Porch Live locations,
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.500]   we are introducing tonight and saying a big hello
[00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.200]   from Dallas, y'all help me out.
[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.760]   Welcome Porch Live Midland,
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.800]   Porch Live Greater Lafayette,
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.320]   and Porch Live Des Moines, Iowa.
[00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.040]   We are so glad that you guys are tuning in tonight.
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.120]   And of course my friends in Dallas, what's up?
[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.240]   I'm JD, if we haven't met,
[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.480]   I serve as the creative director here at the Porch.
[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.160]   It's a privilege to be here speaking.
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.400]   Dave and Marvin tonight is in College Station.
[00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.520]   Any Aggies in the house?
[00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:53.720]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.760]   Speaking of breakaway, so you're stuck with me
[00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.700]   and I am so pumped.
[00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.840]   Daniel chapter three, we are in this series on God.
[00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:01.680]   That's on God.
[00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.220]   We're gonna see that time and time again in this series.
[00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.640]   Week one, chapter one, we've talked about how Daniel
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.600]   and the people, the Israelite people were different
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.120]   than those that were underneath the Babylonian captivity.
[00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.500]   They ate different food.
[00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.020]   Night two, we saw what it looked like
[00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.120]   to have God confidence as Daniel stood before the king
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.240]   and interpreted his dream on God's power and strength.
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.360]   And tonight we're gonna look at what it means
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.480]   to have great faith, not from Daniel,
[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.960]   but some side characters known as Shadrach,
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.840]   Meshach, and Abednego.
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.760]   But before we go there, I wanna tell you about this week.
[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.200]   Me and some friends were sitting in our apartment
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.880]   and we were going through Netflix trying to decide
[00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.660]   what to watch and there was this show
[00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:42.840]   that kind of just caught my eye.
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.360]   It was like number one on Netflix at the time
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.800]   called "Is It Cake?"
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.300]   "Is It Cake?"
[00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.300]   And you know, like when you hover over,
[00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.320]   it's not that good, honestly,
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.800]   but whenever you hover over and like the commercial starts
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.040]   and you're like, you got five seconds,
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.080]   I was like, all right, Netflix, I'll buy it, click.
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.480]   And so I start watching this show
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.760]   and if you haven't seen it, the premise of the show
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.200]   is these bakers are in a competition
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.000]   where essentially they have to fool these judges
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.900]   to convince them that what they baked is actually real,
[00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.760]   that it's not cake, that it's not fake, it is a real thing.
[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.360]   And so imagine they would have to make this water bottle
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.400]   look exactly like a water bottle, but instead it's cake.
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.760]   And so they have like, whenever they turn around the wall
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.800]   and they're done baking, they have four hours to do it,
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.640]   there's all these different water bottles,
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.680]   there's five of them, except one of them is cake.
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.760]   And then the judges in like 20 seconds
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.320]   have to pick one through five,
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.200]   which one they think is cake.
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.360]   And so me and all my friends, we're like, it's number two,
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.800]   no, no, it's number five, 'cause it's just shocking
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.440]   how much literal cake can look like a real object.
[00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.600]   And so we're all putting in our votes.
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.340]   And then the way that it's revealed is the host,
[00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.800]   who's interesting if you've seen it,
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.960]   he takes this big knife and kind of like violently,
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.440]   creepily, like he likes it too much.
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.520]   I'm like, bro, chill.
[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.880]   He goes over and he's like, is it cake?
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.880]   And I'm like, yeah, come on.
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.500]   And he goes to cut it, and if it's not cake,
[00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.760]   it just hits whatever the thing is,
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.640]   and the judge is lost and the baker won.
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.200]   And then he'll be like, which one is it?
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.120]   And he'll walk over and they're all like, no.
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.520]   And then he cuts it and it's so like nice.
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.040]   It's like soothing weirdly.
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.400]   He cuts it and then reveals on the inside it's cake
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.220]   and everyone's just like, pff.
[00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:29.300]   So I watched like two episodes,
[00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:30.160]   I was done with it after that.
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.460]   But the point is, I think a lot of us
[00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:36.480]   are there with our faith.
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.120]   In the same way that these guys are challenged to go,
[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.900]   is it cake or is it real?
[00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.020]   A lot of times when it comes to our faith,
[00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.900]   we're going, is it real or is it fake?
[00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.580]   Like, is my faith real?
[00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:55.220]   When I stand before God, will I be seen good,
[00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.220]   well done, my good and faithful servant?
[00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.980]   Like your faith, your faith has been real, it's been well.
[00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.220]   But just like the cake on the show,
[00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.140]   a lot of times you don't know if your faith
[00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.540]   is actually about it until it's cut into in life.
[00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.780]   With these guys, we'll see that it wasn't cut into,
[00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.380]   it was actually burned into.
[00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.180]   But a lot of times it's until the heat
[00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.520]   begins to be turned up, the pressure begins to be added on,
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.820]   the stakes begin to be raised higher and higher.
[00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.140]   And in these defining moments in life,
[00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:31.100]   that is when we realize, man, my faith, all of this talk,
[00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.980]   it was either real or it was fake.
[00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.420]   And our world is only getting, guys,
[00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.140]   our world is only getting more and more to a place
[00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.920]   where you're gonna have to make a decision.
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:44.500]   And I think the problem is so many people,
[00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.500]   when that moment comes to display radical faith in God,
[00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.660]   they crumble and they're marked by conformity
[00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.500]   rather than courage and obedience
[00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.820]   because they did not take today seriously.
[00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:02.140]   You don't wanna wait until the fires in life,
[00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:06.820]   the storms and trials in life to decide, is my faith real?
[00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:09.260]   It's the decisions you make today.
[00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.720]   It's how you prepare today that prepare you for the moment
[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.900]   that when the fires of life come, you'll be ready.
[00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.300]   You don't have to wonder, man, I hope that it's real.
[00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.280]   I hope that my faith is what I've always said it is.
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.040]   No, you can know today.
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.300]   We're gonna see in the life of these men
[00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.040]   that you can know right now.
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.500]   You don't have to ever question again.
[00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.700]   And here's why this is relevant to every person in this room
[00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.640]   'cause some of you are like, man, I know my faith is real.
[00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.320]   The reason why this is so relevant to all of us
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.420]   is because even if you think,
[00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:38.680]   when we look into the deepest parts of our life,
[00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.120]   there is something that we do that communicates otherwise.
[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.100]   So many times our life is marked by fear, worry,
[00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:50.300]   or even living in our own faith, our self-faith,
[00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.240]   rather than faith in God.
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.000]   And that's what we're gonna see in this story.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.040]   We're gonna see what it looks like to have a faith on fire.
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.880]   If you're a note taker, if you like alliterations,
[00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.840]   all that stuff, faith on fire
[00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.400]   is the title of tonight's message.
[00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.540]   And we're gonna do that by tackling Daniel chapter three.
[00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:08.440]   And so, wanna go and give a heads up.
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.240]   This is a long story,
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:14.720]   but I will say, if you tell me, man, the Bible is boring,
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.360]   especially the Old Testament,
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.480]   I do not know what book you are reading
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.440]   because this is one of my favorite stories of all time.
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:22.920]   Like this is a movie.
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:24.220]   When I read this, I am like,
[00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:25.720]   I cannot wait to get to the next sentence
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.480]   because it is so good.
[00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:30.040]   And so lean in, although it's a lot of words,
[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.760]   what we're gonna do is every day,
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:33.600]   if you don't have a way that you do your quiet time,
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.040]   if you kind of just open up and point,
[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:36.480]   I'm gonna give you just a good way
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:37.800]   to know how to study your Bible.
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:42.800]   Write this down, observation, interpretation, application.
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.520]   Observation, interpretation, application.
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.440]   That when you open up a passage,
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:50.240]   when you hear, hey, the porch is going through
[00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.200]   a book of the Bible, you wanna,
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.040]   that should be an indicator, oh, okay,
[00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:56.520]   so what we're gonna do is we're gonna read the text,
[00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.160]   we're gonna observe what it's saying,
[00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.980]   we're gonna interpret it by seeing what the author's intent,
[00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:04.360]   what was the author trying to communicate to me?
[00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:06.960]   What does this, how do I interpret this for my life?
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.320]   And then we're gonna apply it.
[00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:10.980]   Knowledge puffs up.
[00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:11.980]   We don't want just more knowledge,
[00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:14.640]   we want to put it into practice.
[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.720]   And so today, we're simply gonna look at this story,
[00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:21.200]   observe it, interpret it, and apply it.
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:25.400]   And so I'm gonna kind of summarize verses one through 13,
[00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.560]   and then we'll read 14 to the end.
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:29.480]   With me, everyone with me?
[00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:30.320]   With me?
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:31.520]   All right, sweet, here we go.
[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:33.480]   Daniel chapter three, one through 13.
[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:36.040]   What you need to know, Nebuchadnezzar,
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:37.040]   he's kind of out there.
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.880]   Like at the end of every chapter, he's like,
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:40.280]   "You have the most high God."
[00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:41.760]   And the next one, he's mad again.
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:43.080]   He's like, "Bow down to me."
[00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:46.960]   In this instance, he goes and he acts all crazy,
[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:49.400]   and he's like questioning people's loyalty.
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.400]   People have been whispering in his ear, and he's like,
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:53.120]   there's like, I think a rebellion's going on,
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.440]   and so what does he do?
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:57.020]   He makes an idol of gold 90 feet high.
[00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:57.860]   That sounds logical.
[00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:01.640]   So he builds this huge self-idol of himself,
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:05.080]   and it's this moment where he kind of makes the people
[00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:08.080]   serve him both politically and spiritually.
[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.400]   They were displaying their political loyalty
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:12.380]   and their spiritual loyalty to him,
[00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:14.800]   because he's the baddest king of the time at this time.
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.440]   So what he says is, "Hey, I've got all these instruments.
[00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:18.440]   "I've got this band over here.
[00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:19.720]   "They're the best in the nation.
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:20.960]   "They're gonna play some music,
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:23.600]   "and then you're gonna drop down and worship this idol."
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:25.520]   When you read this, a lot of you are too familiar with this.
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:27.680]   You are used to dropping when you hear the music
[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:30.640]   in the clubs, but can you imagine you're just walking around
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:32.280]   with like baskets of bread and you hear,
[00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:34.720]   "Give me something," you know, you drop down.
[00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:35.600]   That's what I picture, you know,
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:36.840]   the bass is like hitting, you know,
[00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:38.720]   the saxophone's playing.
[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:40.960]   And so they're bowing down to the idol.
[00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:43.480]   Oh, and by the way, if you don't,
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:46.620]   I'm gonna throw you in a fiery furnace, okay?
[00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:48.440]   Casual, so everyone bow.
[00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:49.600]   The reason why he's doing this,
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:53.720]   because he wants to see who's loyal to me.
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:55.920]   Who will bow?
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:09:00.040]   And if you're caught standing, you will soon be burning.
[00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:01.600]   That's what he says.
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:04.880]   And so as this is going on, everything's going good,
[00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:08.060]   everything's going smooth, the king gets word
[00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:11.400]   that there are certain Jews, these wise men go to him,
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:14.560]   they're like, "Oh, mighty king, didn't you say
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:15.940]   "that like once they hear the music,
[00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:17.080]   "they're supposed to bow down to you
[00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:18.520]   "to display their loyalty?"
[00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:19.960]   He's like, "I did say that."
[00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:21.920]   And there's like, there's certain Jews,
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:24.760]   Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who aren't doing it.
[00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:25.600]   And he's like, "What?
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:26.420]   "Bring them to me.
[00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:27.260]   "Let me talk to them.
[00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:28.400]   "Let me at them."
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:30.080]   So he's all fiery, he's hot.
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:34.060]   He brings in these three men to stand before him
[00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:35.640]   and to plead their case.
[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:37.580]   And that's where we are in the story.
[00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:38.500]   Verse 14.
[00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:41.200]   Nebuchadnezzar said to them,
[00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:43.960]   "Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego,
[00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:46.180]   "that you refuse to serve my gods
[00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:49.480]   "or to worship the gold statue I have set up?
[00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:52.200]   "I will give you one more chance to bow down
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:53.860]   "and worship the statue I have made
[00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:56.040]   "when you hear the sound of the musical instruments.
[00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:59.180]   "But if you refuse, you will be thrown immediately
[00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:00.560]   "into the blazing furnace.
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:05.560]   "And then what god will be able to rescue you from my power?"
[00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:07.640]   He bowed to sea.
[00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:08.720]   Verse 16.
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:11.040]   Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego replied,
[00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.080]   "Oh, Nebuchadnezzar,
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:15.160]   "we do not need to defend ourselves before you."
[00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:16.000]   I love this part.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.080]   This is so funny to me, I don't know why.
[00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:19.080]   "If we are thrown into the blazing furnace,
[00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:22.400]   "the god whom we serve is able to save us.
[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:26.000]   "He will rescue us from your power."
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.600]   Your majesty, your most loyal king.
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.640]   "But even if he doesn't,
[00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:32.280]   "we want to make it abundantly clear to you,"
[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:35.880]   again, your majesty, you know, we're just little peasants,
[00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:38.940]   "that we will never serve your gods
[00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:41.820]   "or worship the gold statue you have set up.
[00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:43.600]   "Nebuchadnezzar was so furious
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:45.260]   "with Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego
[00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.000]   "that his face became distorted with rage.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.860]   "He commanded that the furnace be heated
[00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:51.960]   "seven times hotter than usual.
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:54.820]   "Then he ordered some of the strongest men of his army
[00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:57.540]   "to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego
[00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:59.620]   "and throw them into the blazing furnace.
[00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:02.000]   "So they tied them up, threw them into the furnace,
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   "fully dressed in their pants, turbans, robes,
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:04.840]   "and other garments,"
[00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:06.400]   that's apparently important to know.
[00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:09.800]   "And because the king in his anger
[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.800]   "had demanded such a hot fire in the furnace,"
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:12.660]   this is crazy,
[00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:14.680]   "the flames killed the soldiers
[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:16.360]   "as they threw the three men in.
[00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:21.120]   "So Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, securely tied,
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:25.000]   "fell into the roaring flames.
[00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:27.200]   "But suddenly,"
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:30.560]   Mufasa, you know that part?
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:31.480]   Shake it.
[00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:36.480]   "But suddenly, Nebuchadnezzar jumped up in amazement
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:38.760]   "and exclaimed to his advisors,
[00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:40.740]   "'Hey, yo, didn't we tie up three men
[00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:42.180]   "'and throw them into the furnace?'
[00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:43.560]   "And they're like, 'Yeah, it just happened, King,
[00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:44.480]   "'like five minutes ago.'
[00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:48.160]   "'Yes, your majesty, we certainly did,' they replied.
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:50.380]   "'Look,' Nebuchadnezzar shouted,
[00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:53.100]   "'I see four men, unbound,
[00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:55.820]   "'walking around in the fire, unharmed.'
[00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:58.880]   "And the fourth looks like a god.
[00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:00.680]   "Then Nebuchadnezzar came as close as he could
[00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:02.840]   "to the door of the flaming furnace and shouted,
[00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:04.640]   "'Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego,
[00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:08.340]   "'servants of the most high God, come out, come here.'
[00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:12.060]   "So Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego stepped out of the fire.
[00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:15.660]   "Then the high officers, officials, governors,
[00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:17.480]   "and advisors crowded around them
[00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:19.880]   "and saw that the fire had not even touched them,
[00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:22.220]   "not a hair on their heads were singed,
[00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:24.300]   "and their clothing was not scorched.
[00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:27.620]   "They didn't even smell of smoke."
[00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:29.360]   That's crazy.
[00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:31.900]   "Then Nebuchadnezzar said,
[00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:35.220]   "Praise to the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.
[00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:37.720]   "He sent his angel to rescue his servants
[00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:39.040]   "who trusted in him.
[00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:43.720]   "They defied the king's command and were willing to die
[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:47.480]   "rather than serve or worship any god except their own God.
[00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:49.040]   "Therefore I make the decree,
[00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:51.840]   "if any people, whatever their race or nation or language,
[00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:54.820]   "speak a word against the God of Shadrach, Meshach,
[00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:57.260]   "and Abednego, they will be torn limb from limb."
[00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.700]   Here we are again with the tearing from limb to limb.
[00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:01.200]   This guy needs to go see a counselor.
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:05.740]   "And their houses will be turned into heaps of rubble.
[00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:08.860]   "There is no other God who can rescue like this.
[00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:12.500]   "Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego
[00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:16.900]   "to even higher positions in the province of Babylon."
[00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:18.900]   Woo, okay, I need a drink.
[00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:22.080]   Thank you.
[00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:24.980]   So tonight, we're observing, like I said,
[00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:26.280]   we're observing this story
[00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:27.720]   and we're learning what it looks like
[00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:31.220]   to have a faith that's on fire for God.
[00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:32.400]   And so right into it.
[00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:34.280]   Faith on fire, number one.
[00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:38.160]   Faith on fire will look different.
[00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:41.040]   People who have a faith on fire are built different.
[00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:42.220]   All right, I'm gonna tell you,
[00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:45.740]   if you are a Christian, you will look different.
[00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:50.120]   Remember that the king has asked everyone to bow down
[00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:53.520]   and there's a reason why these three guys stood out.
[00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:58.280]   Because when everyone bowed, they were standing.
[00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:02.540]   So because of that, Nebuchadnezzar said to them, verse 14,
[00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:04.980]   "Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego,
[00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:07.260]   "that you refuse to serve my gods
[00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:11.200]   "or to worship the gold statue I have set up?
[00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:15.140]   "I will give you one more chance to bow down."
[00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:16.920]   You need to know this about faith.
[00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:20.600]   Real faith will produce real testing.
[00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:23.680]   If you are gonna be marked by real faith,
[00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:27.080]   you better be ready to be accompanied by real testing.
[00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:28.480]   They always go hand in hand
[00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:30.480]   because the more your faith builds,
[00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:33.160]   the more that testing is used to strengthen your faith
[00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:34.760]   and they go hand in hand.
[00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:37.400]   God uses these moments of testing
[00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:39.780]   and trying to build your faith on him.
[00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:41.580]   We see that all throughout scripture.
[00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:44.120]   You've probably experienced that in your life.
[00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:47.100]   And if you're gonna be a Christian in the world today,
[00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:51.920]   you're gonna have your is it true moment.
[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:52.920]   What do I mean by that?
[00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:54.980]   King Nebuchadnezzar, he looked at these three guys
[00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:56.660]   and he said, "Hey, is it true
[00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:58.340]   "that you won't bow down to me?
[00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:00.200]   "Is it true?
[00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:04.820]   "And if you're gonna be a Christian
[00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:07.040]   "marked by radical faith and obedience,
[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:09.120]   "you're gonna be asked, hey, is it true
[00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:13.980]   "that you only believe that there's just male and female?"
[00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:18.600]   Is it true that you're actually against pro-choice
[00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.820]   and you are for the sanctity of life?
[00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:24.740]   Hey, is it true that you believe
[00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:27.620]   that Jesus is the only way to heaven?
[00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:32.140]   Hey, is it true that you believe
[00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:33.940]   that same-sex marriage is wrong?
[00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:35.660]   There's gonna be all these different things
[00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:38.880]   that the world, your jobs, your friends,
[00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:40.640]   people that you encounter on trips
[00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:43.300]   and different moments of life are gonna ask you,
[00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:46.300]   hey, is it true blank?
[00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:51.320]   And if you wanna be marked by real faith,
[00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:54.100]   you have to be ready to be tested and in the testing.
[00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:57.960]   Our job as Christians is to look different.
[00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:01.120]   It's surprising to me, the church, I think,
[00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:05.460]   has slowly sought so hard to reach the world
[00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:07.740]   that it's slowly starting to look like the world
[00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:08.860]   and you can't tell a difference
[00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:10.700]   between Christians and the world.
[00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:13.100]   And so because of that, we've become soft
[00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:15.380]   as Christians, we don't like the tension
[00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:16.940]   of looking different.
[00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:19.820]   Actually, when the world doesn't agree with us,
[00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:22.320]   we're hurt by it, we're surprised by it.
[00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:25.700]   And it's so shocking to me that we as Christians
[00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:28.280]   are so torn up when the world is mad at us,
[00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:30.140]   when our coworkers talk about us,
[00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:31.380]   when we're treated differently,
[00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:34.420]   it's so surprising because Jesus says it point blank
[00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:36.300]   that this will happen for the believer.
[00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:41.060]   John 15, Jesus says, hey, when the world hates you,
[00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:42.860]   remember that it hated me first.
[00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:46.660]   Then he goes on to say, if you were of the world,
[00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:49.340]   the world would love you as its own.
[00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:51.300]   But because you are not of the world,
[00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:52.980]   but I chose you out of the world,
[00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:54.980]   therefore the world hates you.
[00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:57.400]   And I know, take it from me, a fellow people pleaser,
[00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:59.900]   my people pleasers, you're like, but no,
[00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:01.580]   I want everyone to love me.
[00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:04.240]   No haters, good vibes only, positivity.
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:08.600]   But it cannot be at the expense of your faith.
[00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:13.660]   You cannot seek to please man over pleasing God.
[00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:17.500]   We see here that Christians living out a radical faith
[00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:20.780]   are called to look different.
[00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:23.360]   TA, one of our teaching pastors here at Watermark
[00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:25.480]   said something two Sundays ago that really stuck with me.
[00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:28.740]   He said, hey, if your life makes perfect sense
[00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:31.500]   to the unbeliever, then something is terribly wrong.
[00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:35.780]   If your life makes perfect sense to the unbeliever,
[00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:38.820]   then something is terribly wrong.
[00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:41.720]   And if right now, I think if I followed you
[00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:46.660]   into some of your workplaces and I asked your coworkers,
[00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:50.280]   hey, he's a Christian, why don't you wanna be like him?
[00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:52.940]   They'd be like, he's a Christian?
[00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:57.500]   They'd be like, wait, why would I need God
[00:17:57.500 --> 00:17:58.960]   when clearly he doesn't?
[00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:02.500]   You have to ask yourself, if right now I went
[00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:04.980]   into your spaces of influence and I asked the people
[00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:07.740]   around you, what's different about this person?
[00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:08.740]   What would they say?
[00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:14.740]   Would you look any different to the world?
[00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:17.820]   Because if you're a Christian today,
[00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:21.740]   you should not feel like you are home.
[00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:24.060]   You should feel out of place.
[00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:24.880]   Why?
[00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:26.540]   Because this isn't our place.
[00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:28.020]   We live for heaven.
[00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:29.540]   That's our home.
[00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:32.780]   So you should not feel like this is it.
[00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:34.100]   Christian, this is not it.
[00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:35.740]   There is so much more.
[00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:37.340]   And so until then, yeah, you're gonna feel
[00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:38.860]   a little uncomfortable.
[00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:40.660]   Can I get a volunteer like right in the middle?
[00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:41.500]   Is that Gabe?
[00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:42.320]   There you are, yeah.
[00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:43.620]   Stand up, Gabriel.
[00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:44.460]   Stand up.
[00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:47.460]   (audience cheering)
[00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:54.220]   How you feeling?
[00:18:54.220 --> 00:19:00.060]   Nervous?
[00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:01.420]   A little uncomfortable.
[00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:03.700]   Everyone's looking at you.
[00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:04.780]   You're probably starting to sweat
[00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:06.480]   in different regions of your body.
[00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:09.440]   ♪ Welcome to my life ♪
[00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:10.400]   Yeah, it's hard up here, okay?
[00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:11.240]   See how it feels?
[00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:14.320]   It's getting a little more.
[00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:22.280]   Everyone else is sitting.
[00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:25.760]   And right now there's something in you naturally
[00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:27.680]   that's wanting to sit.
[00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:28.520]   Don't.
[00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:32.200]   (audience laughing)
[00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:33.840]   I know we read this and we're like, wow,
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:35.080]   Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego,
[00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:36.440]   what great men of faith.
[00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:38.000]   I can tell you when everyone else went down,
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.520]   I bet it was hard to stay up.
[00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:42.520]   I bet it felt uncomfortable.
[00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:46.800]   I bet that they began to sweat and get nervous.
[00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:47.640]   You can sit down.
[00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:48.480]   Give it up for Gabriel real quick.
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:51.480]   (audience cheering)
[00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:55.480]   But here's the reality, guys.
[00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:58.960]   When you go to work, when you go to your master's program,
[00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:01.080]   when you go to your sphere of influence,
[00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:04.680]   back home to your family, that should be your reality.
[00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:08.120]   If you look just like everyone else,
[00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:11.480]   I would ask you, is your faith real?
[00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:15.560]   Because we as Christians, what we see here
[00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:18.040]   is that it's not a matter of if, but when.
[00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:19.840]   You will experience testing
[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:22.200]   because you will look different.
[00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:24.920]   But remember, you are not alone.
[00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:26.920]   There is a Savior, His name is Jesus,
[00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:30.740]   who walked the walk for us, that the world hated Him too.
[00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:35.280]   And like we sung earlier, He hung on the cross,
[00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:38.160]   He defeated sin, and He rose from the grave.
[00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:41.080]   So that way, today, when the world looks at us
[00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:43.560]   and sees that we're different, it's like, is it true?
[00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:45.920]   I'm gonna give you one more chance or you're fired.
[00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:47.080]   I'm gonna give you one more chance
[00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:48.680]   or you're never hanging out with us again.
[00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:50.920]   I'm gonna give you one more chance
[00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:53.560]   or this relationship is over.
[00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:57.400]   When you get to that moment, will you stand or will you bow?
[00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:02.880]   There are people in this room who have lost jobs
[00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:06.960]   because they have stood up for their faith.
[00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:09.240]   And I wanna say, I'm so proud of you.
[00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:12.380]   God is so honored by that.
[00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:17.440]   The world is looking and they're watching.
[00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:20.440]   And when you're tested in how you respond,
[00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:21.640]   that's what they're attracted to
[00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:22.600]   and that's what they're following.
[00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:26.160]   So I'm asking you, does your faith look any different?
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:30.120]   To these moments, these defining moments that are hard
[00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:31.580]   and decision has to be made,
[00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:34.240]   the Christian's response should be faith encouraged.
[00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:36.900]   The world's response, fear and conformity.
[00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:41.360]   Everyone else was found bowing down, listening to the king,
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:43.480]   but the Christian stood in faith.
[00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:44.940]   They said, we will not bow.
[00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:49.200]   How did they have such assurance
[00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:51.880]   knowing that on the other end was the fire?
[00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:53.320]   How did they do it?
[00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:56.520]   Because they had faith.
[00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:59.320]   Hebrews chapter 11 defines faith like this.
[00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:01.760]   Now faith is confidence in what we hope for
[00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:05.920]   and assurance about what we do not see.
[00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:09.360]   They could not see if God would save them from the fire,
[00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:12.320]   but it did not matter because they were assured
[00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:14.820]   that God would be with them.
[00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:17.520]   Whether it was the fire, whether it was on land
[00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:20.500]   or whether it was in heaven, God would not leave them
[00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:22.560]   because they know that he would never leave them
[00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:23.400]   or forsake us.
[00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:24.560]   That's not who he is.
[00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:27.020]   He is always present.
[00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:32.020]   So because of that, they were able to stand and be different
[00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:33.680]   although everyone else bowed.
[00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:35.880]   How were they so assured?
[00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:39.520]   Because they had the right informing of their faith,
[00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:41.320]   which leads me to point two.
[00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:44.640]   A faith that's on fire must be rightly informed.
[00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:47.280]   Verse 16, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego replied,
[00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:50.680]   you know, he says, is it true that you won't bow?
[00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:52.040]   I'm gonna give you one more chance
[00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:54.600]   or I'm throwing you in the fire to be burned alive.
[00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:56.200]   And here's what they say.
[00:22:56.200 --> 00:23:01.080]   I mean, this is crazy when you think about it.
[00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:03.140]   The face of death, here's what they say.
[00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:04.920]   It's almost as if they're laughing.
[00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:05.760]   They're so at peace.
[00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:07.560]   Oh, Nebuchadnezzar, we do not need
[00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:09.940]   to defend ourselves before you.
[00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:11.640]   If we are thrown into the blazing furnace,
[00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:14.600]   the God whom we serve is able to save us.
[00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:18.640]   Notice that they said that he is able, not that he will.
[00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:19.480]   He's able.
[00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:22.640]   That was enough for them.
[00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:25.400]   He will rescue us from your power, your majesty,
[00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:28.120]   but even if he doesn't, but even if he doesn't,
[00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:31.760]   but even if he doesn't, we want to make it clear to you,
[00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:34.760]   your majesty, that we will never serve your gods
[00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:37.980]   or worship the gold statue you have set up.
[00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:40.820]   What we see here is that these men's faith
[00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:42.980]   was rightly informed by what?
[00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:45.720]   God's word and God's character.
[00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:51.060]   God's sufficient word and God's never changing character.
[00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:51.900]   How do we see that?
[00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:52.720]   Look at their response.
[00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:55.200]   Response number one, they say, oh, Nebuchadnezzar,
[00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:58.520]   we do not need to defend ourselves before you.
[00:23:58.520 --> 00:23:59.620]   What does that say that they know
[00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:01.000]   about the character of God?
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.440]   They're saying we don't need to defend ourselves
[00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:06.500]   because our God is a defender.
[00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:09.680]   Response number two, if we are thrown
[00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:11.960]   into the blazing furnace, the God whom we serve
[00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:13.200]   is able to save us.
[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:15.800]   He will rescue us from your power.
[00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:19.640]   They're saying, hey, the saving isn't on us.
[00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:20.800]   We don't have to save ourselves
[00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:23.440]   because our God is a rescuer.
[00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:24.760]   It's a part of his character.
[00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:28.000]   He defends and he rescues the oppressed.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.160]   Response number three, but even if he doesn't,
[00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:34.160]   I think that part is really challenging for us today,
[00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:35.280]   especially in America.
[00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:40.480]   We have created a comfortable Christianity
[00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:42.620]   that doesn't want to say this line.
[00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:47.260]   But even if he doesn't, we wanna make it clear to you
[00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:49.040]   that we will never serve your gods
[00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:51.160]   or worship the gold statue you have set up.
[00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:52.940]   What they're saying with that response is
[00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:56.640]   we will be obedient to our God, the God,
[00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:58.720]   despite the outcome.
[00:24:58.720 --> 00:24:59.640]   Why?
[00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:02.800]   Because they knew that our God is the ultimate king.
[00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:06.120]   You might be king on earth, but we serve a higher king,
[00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:08.840]   the king of majesty, the alpha and the omega,
[00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:10.280]   the beginning and the end.
[00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:14.720]   His name is God almighty, and that's who we serve.
[00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:17.360]   So even if he doesn't give us our desired outcome
[00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:20.240]   of staying alive, we will never bow down.
[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:22.480]   So you might as well put us in the fire.
[00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:28.380]   Their response informed what they believed.
[00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:30.300]   That's what we know what they believe
[00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:31.700]   by the way they responded,
[00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:35.540]   because God's word and God's character
[00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:37.260]   is what informed their faith.
[00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:38.840]   The reason why we know this at this time,
[00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:40.620]   we don't know how many books of the Old Testament
[00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:42.180]   these guys had to study and know.
[00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:45.260]   We know they had the first five books of the Bible.
[00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:47.380]   And by these responses, what I'm seeing them say is,
[00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:52.180]   hey, we know that the God who fulfilled his promise
[00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:56.480]   to Abraham, the father of Israel, is the same God today.
[00:25:56.480 --> 00:26:00.680]   We know the God who took Israel out of Egypt
[00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:04.440]   through 10 miraculous plagues and split the Red Sea
[00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:08.800]   for our people to walk through is the same God today.
[00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:12.960]   We know that God is faithful, that he breaks down the walls,
[00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:16.720]   that he wins wars, that he makes ways.
[00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:18.460]   That's who our God is.
[00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:21.280]   And because of that, because we've read it and we believe it
[00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:23.960]   and because that God is the same God today,
[00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:25.840]   we will never bow.
[00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:30.160]   And the same God who was the God of Israel
[00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:31.920]   whenever they were in slavery to Egypt,
[00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:34.160]   the God of Israel when they were enslaved
[00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:37.840]   to the Babylonian empire is the same God today for you.
[00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:39.840]   When you are underneath the impression
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:42.900]   of the darkness of this world, of culture,
[00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:44.320]   of people who are telling you
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:46.880]   that you have to go this way or else,
[00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:52.920]   you have to know what informs my faith is God's word
[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:56.320]   and God's never-changing character.
[00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:58.600]   I think a lot of us, when we get to these moments
[00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:00.520]   of defining moments in our life,
[00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:02.840]   the reason why we crumble is because sadly,
[00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:04.160]   we don't know God's character
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:05.800]   because we don't know God's word.
[00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:08.360]   We know a quote on Instagram.
[00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:12.600]   We know a pastor's one-minute clip.
[00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:16.480]   We know little bits of sermons that are fed to us.
[00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:19.440]   We remember the one sentence that we wrote down,
[00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:22.700]   but these guys clearly had spent time knowing God's word,
[00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:25.440]   therefore, they had a very real view of his character
[00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:27.600]   and that's what dictated their right response
[00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:29.780]   to these defining moments 'cause their faith was informed
[00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:31.080]   by something that doesn't change.
[00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:34.560]   But today, so many people's faith is informed
[00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:38.700]   by their feelings, by their emotions,
[00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:42.320]   by their experiences, by their opinions,
[00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:46.600]   and those things, those things are the improper way.
[00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:50.800]   They are the wrong way to inform your faith.
[00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:51.640]   Why?
[00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:53.640]   All of those things change.
[00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:56.600]   Your feelings, you're like Nebuchadnezzar, all right?
[00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:58.240]   You're hot, then you're cold, yes, then you're no,
[00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:01.880]   and then you're out, up, then you're down, all the things.
[00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:04.000]   Feelings make terrible gods.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:09.160]   Emotions, yeah, they're real, they're there,
[00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:13.000]   but they are not what dictate your faith.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.880]   Experiences, so many of you have experienced,
[00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:17.180]   the reason why you come to the porch,
[00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:18.520]   but you're out on church and you're like,
[00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:20.400]   I don't need to go to church to be a Christian,
[00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:23.540]   is because you've let one experience,
[00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:26.760]   one experience of church hurt, which hello,
[00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:28.260]   the reason why that church hurt exists
[00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:29.800]   because you're a broken person
[00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:31.200]   interacting with broken people,
[00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:35.080]   therefore, that is what causes oftentimes dysfunction,
[00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:37.720]   you let that experience inform your faith,
[00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:39.560]   and so now you're out on church
[00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:41.600]   because an experience guides your life.
[00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:47.020]   We need to stop projecting our experiences onto God.
[00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:48.760]   Because your dad left you
[00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:51.680]   does not mean that your God will leave you.
[00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:54.000]   Because that person cheated on you and left you
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.980]   does not mean that God will forsake you.
[00:28:55.980 --> 00:28:59.480]   God is not that experience, God is not that person,
[00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:02.800]   he is the only thing that is available
[00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:05.120]   and fully capable of informing your faith
[00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:07.700]   because he's the only thing that never changes.
[00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:12.520]   That's why his word and his never changing character
[00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:15.640]   are the right ways to inform your faith,
[00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:18.720]   these guys clearly understood that.
[00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:23.960]   Second Timothy 3.16 says that all scripture,
[00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:27.340]   all scripture is breathed out by God,
[00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:28.680]   that everything you read the Bible
[00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:32.440]   is inspired and breathed out by God,
[00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:35.080]   and it can be used for teaching, for correcting,
[00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:38.740]   and for training in all righteousness.
[00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:40.120]   That means that it is complete,
[00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:42.640]   the Bible says it's complete and lacking nothing.
[00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:44.600]   You don't need to add anything to it,
[00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:47.120]   you don't need to take away anything from it.
[00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:48.280]   But the reason why we do,
[00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:50.400]   the reason why we would like ourselves
[00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:52.520]   to be gods of our life,
[00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:54.960]   the reason why we want our feelings and our experiences
[00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:58.280]   to inform our faith is because we get to decide
[00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:00.160]   when we are in and out with God,
[00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:01.920]   and we get to decide when we wanna pick
[00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:04.800]   what parts of the Bible that we wanna follow.
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:07.840]   Because if my feelings and how I feel today
[00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:09.960]   get to determine how I respond to God,
[00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:13.080]   that's much more easier and comfortable
[00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:15.520]   than relying on what he says is best for me.
[00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:17.340]   So if I wake up today
[00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:21.520]   and I feel like walking rightly with God, then I will,
[00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:24.720]   but if I feel lonely and sad,
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:27.680]   then yeah, I'll go hook up with that person
[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:29.760]   because my feelings inform my faith.
[00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:33.800]   Those things are the wrong way to inform,
[00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:35.160]   the right way to inform your faith.
[00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:36.520]   If you're gonna have a faith on fire,
[00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:38.400]   it must be rightly informed.
[00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:41.280]   You inform it with God's sufficient word
[00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:44.060]   and his never-changing character.
[00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:49.920]   The last thing to have a faith on fire that you need,
[00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:53.200]   a faith on fire produces action.
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:58.040]   We see in this story that a faith on fire produces action.
[00:30:58.040 --> 00:30:58.880]   Look at this.
[00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:03.640]   They go through all this stuff, they say all these things,
[00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:04.920]   and then in verse 21,
[00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:09.880]   they tied them up and they threw them into the furnace,
[00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:12.080]   fully dressed in their pants, turbans,
[00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:13.480]   robes, and other garments,
[00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:15.560]   and because the king in his anger
[00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:17.480]   had demanded such a hot fire in the furnace,
[00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:18.760]   the flames killed the soldiers
[00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:20.960]   as they threw the three men in.
[00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:25.000]   So Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, securely tied,
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.360]   fell into the roaring flames.
[00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:32.840]   Their faith was not just talk.
[00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:34.040]   Talk is cheap.
[00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:37.300]   They were men of action.
[00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:41.160]   We always say actions speak louder than words.
[00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:44.560]   Here are the kind of actions in these men.
[00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:46.640]   These men are displaying the kind of action
[00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:48.080]   that follows real faith.
[00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:50.720]   Here are the kind of actions that follow a false faith,
[00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:52.280]   a fake faith.
[00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:55.160]   God, I trust you with my life.
[00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:59.400]   Guy walks by.
[00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:01.160]   I'm kind of tired of singleness, you know.
[00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:03.600]   God's kind of taking a long time.
[00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:05.040]   He doesn't go to the church.
[00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:06.840]   He doesn't read his Bible.
[00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:09.800]   Calls himself a Christian, good stable career.
[00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:11.040]   He's enough for me.
[00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:12.320]   Walks over here.
[00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:17.040]   But you just said in faith,
[00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:18.880]   God, I trust you with my life.
[00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:20.280]   And then when something walks by
[00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:22.040]   that clearly isn't God's best
[00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:24.680]   and your actions take you over here,
[00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:26.040]   something's off.
[00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:30.680]   Real faith are followed by actions.
[00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:33.280]   What you do points to what you actually believe.
[00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:34.960]   And so that action tells me,
[00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:36.760]   no, God, I don't trust you.
[00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:38.040]   You're taking too long.
[00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:40.480]   All my roommates are married with two kids.
[00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:43.000]   So I'm taking matter into my own hands.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:44.920]   You can be God when I need blessings,
[00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:47.040]   but I'm gonna be God when I get what I want,
[00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:48.480]   when I wanna get what I want.
[00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:53.600]   Another example, God, I wanna go all in with you.
[00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:56.360]   We come to the porch and we're like,
[00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:59.500]   hey guys, God would call you to be a part of a local body,
[00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:02.240]   to serve the church, to serve the needs of the city,
[00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:04.560]   to be in community, to read his word.
[00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:05.400]   And you're like, what?
[00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:07.760]   Sundays are Miami days.
[00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:08.880]   Self-care.
[00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:12.040]   Like I'm so busy Monday through Friday,
[00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:14.560]   and then I go out for different things on Saturday.
[00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:15.940]   I get the pump in on Sunday.
[00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:17.080]   Like I just don't got time for that.
[00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:18.320]   I'll stream at home.
[00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:22.480]   But you just said, God, I wanna be all in.
[00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:25.360]   God, I want to be intimate with you.
[00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:27.320]   God, I want a thriving relationship with you.
[00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:31.660]   I wanna be Christ-like, yet you don't have time.
[00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:35.140]   Your actions point to what you believe.
[00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:38.700]   God, I want to stop partying.
[00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:42.040]   I just, I don't know how it happens.
[00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:44.100]   I keep hooking up with people.
[00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:46.020]   I wanna stop.
[00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:46.900]   You going out tonight?
[00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:48.300]   Yeah, meet you there at six.
[00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:53.220]   I'm like, and here's the issue.
[00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:57.080]   When you're feeling like the next morning,
[00:33:57.080 --> 00:34:00.060]   like guilt after sex, when you're feeling that,
[00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:01.760]   you're like, God, I wanna be done.
[00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:05.120]   And then the lonely hours come the next Saturday.
[00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:09.320]   And you're sitting there, you get the text.
[00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:10.600]   Hey, you wanna go out tonight?
[00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:12.520]   And you're like, I know I shouldn't.
[00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:13.920]   I know I shouldn't.
[00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:16.040]   That's gonna lead to me drinking too much.
[00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:17.960]   That's gonna lead me to getting some liquid courage.
[00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:19.840]   That's gonna lead me to Snapchatting that person
[00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:21.840]   and ending up at their house at 3 a.m.
[00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:24.520]   And I'm gonna just get into this vicious cycle.
[00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:26.040]   And I look at your actions.
[00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:28.560]   And if actions point to what you believe,
[00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:30.360]   what does that say about your faith?
[00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:34.340]   Do you have faith that God
[00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:36.480]   will fully satisfy your every need?
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:38.520]   That God knows that you need before you even ask,
[00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:40.220]   so you don't have to go searching?
[00:34:40.220 --> 00:34:44.960]   James 2:17 says, "So also faith by itself,
[00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:47.600]   "if it does not have works, is dead."
[00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:54.020]   Faith by itself, if it does not have action, is dead faith.
[00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:55.320]   Fake faith.
[00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:58.880]   And I think I know what the problem is.
[00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:02.160]   Like, there are a lot of motivational speeches out there
[00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:05.160]   that encourage people like to have fiery faith.
[00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:08.000]   And yeah, I wanna be marked by courageous decisions.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:09.440]   And I wanna go all in with God.
[00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:10.780]   And I want fiery faith.
[00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:14.080]   You want it until it actually calls you into the fire.
[00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:17.520]   You wanna be known as someone with a fiery faith
[00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:19.080]   until it's time to step up.
[00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:20.720]   And it's really easy to proclaim it
[00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:23.320]   on the outside of the furnace looking in
[00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:25.080]   until you start getting tied up.
[00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:27.720]   I mean, these guys did it all right, right?
[00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:29.660]   They were like, "We're not gonna bow."
[00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:30.640]   They didn't bow.
[00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:32.480]   "Our God will save us.
[00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:33.600]   "Our God will save us.
[00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:35.500]   "Our God will save us, right God?"
[00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:36.920]   Tied the knot, tied the knot.
[00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:39.040]   Like, "God, our God will save us."
[00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:40.760]   And they start to swing them.
[00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:42.560]   And they're like, "Really, God?"
[00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:45.260]   And they started throwing them in like a stack of logs.
[00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:51.280]   So many of us claim to want a faith on fire
[00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:54.520]   until it calls us to put some money where our mouth is,
[00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:56.360]   until action.
[00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:59.520]   We would rather have the perks of Christianity,
[00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:01.960]   but not the persecution that comes with it.
[00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:04.960]   We want salvation, but without suffering.
[00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:06.240]   We want amazing grace,
[00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:08.720]   but just enough to cover up our guilt,
[00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:10.940]   not to actually change our lives.
[00:36:10.940 --> 00:36:13.760]   We want to be sons and daughters of God,
[00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:15.920]   but still cousins with the world.
[00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:19.240]   We want to be known as people of radical faith
[00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:21.680]   until it calls us out into radical obedience,
[00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:23.560]   until it calls us into the fire.
[00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:25.980]   But I'm telling you, if you want real faith,
[00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:28.240]   then you're gonna get some heat.
[00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:31.400]   You're gonna get some pressure from the world.
[00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:33.720]   And faith is followed by action.
[00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:35.240]   And so I'm asking you,
[00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:37.940]   what do your actions say about your faith?
[00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:40.240]   If what you do points to what you believe,
[00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:41.140]   how are you doing?
[00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:47.080]   Me and my wife, we, since being married,
[00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:50.140]   girls have the craziest fears.
[00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:52.440]   It's crazy.
[00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:55.460]   And I started noticing, she came from Arkansas,
[00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:59.400]   and she's in Texas, and she wasn't driving on the highways.
[00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:03.800]   And she told me, by the way, I'm afraid of Dallas highways,
[00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:05.240]   so I'm not gonna drive on them.
[00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:07.160]   And so now sometimes she tries to be sweet,
[00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:09.480]   and she's like, "Can we like, want me to drive?"
[00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:10.560]   And I'm like, "Heck no, girl.
[00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:12.860]   "A 20-minute trip takes 50 minutes with you,
[00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:15.280]   "running all these back roads."
[00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:18.040]   And so what I'll do is I'll acknowledge the fear,
[00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:19.640]   and she loves this, let me tell you.
[00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:20.680]   I'll acknowledge the fear,
[00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:22.560]   and I'll try to get to the root of it.
[00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:25.560]   Because I'm like, "Wait, this is not okay.
[00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:28.840]   "You are my wife, you can drive on a highway, all right?"
[00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:31.640]   And so I'll say, "Hey, why are you afraid
[00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:33.440]   "to drive on highways?"
[00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:35.920]   And she'll go, "Because there's a lot of cars going fast."
[00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:37.680]   Today, actually, she threw me a new one.
[00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:39.040]   She said, "Because what if I faint?"
[00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:39.880]   I'm like.
[00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:42.480]   (congregation laughing)
[00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:44.160]   Like, am I married to a fainting girl?
[00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:46.000]   Like, what's going on?
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   What if I faint?
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:48.200]   People just fainting now?
[00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:49.040]   She's like, "What if I faint?"
[00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:50.880]   I'm like, "All right, okay, so what if you faint?"
[00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:52.680]   And she's like, "Well, then I'll get in a wreck."
[00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:54.880]   And I'm like, "Okay, well, what if you get in a wreck?"
[00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:56.780]   And she's like, "Well, then it'll hurt."
[00:37:56.780 --> 00:37:58.920]   And I'm like, "Okay, well, what if it hurts?"
[00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:00.900]   And she's like, "Well, then I'll go to the hospital."
[00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:01.880]   I'm like, "Well, what if you go to the hospital?"
[00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:05.360]   She's like, "I'll either get saved, I'll either heal."
[00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:06.200]   I was like, "Or?"
[00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:08.360]   And she'll go, "Or I'll die."
[00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:12.080]   And I'm like, "Okay, okay.
[00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:14.040]   "What if you die?"
[00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:17.960]   And she kind of smiles every time.
[00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:19.280]   'Cause it always ends to death.
[00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:20.520]   That's the root fear, death.
[00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:23.600]   (congregation laughing)
[00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:24.960]   I'm like, "So what if you die?"
[00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:27.680]   And she smiles and she goes, "I'll be in heaven."
[00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:30.120]   (congregation laughing)
[00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:34.960]   That's silly, but y'all, that is powerful, all right?
[00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:38.360]   Because the problem with us today,
[00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:40.240]   the problem with me today,
[00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:43.600]   is there's something in me that doesn't actually believe
[00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:46.520]   that heaven is better than earth.
[00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:49.080]   There's something in me that when I look at my actions,
[00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:52.320]   I'm living as if earth is the end goal.
[00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:55.320]   I'm looking like conformity and having people like me
[00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:57.720]   is where the treasure is found.
[00:38:57.720 --> 00:39:00.520]   I'm looking like success and more money
[00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:05.200]   and more opportunities, that's where satisfaction lies.
[00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:08.320]   That shows me that I think heaven is it,
[00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:10.240]   or I think earth is it.
[00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:15.560]   But I need to tell myself,
[00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:18.640]   you need to tell yourself in these moments of opportunity
[00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:22.080]   where you need to choose fear or faith,
[00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:26.280]   when heaven is the reward, suffering is the gain.
[00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:29.520]   Testing is the opportunity.
[00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:33.160]   When the world is bowing, standing up for what's right,
[00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:35.080]   even though it might result in suffering,
[00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:38.240]   you have to see that as the advantage.
[00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:39.680]   Because like Paul says,
[00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:41.400]   it's when we're weak that he's made strong.
[00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:44.400]   His power is made perfect through our weakness.
[00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:50.880]   These guys were thrown into a fire, thrown into a fire.
[00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:53.440]   And now this was the opportunity
[00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:55.640]   where God got to flex his power.
[00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:58.480]   And he wants to do the same with you.
[00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:01.440]   But you have to go, man, when I am freaking out,
[00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:02.680]   when the rest of the world is bowing down,
[00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:05.640]   when the rest of the world is doing this, I will not bow.
[00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:09.040]   I am not afraid of what lies on the other end
[00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:10.840]   of not compromising and bowing down.
[00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:13.720]   I'm not afraid, even if it leads to death,
[00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:17.620]   even if it leads to death, being with God is greater.
[00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:19.960]   I have to tell myself all that all the time.
[00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:22.240]   Being with God is greater.
[00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:27.040]   And these men, they clearly understood.
[00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:30.660]   They clearly had a right perspective
[00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:33.120]   of what it looks like to be marked by faith
[00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:35.500]   and where faith could lead them.
[00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:36.660]   And they were willing to say,
[00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:38.280]   but even if he doesn't save us,
[00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:41.800]   to be with our King is greater than being here.
[00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:46.780]   And once they were thrown into the fire,
[00:40:46.780 --> 00:40:48.080]   that's when God showed up.
[00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:53.980]   Verse 24, "But suddenly Nebuchadnezzar jumped in amazement
[00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:55.360]   "and exclaimed to his advisors,
[00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:57.280]   "didn't we tie up three men
[00:40:57.280 --> 00:40:58.860]   "and throw them into the furnace?
[00:40:58.860 --> 00:41:00.400]   "Yes, we certainly did.
[00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:03.700]   "Look, he shouted, I see four men
[00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:06.100]   "unbound walking around in the fire unharmed.
[00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:07.940]   "And the fourth looks like a God.
[00:41:07.940 --> 00:41:10.320]   "The fourth looks like a God.
[00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:12.020]   "And then Nebuchadnezzar came as close as he could
[00:41:12.020 --> 00:41:13.740]   "to the door of the flaming furnace.
[00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:15.860]   "And he shouted, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego,
[00:41:15.860 --> 00:41:18.800]   "servants of the most high God, come out, come here.
[00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:21.220]   "So they got out and they stepped out of the fire.
[00:41:21.220 --> 00:41:23.260]   "And then all the people gathered around
[00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:25.560]   "and they saw that the fire had not even touched them.
[00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:27.200]   "They didn't even smell like smoke.
[00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:29.920]   "And he said, praise to the God of Shadrach, Meshach,
[00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:30.840]   "and Abednego.
[00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:33.240]   "He sent his angel to rescue his servants,
[00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:36.300]   "just like they said he would, who trusted in him.
[00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:38.680]   "They defiled the king's commands.
[00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:41.800]   "They defied the king's command and were willing to die
[00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:43.940]   "rather than serve or worship any God
[00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:45.800]   "except their own God."
[00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:48.280]   The point of having great faith
[00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:51.320]   is to not make your name more great.
[00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:53.560]   The point of having great faith
[00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:57.280]   is to point to the victory of your great God.
[00:41:57.280 --> 00:42:00.360]   That's why he calls us to have radical faith.
[00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:03.200]   That's why he calls us to step out into the unknown
[00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:05.640]   so that way when you choose to surrender
[00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:08.160]   in radical obedience despite outcomes,
[00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:10.720]   that's when he can put his glory on display through you
[00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:12.640]   to the hurting and lost world.
[00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:14.040]   And if you will choose,
[00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:17.460]   if you will choose to let your suffering define your God,
[00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:19.440]   if you will let yourself choose
[00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:21.200]   to let your God define your suffering
[00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:22.800]   and not your suffering to define your God,
[00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:24.160]   watch what he'll do.
[00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:27.000]   Watch what he'll do with that obedience.
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:28.160]   He will take that moment
[00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:30.080]   and he will use it to display his goodness
[00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:33.120]   and his power and his glory to the world through you.
[00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:35.160]   Just like he did through these guys.
[00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:38.240]   Notice, they didn't have to say anything profound.
[00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:39.680]   They didn't have to say anything to change their mind.
[00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:42.120]   They just simply had to live it out.
[00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:43.800]   Their faith had action.
[00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:46.240]   And when they put that action into practice,
[00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:51.240]   that's when the king said, "Wow, look at this God.
[00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:54.340]   "Look at this God.
[00:42:54.340 --> 00:42:59.040]   "He is the only God worthy of worship.
[00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:03.080]   "And if you, if you, when compromise
[00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:04.740]   "and those opportunities come,
[00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:07.880]   "will stand up and be different,
[00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:11.020]   "if you will inform your faith correctly,
[00:43:11.020 --> 00:43:15.200]   "and if you will let your faith lead you to great action,
[00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:18.260]   "to point to your great God, watch what he will do."
[00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:21.020]   Watch what he will do.
[00:43:21.020 --> 00:43:24.080]   I don't know what your fire is.
[00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:26.020]   I don't know what your even if moment is,
[00:43:26.020 --> 00:43:27.880]   that even if God doesn't give a desired outcome,
[00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:28.720]   I'm gonna trust him.
[00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:30.840]   I don't know what that moment is.
[00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:33.240]   But what I do know is that if you choose to respond
[00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:37.680]   with real radical faith, watch what God will do.
[00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:39.400]   He will do the unthinkable.
[00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:43.440]   He will do exceedingly more than you could ever ask or think.
[00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:46.080]   He's just waiting for you to say yes.
[00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:48.880]   He's waiting for you to have real faith in him.
[00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:49.720]   Let's pray.
[00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:56.840]   God, I thank you that it's not because of our faith,
[00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:00.520]   it's not because of our decision,
[00:44:00.520 --> 00:44:04.280]   it's not because of our works that we are saved,
[00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:08.920]   but it's because you, God, sent your son down to earth
[00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:12.260]   to pay the ultimate price,
[00:44:12.260 --> 00:44:18.000]   because your son stepped into the fire of this world
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:21.160]   in sin and shame and brokenness,
[00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:24.600]   and defeated it by rising from the grave three days later.
[00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:29.440]   Because of that, we now can walk towards trials,
[00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:32.400]   we can walk towards persecution and suffering.
[00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:34.460]   We now can stand up when the rest of the world
[00:44:34.460 --> 00:44:35.480]   is bowing down.
[00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:39.600]   We can look different because of what you have done for us.
[00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:42.100]   And I pray that these people, that this generation,
[00:44:42.100 --> 00:44:44.040]   would see that the world is hurting
[00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:46.800]   and looking for something real, someone different,
[00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:50.640]   and may it start with the radical decisions in this room.
[00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:55.960]   I pray that me, my friends here tonight,
[00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:59.160]   that we'd be marked by people of real faith
[00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:02.600]   because you are a real God who wants to do real things
[00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:06.160]   through his people when they say yes to you.
[00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:08.640]   Would we respond right now with whatever it is
[00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:11.860]   that even if, even if you don't heal the cancer,
[00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:14.980]   even if you don't change things around,
[00:45:14.980 --> 00:45:16.600]   even if you don't provide the spouse,
[00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:18.780]   God, I trust you, God, I trust you.
[00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:21.820]   And then you would come and do, God, with that trust,
[00:45:21.820 --> 00:45:24.360]   you would come and do what only you can do tonight.
[00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:26.920]   Maybe respond right now.
[00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:28.880]   In the name that I pray, amen.
[00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:29.720]   Let's respond.
[00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:39.720]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
