[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:19.720]   - All right, all right, welcome to the porch.
[00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.040]   My name is Josiah and we are jumping into week three
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.020]   of Ephesians, introducing the new you.
[00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.860]   But before we get there, help me welcome our friends
[00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.880]   across the nation, our Porch Live locations,
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.960]   Porch Live Tulsa, Oklahoma, Boise, Idaho,
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.240]   Scottsdale, Arizona, and not but least,
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.920]   or was that right?
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.380]   Yeah, yeah, not but least, our friends right down the road,
[00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.960]   Fort Worth, Texas, come on, the Porch Live.
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:46.800]   Let's go.
[00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.720]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:51.760]   Love it.
[00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.320]   Well, hey, any iPhone users in the room tonight?
[00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.640]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.160]   Okay, all right, me too.
[00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.440]   Any Android?
[00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.700]   (audience cheering)
[00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:04.960]   You can be dismissed.
[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.240]   I'm playing, I'm playing.
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.240]   Is that one Android user on the group text
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.440]   that you can't name the texting thread, you know, that one?
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.540]   You know, you got to use group me instead?
[00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.480]   Oh man, Android people, got to love them.
[00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:25.780]   Hey, 15 years ago, about two and a half months ago,
[00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.640]   15 years ago, so two, excuse me, two months ago,
[00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.360]   we celebrated 15 years of this thing right here,
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.440]   the iPhone.
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.400]   The iPhone came out.
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.920]   I know you probably didn't know that, that's okay.
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.680]   A man named Steve Jobs had a vision, yeah, look at it,
[00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.320]   had a vision that he would create a phone
[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.480]   that would change everything,
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.900]   almost everything about our life.
[00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.040]   Like, it was crazy, like, I got to thinking,
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.980]   man, I was 24 years old, I know I just dated myself there.
[00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.560]   I was 24 years old in 2007 when the iPhone came out.
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.140]   And I just got to thinking, man,
[00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.140]   he used this one phone that began to change our culture.
[00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.700]   It began to change the way we communicate,
[00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.340]   the way we interact, and ultimately,
[00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.340]   he created this phone to change the world.
[00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.420]   Let me give you a few.
[00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.540]   It was the first modern touchscreen smartphone.
[00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.280]   It allowed us to basically carry a computer around
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.860]   that fit in the size of our hand.
[00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.140]   That's what he created,
[00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.620]   the first modern touchscreen smartphone.
[00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.100]   It put internet in our pockets,
[00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.160]   whether you have, you know, wifi or not,
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.300]   like, you have the internet at your disposal.
[00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.060]   We're connected all the time.
[00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.940]   Everything is now instant gratification.
[00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.380]   We now expect everything to be on demand.
[00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.540]   We take for granted that we have unlimited music
[00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.040]   and TV shows and movies and books on our phone.
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.020]   It turned all of us into wannabe photographers
[00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.540]   and influencers, right, man?
[00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.820]   It gave us platforms.
[00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.820]   Some of you really are influencers, praise God.
[00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.560]   Hopefully you're influencing the right thing.
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.660]   It transformed photography from a hobby to,
[00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.020]   man, there's not a day that goes by
[00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.820]   that you and I probably don't take a picture of something.
[00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.140]   I mean, we sit across the table with friends
[00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.020]   and we have fajitas and we wouldn't,
[00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.100]   it would never cross our mind 15 years ago
[00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:35.860]   to take a picture and share that with the world.
[00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.940]   We would just talk to each other, right?
[00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.040]   But we don't really do that anymore.
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.080]   The iPhone gave way to apps.
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.940]   Now there is more than two million apps in the App Store.
[00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.100]   It shaped modern social media.
[00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.320]   For a great part of my life,
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.940]   I would have to log on MySpace, anybody?
[00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.060]   Ooh, oh, a few, okay, older generation,
[00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.980]   let's go, millennials.
[00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.020]   Facebook, we'd have to log on from our computer.
[00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:07.580]   Now we just get to log on to social media from our phone.
[00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.280]   Yeah, come on.
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.880]   You can FaceTime with anyone around the world.
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.700]   There's navigation on your phone now.
[00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:15.900]   Like, this'll blow your mind.
[00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.300]   There was a thing called Maps.
[00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:21.900]   Like, it was a paper deal that you had
[00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.980]   that you would fold up or unfold,
[00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:26.480]   but you would put it in your glove box.
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:27.620]   Like, some of you are like, what?
[00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:28.460]   That's just crazy.
[00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:29.820]   I don't, really?
[00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:30.660]   Yeah.
[00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:36.720]   On top of that, like, it was 500 bucks when it came out.
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.540]   Like, that was unheard of.
[00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:40.500]   Like, I said, no, man, this isn't gonna get any traction.
[00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:41.340]   There's no way.
[00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.580]   Like, you can get the Razr or the BlackBerry,
[00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.260]   just sign a contract and it's almost free.
[00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.660]   And now we just drop one grand.
[00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.660]   You know, we just drop $1,000 on, you know, getting the phone.
[00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:56.900]   I start there tonight because in the same way,
[00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.180]   the iPhone and this one man, Steve Jobs,
[00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:01.500]   changed the world.
[00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.580]   It changed how we interact with each other.
[00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.940]   It changed how we spend our time.
[00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.540]   Like, the average person spends eight hours a day
[00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:12.020]   on their phone, which I'm not promoting, right?
[00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.720]   I'm just saying it changed everything.
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.060]   The way we talk.
[00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:21.380]   And tonight, like, we're gonna look at a passage
[00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.180]   in scripture, I believe it's one of the most powerful
[00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.800]   passages in all of the Bible.
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.680]   In Ephesians chapter two, tonight, that I believe
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.620]   has the power to change everything in our life.
[00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.280]   And for some of you, it has.
[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.060]   Like, it's changed the way you live.
[00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:38.400]   It's changed the way you talk.
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.680]   It's changed the way you date.
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.700]   It's changed the way you spend money.
[00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.520]   It changes the way you work.
[00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:50.100]   Like, it's changed the way you even use your time.
[00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:54.380]   In this passage, it paints the clearest depiction
[00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:57.320]   of the gospel, who is Jesus and what did he come to do.
[00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:02.320]   The gospel has the potential to change everything about us.
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:06.460]   And for some of us tonight, like, we don't believe this.
[00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:08.140]   Like, we don't believe this message
[00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:10.700]   and that's why some of us are gonna spend eternity
[00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:15.060]   apart from Jesus, separated from him forever and ever.
[00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:16.220]   In a place called hell.
[00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:19.900]   And that's sobering for some of us.
[00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.540]   But if you believe this, then it changes everything
[00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:24.100]   about your life.
[00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:26.300]   Ephesians two, starting in verse one.
[00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.100]   If you have your Bibles, you can turn them
[00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:29.220]   to Ephesians chapter two.
[00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:31.260]   It'll be up on the screen if you don't.
[00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.800]   We're gonna see who we were before Christ,
[00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:38.240]   what Christ has done and who we are now.
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.080]   Ephesians two.
[00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:43.660]   And you were dead in your trespasses and sins
[00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:46.140]   in which you once walked.
[00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:48.420]   Following the course of the world,
[00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:50.500]   following the prince of the power of the air,
[00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:55.300]   the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience.
[00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:58.060]   Among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh,
[00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:02.460]   carrying out the desires of the body and the mind.
[00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:04.340]   And we're by nature children of wrath
[00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:05.260]   like the rest of mankind.
[00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:06.100]   Point number one.
[00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:09.940]   Point number one, this is who we were.
[00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:11.220]   Who we were.
[00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:12.900]   We were dead, the Bible says.
[00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:15.060]   Not physical, but spiritual.
[00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:16.360]   Like we're separated from God.
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:17.200]   Why?
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:18.020]   Because of sin.
[00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:20.120]   Like dead in our trespasses and sins means
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:21.860]   that sin is not just an action,
[00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:23.840]   but it's a condition of our heart.
[00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:25.460]   Like sin isn't just something we do.
[00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:27.180]   Sin is something we are.
[00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:29.960]   And that's hard for some of us because we like
[00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:32.740]   just believing that this is just something we do.
[00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:34.180]   Because if it's just something that we do,
[00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:36.280]   then we can just pull our bootstraps up
[00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:38.680]   and white knuckle this thing and change our behavior
[00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:41.200]   and modify it and go to the self-help section
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:43.680]   at Barnes and Noble and just get some self-help books
[00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:46.300]   to help us build a better you.
[00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:51.460]   But we see that we're not sinners because we sin,
[00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:53.440]   we sin because we are sinners.
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:57.180]   It's in our nature, this text is saying.
[00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:01.120]   Dead in our trespasses and sins.
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:02.300]   Think about it like this one.
[00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:04.320]   This way, the iPhone, for example,
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:07.000]   or any phone, you plug it in.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.800]   I told you I had an iPhone, come on.
[00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:13.720]   You plug it in and it's charged up.
[00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:15.540]   You do that the night before like I do
[00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:16.780]   and then it's charged up for the day,
[00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:19.980]   but it only lives for so long and then what happens?
[00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:21.720]   It dies.
[00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:26.840]   It dies and this is like you and I,
[00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:28.200]   we're not independent beings,
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:31.240]   we're dependent beings on the God of creation,
[00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:33.360]   the one who's pumping breath into your lungs,
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:36.200]   is giving you a heart that beats and eyes that see.
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:38.860]   We're not independent from him,
[00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:41.160]   we are dependent on him.
[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:44.920]   And when we sin against him,
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:48.120]   it's as if we're unplugging from the source of life
[00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:49.880]   and the results are we're still alive,
[00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:52.240]   but we're in this cycle of death now
[00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.080]   and eventually we're gonna be disconnected
[00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:55.940]   from the source of life completely.
[00:08:55.940 --> 00:09:01.400]   This is how the Bible explains our deadness.
[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.000]   This is how the Bible explains our life.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   We can be living physically but dead spiritually.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.760]   And in the process of dying physically,
[00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:11.840]   you stand before God and then you experience eternal death
[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:15.120]   which is forever punishment away from God,
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.820]   separated from the grace of God
[00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:19.480]   instead of being connected to the grace of God.
[00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:21.880]   And listen, I warn you because I love you.
[00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:26.620]   Like this isn't a popular message of our day,
[00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:29.720]   but maybe God brought you into this place tonight
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:33.280]   to hear this message that could change everything
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:35.520]   about your life.
[00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:38.680]   The text explains why we're dead.
[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:43.680]   It says we're dead because we're following the world.
[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:45.640]   It goes on, it says we're following the course
[00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:47.920]   of this world and think of the world
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:51.080]   or think of culture as like this fast moving river.
[00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:54.200]   It's this strong current and has this deep undertow.
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.080]   And anything that goes into the river
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:58.080]   just gets swept downstream.
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:00.640]   The Bible's saying that this is the culture,
[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:03.280]   this is the world that when you jump in
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:04.760]   and you begin to follow the world,
[00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:08.080]   then it's just gonna take you down that path
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:09.160]   that the world goes down.
[00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:12.920]   That, you know, hey, that's just how they think.
[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:13.960]   Or that's just what they do.
[00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:16.400]   That's just, you know, how everyone acts
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:19.200]   and you just start seeing it as normal.
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:23.560]   And it's because what everyone else is doing
[00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:25.440]   and you just date like everyone else dates,
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:27.040]   you spend like everyone else spends.
[00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:29.760]   And in fact, the Bible says that there's a way
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:32.160]   that seems right to man, but there's not.
[00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:35.200]   It seems right to man, but that way ends in death.
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:40.000]   And so tonight we gotta get some altitude,
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.920]   we gotta get some perspective and understand
[00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:43.840]   that we're all born in that river
[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:45.320]   and we're all headed downstream.
[00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:47.880]   And for some of us, like we know what this feels like.
[00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:51.880]   For some of us that we've committed our life to Christ,
[00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:55.480]   our life is marked by a difficult swim
[00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:59.280]   against that strong current of the world and culture.
[00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:00.760]   Like some of you know what I'm talking about.
[00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:05.000]   Like it's easier for you to sleep around
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.720]   than it is to put your sexual desires in check
[00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:13.480]   and protect your purity for your future husband
[00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:14.320]   or your wife.
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:17.760]   Like it's easier for you to spend all your money
[00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:22.240]   on yourself instead of spending it on others
[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:24.480]   and furthering God's kingdom.
[00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:28.840]   Like it's easier for you to numb the pain of singleness
[00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:32.360]   by running to a two-dimensional image on your phone
[00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:34.240]   just to get a quick release rather than,
[00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:37.960]   man, get up from that place and pursue that woman.
[00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:43.200]   But you think, man, but I got rejected the last time
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:45.240]   or the last four times I went out on dates,
[00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:46.640]   it didn't work out.
[00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:49.960]   But that's not an excuse to keep pursuing
[00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:53.200]   a woman and being God's man.
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:57.480]   For some of you, the pain of hurt, the pain of suffering,
[00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:01.960]   it's easier for you just to numb it with the bottle,
[00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:06.320]   just run to alcohol instead of extending forgiveness
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:09.120]   for that person who hurts you.
[00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:13.600]   It's easier for you just to have a corrupt sexuality
[00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:15.880]   or correct morality than it is to repent
[00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:18.640]   and seek the Lord and grow by the grace of God.
[00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:27.080]   It's easier for you to build a platform on social media
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:30.880]   than to build God's kingdom.
[00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:36.280]   This is why the Bible says we're dead,
[00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:38.920]   because we're following the course of the world.
[00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:42.120]   It doesn't just say we're following the course of the world
[00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:44.040]   but it says we're following Satan,
[00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:45.680]   following the prince of the power of the air,
[00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:49.360]   the spirit that is now at work and the sons of disobedience.
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:52.960]   Not only are there God's people but there's Satan's people.
[00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:55.360]   Not only are there people that are submitted
[00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:57.380]   to the work of the Holy Spirit
[00:12:57.380 --> 00:12:58.760]   but there's also people that are submitted
[00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:00.720]   to Satan and his demons.
[00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:03.920]   And so the question begs is,
[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:06.760]   hey, how do you know if you're submitted to Satan?
[00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:08.640]   Well, just let me tell you this for a second.
[00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:11.080]   The motto of Satan is to worship Satan.
[00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:14.480]   It's not to worship Satan, it's to worship yourself.
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:16.340]   Self-worship.
[00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:18.320]   How do you know if you're following him?
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:19.400]   You just do you.
[00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:23.600]   You think about you.
[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:25.320]   You rise up thinking about you.
[00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:27.320]   You go to bed thinking about you.
[00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:29.720]   You live for you and that's all Satan
[00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:31.280]   is trying to get you to do.
[00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:33.800]   And listen, the Bible says that he disguises himself
[00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:35.840]   as an angel of light.
[00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:39.400]   And just because someone looks good on the outside
[00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:43.840]   and they have health and they have the materialism
[00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:46.080]   and they have the job and they have the money,
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:49.080]   that's not always blessings from God.
[00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:53.680]   Because Satan will lure you and I into thinking that,
[00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:55.920]   hey, as long as we get those things,
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:58.000]   I must be blessed, bro.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.440]   And it's like, whoa, he doesn't care
[00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:04.680]   as long as he gets that one thing, your soul.
[00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:07.320]   As long as he can distract you
[00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:10.520]   from the creator of the universe.
[00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:13.240]   Listen, this was my story.
[00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:18.480]   I found myself thinking that I had everything
[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:20.320]   by the world's standards.
[00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:22.200]   By the world's standards, I would say I had it.
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:27.200]   I had the girl and I had the sport.
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.280]   I was playing baseball in college
[00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:33.040]   and I had the affirmation and the accolades and the awards.
[00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:35.300]   And man, that was the life of the party.
[00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:38.920]   And listen, I ran to that drug
[00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:40.680]   just to get that temporal high.
[00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:43.920]   I had the car.
[00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:45.660]   I had the materialistic possessions.
[00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:46.840]   I had some money.
[00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:50.340]   And by the end of my junior year,
[00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:53.400]   I just began asking myself the question, is that it?
[00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:57.880]   And I remember grabbing a Bible that was dusty
[00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:00.900]   up in my bookshelf in my apartment.
[00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:04.920]   I was like, man, there's gotta be something more.
[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:06.480]   There's gotta be more that meets the eye.
[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:09.300]   If I got everything that the world calls success,
[00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:11.480]   I checked that box and I'm still feeling empty
[00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:14.400]   and unsatisfied, then what else is there?
[00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:17.740]   And I remember opening to 1 John chapter three.
[00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:21.020]   And it says in 1 John three, I believe verse four,
[00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:22.900]   it says that when you live in continuous sin,
[00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:25.460]   it shows that you belong to the devil
[00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:27.960]   who's been sinning since the beginning.
[00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:29.820]   But the son of God, Jesus, came to destroy
[00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:31.340]   the works of the devil.
[00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:32.980]   And those who have been born into God's family
[00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:36.100]   do not make a practice of sinning because God is in them.
[00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:40.420]   I realized that I was a child of the devil.
[00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:42.220]   Like that seems extreme, right?
[00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:44.500]   But the Bible says that when you make a practice of sinning,
[00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:46.380]   you keep doing the same thing over and over
[00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:49.260]   and not having any convictions to turn from that sin,
[00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.340]   then you are a child of the devil.
[00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:56.540]   And that night, man, my mouth was stopped
[00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:57.820]   of all justification.
[00:15:57.820 --> 00:16:01.140]   I was following the prince of the power of the air
[00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:03.700]   and everything on the outside, man, it looked good.
[00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:06.360]   I had it.
[00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:11.360]   I thought I reached success only to find myself
[00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:15.180]   in a place of depression, full of anxiety.
[00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:17.420]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:18.820]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:20.180]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:21.420]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:22.620]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:23.940]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:25.260]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:26.540]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:27.940]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:29.420]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:30.740]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:31.780]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:32.620]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:33.460]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:34.300]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:35.140]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:35.980]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:36.800]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:37.640]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:38.480]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:39.300]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:40.140]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:40.980]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:41.820]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:42.640]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:43.480]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:44.320]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:45.160]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:46.000]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:46.820]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:47.660]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:48.500]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:49.320]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:50.160]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:51.000]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:51.820]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:52.660]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:53.500]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:54.320]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:55.160]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:56.000]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:56.820]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:57.660]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:16:57.660 --> 00:16:58.500]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:16:58.500 --> 00:16:59.340]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:00.180]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:01.000]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:01.840]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:02.680]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:03.500]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:04.340]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:05.180]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:06.000]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:06.840]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:07.680]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:08.500]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:09.340]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:10.180]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:11.000]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:11.840]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:12.680]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:13.500]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:14.340]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:17:14.340 --> 00:17:15.180]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:16.000]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:16.840]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:17.680]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:18.520]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:19.340]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:20.180]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:21.020]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:21.840]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:22.680]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:23.520]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:24.340]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:25.180]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:26.020]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:26.840]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:27.680]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:28.520]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:29.340]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:30.180]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:31.020]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:31.840]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:32.680]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:33.520]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:34.340]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:35.180]   I was a child of the devil.
[00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:36.180]   It feels good.
[00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:45.320]   Bible says, it goes on, it says,
[00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:47.520]   "By nature, we're children of wrath
[00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:48.860]   like the rest of mankind."
[00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:52.860]   What that means is that we were born apart from God
[00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:55.100]   with a sinful nature.
[00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:58.140]   By the time we came out of our mama's womb,
[00:17:58.140 --> 00:17:59.640]   by nature, we're sinners.
[00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:01.780]   Like, you gotta understand this.
[00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:03.980]   When I was reading this, I'm like,
[00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:04.900]   this is just natural.
[00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:07.280]   This is just what we gravitate to, right?
[00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:11.060]   Like, this is, no one has to teach me how to sin.
[00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:13.700]   Like, I'm varsity.
[00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:15.440]   Like, that's just my life, right?
[00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:18.320]   Sin isn't just something we do.
[00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:20.360]   Sin is something we are.
[00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:26.940]   Psalm 51.5 backs up what I'm saying here.
[00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:30.420]   It says this, "Surely I was sinful at birth,
[00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:33.940]   sinful from the time my mother conceived me."
[00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:38.700]   And this became also real when my wife and I,
[00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:41.240]   Kathy, started to have kids about six years ago.
[00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:47.140]   And we birthed these kids, we, she did, praise God.
[00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:49.580]   (laughing)
[00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:50.620]   Bless you.
[00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:54.020]   If you're listening to this right now, babe, I love you.
[00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:55.660]   Thank you.
[00:18:55.660 --> 00:19:00.660]   But we began to start, you know, just being parents.
[00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:02.220]   And it was cute, man.
[00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:04.420]   Like, they come out of the room and they start crying,
[00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:05.940]   but then they put them on their chest.
[00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:08.940]   And man, this is one of the most amazing experiences
[00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:09.920]   of my life.
[00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:13.280]   But then they begin to grow up and become toddlers.
[00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:15.820]   And it's like you're raising a,
[00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:19.060]   you're raising a small terrorist.
[00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:20.540]   (laughing)
[00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:23.060]   I mean, that's kind of what it is, right?
[00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:26.020]   I mean, they scratch and they bite
[00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:28.900]   and they throw temper tantrums in the grocery store.
[00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:31.100]   And they're just, I mean,
[00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:33.140]   and I didn't have to teach them that.
[00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:36.180]   It's just, that's just what came natural, right?
[00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:37.460]   I mean, this was the other day.
[00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:39.300]   I mean, I'm trying, we're trying to put our,
[00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:41.260]   our four-year-old daughter down to sleep.
[00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:42.780]   And here's a picture.
[00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:44.880]   And she's just mean mugging us.
[00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:47.100]   This is Isabella and her sister in the back, man,
[00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:49.700]   she's doing, she's doing what all older brothers
[00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:51.220]   and sisters do, they're rule followers.
[00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:52.780]   So she's sleeping.
[00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:54.740]   And she's just looking at us like, now what?
[00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:55.580]   What are you going to say?
[00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:57.420]   You're going to make me go to sleep?
[00:19:57.420 --> 00:19:59.560]   It's like, what do we do with that?
[00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:02.580]   I guess just like, you know, put her outside and, you know,
[00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:05.700]   tell her to do some laps in the backyard.
[00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:07.300]   But she's just looking at us right there.
[00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:10.260]   And she's just like, man, what, what are you going to do?
[00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:11.900]   And I didn't have to teach her that.
[00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:14.020]   She's like, no, I'm not taking a nap.
[00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:15.940]   It's like, okay, I guess you're not taking a nap,
[00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:18.300]   but I'm going to give you a consequence for that.
[00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:20.700]   And so that's the crazy thing.
[00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:24.420]   Like it's been so good being a parent
[00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:27.120]   because you see this sinful nature
[00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:29.580]   from the time they were born.
[00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:32.720]   And listen, we can laugh at her rebellion.
[00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:34.680]   And it's kind of cute when you're five,
[00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:37.820]   but it's destructive when you're 25.
[00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:42.380]   And what she needs is a new nature.
[00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:44.140]   And the same is true for you and I.
[00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:47.980]   We were born with a sinful nature
[00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:51.160]   that has no cure apart from Christ.
[00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:54.220]   Let me illustrate it this way.
[00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:57.600]   (pages flipping)
[00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:03.640]   This is you, this is you and I, right?
[00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:07.920]   And the Bible says that God created everything to be perfect
[00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:11.160]   but he wanted to give you and I a choice.
[00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:13.020]   He wanted to give man, woman a choice.
[00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:16.200]   So he gave them one rule and you know what happened
[00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:17.960]   in the garden, they ate the apple
[00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:21.280]   and sin entered the world that sent creation into chaos.
[00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:23.960]   And so everything is broken because of sin.
[00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:26.080]   There's nothing that's just perfect.
[00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:28.620]   There's nothing holy, there's nothing right.
[00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:32.920]   Sin is a result of, suffering is a result of all sin,
[00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:33.760]   I should say.
[00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:37.600]   And so we feel it throughout our week,
[00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:41.120]   sometimes in small ways and sometimes in big ways.
[00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:44.440]   Whether it's cancer or someone mismanaging information
[00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:47.240]   about us and gossiping, like we feel the weight of sin.
[00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:50.480]   And so the Bible says that all have sinned
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:52.320]   and fallen short of the glory of God.
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:57.440]   And it's just, it's tainted our life.
[00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:59.080]   Like we're no longer perfect.
[00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:02.400]   Like we've fallen short of God's standard.
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:04.840]   His standard is perfection.
[00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:07.360]   The Bible says in Romans 6, 23,
[00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:09.160]   "For the wages of sin is death."
[00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:12.560]   It's brought death and destruction upon our life.
[00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:17.400]   And no matter what you try to do to make that right,
[00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:21.520]   the Bible says you just make a bigger mess
[00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:25.260]   and sin just continues to rule you more and more.
[00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:29.440]   And the Bible says in Romans 3, 11,
[00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:32.000]   "That there is none righteous, no not one."
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.760]   Like we've fallen so far away from God's standard,
[00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:38.220]   which is perfection.
[00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:42.440]   And the Bible says if we die in our sin,
[00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:44.320]   we forfeit the grace of God.
[00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:46.480]   And the only thing left for us is His wrath.
[00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:47.320]   Did you see that?
[00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:51.080]   Like earlier in the text, it says we're children of wrath.
[00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:52.800]   And listen, we don't like talking about wrath
[00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:54.040]   and we don't like talking about hell,
[00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:57.840]   but this book, Jesus talks about hell twice as much
[00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:00.640]   as he talks about heaven in Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.
[00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:05.320]   And I meet with young adults every single week
[00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:07.360]   and I just say, "Hey, if God allowed sin into heaven,
[00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:08.240]   "what would it look like?"
[00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:09.900]   And they're like, "Man, it would look broken,
[00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:14.180]   "like my life and the world would no longer,
[00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:17.520]   "or heaven would no longer be a perfect place."
[00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:19.160]   I said, "You're right."
[00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:22.720]   So therefore God must assess a penalty for sin.
[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:24.240]   And that penalty is hell.
[00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:28.680]   Total separation from God, your creator.
[00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:34.720]   And I just say, "Hey, but God never intended
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:39.720]   "for it to be that way, so He came up with another plan."
[00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:43.720]   And this is where we see the good news in Ephesians 2.
[00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:47.640]   Verse four, look at what it says.
[00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:50.640]   "But God being rich in mercy."
[00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:54.720]   Like that's a great big but right there.
[00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:57.040]   Like that is huge.
[00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:58.240]   That's what I'm talking about right now,
[00:23:58.240 --> 00:23:59.240]   your sinful nature, right?
[00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:01.540]   Your guess, your mind is all up in the gutter.
[00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:05.320]   (congregation laughing)
[00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:09.240]   But thank the Lord for that, that one phrase,
[00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:14.160]   "But God being rich in mercy
[00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:18.080]   "because of the great love with which He loved us,
[00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:20.800]   "even when we were dead in our trespasses."
[00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:21.800]   What did He do?
[00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:24.740]   "He made us alive together with Christ.
[00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:26.560]   "By grace you have been saved.
[00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:30.800]   "And He raised us up with Him and seated us with Him
[00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:33.520]   "in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus."
[00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:35.840]   That's our standing, that's where we're headed
[00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:39.240]   for those of us in Christ, so that in the coming ages
[00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:41.680]   He might show the immeasurable riches of His grace
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:43.760]   and kindness towards us in Christ Jesus.
[00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:45.360]   The coming ages, when He comes back,
[00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:47.000]   I've read the rest of the book.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.840]   Revelation, He's coming back.
[00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:54.940]   This time, not as a suffering servant hanging on a cross,
[00:24:54.940 --> 00:25:03.400]   but as a mighty warrior coming for His church,
[00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:04.320]   for the believer.
[00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:12.080]   And it goes on and says, "For by grace you have been saved
[00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:15.560]   "through faith, and this is not your own doing.
[00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:19.360]   "It is a gift of God, not a result of works,
[00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:20.960]   "so that no one may boast."
[00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:24.140]   Point number two, what Christ has done.
[00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:25.600]   What Christ has done, but God,
[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:27.720]   this one phrase, being rich in mercy,
[00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:30.180]   it's this idea of abundance, it's this idea of overflow.
[00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:31.640]   It never runs out, like some of us,
[00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:35.700]   man, we're worried about cost of inflation rising, right?
[00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:40.200]   Like the cost of food or the cost of gas
[00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:42.640]   or the cost of rent, like, talked to a bunch of young adults
[00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:44.520]   like, man, my rent is just skyrocketing,
[00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:47.120]   and I don't know if my paycheck is gonna be suffice
[00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:48.860]   to pay for all these things.
[00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:53.840]   But God's saying, hey, not in my economy.
[00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:58.580]   My grace is rich in mercy, and it never runs out.
[00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:00.000]   His grace never runs out.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.180]   There will always be enough for those of us
[00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:05.980]   that bend the knee and surrender our life to Him.
[00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:06.820]   Why?
[00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:09.540]   Because of the great love in which He loved us.
[00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:13.200]   He proved this by dying on the cross for your sin and mine.
[00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:15.980]   Grace, it's this idea that you can't earn it.
[00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:16.940]   There's nothing you can do.
[00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:20.320]   We don't deserve it, but that's the whole point of grace.
[00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:23.060]   If you could deserve it, then it would not be grace.
[00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:25.480]   There's no one in this room tonight
[00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:28.160]   that has done something so terrible that grace won't cover.
[00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:29.820]   Like, some of you are like, no, no, not me,
[00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:31.380]   just you don't know what I've done.
[00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:35.440]   My sin is just too great for God.
[00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:37.080]   Like, my life is stained.
[00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:41.040]   That past abortion, you know, that embezzling money.
[00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:43.760]   I mean, you don't know what's happened to me.
[00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:45.720]   Like, maybe even murders are part of your story.
[00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:48.560]   Like, nothing is too great for God.
[00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:55.080]   That adultery, nothing is too great for God.
[00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:59.680]   The thing that you think that you're gonna take to the grave,
[00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:02.120]   nothing is too great for God.
[00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:06.520]   Oh, no, no, not me, just you don't understand my story.
[00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:09.320]   No, no, no, I might not understand your story,
[00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:12.200]   but you don't understand the grace and the mercy of God.
[00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:16.080]   It's for you, all you need is need to come to God.
[00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:20.680]   The prereq, the prequalification to come to God
[00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:23.240]   is not you trying to pull your bootstraps up
[00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:25.720]   and white knuckle it and modify your behavior
[00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:30.660]   and do some good works to make yourself right.
[00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:33.960]   No, it's to bend the knee.
[00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:36.880]   Like, that's the problem for some of us, man.
[00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:39.120]   Like, we don't understand,
[00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:42.120]   we don't fathom the grace that's being offered to us.
[00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:43.600]   Like, some of us think, man, our works,
[00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:46.600]   like, good works right here, right here.
[00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:48.920]   The good works that I do,
[00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:52.800]   this is gonna be enough to make me right with God.
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:56.360]   I'm gonna, you know, maybe volunteer
[00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:59.580]   at the animal rescue shelter.
[00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:01.160]   I'm gonna go to church every Sunday.
[00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:02.900]   Oh, I'm gonna be at the porch, the porch.
[00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:03.740]   That's what I'm gonna do.
[00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:06.360]   I'm gonna climb to the porch every Tuesday night.
[00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:08.000]   I'm gonna carry my Bible.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:09.840]   I'm gonna get, I'm gonna know some memory verses.
[00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:11.360]   I'm gonna memorize scripture.
[00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:14.360]   Hey, I'm gonna get the cross tattoo, man.
[00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:16.240]   I'm gonna look good on the outside.
[00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:21.240]   Some of you are like, man, I'm gonna go a step further.
[00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:22.320]   I'm gonna be a member of this.
[00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:23.160]   That's what I'm gonna do.
[00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:25.720]   I'm gonna be a member of Watermark Community Church.
[00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:29.520]   I'm gonna get in community group.
[00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:35.380]   Hey, I might even get baptized.
[00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:38.380]   That sounds like the next thing for me to do.
[00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:44.780]   On this hamster wheel of just performance, good works.
[00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:49.000]   And all you do is make a bigger mess.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:55.380]   Because it's your work that you're submitting to,
[00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:57.000]   not his work.
[00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:03.340]   And that's not the point of the gospel.
[00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:08.180]   The point of the gospel is God, I can't, but you can.
[00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:12.640]   Like I talk to young adults and I say,
[00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:15.140]   hey, if God should let you into heaven,
[00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:16.160]   what would you say?
[00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:19.700]   And a lot of times it starts with because I,
[00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:21.860]   and I'm like, you missed it.
[00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:24.180]   If you could get to heaven because of you,
[00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:26.580]   what was the point of Jesus dying on the cross?
[00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:30.080]   There's nothing we can do.
[00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:31.340]   That's the whole point of grace.
[00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:32.460]   Well, that's scandalous, Josiah.
[00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:34.540]   What, I can't do anything?
[00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:35.640]   You can't do anything.
[00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:38.140]   Because if you could do something,
[00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:40.780]   then you and I would surely boast about it.
[00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:46.420]   And when we boast about it, then who gets the credit?
[00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:47.260]   We do.
[00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:51.560]   Not him, not what he did for you on the cross.
[00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:55.200]   And so the only thing that we can do is point to him,
[00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:57.400]   point to Christ.
[00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:01.300]   Like some of us, like we can't fathom this grace
[00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:03.200]   because when you're a kid, you would mess up
[00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:05.500]   and maybe you got caught by your parents
[00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:07.380]   or you would go confess something to them
[00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:12.060]   and you would just be met with like just this,
[00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:15.060]   just this anger and they would shun you.
[00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:16.420]   Maybe you confessed that you lied
[00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:19.180]   or you got found out at that party that you threw
[00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:20.480]   when your parents went out of town
[00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:23.180]   and the house was cleaner than it was before they left.
[00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:24.200]   They're like, something ain't right.
[00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:25.140]   That was my story.
[00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:29.180]   But, but, but, but, but that's what we would do, right?
[00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:32.140]   And then they found out and they just shunned it
[00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:35.060]   and they didn't create a space and a place
[00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:36.740]   for you to be real and authentic.
[00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:37.940]   So you went into hiding.
[00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:42.260]   Or maybe you confessed that you were gay
[00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:45.060]   and they just said, I'm done ostracizing.
[00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:51.840]   And you can't fathom grace because that was your experience.
[00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:54.620]   And so you view God in the same way
[00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:57.060]   that you view your parents.
[00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:01.900]   As a dad of three kids, I wanna create a safe place
[00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:04.700]   for them to be able to confess
[00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:06.380]   or for them to be able to share
[00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:07.400]   whatever they're going through.
[00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:10.940]   So I'll put my little girls down to bed,
[00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:12.260]   you know, every night except Tuesday
[00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:15.020]   and I'll just say, hey, how's your heart?
[00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:17.020]   What was the high of your day?
[00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:19.180]   What was the low of your day?
[00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:21.220]   What, how are you doing?
[00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:23.620]   Hey, you know, daddy, you can tell daddy anything you want
[00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:27.100]   and I promise you, I'm still gonna love you
[00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:30.460]   not because you did or didn't do what daddy wanted.
[00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:35.740]   And so I'll ask them this question before we go to bed,
[00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:37.500]   just say, hey, what's the gospel?
[00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:40.340]   Like, what is it?
[00:31:40.340 --> 00:31:42.300]   Camille, Isabella, what is the gospel?
[00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:44.100]   And I'll begin to reiterate it to them
[00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:46.900]   and we were out and they were in their princess dresses
[00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:49.700]   the other night when they were riding scooters
[00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:51.980]   and I just sat them down, I just said,
[00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:53.180]   hey, what is the gospel?
[00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:55.620]   And I filmed it, here's what they said.
[00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:57.180]   What is the gospel?
[00:31:57.180 --> 00:31:59.580]   - The gospel is the good news of Jesus Christ.
[00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:01.380]   That he died on the cross for our sins
[00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:03.300]   and rose again on the third day
[00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:04.980]   to the feet of sin and death.
[00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:08.700]   - That's right, this is the gospel, my friends.
[00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:12.180]   The gospel is the good news of Jesus Christ
[00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:13.740]   that he died on the cross for our sins
[00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:15.180]   and rose again on the third day.
[00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:17.820]   And listen, like it's cute when they can regurgitate it
[00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:19.780]   at four and almost six years old.
[00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:22.820]   And I love that and my wife and I were praying
[00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:24.580]   that, hey, that would become a reality,
[00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:26.860]   the truths that we're giving to them,
[00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:28.140]   the truths that we're sharing to them
[00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:30.140]   would begin to be a heart belief,
[00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:31.980]   that it wouldn't just be this intellectual belief
[00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:33.260]   and they wouldn't follow Jesus
[00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:35.540]   because mommy and daddy does it.
[00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:38.660]   And that's our heart, that's our prayer
[00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:40.640]   every single day for our kids.
[00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:45.540]   And so for some of us, man, like we see that
[00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:48.300]   and it is cute and I love it
[00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:51.000]   and I go back to that video all the time.
[00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:56.300]   And it's cute at four and six to regurgitate that,
[00:32:56.300 --> 00:32:59.320]   but when you're 25, 35 years old
[00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:01.060]   and you know how to answer that question,
[00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:02.500]   but then you look back at your life
[00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:04.040]   and like nothing's changed.
[00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:07.060]   It's not as cute.
[00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:11.280]   Listen, I don't say that to shame you.
[00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:12.540]   I don't say that to guilt you.
[00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:14.740]   I say that to challenge you
[00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:19.780]   to do an inventory tonight and say,
[00:33:19.780 --> 00:33:22.380]   what am I really doing with Jesus?
[00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:27.860]   Like, am I allowing him to change everything about my life
[00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:32.140]   or am I hanging on to the parts that I don't disagree with?
[00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:37.800]   Like when you and the Bible disagree, who wins?
[00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:42.700]   Like I have been going through the scriptures
[00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:45.340]   and I'm like, oh, that one's hard.
[00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:47.500]   Slow to speak, quick to listen
[00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:49.140]   for the anger of a man does not produce the right,
[00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:50.260]   ooh, that hurts.
[00:33:50.260 --> 00:33:54.620]   And God begins to convict me of my anger
[00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:59.620]   and my short tempered and my tone with my kids and my wife.
[00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:09.220]   Our salvation is an act of God's love.
[00:34:09.220 --> 00:34:12.420]   Jesus did what you and I can.
[00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:16.540]   Like Jesus lived the life that you couldn't live.
[00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:18.760]   He was perfect in thought, word and action.
[00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:25.420]   And all of our sin was poured out on him at the cross.
[00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:31.820]   And the Bible says that he soaked up
[00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:36.740]   the sin of the world on the cross.
[00:34:36.740 --> 00:34:46.200]   And there's nothing else that can pay for your sin
[00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:47.340]   and my sin.
[00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:51.060]   I've studied all the other religions.
[00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:54.100]   There's not another religion that teaches
[00:34:54.100 --> 00:34:57.060]   that there's a God who left the comforts of heaven
[00:34:57.060 --> 00:34:59.460]   and came to earth to bear a cross.
[00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:03.740]   And there's nothing you and I can do
[00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:04.900]   to be made right with God.
[00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:06.460]   It's everything that he's done.
[00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:09.900]   Like we don't climb this ladder to get to heaven
[00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:12.240]   and reach in spiritual enlightenment.
[00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:18.720]   We submit to God, the only one
[00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:19.960]   that died on the cross for our sin.
[00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:24.960]   And so he soaked up every last ounce of our sin.
[00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:31.720]   And the Bible says that while we were yet sinners,
[00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:34.640]   Romans 5, 8, Christ died for us.
[00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:42.160]   The Bible says that if we would confess with our mouth
[00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:48.020]   that Jesus is Lord and believe in our heart
[00:35:48.020 --> 00:35:52.060]   that God raised him from the dead, we would be saved.
[00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:56.020]   That when we put our faith and trust in Christ,
[00:35:56.020 --> 00:36:01.020]   he begins to soak up the sin in our life.
[00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:05.020]   Like he begins to forgive the sin in our life.
[00:36:05.020 --> 00:36:08.980]   There's nothing that can take us away from Christ.
[00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:12.700]   He begins the work that started in us
[00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:14.820]   and he finishes that work.
[00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:20.160]   Jesus is the only one, my friends,
[00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:23.740]   that can forgive you of your sin.
[00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:28.740]   There's no amount of good works, only Christ, only Christ.
[00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:35.020]   And so we come to God and say,
[00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:38.700]   "God, would you take all of our sin on you?
[00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:42.200]   "Would you forgive me of my sin?
[00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:47.200]   "Would you allow this bag of bones to become life
[00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:52.760]   "because we're dead in our trespasses and sins?"
[00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:55.660]   But the Bible says he's made us alive together in Christ.
[00:36:55.660 --> 00:36:57.980]   Have you made that decision?
[00:36:57.980 --> 00:37:01.800]   Have you made that decision
[00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:05.080]   that could change everything about your life?
[00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:10.900]   It goes on, it says in verse 10
[00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:12.520]   that we are his workmanship,
[00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:14.820]   created in Christ Jesus for good works,
[00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:19.020]   which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them.
[00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:22.960]   Like we go back to good works,
[00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:25.100]   not so that good works would save us,
[00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:27.580]   but the Bible says that, hey, once you are saved,
[00:37:27.580 --> 00:37:29.180]   like you've been saved from work,
[00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:31.020]   you don't work for your salvation,
[00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:35.020]   that is a free gift of God so that you and I can't boast.
[00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:40.020]   But it says, hey, once you've accepted that free gift,
[00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:42.360]   that grace, that mercy,
[00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:48.080]   then he has prepared good works for you to walk into.
[00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:53.340]   The sin in your life no longer conquers you.
[00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:55.820]   And so you don't work for your salvation,
[00:37:55.820 --> 00:37:58.220]   but you do work from your salvation
[00:37:58.220 --> 00:38:01.620]   and you take what Christ has done in your life
[00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:05.200]   and now you begin to pour it into the good works
[00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:06.820]   which he has prepared beforehand
[00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:11.260]   and you begin to walk in those good works.
[00:38:11.260 --> 00:38:17.020]   We are people created in Christ Jesus for good works.
[00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:20.480]   If your salvation is not followed by good works,
[00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:22.980]   then you might not be saved.
[00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:25.360]   Do you see good work in your life?
[00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:28.880]   Once God saves you, he creates you for good works,
[00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:31.400]   which just means that he's put desires in you
[00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:34.020]   that were not there before.
[00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:39.020]   Like I had no desire to pick up my Bible
[00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:42.660]   before that night in my apartment my junior year
[00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:44.880]   and read it, no desire.
[00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:48.720]   I had no desire to step foot into a church
[00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:52.000]   and get plugged in and serve.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:55.480]   I had no desire to give my life away
[00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:58.040]   so that others could come to know
[00:38:58.040 --> 00:38:59.620]   the hope that lied within me.
[00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:04.600]   I had no desire until God awakened that in my life.
[00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:09.220]   I had no desire to go around and tell people about Jesus
[00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:14.220]   and share my story until God awakened that desire within me.
[00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:18.940]   I had no desire to memorize scripture.
[00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:21.080]   I had no desire to confess my sin
[00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:23.760]   to a smaller group of men that could know me
[00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:26.780]   and I could know them and they began to hold me accountable.
[00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:29.040]   I didn't want accountability, what?
[00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:33.260]   No, that's a dirty word, man, get away from me.
[00:39:33.260 --> 00:39:35.220]   That wasn't me.
[00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:37.020]   But now I desire to be fully known.
[00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:44.140]   And it gives people an opportunity to fully love me
[00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:46.980]   because they know all of me.
[00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:48.980]   They know all of me.
[00:39:48.980 --> 00:39:51.940]   He begins to change your desires.
[00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:53.220]   That's what this text is saying.
[00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:57.880]   And you begin to walk in those good works.
[00:39:57.880 --> 00:39:59.900]   So if your faith is not producing good works,
[00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:00.740]   what do you do?
[00:40:00.740 --> 00:40:02.900]   Though the answer isn't that you would just
[00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:04.700]   start walking out what I just said.
[00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:09.300]   That would be just as useless as you taking a piece of fruit
[00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:10.540]   and putting it on a dead tree,
[00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:12.300]   hoping that it would become alive.
[00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:17.900]   No, that you would see that you are dead apart from Christ,
[00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:19.060]   that you need a new nature,
[00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:21.900]   that you need him to come into your life
[00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:23.420]   and you need to bend your knee
[00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:25.460]   and you need to surrender your life to Christ
[00:40:25.460 --> 00:40:27.540]   and say, God, I need you.
[00:40:28.820 --> 00:40:31.900]   I can't produce these desires apart from you
[00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:34.500]   because my nature is bad.
[00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:35.660]   It's destructive.
[00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:40.500]   Is that you tonight?
[00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:42.980]   Do you need a new nature?
[00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:47.780]   Have you embraced the overwhelming love and grace
[00:40:47.780 --> 00:40:49.380]   given to you by Christ
[00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:52.220]   and what he's done for you on the cross?
[00:40:52.220 --> 00:40:53.620]   And through his resurrection
[00:40:53.620 --> 00:40:57.300]   that he defeated sin and death.
[00:40:57.780 --> 00:41:01.340]   For those of us that are saved,
[00:41:01.340 --> 00:41:03.180]   we need to understand that we are his workmanship.
[00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:06.260]   This Greek word, poema,
[00:41:06.260 --> 00:41:07.780]   it was where we get the Greek word,
[00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:09.900]   or before we get the word poem.
[00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:11.580]   We are his workmanship.
[00:41:11.580 --> 00:41:13.760]   He's created us in Christ Jesus
[00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:18.360]   to compose something beautiful that will glorify him.
[00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:23.060]   There's a song that Davy is gonna sing tonight
[00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:25.140]   that she wrote and she composed that
[00:41:25.140 --> 00:41:27.700]   not so that she would get the affirmation from men
[00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:30.360]   but so that she would get the affirmation from God
[00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:32.900]   so that she would begin to please God
[00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:34.200]   with all of her being,
[00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:37.380]   with the gifts and the talents that she's been given.
[00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:39.060]   That's what God is calling you and I to do
[00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:42.060]   when we step foot into our office tomorrow
[00:41:42.060 --> 00:41:45.580]   that whatever you're doing is now your mission field.
[00:41:45.580 --> 00:41:47.740]   You might be in business
[00:41:47.740 --> 00:41:50.060]   but you leverage business for the glory of God
[00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:51.860]   so that others can come to know him.
[00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:55.180]   You might be a nurse or you might be a doctor
[00:41:55.180 --> 00:41:56.480]   but you're leveraging that.
[00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:59.920]   You might help people physically but spiritually,
[00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:01.920]   you know that they're dead apart from Christ
[00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:03.720]   and so you begin to leverage that
[00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:08.040]   so that others can come to know that hope.
[00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:09.920]   You might be a barista
[00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:11.680]   and your job isn't just to make coffee
[00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:14.780]   but your job is to step into the good works
[00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:16.620]   that God has prepared before him
[00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:21.520]   in the same way that Steve Jobs created the iPhone.
[00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:24.560]   That was his workmanship to change the world.
[00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:28.320]   Jesus is calling you and I to step foot
[00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:31.960]   into the good works,
[00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:36.480]   into the spaces and the places that you go every day
[00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:39.720]   so that he gets the glory,
[00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:40.840]   you get the joy,
[00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:43.640]   you understand why you were created
[00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:46.520]   and that the world around us receives the good.
[00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:48.280]   Let me pray that you would tonight.
[00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:51.520]   God in heaven,
[00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:56.580]   thank you for your goodness and your mercy on our life.
[00:42:56.580 --> 00:43:01.880]   Apart from you, God, we are dead.
[00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:05.680]   Oh, we might be physically being,
[00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:08.480]   we might be alive physically but we are dead spiritually.
[00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:10.080]   We're dead men and women walking
[00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:14.160]   and so God, would you begin to awaken
[00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:17.100]   men and women in this moment,
[00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:20.460]   first and foremost, those that need a new nature.
[00:43:21.420 --> 00:43:23.660]   (gentle music)
[00:43:23.660 --> 00:43:28.580]   That they would see that they can do nothing apart from you.
[00:43:28.580 --> 00:43:31.960]   There's nothing that they can do to be made right.
[00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:36.220]   And God, tonight, they would believe,
[00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:38.460]   they would have the faith
[00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:43.020]   to accept what you've done for them
[00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:46.760]   and that they would confess with their mouth
[00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:50.400]   that you are truly the leader of their life.
[00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:53.520]   (gentle music)
[00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:56.120]   And God, you would begin a work in them
[00:43:56.120 --> 00:43:57.840]   that you've never done before.
[00:43:57.840 --> 00:43:59.520]   And for those of us that are saved,
[00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:00.920]   we're walking with the Lord,
[00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:04.040]   that we wouldn't give up when we fall into sin
[00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:05.920]   but that we would remind ourself of the gospel,
[00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:08.440]   that we'd run back to Ephesians 2, 1 through 10
[00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:10.140]   and we would believe the gospel.
[00:44:10.140 --> 00:44:16.440]   As some of us, we would not wanna admit
[00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:19.200]   that we're probably worse than what I even
[00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:21.600]   failed to articulate tonight,
[00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:24.300]   that we're more depraved than what we care to admit
[00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:29.300]   but we're more loved than what we probably express.
[00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:35.000]   And so would we walk in light of those two realities tonight
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:42.880]   and God, would that produce in us a desire for more of you
[00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:46.020]   no matter where we find ourselves tonight.
[00:44:46.620 --> 00:44:50.740]   No matter what circumstances are going on in our life,
[00:44:50.740 --> 00:44:52.380]   no matter what sin we're wrestling with,
[00:44:52.380 --> 00:44:54.660]   what sin we're trying to fight,
[00:44:54.660 --> 00:44:58.900]   would we have a reality that the gospel is enough?
[00:44:58.900 --> 00:45:02.260]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
