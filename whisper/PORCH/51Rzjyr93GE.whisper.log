[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:25.800]   - All right, well, welcome everybody in the room,
[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.460]   everybody tuning in online,
[00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.120]   Ports Austin, Ports Boise, Ports Tulsa,
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.000]   Ports North Houston, Ports Scottsdale,
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.500]   all the different Ports lot locations,
[00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.200]   we're continuing this series on God,
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.200]   where we are looking at stories from the book of Daniel.
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.600]   Let me start by giving a little vision into my world.
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.020]   In December, my wife and I moved our two oldest kids,
[00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.860]   our son and daughter, into the same room,
[00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.320]   put them in a bunk bed, here's a picture of them,
[00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.920]   just chilling, loving life,
[00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.980]   can't believe we get to sleep together,
[00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.940]   got my princess cup and everything,
[00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.980]   and it was awesome, we combined bedtimes,
[00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.540]   which allowed you to put them both down at the same time,
[00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.480]   but shortly after, they began staying in the same room,
[00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.660]   my son, the boy on top,
[00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.820]   started having what's called night terrors.
[00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.020]   Now just a heads up, someday you may have kids,
[00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.060]   this is not a nightmare, this is a night terror.
[00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.900]   What's the difference?
[00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.360]   A night terror happens about 45 minutes after you go to bed,
[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.520]   nightmare happens sometime in the middle of the night,
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:29.840]   I don't know, I don't make this stuff up,
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.680]   but anyways, he begins to have these night terrors,
[00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.640]   and we begin to try to figure out what's happening,
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.540]   like a night terror where he would just wake up,
[00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.260]   and it's not like just a nightmare where you wake up
[00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.240]   and you're like still in the sleep mode,
[00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.440]   so he's screaming, which means he's waking up his sister
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.680]   every single night, just some form of torture,
[00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.060]   45 minutes into falling asleep,
[00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.560]   and my wife and I begin to go, what is causing this?
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:54.740]   Is it something he ate?
[00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.680]   Is it because at first we thought it was,
[00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:57.760]   we watched The Lion King,
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.280]   I knew I should have fast forwarded on a part with Scar,
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.700]   and he's having night terrors now,
[00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.440]   and then eventually we begin to go,
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.900]   man, is it something he's eating?
[00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.200]   Is it the time, maybe we should wake him up 45 minutes in,
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.360]   and then that'll avoid it.
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.280]   Nope, it just delayed the night terror from happening,
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.120]   so we begin to just look for solutions,
[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.840]   we're trying essential oils and rubbing it on things,
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.500]   and just, you know, that's who we are,
[00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.200]   and eventually, my wife took him to the dentist,
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.800]   and he was having his first dental appointment,
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.560]   or one of his first dental appointments,
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.840]   and the dentist looked in his mouth and said,
[00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.840]   his tonsils are really large, is he having night terrors?
[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.480]   And it turns out that if you have tonsils that are large,
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.400]   at night it can inhibit your breathing,
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.320]   which for whatever reason has some impact,
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.480]   and creates night terrors.
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.160]   And so today, now he goes to bed,
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.240]   and he has like this nasal saline spray
[00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.960]   that he has to put in there every single time
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.160]   that he goes to bed, but it gave him some relief.
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.000]   Now what does that have to do
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.560]   with what we're gonna talk about tonight?
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.560]   We're gonna look at a man who is having a night terror,
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.280]   if you will, and it's a king named Nebuchadnezzar
[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.000]   that we launched into last week,
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.360]   and Nebuchadnezzar begins to have this nightmare,
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.840]   this thing that is reoccurring,
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.640]   and keeps him from being able to sleep.
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.960]   And Daniel, who's the focal point really of tonight,
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.720]   and for much of the study on God,
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.080]   is gonna interpret the dream,
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.600]   and the interpretation of the dream
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.160]   provides the relief the king was looking for.
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.160]   But in Daniel's interpretation,
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.140]   and even the way that he goes before the king,
[00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.500]   and communicates the meaning of his dream,
[00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:45.720]   we learn a lot of things
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.880]   that we're just gonna walk through and observe.
[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.300]   One of the things that we learn
[00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:54.300]   is how Daniel could be so confident standing before the king.
[00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.660]   And so we're gonna explore and continue this series,
[00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.320]   and learn what was at the root and behind
[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.200]   why Daniel was so confident in the chaos.
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.000]   As we said last week,
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.480]   on God is looking at the book of Daniel.
[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.320]   What's the book of Daniel?
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.400]   It's a book that was written 600 years ago
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.820]   in a town, or in this capital city of Babylon.
[00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:18.320]   Babylonian Empire was the world superpower in 600 BC.
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:19.680]   It had conquered the known world,
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.040]   and it was ruled by a ruthless dictator named Nebuchadnezzar.
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.040]   Here's a picture of the map of Babylon.
[00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.320]   No, that's Zac Efron.
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.200]   And there's Babylon.
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.920]   We just have pictures of Zac Efron around.
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.920]   There's Babylon, and you can see
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.720]   that's the Babylonian Empire.
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.280]   And the reason they had Zac Efron
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.880]   is whenever I read through scripture,
[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.720]   I'll think of the different characters that are involved,
[00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.160]   so when I think of Daniel, like I said last week,
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.160]   I think of Zac Efron.
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.320]   When I think of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego,
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.120]   we think of the Spider-Man trio.
[00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.060]   When I think of King Nebuchadnezzar, this kind of evil king,
[00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.760]   I think either Jafar or the king from Gladiator,
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.400]   but those are kind of the characters.
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.640]   And Nebuchadnezzar rules the known world.
[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.360]   He's taken captive Daniel and his friends,
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.800]   and Daniel is put to work in the king's palace.
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.720]   And the king's gonna have a dream,
[00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.800]   and Daniel's interaction and exchange
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.600]   and interpretation of the dream
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.500]   gives us a look into how he was so confident,
[00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:23.560]   and it also tells us the entire story of history.
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.520]   He tells a dream that, candidly,
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.400]   I don't know that I'll be able to put into words
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:34.160]   the power that this chapter has had since it was written,
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.320]   because Daniel is gonna say to the king
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:40.040]   the events that happened immediately
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:41.400]   in the centuries following,
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.040]   and that will happen all the way up
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.400]   until the Messiah's return.
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.360]   So we're gonna be in Daniel chapter two,
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.680]   starting in verse one.
[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.480]   We're gonna walk through three observations.
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.120]   If you have a Bible, you can flip there now.
[00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.760]   If not, it'll be on the screen.
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.280]   And as always, we have Bibles in the Welcome Center
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.480]   that are our gift to you.
[00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:58.920]   So let me start in verse one.
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:06.520]   One night, during the second year of his reign,
[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:10.440]   King Nebuchadnezzar had such disturbing dreams
[00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.360]   he could not sleep.
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.360]   So he called his magicians, enchanters,
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.840]   sorcerers, astrologers, anyone who had access to the divine,
[00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:23.460]   and he demanded that they tell him what he had dreamed.
[00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:26.040]   As they stood before the king, he said,
[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:26.960]   "I've had a dream.
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.020]   "It deeply troubles me.
[00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:29.320]   "I must know what it means."
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:30.460]   The astrologers answered.
[00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:32.480]   The king, an Aramaic, long lived the king.
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:36.080]   "Tell us the dream, and we will tell you what it means."
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.840]   But the king said to them,
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:42.840]   "I am serious if you don't tell me what my dream was
[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:48.260]   "and what it means, I will have you torn limb from limb
[00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.200]   "and your houses turned into heaps of rubble."
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.520]   That escalated quickly.
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.240]   Nebuchadnezzar was known to have a temper,
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:57.260]   so he calls in his guys to say, "Hey, I've had a dream,
[00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.800]   "and I want you to tell me what it was and what it means."
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.440]   Some people believe it's because,
[00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:03.960]   like often happens when you have a dream,
[00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:05.680]   you wake up and you're like, "Wait, what was that?
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:06.560]   "And was she there?"
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.320]   And you can vaguely remember it,
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:10.280]   and you're like, "I don't think he had pants on."
[00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:12.120]   And it's just kind of you're piecing together,
[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:14.720]   maybe it was that, or maybe he just wanted to see
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:18.160]   if these men actually possessed
[00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:21.720]   the divine wisdom they claimed to.
[00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:23.060]   The men say back to him,
[00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:26.200]   "Nobody can do what you're asking, that's impossible."
[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:28.300]   In verse 10, "No one on earth can tell a king his dream.
[00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:32.440]   "No king has ever asked of any person such a thing.
[00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:35.000]   "The king's demand," verse 11, "is impossible."
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.500]   He can't tell you your dream.
[00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:41.400]   "No one except the gods can tell you your dream,
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.860]   "and they do not live here among people.
[00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:46.200]   "The king was furious, and he ordered all the wise men
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:50.240]   "to be executed, which included Daniel,
[00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:52.400]   "and Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:56.640]   "When Arioch, the king's commander, came to kill them,"
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:58.420]   that's a bad day, I'm here to kill you,
[00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:01.580]   "Daniel handled the situation with wisdom and discretion,
[00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:03.260]   "and he asked Arioch,
[00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.340]   "'Why has the king issued such a harsh decree?'
[00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:06.900]   "Arioch explained everything that happened.
[00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:08.460]   "Daniel went to see the king.
[00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:11.260]   "He asked for more time to tell the king
[00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.280]   "what the dream meant.
[00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:16.100]   "And then Daniel went home, and he told his friends,
[00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:18.600]   "Hananiah, Meshach, and Azariah,"
[00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:20.640]   that's Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego,
[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:21.620]   "what had happened.
[00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:24.560]   "He urged them to ask the God of heaven
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:29.560]   "to show them his mercy by telling him the secret,
[00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:32.080]   "so they would not be executed
[00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:34.320]   "along with the other wise men of Babylon."
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.560]   The first thing I wanna point out
[00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:36.960]   that we see from Nebuchadnezzar
[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:39.480]   and his reason why Daniel had such confidence
[00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:44.480]   before the king is he knew what Nebuchadnezzar's life
[00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:47.500]   reflects, everyone needs God.
[00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:50.320]   The king, Nebuchadnezzar, was the most powerful person
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:52.440]   who had ever ruled to that point.
[00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:53.840]   He had created a civilization,
[00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:56.980]   even his own palace and the city of Babylon
[00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:58.680]   was constructed in a way
[00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:01.220]   that he constantly lived in security.
[00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:02.060]   I mean, it was a marvel.
[00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:04.960]   The city itself was one of the wonders of the ancient world.
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:08.480]   It had walls 75 feet high and thick enough
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:11.680]   for two four-horse chariots to ride across,
[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:13.940]   a Greek historian tells us, that it was a marvel.
[00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:17.920]   He lived in luxury, he lived in security, he had more gold.
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:22.000]   One historian said Babylon contained more gold than dust,
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.320]   that he was the wealthiest, richest, securest,
[00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:29.840]   he had everything you'd want, and yet he had a need,
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:31.920]   and that need was God.
[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:34.480]   And Daniel knew that I offer something of the king
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:36.840]   that he doesn't have,
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:38.600]   something that every person who's ever lived needs,
[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.640]   which is a relationship with God in this life,
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:43.280]   a relationship with God to have eternal life.
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:44.280]   And the same is true today.
[00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:45.720]   Every person you've ever met,
[00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:47.960]   and you probably have never thought about it this way before
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:52.560]   but every person needs God.
[00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:55.240]   They may not even realize their need for God,
[00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:57.360]   but the greatest whole that exists inside
[00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:01.760]   of every human heart is a hole that only God can fill.
[00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:05.520]   Your boss at work today, as much of a jerk as he is,
[00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:07.820]   is in need of God.
[00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:12.080]   Your parents, and however great or poorly you think of them,
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:14.360]   are in need of a relationship with God.
[00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:19.640]   Billionaires, supermodels, baristas,
[00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:23.200]   all come into existence and have and share in common
[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:28.040]   a need for God in this life and for eternal life.
[00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:32.100]   There's an emptiness that ultimately only God can satisfy.
[00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:35.080]   Tom Brady a couple weeks ago decided
[00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:37.200]   that he was gonna do another fake out
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:41.440]   and come back to play again for the 700th year.
[00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:44.960]   And you think about that.
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:48.280]   And my wife and I were talking about it, and who knows?
[00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:51.200]   It's like, man, you just can't let it go.
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:55.040]   And the reasons behind that, who knows?
[00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:57.360]   I do know he did an interview a handful of years ago,
[00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:59.220]   and it was with 60 Minutes,
[00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:01.400]   and the interview may give us the reason why
[00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:04.240]   it's hard to let it go.
[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:07.940]   In the interview, he says this, this is Tom Brady speaking.
[00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:11.260]   "There's times I'm not the person I wanna be.
[00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:15.940]   "Why do I have three Super Bowl rings
[00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:17.680]   "and still think there's something greater
[00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:19.560]   "out there for me?"
[00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:20.760]   I mean, maybe a lot of people would say,
[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:21.800]   "Hey, man, this is it.
[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:23.560]   "I reached my goal, my dream, my life.
[00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:28.560]   "Me, I think, God, it's gotta be more than this.
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:33.680]   "I mean, this can't be what it's all cracked up to be."
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:37.760]   And the interviewer asked him, "What's the answer?"
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:43.720]   And what he responds with is tragic.
[00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:47.480]   "What's the answer?"
[00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:51.060]   Tom Brady responds, "I wish I knew.
[00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:53.840]   "I wish I knew."
[00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:56.400]   Now, what's he reflecting?
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:57.880]   He's reflecting what's true about every person
[00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:59.020]   you've ever met and ever will meet,
[00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:01.040]   that there is a hole inside of the human heart.
[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:03.260]   God says in Ecclesiastes chapter three
[00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.520]   that he put it there so that you and I would encounter him,
[00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:08.040]   that everyone has a need for God.
[00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:09.080]   And some of you came to the room tonight,
[00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:10.320]   and you don't think you need God.
[00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:11.640]   You feel like you're living your life.
[00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:14.920]   You got, everything on the outside looks picturesque.
[00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:18.120]   Everything looks like what everyone else would want.
[00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:20.880]   And yet you know it's empty.
[00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:23.800]   And you'll either discover that today
[00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:27.600]   or discover your need eventually,
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:29.780]   because every person has a desperate need
[00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:33.300]   inside of the human heart for God,
[00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:35.000]   just like the king had a desperate need
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.240]   for an answer from the divine.
[00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:39.020]   And Daniel is able to go confidently
[00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:42.760]   because he knows that I offer and I have something
[00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:44.800]   that every person needs, and he doesn't.
[00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:45.640]   How?
[00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:48.840]   There was a writer for the London Times,
[00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:50.920]   which is basically the New York Times version
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:53.480]   of the Times, it's actually called in London.
[00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:55.960]   And he was reflecting on some time
[00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:58.440]   that he'd spent in Africa, and he says something,
[00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:01.460]   despite being an atheist, that really reflects
[00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:02.760]   what's true not just of Africa,
[00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:04.620]   but of all places in general.
[00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:05.460]   Here's what it says.
[00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:07.920]   This is Matthew Paris for the London Times.
[00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:10.440]   And he writes about what he observed
[00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:11.560]   in his time in Malawi.
[00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:13.320]   He says, "As an atheist,
[00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:18.480]   "I truly believe Africa needs God.
[00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:21.880]   "This confounds my ideological belief,
[00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:24.480]   "stubbornly refuses to fit in my worldview,
[00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:27.040]   "and has embarrassed my growing belief
[00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:28.160]   "that there is no God.
[00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:31.340]   "Though I'm an atheist, I'm convinced
[00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:34.080]   "of the enormous contribution Christian evangelism,
[00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:36.500]   "or the body of Christ, or the message of Jesus,
[00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:39.900]   "makes in Africa, distinct from all the other works
[00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:43.100]   "of government projects, secular NGOs, international aid.
[00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:44.820]   "These alone will not do."
[00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:48.460]   It then says, "In Africa, Christianity changes
[00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:52.580]   "people's hearts, and the change is good.
[00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:57.040]   "Christians, black and white, working in Africa
[00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:59.280]   "do heal the sick, do teach people to read and write.
[00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:01.660]   "Only the severest kind of secularist
[00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:04.380]   "could see a mission hospital or school,
[00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:07.280]   "and say the world would be better off without that.
[00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:10.820]   "Missionaries," I love it,
[00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:15.260]   "not aid money, are the solution
[00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:16.760]   "to Africa's biggest problem.
[00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:20.680]   "Removing Christian evangelism from African equation
[00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:22.280]   "may leave the continent at the mercy
[00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:25.580]   "of a malign fusion of Nike, the witch doctor,
[00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:27.940]   "the mobile phone, and the machete."
[00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:29.660]   That even an atheist looks and says,
[00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:33.100]   "Man, I've gotta confess, these people need God."
[00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:34.920]   Where he gets it wrong is he says,
[00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:38.380]   "Africa, what's true is he needs God.
[00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:40.500]   "All people need God.
[00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:42.380]   "In every place and in every space.
[00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:47.400]   "Dallas, Boise, Scottsdale,
[00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:50.800]   "is filled with people who need God,
[00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:53.600]   "and Daniel has a confidence that comes from men.
[00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:57.300]   "I bring to the table something that every person needs
[00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:59.460]   "because I know my creator."
[00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:00.700]   The second thing we see in the story,
[00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:05.660]   and I think it's unbelievably profound,
[00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:08.260]   is the prediction that he now makes.
[00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:09.940]   The interpretation of the king's dream.
[00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:12.340]   He goes, basically, and he goes and prays,
[00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:13.860]   and that night, it says, verse 19,
[00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:15.840]   "God revealed the vision to Daniel.
[00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:20.560]   "Daniel then praised God and said,
[00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:23.720]   "Praise the name of God forever and ever.
[00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:25.840]   "He has all wisdom and power.
[00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:30.840]   "He controls the course of human events, or world events.
[00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:36.900]   "Our God removes kings and sets up other kings.
[00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:39.600]   "He gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to scholars.
[00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:41.920]   "He reveals deep and mysterious things.
[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:44.660]   "He knows what lies hidden in darkness,
[00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:46.000]   "though he's surrounded by light.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.780]   "I thank you and praise you, God, of my ancestors."
[00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:51.920]   Daniel prays, he then goes back and says,
[00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:52.800]   "Hey, take me to the king.
[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:54.520]   "I will tell him the interpretation."
[00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:57.840]   Shows up at the king, and the king says,
[00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:58.680]   "Do you know what it means?
[00:15:58.680 --> 00:15:59.500]   "Do you know my dream?
[00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:00.680]   "Do you know the interpretation?"
[00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:02.280]   And this is how Daniel responds.
[00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:07.560]   Verse 27, "Daniel replied,
[00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:11.240]   "There are no wise men, enchanters,
[00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:13.700]   "magicians, or fortune tellers
[00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:16.340]   "who can reveal the king's secret.
[00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:22.900]   "But there is a God in heaven who reveals secrets.
[00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:27.100]   "He has shown King Nebuchadnezzar
[00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:30.520]   "what will happen in the future.
[00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:32.020]   "Now I will tell of your dream
[00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:34.440]   "and the visions that you had."
[00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:36.100]   And he says, "Nobody can tell this,
[00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:37.660]   "but there is a God in heaven.
[00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:41.560]   "And he has told you what is going to happen
[00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:43.720]   "in the centuries to follow
[00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:46.320]   "and for the rest of human history.
[00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:49.800]   "And here is your dream, king."
[00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:51.640]   And then he says, and this is the point
[00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:53.800]   where if your mind works like mine,
[00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:56.640]   inside of watching the movie of this happen,
[00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:59.080]   this is when the suspenseful music turns on
[00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:02.000]   and the king leans forward in his throne
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.360]   as he hears Daniel describe exactly what you dreamed.
[00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:11.280]   He says, "In your vision, your majesty,
[00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:16.280]   "you saw before you a huge shining statue of a man.
[00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:19.160]   "It was a frightening sight.
[00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:22.400]   "The head of the statue was made of fine gold.
[00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:23.920]   "Its chest and arms were of silver.
[00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:25.640]   "Its belly and thighs were of bronze.
[00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:27.920]   "Its legs were iron.
[00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:32.920]   "And its feet were a combination of iron and clay.
[00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:35.960]   "As you watched this statue in front of you,
[00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:39.840]   "all of a sudden a rock cut from a mountain,
[00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:42.720]   "not made by human hands,
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:47.160]   "struck the feet of iron and clay, smashing it to bits.
[00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:50.560]   "The whole statue crushed into small pieces of clay,
[00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:52.120]   "iron, gold, and bronze.
[00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:55.080]   "Then the wind blew away all of them without a trace,
[00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:57.040]   "like chaff on a threshing floor.
[00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:59.840]   "But the rock that knocked down the statue
[00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:03.360]   "became a great mountain that covered the whole earth."
[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:05.200]   He says, "You saw there was a statue
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:06.240]   "and the head was made of something
[00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:07.840]   "and the arms were made of silver
[00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:10.480]   "and then the chest and the thighs were made of bronze
[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:11.720]   "and the legs were made of iron.
[00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:14.120]   "And then this rock comes out of nowhere
[00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:16.200]   "and it hits the feet of the statue
[00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:18.960]   "and the entire thing crumbles and collapses."
[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:23.320]   And the king is realizing, "That's exactly what I saw."
[00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:26.840]   And then Daniel says, "And here's the meaning of your dream."
[00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:30.400]   This is what he says, verse 36.
[00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:32.240]   "Now we will tell you what it means.
[00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:36.000]   "Your majesty, you are the king of kings,
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   "or the greatest of kings.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.840]   "God has given you sovereignty, power, strength, and honor.
[00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:43.440]   "He made you the ruler over all of the inhabited world.
[00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:45.560]   "You're the ruler of the known world.
[00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:50.200]   "You and your kingdom is the head of gold."
[00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:53.360]   So the first empire that we're told of
[00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:55.640]   is the Babylonian, the head of gold, if you will.
[00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:59.800]   The statue, a replica, a remake of it is right there.
[00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:01.320]   And he sees this image and the head is gold
[00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:03.400]   and the reason Babylon would have been gold
[00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:05.400]   is like I said earlier, the amount of gold,
[00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:07.440]   people didn't even know existed in the entire world,
[00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:09.440]   that the city was filled with it.
[00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:14.520]   And then he says, "But there's another kingdom,"
[00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:18.720]   verse 37, 39.
[00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:22.480]   "But after your kingdom,"
[00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:26.560]   in other words, your kingdom will come to an end.
[00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:31.560]   "Another kingdom inferior to yours
[00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:34.960]   "will rise and take your place."
[00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:36.720]   The two arms are made out of silver
[00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:41.320]   and the silver kingdom is the Medo-Persian kingdom.
[00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:43.440]   It was these two groups that combined,
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:45.120]   Medes and the Persians,
[00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:47.480]   that eventually 100 years later,
[00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:51.080]   or no, 50 years later, would conquer Babylon.
[00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:55.760]   And it's represented by these two arms coming together.
[00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:58.120]   And it will take down your kingdom.
[00:19:58.120 --> 00:19:59.680]   And then he says, "And then there's another kingdom
[00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:00.520]   "that's coming."
[00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:03.400]   Verse 30, 40.
[00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:07.160]   "After that kingdom has fallen,
[00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:11.000]   "yet a third kingdom represented by bronze
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.560]   "will rise to rule the world."
[00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:17.360]   So he says there's the gold kingdom,
[00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:19.960]   then there's gonna be another kingdom that takes you down.
[00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:22.480]   Then there's gonna be a kingdom after you,
[00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:24.920]   which would be the kingdom of Greece.
[00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:27.920]   Why would it be the kingdom of bronze?
[00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:31.360]   Well, the Greek kingdom, again, none of this has happened.
[00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:33.760]   Daniel's saying this is what's about to happen
[00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:35.800]   in the next few centuries.
[00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:40.800]   The bronze kingdom was led by a guy named Alexander the Great.
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:43.200]   Alexander the Great mastered, perfected,
[00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:46.880]   had his soldiers perfect the use of bronze in weaponry.
[00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:49.280]   So it was the bronze kingdom.
[00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:51.000]   Alexander the Great would conquer the known world
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.080]   from Egypt to India by the age of 33.
[00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:59.000]   And he would conquer and come in
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.400]   and be the third kingdom represented here.
[00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:05.080]   What's interesting is 200 years later,
[00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:07.200]   when Alexander was conquering the world
[00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:09.120]   and establishing his kingdom,
[00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:10.720]   he comes outside of Jerusalem.
[00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:13.320]   And he's about to take on Israel.
[00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:16.640]   And the high priest goes outside of the city
[00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:18.760]   and brings with him the book of Daniel
[00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:21.560]   and says, "Don't kill us.
[00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:23.800]   "We saw you coming.
[00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:27.440]   "Our God told us that you were here
[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:28.880]   "and that you would conquer."
[00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:32.200]   And Alexander the Great is so flattered
[00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:35.880]   that his kingdom would be written and prophesied about
[00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:37.280]   in here and in chapter seven
[00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:41.640]   that he doesn't destroy the city and moves forward.
[00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:44.880]   And yet after this kingdom,
[00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:46.480]   we're told of another one that would raise up,
[00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:48.000]   where Daniel says, "Following that kingdom,
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.720]   "there will be a fourth one.
[00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:51.960]   "It will be strong as iron,
[00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:56.960]   "and that kingdom will smash and crush all previous empires
[00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:01.000]   "just as iron smashes and crushes everything it strikes."
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.440]   So it's gonna be an even stronger kingdom.
[00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:05.640]   Iron was known as the strongest metal at the time.
[00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:08.520]   And this kingdom would be represented by Rome.
[00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:09.760]   It would be stronger than all the others.
[00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:13.840]   And Rome established a military might
[00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:16.400]   unlike anything the world had ever seen.
[00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:19.520]   And they ruled for hundreds of years.
[00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:23.560]   All of this is written 600 years
[00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:25.400]   before any of that would ever happen.
[00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:27.640]   And Daniel's saying, "Kingdom of heaven,
[00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:31.960]   "God has told you what is going to happen."
[00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:33.840]   Now before we go to the next point
[00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:38.200]   and discover why he was so terrified at that reality,
[00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:42.120]   I just wanna camp on something in the second observation.
[00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:45.320]   Everything is under God's control.
[00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:48.000]   Everyone needs God, and everything is under God's control.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.320]   I want you to think about what Daniel just said.
[00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:52.160]   We often think that, "Man, where is God
[00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:53.160]   "and how could this be happening?"
[00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:57.160]   And Daniel just said, "There's gonna be an empire
[00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:59.400]   "set up by Alexander the Great,
[00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:01.680]   "who is anything but a worshiper of God,
[00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:04.680]   "and God's gonna be sovereignly over him ruling."
[00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:06.560]   There's gonna be an empire set up by the Persians.
[00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:07.520]   Remember Xerxes?
[00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:10.560]   And they're gonna basically invent crucifixion,
[00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:12.880]   and they're gonna be a wicked-filled people,
[00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:16.200]   but God is going to allow their empire to be established.
[00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:19.960]   God is gonna allow the Roman Empire to be established.
[00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:22.280]   That God is in control of everything,
[00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:24.640]   and these men sit and they think that they're in control.
[00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:29.640]   They are pawns in the story God is writing.
[00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:34.200]   And he will use anyone and everyone and everything
[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:37.640]   because everything is underneath God's control.
[00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:40.280]   Daniel even highlights this in verse 21, where he says,
[00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:43.200]   "He controls the course of world events.
[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:47.040]   "He removes kings and he sets up other kings.
[00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:51.360]   "That he is sovereign and in control
[00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:54.200]   "over what is happening in Ukraine,
[00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:55.800]   "over what's happening in Dallas,
[00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:57.000]   "over what's happening in Russia,
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.600]   "what happened in Iran.
[00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:03.400]   "That God is sovereign and in control over all of it."
[00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:06.160]   And the Scripture tells us that as believers,
[00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:09.520]   we have a promise from God that he is using
[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:11.680]   and will use everything in this life
[00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:14.520]   to bring about good for those who love him.
[00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:15.880]   Romans chapter eight, verse 28 says that,
[00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:20.720]   "God works all things together for good
[00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:24.920]   "for the people of God or for those who love him."
[00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:28.000]   And make no mistake, King Nebuchadnezzar,
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   you are not in control, but there is one who is.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.420]   My wife, in this season, 'cause we have a newborn,
[00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:37.480]   often will send me and I'll take the kids
[00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:40.240]   and we'll go shopping because there's some age
[00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:42.280]   where it's like until 12 weeks and they have shots,
[00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:44.760]   you're basically kind of like on lockdown with the baby
[00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:46.200]   and so she'll hang at home with them
[00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:47.160]   and I'll take the other two kids
[00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:48.680]   and we'll go out shopping,
[00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:52.720]   which is honestly one of the most exhausting things
[00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:54.520]   of all time because you walk into a store
[00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:55.580]   and you got two little kids
[00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:57.520]   and they're just going crazy running around
[00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:00.600]   and you're trying to just walk the walk of shame
[00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:01.440]   as people look at you like,
[00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:03.120]   "What kind of parent are you right there?
[00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:04.280]   "They don't even have clothes on."
[00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:05.620]   And they're running around going like,
[00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:07.080]   "Hey, can we get a toy, can we get a toy, can we?"
[00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:08.120]   And I'm like, "We're at the gas station,
[00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:09.800]   "they don't have toys at the gas station."
[00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:10.840]   And that's just what they think.
[00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:12.280]   Anytime that they go shopping anywhere,
[00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:13.480]   they're going to get a toy.
[00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:15.120]   And so it's just madness.
[00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:17.040]   And sometimes I honestly just give them a toy,
[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:19.880]   just stop, just stop, take the toy.
[00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:22.560]   There's one exception to shopping that honestly,
[00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:25.220]   it focuses all of their energy
[00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:27.280]   and distracts them with enough time
[00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:29.200]   that it makes it a little bit more enjoyable.
[00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:30.760]   And that's when you go to a shopping center
[00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:34.600]   that has a shopping cart with a car on it.
[00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:36.160]   Looks something like this.
[00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:37.080]   Why is that important?
[00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:38.600]   Because they get in the cart
[00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:40.420]   and they think that they're driving the cart.
[00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:42.320]   And so they're like, "Yes, we're going this way
[00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:43.960]   "and yes, we're going this way."
[00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:46.200]   And they're taking turns and they're going around
[00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:48.360]   and we're going through and getting the list of things
[00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:50.160]   mom said we gotta go get.
[00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:52.940]   Inevitably, while we're driving,
[00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:55.640]   there comes a point where they wanna take another lap
[00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:58.480]   around the store and I need to go get a light bulb
[00:25:58.480 --> 00:25:59.320]   or go get something else.
[00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:01.120]   And they turn right and I turn left.
[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:04.920]   And they discover, "Wait a second.
[00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:06.680]   (congregation laughing)
[00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:09.400]   "I'm not driving this thing at all."
[00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:12.120]   And they may throw a fit, they may freak out,
[00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:15.160]   they may react, but they become very aware
[00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:17.360]   who's driving the cart.
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:24.480]   And the message of the Bible and what Daniel is depicting
[00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:29.260]   is that don't buy the lie that you're driving the cart.
[00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:32.860]   But there is a God in heaven who is actively involved
[00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:35.760]   in the events and the circumstances of the world around you
[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:36.880]   and he is in control.
[00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:39.760]   And there is nothing that you or I will ever face
[00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:42.500]   that he is not sovereignly over,
[00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:44.920]   that he is not in power over,
[00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:48.680]   that he will not use to bring about good from
[00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:50.840]   for the people of God.
[00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:53.800]   Because he's in control.
[00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:56.160]   And this should move us to do a couple things
[00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:57.160]   that I think Daniel models.
[00:26:57.160 --> 00:27:00.760]   One of them is Daniel is faced with a problem
[00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:01.600]   and what does he do?
[00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:03.080]   He immediately moves to pray.
[00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:07.240]   Because he knew, "My God controls everything.
[00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:08.780]   "He controls king's hearts.
[00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:10.720]   "He controls everything that is.
[00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:12.600]   "So I'm gonna go to him in prayer."
[00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:15.920]   How often when problems hit do you not turn,
[00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:20.000]   do I not turn to God and ask him for help?
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.080]   God, you know what I'm walking through right now at work
[00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:24.560]   and you know what I'm concerned about
[00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:25.800]   as it relates to this presentation
[00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:27.640]   or my boss's opinion of me?
[00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:32.720]   And we don't ask God for help.
[00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:35.680]   Like Daniel models just what a belief
[00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:38.480]   and a death grip on my God is in control of everything.
[00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:44.420]   And so I can ask him because he can change and do anything
[00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:47.140]   and it moves him to go to God in prayer.
[00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:49.340]   The second thing that we see modeled out from him
[00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:53.700]   is that it moves him to trust that even,
[00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:55.420]   I mean Daniel is sitting in the palace
[00:27:55.420 --> 00:27:57.300]   600 miles away from his home.
[00:27:57.300 --> 00:28:00.300]   He had every reason to believe,
[00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:02.500]   "God has forgotten me, God is up to nothing.
[00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:05.620]   "I'm about to get killed by this crazy king
[00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:07.260]   "if I can't tell him his dream."
[00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:11.400]   And yet he believed, "God is still in control,
[00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:16.160]   "he can answer my prayer and I'm gonna choose to trust him."
[00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:19.040]   What's astounding about the predictions is,
[00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:23.280]   think about it, all of these would come to pass
[00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:26.160]   and Daniel lays out these are the only empires
[00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:27.480]   that will ever exist.
[00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:31.400]   And to this day he's been correct.
[00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:35.800]   I mean, March Madness is going on right now
[00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:37.580]   and in the history of March Madness,
[00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:42.580]   not one person has ever predicted successfully a bracket,
[00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:43.520]   not one.
[00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:47.160]   And he lays out and predicts every world empire
[00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:50.200]   that will ever be and gets them exactly right.
[00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:56.920]   Because he knew the God who controls everything.
[00:28:56.920 --> 00:29:01.720]   Finally, final observation that we see
[00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:08.560]   is that every kingdom but God's won't last.
[00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:11.640]   It says this, "The feet and the toes you saw
[00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:14.620]   "were a combination of iron and clay,
[00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:16.440]   "showing this kingdom, this next kingdom,
[00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:18.600]   "will be divided like iron mixed with clay.
[00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:19.980]   "It will have some strength of iron,
[00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:21.860]   "but while some parts of it will be as strong as iron,
[00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:23.920]   "other will be as weak as clay.
[00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:27.340]   "The mixture of iron and clay shows that these kingdoms
[00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:30.040]   "will strengthen themselves by forming alliances
[00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:33.320]   "through inner marriage,
[00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:34.600]   "but they will not hold together
[00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:37.240]   "just as iron and clay do not mix."
[00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:38.840]   What is he saying right there?
[00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:41.620]   This is one of those that the interpretation is divided.
[00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:45.440]   It's either referring to what happened after Rome,
[00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:46.880]   which was Europe,
[00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:50.140]   and that there would be kingdoms that would rise up,
[00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:53.680]   but no super kingdom would ever quite dominate
[00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:56.000]   all of that area, and they would have marriages
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.480]   where Henry V would marry some French lady
[00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:00.840]   and they'd try to hold and build a stronger kingdom,
[00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:02.140]   but it wouldn't last.
[00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:07.980]   Or he's referring to a kingdom
[00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:11.020]   that will rise up at the very end,
[00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:15.100]   made up of 10 kings like the 10 toes in the feet
[00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:17.260]   that Revelation points to.
[00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:20.740]   Either way, it's Daniel reflecting,
[00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:24.420]   hey, there was not going to be another superpower like these
[00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:27.520]   that will rule, expand, and conquer all of the world.
[00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:32.220]   But during the reign of those kings, verse 44,
[00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:36.220]   the God of heaven will set up a kingdom
[00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:38.880]   that will never be destroyed or conquered.
[00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:44.380]   It will crush all these kingdoms into nothingness.
[00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:47.540]   It will stand forever.
[00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:52.000]   That is the meaning of the rock cut from the mountain,
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.120]   though not by human hands,
[00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:59.100]   that crushed to pieces the statue,
[00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:01.140]   the great God was showing the king
[00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:03.460]   what will happen in the future.
[00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:07.500]   The dream is true and its meaning is certain.
[00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:11.140]   Nebuchadnezzar hears it, knows it,
[00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:13.660]   falls, we're told, verse 46, at Daniel's feet,
[00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:16.700]   and he worshiped him, commanded sacrifices be made,
[00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:17.980]   and then he said to Daniel,
[00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:20.920]   truly your God is the greatest of all gods,
[00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:23.220]   the Lord over kings, revealer of mysteries.
[00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:25.260]   You have revealed the secret.
[00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:26.980]   Then he gives Daniel a promotion,
[00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:28.820]   puts him in charge of all the wise men.
[00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:31.220]   The final thing we see is that every kingdom
[00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:34.240]   but God's won't last.
[00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:37.140]   This is why Nebuchadnezzar was terrified.
[00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:38.940]   And candidly, this is why a lot of people,
[00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:41.780]   when they think about the end of their life,
[00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:43.620]   become terrified.
[00:31:43.620 --> 00:31:45.220]   Nebuchadnezzar is confronted with the fact that,
[00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:46.900]   hey, there's gonna come another kingdom
[00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:48.320]   that's going to destroy yours.
[00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:49.420]   Yours is not gonna last.
[00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:52.580]   In fact, every human kingdom will be ultimately destroyed,
[00:31:52.580 --> 00:31:54.500]   and it filled him with terror.
[00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:57.100]   That I've built my entire life
[00:31:57.100 --> 00:31:58.900]   trying to build walls of security,
[00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:00.700]   trying to build a name for myself.
[00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:05.660]   And Daniel is saying, your kingdom will not last.
[00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:08.220]   What you have given all of your strength
[00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:12.780]   and years of life to will be blown away,
[00:32:12.780 --> 00:32:16.940]   like a sand castle when the tide comes in,
[00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:21.260]   and you will have wasted your life, oh king,
[00:32:21.260 --> 00:32:24.740]   because every kingdom but God's won't last.
[00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:27.420]   The same instruction is applicable to us today.
[00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:31.460]   And knowing that God's kingdom alone will last,
[00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:32.460]   it will do two things.
[00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:34.540]   It'll either create hope when you hear that,
[00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:36.140]   man, I've given my life to the only thing
[00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:38.660]   that eternally is going to matter,
[00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:43.660]   or horror when your life is done.
[00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:46.300]   Because you will realize you have wasted,
[00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:47.900]   and you have given yourself to something
[00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:51.900]   that will not last, and wasted your life.
[00:32:52.780 --> 00:32:55.740]   And the king felt horror as he looked
[00:32:55.740 --> 00:32:58.540]   at the coming kingdom of God.
[00:32:58.540 --> 00:33:03.660]   The other thing that we see is the stone,
[00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:08.100]   which is Daniel in his picture of Jesus.
[00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:11.740]   Notice it said, a stone not cut by human hands.
[00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:12.580]   What does that mean?
[00:33:12.580 --> 00:33:17.140]   It was a stone that was divinely created.
[00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:20.180]   It wasn't cut from the mountain by any human work.
[00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:25.140]   It was a stone that had not been formed by human hands,
[00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:26.540]   and it's gonna come down,
[00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:30.780]   and it's gonna crush every kingdom that exists.
[00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:33.180]   That Jesus will establish a kingdom,
[00:33:33.180 --> 00:33:35.140]   and every other kingdom in this world,
[00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:38.700]   and every leading nation and empire
[00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:43.700]   will be crushed underneath the wonder
[00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:46.900]   of the everlasting kingdom Jesus is going to create.
[00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:51.420]   Daniel says it's true, it's sure, it's coming.
[00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:55.180]   Our God is establishing a kingdom that will never fade,
[00:33:55.180 --> 00:33:59.100]   and every kingdom but God's won't last.
[00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:01.740]   As it's been said, history,
[00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:03.420]   and the point of all of human history
[00:34:03.420 --> 00:34:08.100]   is that it is his story, our God's.
[00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:10.580]   Daniel is giving a spoiler alert to Nebuchadnezzar.
[00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:12.020]   You are gonna waste your life,
[00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:14.180]   and you will waste your life if you spend it
[00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:16.100]   trying to build and amass your kingdom,
[00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:17.660]   and focused on you getting the house,
[00:34:17.660 --> 00:34:19.540]   and getting the car, and getting the raise,
[00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:21.020]   and make them a million by 30,
[00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:23.340]   all of which are great, and I hope that you do,
[00:34:23.340 --> 00:34:25.460]   but if that is the focal point of your life,
[00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:27.940]   you are building a kingdom that will not last.
[00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:31.660]   And the scriptures teach us
[00:34:31.660 --> 00:34:34.300]   the way that we live for an eternal kingdom
[00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:37.100]   starts with living with an eternal mindset.
[00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:38.100]   What do I mean by that?
[00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:39.220]   You read the New Testament,
[00:34:39.220 --> 00:34:40.060]   and you see verses like,
[00:34:40.060 --> 00:34:42.700]   hey, set your mind on things above.
[00:34:42.700 --> 00:34:46.560]   Colossians chapter three, verse two says.
[00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:48.880]   Or in 2 Corinthians chapter four, it says,
[00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:51.500]   we fix our eyes not on what is seen,
[00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:54.540]   but on what is unseen, because what is seen is temporary,
[00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:56.540]   but what is unseen is eternal,
[00:34:56.540 --> 00:34:58.700]   and that's where we fix our focus,
[00:34:58.700 --> 00:35:02.520]   and that leads to living from an eternal mindset.
[00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:05.640]   And the scriptures say that when it comes
[00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:06.860]   to how you think about your life,
[00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:08.260]   the way that you and I live for a kingdom
[00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:09.580]   that actually will last is we begin
[00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:11.500]   to think through the lens of eternity.
[00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:12.340]   What does that mean?
[00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:13.160]   It means your job.
[00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:15.420]   You don't see yourself just there to work, get a paycheck.
[00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:18.700]   You see yourself there as someone to promote
[00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:21.460]   the name of Jesus, to share the gospel
[00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:24.100]   with people around you, to speak.
[00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:25.980]   When somebody brings up how they're walking
[00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:28.740]   through a hard time, and they really are facing challenges,
[00:35:28.740 --> 00:35:31.740]   you're a voice that's there that says,
[00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:34.180]   can I tell you where I turn when things are hard?
[00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:38.060]   Can I just share what I feel like God
[00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:40.580]   has been really growing in me lately?
[00:35:40.580 --> 00:35:43.500]   And you see it as an eternal opportunity
[00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:48.500]   as Titus chapter two says, to promote in everything
[00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:51.380]   the teachings of our Savior.
[00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:53.720]   It means when it comes to thinking of a spouse,
[00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:54.920]   you think through the lens of eternity,
[00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:57.060]   but you're not just looking for somebody who's hot or not,
[00:35:57.060 --> 00:35:59.180]   or somebody that has some sort of body type.
[00:35:59.180 --> 00:36:01.800]   I'm looking for someone who has an eternal mindset,
[00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:05.180]   because no human relationship is gonna impact this life
[00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:09.220]   or my eternal life and how I use this life like my spouse.
[00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:11.380]   So I'm looking for somebody who wants to lock arms
[00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:15.140]   as we raise disciples, make babies, and live for eternity.
[00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:18.420]   It looks like when it comes to your time,
[00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:20.500]   you don't think, oh, my 20s, these are my years
[00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:23.020]   to spend on you, to sow my wild oats.
[00:36:23.020 --> 00:36:26.140]   It looks like I wanna live for Jesus and my generation,
[00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:28.760]   and I'm gonna use the life, the gifts, the time
[00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:31.820]   that he has given me to do what Ecclesiastes 12 says,
[00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:34.380]   and I'm gonna remember my creator and my youth,
[00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:38.180]   'cause I'm gonna build him the only kingdom that will last.
[00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:42.140]   And Daniel has a confidence, 'cause he says,
[00:36:42.140 --> 00:36:45.820]   "You, king, you've been building a kingdom
[00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:50.820]   "that's gonna crumble, and God is telling you
[00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:52.780]   "the human history."
[00:36:52.780 --> 00:36:55.660]   He doesn't tell anybody else this specific
[00:36:55.660 --> 00:36:57.580]   of a narrative of what is to come,
[00:36:57.580 --> 00:37:01.660]   because God wants you to repent.
[00:37:01.660 --> 00:37:04.880]   God's pursuing you, Nebuchadnezzar.
[00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:06.720]   He wants you to know you don't have to give your life
[00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:10.180]   to building your kingdom, and you can know the God of heaven
[00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:13.220]   and you can be a part of building his,
[00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:17.060]   or you will be crushed by it.
[00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:24.340]   And Daniel models living and embracing,
[00:37:24.340 --> 00:37:27.520]   I'm gonna have a mindset that flows
[00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:29.660]   from my relationship with my God.
[00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:32.460]   In the inside of my wedding ring,
[00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:36.340]   my wife had written 2 Corinthians 5,
[00:37:36.340 --> 00:37:40.740]   verse 14 and 15, where it talks about Paul's description
[00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:43.340]   of how we now see this life as those of us
[00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:44.500]   who are believers and that we live
[00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:45.540]   the only kingdom that lasts.
[00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:48.820]   He says in verse 14, 2 Corinthians chapter five,
[00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:53.820]   "Christ's love compels us, for we are convinced
[00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:57.820]   "that one died for all," that's Jesus,
[00:37:57.820 --> 00:38:00.040]   "and therefore all died, and he died for all
[00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:04.120]   "that those who live should no longer live for themselves,
[00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:09.120]   "but for him who died for them and was raised again.
[00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:13.180]   "We therefore," verse 20, "are Christ's ambassadors,
[00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:17.300]   "as though God was making his appeal through us."
[00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:20.860]   There was a story this week that I read
[00:38:20.860 --> 00:38:23.760]   of a missionary named James Calvert.
[00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:29.660]   He was a missionary to the Fiji Islands in the mid-1800s.
[00:38:29.660 --> 00:38:32.700]   And when you think of Fiji, you probably think like I do
[00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:35.700]   with just huts over the water that have glass.
[00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:39.180]   It's like, that's a pretty sweet gig to be a missionary to.
[00:38:39.180 --> 00:38:42.540]   But Fiji in the 1850s was very different.
[00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:46.740]   And the island had native tribes that were there
[00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:47.820]   that were cannibals.
[00:38:47.820 --> 00:38:52.220]   And James Calvert felt called to go
[00:38:52.220 --> 00:38:54.900]   and share the message of Jesus with these men.
[00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:57.020]   And so he took a group with him,
[00:38:57.020 --> 00:38:58.860]   and they were going there to share the gospel,
[00:38:58.860 --> 00:39:00.860]   and they get on the boat, and they ride over,
[00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:04.040]   and they arrive at Fiji, and the captain of the boat says,
[00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:05.440]   "You can't stay here.
[00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:09.860]   "If you stay here, you will die,
[00:39:09.860 --> 00:39:12.100]   "and all of the men with you will die."
[00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:17.280]   And James Calvert responds and says,
[00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:22.880]   "We died before we came here."
[00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:29.300]   In Christ, we died to ambition, selfish goals,
[00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:31.940]   our own dreams, we died to self
[00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:33.340]   and everything that self desires.
[00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:36.740]   We died that Christ may live in and through us,
[00:39:36.740 --> 00:39:39.820]   that whatever we attempt within his call of God
[00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:40.900]   brings him glory.
[00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:43.940]   We died before we came here so that there'd be no hindrance,
[00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:46.900]   no barriers within ourselves to follow Christ
[00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:49.580]   in the areas of the world where there is a great darkness
[00:39:49.580 --> 00:39:51.220]   and a yearning for the light.
[00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:52.060]   What is he saying?
[00:39:52.060 --> 00:39:55.540]   He's saying, "I've already died to living for myself.
[00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:56.580]   "I'm not here for that purpose.
[00:39:56.580 --> 00:39:59.860]   "I'm here to build the only kingdom that matters."
[00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:01.820]   And that will last.
[00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:06.820]   In conclusion, everyone needs God,
[00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:09.060]   everything is under God's control,
[00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:14.060]   and every kingdom with God or other than God's will fade.
[00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:18.300]   Now there's one last prediction that I didn't highlight
[00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:19.920]   that you see has happened.
[00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:24.940]   And it's a prediction that he had in verse 34 and 35.
[00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:26.800]   I'm gonna read it again.
[00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:29.400]   Daniel's saying, "Here's what you saw.
[00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:31.160]   "You saw the statue and then you saw this rock
[00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:33.500]   "and it came out of the heavens
[00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:35.460]   "and it smashed every earthly kingdom.
[00:40:35.460 --> 00:40:41.900]   "And then that stone grew and became a great mountain
[00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:46.840]   "that filled the whole earth."
[00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:48.020]   What is he talking about?
[00:40:48.020 --> 00:40:49.500]   He's talking about Jesus.
[00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:51.740]   He's talking about the message of Jesus.
[00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:53.580]   And this is another one of the prophecies
[00:40:53.580 --> 00:40:57.580]   that we have seen happen with a message of Christianity,
[00:40:57.580 --> 00:40:59.140]   the message of Jesus, which is what?
[00:40:59.140 --> 00:41:01.500]   In case you're curious, it's that God came into the world
[00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:04.220]   in the form of Christ, Jesus, 2000 years ago,
[00:41:04.220 --> 00:41:06.020]   and he died on a cross for you, for me,
[00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:09.020]   for anyone who's ever sinned, which is everyone.
[00:41:09.020 --> 00:41:11.500]   And he gave his life as the payment for your sin.
[00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:13.860]   And anyone who believes in him
[00:41:13.860 --> 00:41:16.100]   and accepts his death and resurrection
[00:41:16.100 --> 00:41:18.260]   as payment for the mistakes they've made,
[00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:21.740]   the sin in their life, they will live forever,
[00:41:21.740 --> 00:41:23.500]   the Bible says.
[00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:28.500]   And that message has exploded past the walls of the empire.
[00:41:28.860 --> 00:41:31.420]   It was formed in and spread all over the earth,
[00:41:31.420 --> 00:41:33.540]   and that stone has become a great mountain
[00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:34.420]   covering the whole earth.
[00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:35.340]   What do I mean by that?
[00:41:35.340 --> 00:41:36.660]   People think of Christianity as something
[00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:38.440]   that's in the West or it's something in America.
[00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:41.900]   Christianity is exploding all over the world.
[00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:46.260]   You look at Latin America, you look at Asia-America,
[00:41:46.260 --> 00:41:48.940]   and the countries that are exploding with Christianity
[00:41:48.940 --> 00:41:51.780]   far outnumber even today.
[00:41:51.780 --> 00:41:54.500]   In fact, the fastest places the gospel is growing today
[00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:56.860]   is Africa, Asia, and Latin America.
[00:41:56.860 --> 00:42:00.460]   Two-thirds of all self-identifying Christians today
[00:42:00.460 --> 00:42:03.180]   live in Africa, Asia, or Latin America.
[00:42:03.180 --> 00:42:05.220]   To say Christianity is just something for white people
[00:42:05.220 --> 00:42:06.940]   in the West or something for Americans
[00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:09.060]   or something for, is crazy,
[00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:11.900]   and lives in denial of what is actually true.
[00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:15.020]   The fact that the gospel is exploding all over Africa today,
[00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:17.020]   there are more practicing Christians in Africa
[00:42:17.020 --> 00:42:18.780]   than all of Europe combined.
[00:42:18.780 --> 00:42:22.220]   There are more Anglicans, which is the Church of England,
[00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:24.620]   in Africa than there are in England.
[00:42:24.620 --> 00:42:25.900]   There are more Presbyterian,
[00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:29.220]   which is the Church of Scotland, inside of Ghana,
[00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:31.660]   than there are in Scotland.
[00:42:31.660 --> 00:42:34.900]   There are more Christian scholars say today in China
[00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:37.620]   than all of America, and by 2050,
[00:42:37.620 --> 00:42:40.660]   it is estimated that the population of China
[00:42:40.660 --> 00:42:43.380]   will be a majority Christian nation
[00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:45.260]   in a country where it is outlawed.
[00:42:45.260 --> 00:42:48.620]   The message of Jesus is exploding
[00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:51.500]   because our God said it would be a message
[00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:54.380]   that would be a stone that will eventually topple
[00:42:54.380 --> 00:42:56.700]   all earthly kingdoms and it will spread
[00:42:56.700 --> 00:42:59.060]   and be a mountain covering the whole Earth.
[00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:01.100]   Don't buy the lie that Christianity
[00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:03.500]   is in any form on its way out,
[00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:05.900]   because our God is a rock of salvation
[00:43:05.900 --> 00:43:07.100]   to those who trust in him,
[00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:11.160]   and a rock that will not be stopped,
[00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:14.500]   and a force that is growing all over
[00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:16.580]   (congregation applauding)
[00:43:16.580 --> 00:43:20.100]   through the same God that worked through Daniel.
[00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:20.940]   Let me pray.
[00:43:22.020 --> 00:43:26.060]   Father, I thank you that you are at work all over our world,
[00:43:26.060 --> 00:43:27.460]   and there are brothers and sisters right now
[00:43:27.460 --> 00:43:29.220]   that are praying in every language,
[00:43:29.220 --> 00:43:35.100]   of every socioeconomic status,
[00:43:35.100 --> 00:43:41.280]   of every skin color, every nationality,
[00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:45.100]   and hundreds of languages,
[00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:47.600]   and they're crying out and praying to the same God
[00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:51.700]   that Daniel prayed to, that gave Nebuchadnezzar the dream.
[00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:53.780]   I pray that you would prevent this generation,
[00:43:53.780 --> 00:43:57.420]   ourselves, from living for a kingdom that will not last.
[00:43:57.420 --> 00:44:00.220]   I pray that anyone who's never put their faith
[00:44:00.220 --> 00:44:02.580]   in that message that is spreading and filling
[00:44:02.580 --> 00:44:06.060]   the whole Earth of our God who came to save,
[00:44:06.060 --> 00:44:07.140]   tonight would be their night.
[00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:08.540]   We worship you in song, amen.
