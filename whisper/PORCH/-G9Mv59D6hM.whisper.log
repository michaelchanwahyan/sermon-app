[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   [Music]
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   Hey, hey, alright porch, how we doing?
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   Good to be here in Dallas and say hello to our friends in Houston and Fort Worth and other places that are tuning in.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   Man, it is awesome to be together.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   My name is Todd and I get to hang out with you for a little bit tonight.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   We're talking about BC, man, before Christ.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   Stories that happened before the man that all of history pivoted on shows up.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   And I just want to start by just saying it's a little crazy sometimes when you read some of these stories.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   If you haven't been tuning in with us these last couple of weeks, you heard a story about some old goat
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   went around the desert that God appeared to and said, "Quit worshipping what you're worshipping, come know me."
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   And later that man had a son when he was about 100 years old and that son was supposed to be offered
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   as a sacrifice of faith by him.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   And right when that old man got ready to kill his son, some other old goat, a ram, was caught in some thicket and was delivered.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   That sounds crazy.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   And from that guy and that son, all the nations of the world were supposed to be blessed.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   That sounds crazy.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   It sounds crazy that even before that guy, there was another guy that was living on the earth
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   and the earth was becoming very wicked and God chose him to build an ark in the middle of a desert
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   before a flood came and judged the whole world.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   And that the whole world would eventually be destroyed and yet God would use that guy
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   who proclaimed the coming judgment of God, if people trusted in him,
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   they would move towards that instrument of wood which he built that when the judgment came
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   they'd be raised up in and saved in.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   Sounds crazy.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   A little bit later there's a story about a young guy that God chose when he was out there in the desert
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   tending a flock of sheep and he said, "I'm going to make you king over my people.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   I'm going to make you considered great. I'm going to use you to defeat a giant,
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   a guy that's nine foot plus tall and intimidated entire armies.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   I'm going to use you to take him down and I'm going to use you to remind my people how great I am."
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   That story sounds crazy.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   That's what I don't like about the Bible. It's full of crazy stories.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   I mean, like, think about this.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   What if I told you this story, that there was the most powerful nation in the history of the world.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   Economically, militarily wise, it was just thriving, it was prospering, it was kicking it like no other nation ever had.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   And 18 men were going to come attack this nation and just cripple it economically.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   They were going to penetrate its fortress of military strength.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   It was going to shut down all commerce.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   These 18 men were going to take down this huge national force of economic power and military strength.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   If I told you that 18 guys did that, you'd go, "That's what I don't like about your Bible, Todd.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   That's a ridiculous story."
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   And yet, if you were tuning in September 11, 2001, that's exactly what happened.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   That in history, 18 men shut this country down.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   They melted the symbols of economic strength and power, the World Trade Center.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   They penetrated the fortress, which represents our worldwide military strength,
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   and our nation was paralyzed and in fear.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   That's just 15 years ago in history.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   And it flat sounds crazy if you tell it a certain way looking back.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   The Bible's filled with crazy stories.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   I'm going to tell you one of the craziest ones tonight.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   I'm going to tell you that there's some lesson in there for you.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   I'm going to introduce it to you by just giving you a riddle.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   This is a riddle that some guy that apparently had more money than sense had put word out
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   that if anybody could come up with a puzzle or a riddle that they themselves had created
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   that he couldn't answer, he would give them $1,000.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   This was decades ago, and that was a lot of money.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   And so some woman entered this particular riddle into the contest,
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   and the guy couldn't solve it.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   I want to see if you can solve it, and we'll give you a prize.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   What are we going to give them, David?
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   Entrance to launch.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   Are we going to do that?
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   We're not, but we're going to give you the riddle anyway.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   All right?
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   Here's the riddle.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   "Adam, God made out of dust, but he thought best to make me first.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   So I was made before man to answer God's most holy plan.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   A living being I became, and Adam gave to me my name.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   I from his presence withdrew, and more from Adam never knew.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   I did my maker's law obey, nor ever from it went astray.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   Thousands of miles I go each year, but seldom on earth do I appear.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   For purpose-wise, which God did see, he put a living soul in me,
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   a soul from God, I did claim, and God from me took the soul again.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   So when from me the soul had fled, I was the same as when first made,
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   and without hands, feet, or soul, I travel on from pole to pole.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   I labor hard by day, by night.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   To fallen men I give great light.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   Thousands of people, young and old, will by my death great light behold.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   No right or wrong can I conceive.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   The scripture I cannot believe.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   Although my name is there and found, they are to me an empty sound.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   No fate of death doth trouble me.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   Real happiness I'll never see.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   To heaven I will never go, nor will I go to hell below.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   Now when these lines you slowly read, go search your Bible with all speed,
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   for that my name is written there, I do honestly to you declare.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   Now that, my friends, is brilliant, especially when you know the answer.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   Anybody who has never heard that before, have any idea,
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   maybe somebody who didn't know what we were talking about tonight,
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   have any idea what the answer to that could be?
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   What do you got out there?
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   Is that wisdom?
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   Holy Spirit?
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   No, no, and no.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   The answer is a whale.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   Now listen again.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   Adam God made out of dust, but he thought best to make me first.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   If you know anything about Genesis, the order of creation,
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   the animals and the sea creatures were made first.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   So I was made before man to answer God's most holy plan.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   A living being I became, and Adam gave to me his name.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   You guys know Adam named all the animals.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   I from his presence withdrew from Adam's presence withdrew,
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   and more from Adam never knew.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   Adam never taught me anything again.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   I did my maker's law obey, nor ever from it went astray.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   Thousands of miles I go each year, but seldom on earth do I appear.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   For purpose wise, which God did see, he put a living soul in me.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   Now we're getting to the story.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   You see why it was safe to offer you guys not just the launch this year,
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   but a new car and a million dollars.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   Sorry no one got it.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   But listen to this.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   This is really great.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   A soul from me God did claim and took from me that soul again.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   So when from me the soul had fled, I was made the same as when first made.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   And without hands, now feet, or soul, I travel on from pole to pole.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   I labor hard by day by night to fall in men I give great light.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   Now that one might be kind of hard.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   Why?
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   Do you know that what they would use to make light is they would burn blubber, whale oil.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   Thousands of people, young and old, will buy my death, great light, behold.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   No right or wrong can I conceive.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   The scripture I cannot believe.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   Although my name therein is found, they are to me an empty sound.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   No fate of death to trouble me, real happiness I'll never see.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   To heaven I will never go, nor will I go to hell below.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   Animals don't have a soul, don't have that kind of judgment.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   They're here and gone, not like you.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   Pay attention tonight.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   Now when these lines you slowly read, go search your Bible, we'll all speed for that.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   My name is written there, I do honestly to you declare it.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   We're talking about a whale.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   No we're not, we're talking about the story of Jonah and the answer to the riddle, the whale.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   But here's a riddle for you.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   Why does God care so much, or does God care so much about you?
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   Especially if you coming in here tonight know just how wrong you are in the way you live.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   You, unlike the whale who does whatever God tells him to do, don't do at all what God tells you to do and you well know it.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   And you are somebody that is very far from God and the question is, does God care about you?
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   And I'm going to show you the answer to that tonight.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   And I'm also going to show you the answer to this.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   Let's say by some miraculous story of grace you have come to know already that God loves you and cares for you.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   Are you fully engaged in the way that God wants you to be engaged with the truth that you have come to know?
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   So we're going to read the story of Jonah and the whale.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   It's a crazy story.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   But what you're going to find out is this isn't really a story that is to be discussed about whether it is allegorical or whether it's a parable.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   An allegory is a story that everything means anything and it has lots of different meanings to it.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   A parable is that there is some meaning to the story but not what's there right immediately on the surface of it.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   Or is it historical?
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   To understand what the genre is, genre as you guys know because you're edumacated, is just a way to talk about what kind of literature something is.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   Is it poetical? Is it allegorical? Is it historical narrative?
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   What genre is Jonah? Should we believe it as a story that is really true?
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   It's not really a question of literature.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   It's a question of who you think Jesus is because Jesus, I will tell you at the very end of our time tonight,
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   compares his life and the final miracle authenticating who he was to this story.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   And if you believe Jesus is who he says he was, if you believe there is a BC and an AD,
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   if you believe there is a year of our Lord where everything pivots, all of human history pivots,
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   then you better believe that Jesus knew what he was talking about when he said that there was a Noah.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   Do you know that Jesus talked about Noah?
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   And so it's not whether the story of Noah could possibly happen, it's whether Jesus could possibly be who he claimed to be.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   Do you know that it's not crazy to think that all of humanity came from an Adam and an Eve,
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   two people created in the image of God?
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   It's really a question of do you believe Jesus is who he said he is because Jesus said God created an Adam and an Eve.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   It's not really a question of whether or not an old man in the desert wandering around could actually have implications on your life
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   because Jesus said that this old man Abraham has implications on your life.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   It's not really a question of whether David existed and slayed a giant because Jesus believed that David existed.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   So all these stories that we talk about in this before Christ, we don't have to really wonder too much about.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   We've got to answer just one question.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   Who is Jesus? What was he doing on the cross?
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   And when he came off that cross, was he dead?
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   And if he was dead, how in the world did he live again?
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   Because if it's true that Christ is God and he died for me,
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   and that he predicted his own death and his own means of defeating death
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   as a sign that he was a man who did not owe any obligation to sin's wages, which is death,
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   then you better pay attention to him.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   For me, I decide the story of Jonah and the whale is true
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   because I don't make it a habit of arguing with guys who walk on water,
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   call in the wind and the waves, give blind sight, and are risen from the grave.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   I happen to go, "Those guys might know something I don't."
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   And so what I want to really talk with you tonight about is this story,
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   and I'm going to take it for what Jesus says it was,
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   which is as a historical revelation anticipating an even greater resurrection.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   So here's one question we might ask ourselves.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   Is it possible that a whale could swallow a human being?
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   Now, I'm no expert in marine biology, but I have done some research.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   My buddy and I, when we every now and then take our wives away for vacation,
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   we go down sometimes to Mexico, and when we go to Mexico,
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   we are in Cabo, oftentimes when whales are down there,
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   we've just made a habit of grabbing snorkels and fins,
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   and when we see a whale coming down the shore, we just hook it out there in the ocean.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   Now, about five years ago, we got out, and we thought we could get near a whale,
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   and we got out there near this humpback, and here's a picture of my buddy and I out in the ocean with a whale.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   Now, what's wild--no, not that one, the one before that, you can clearly see the whale.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   What's--nope, nope, the original one, where there's two heads and a big whale right next to us.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   That's the one we want to show first as we talk.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   You'll see it in just a moment.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   But anyway, in that particular picture where there's two of us with this whale that is there--
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   maybe the picture didn't make it to you--
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   we actually didn't see the whale this particular time.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   It surfaced about 15 feet from us in this giant in the ocean that was near us.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   We completely missed.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   It was just that quiet. Nope, that's not the one. Don't even try it.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   We'll get to those in a minute.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   Appreciate you trying, though. All right?
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   So anyhow, that whale that was out there, we missed.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   Now, a couple years later, we get back out.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   Now, let me just show you this about whales.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   This is how big whales are.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   Here's a slide with all different kinds of whales, all right?
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   And you can see that they're anywhere from 69 to 90 feet if you're dealing with a blue whale,
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   or a humpback, which is the whale I swim out there sometimes to see,
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   because that's what--or out there are 42 to 50 feet.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   Just to give you an idea, okay?
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   A school bus is about 37 feet long.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   So here's a school bus, you know, behind me, okay?
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   These whales are anywhere from the middle of that IMAG here in Dallas
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   to the middle of that IMAG in Dallas.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   Here's a picture of a diver. This is a true story.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   There was a whale that was caught off the coast of California not long ago
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   in a bunch of crab nets.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   It was weighted down. It couldn't get up to breathe.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   And a fisherman saw it, and it radiated into a bunch of environmentalists.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   And they went out, and they realized the only way they were going to save this whale is to cut it free.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   And so they took a bunch of knives, and they cut the netting off this whale.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   And when the whale was freed up, it swam around them with circles of joy.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   The one guy said when he was cutting that last bit of netting off its mouth,
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   he said that eye of that whale just watched him, every move he made.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   And then it went, and just when it was cut free completely,
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   swam circles of joy, and it said it went up to every single diver and nudged it.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   Here's one last picture. I know. I know.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   So here's one last picture that was taken of one diver with that particular humpback whale.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   Now that is an amazing picture.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   What I want you to see is the size of that human next to that humpback whale,
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   giving a big humpback one to the guy.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   And so that mouth on that humpback whale, though,
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   goes almost all the way down to where its dorsal fin is.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   Now a couple years later, when I was with my buddy and we swam out,
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   we saw this humpback whale, and we did get close.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   Here's the pictures that, my fault, I didn't get these squared away earlier,
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   but this is me and my buddy out in the ocean.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   My wife was on the shore with a camera, and she was taking pictures.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   There we are, and we see a whale coming.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   You'll start to see it now in the second picture, move a little bit closer towards us.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   And you can see the ripples. That whale started to dive.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   So we dove, and this was the picture she had when there was nothing there.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   She told me, "Look, if you guys get swallowed, I'm going to get a massage
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   before I haul your little butts back to the States."
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   But anyway, when that thing came up and was gone,
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   I actually had a chance with this whale as it came by.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   I waited for that dorsal fin to go by me and just got close enough
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   where I saw the size of that mouth.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   The mouth itself, if that whale was 60 feet long, was 25 feet long.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   There's no question that thing could have swallowed me up.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   Now here's the question.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   If a whale swallowed a man whole, by the way, they found a whale not many years ago
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   that had swallowed a 450-pound giant squid whole.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   450 pounds.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   And it was later killed, that particular whale, and it was not yet digested.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   And they were just amazed at the ability of these animals that typically eat krill
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   and just run it through its system and process it that way,
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   had swallowed something like a giant squid.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   All that to say, I've seen a whale up close.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   Let me just tell you, it can swallow you.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   But here's the deal.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   Could you live, if you were in the belly of a whale, three days like Jonah was?
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   I'm going to make a case that Jonah didn't need to live for three days
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   in the belly of a whale.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   I'm going to make a case that it wouldn't surprise me at all if he died.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   And God raised him from the dead three days later when he was regurgitated by that whale.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   I don't really need to figure it out.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   I guess if God wanted him to be in that first little stomach,
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   and scientists will tell you that different amounts of food are moved in different directions,
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   that Jonah, for whatever reason, was not processed by that whale
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   and was three days in the deep, Jesus said, not just Jonah in the story.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   It's in the Old Testament, but Jesus said, I'm going to give you a sign.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   It's going to be the sign of Jonah,
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   that a man will be three days in the deep, in the dark,
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   and will raise again to proclaim to you amazing news.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   Now, here's something else that's kind of crazy,
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   is that the people that Jonah was told to go and share the story of repentance with,
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   that there was a God that does exist in the heavens,
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   that people are going to have to do business with,
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   he was called to go to the Ninevites.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   The Ninevites were the most awful people in the face of the earth.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   They were the enemies of the nation of Israel,
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   and Jonah knew that God was merciful,
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   and he wanted nothing to do with that message going to those Assyrians.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   Assyrians were notoriously evil.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   They were, in fact, the very first well-known terrorists.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   They didn't just seek to conquer lands.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   They sought to conquer lands by terror.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   They would run poles through their enemies,
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   up through their backside, through their gill, if you will,
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   their jaw, and they would use them to light their way.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   They would take the skins of their enemies,
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   and they would use them to provide further rain, if you will,
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   resistance to their tents.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   They would cut the heads off their enemies,
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   and they would stack them up like cannonballs in pyramids.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   And they wouldn't just defeat you.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   They would terrorize you.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   And they were hated by all nations, feared by all nations,
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   and Jonah, when he heard word that God wanted him to go and proclaim
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   the message of forgiveness and redemption and reconciliation to him,
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   Jonah said, "I'm not going there."
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   Whether he was scared to go there
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   or whether he just didn't want those enemies to experience grace,
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   it doesn't matter.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   He decided to go the opposite direction.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   Let's read the story of Jonah,
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   and I think you're going to find some application
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   that will encourage you tonight.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   Jonah 1 says, "The word of the Lord came to Jonah, saying,
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   'Arise, go to Nineveh, the great city, and cry against it,
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   for their wickedness has come up before me.'"
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   I just want to stop and make a couple of quick observations here
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   because in every little bit of Scripture,
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   there's something there for you because a lot of people kind of go,
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   "Well, man, I'm not like Jonah. This doesn't really apply to me."
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   I want to let you know this,
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   that there is a responsibility for anybody
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   that the word of the Lord has come to.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   Having received grace and mercy,
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   having received from God revelation,
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   you are necessarily given with that reception some responsibility.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   There's a great question that people often ask.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   "Hey, well, what about people that have never heard the story of Jesus Christ?
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   The Bible says there's no other name under heaven by which men must be saved.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   And so what about the un-evangelized heathen?
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   Has anybody ever hit you up with that one?
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   What about those that have never heard?
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   Is there any way that they can be saved?"
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   And sometimes people ask that question because they're trying to figure out,
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   "Hey, if there's a loophole for that guy, maybe there's a loophole for me."
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   And by the way, even if there's no loophole for that guy,
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   I think God's unjust if he's going to judge people who are condemned
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   because they've rejected a Jesus in whom they've never heard.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   There was a guy who was a great communicator who lived about 150, 160 years ago.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   His name was Spurgeon.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   And Spurgeon was asked the question, "What about the un-evangelized heathen?
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   Can they be saved?"
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   And Spurgeon's response, I thought, was brilliant.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   By the way, if you're not familiar with a little resource we create around here
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   called Real Truth Real Quick, we've answered that question.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   So in five minutes, you can just Google "un-evangelized heathen," "real truth real quick,"
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   or "Todd Wagner, un-evangelized heathen."
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   Those two things sometimes go together.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   And you'll get a little five-minute response on a biblical perspective on that answer.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   But let me give you this answer tonight,
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   because I thought it was brilliant what Spurgeon said when he was asked that question.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   Spurgeon said, "To me, it's a much greater question.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   Can those of us who have heard the gospel
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   and refuse to share it with those who have not heard it really be saved?"
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   Let me say that again.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   You know, sometimes when people ask you that question,
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   what they're really looking for is a loophole themselves, like,
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   "Hey, maybe if that guy gets off, I can get off."
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   And let me just tell you, the person who's asking you that question,
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   whatever is true of the un-evangelized heathen isn't true of them,
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   or they wouldn't be asking the question.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   But I'll just give you a little insight real quick.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   The Bible never says that there's anybody anywhere that would be judged
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   because they've rejected a Jesus who's never heard.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   The Bible also says that God is just.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   And the Bible does still say that that person who's never heard of Jesus is under judgment
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   because of their own conscience they violate,
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   and because of the truth they suppress and righteousness revealed by God in all of creation.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   But I will tell you this, if you really care about the un-evangelized heathen,
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   the greatest thing that you can do is respond to the message of grace yourself
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   and then start to do something about getting the message to them.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   Here's what Jonah chapter 1, verse 1 says.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   Jonah chapter 1, verse 1 says, "The word of the Lord came to Jonah."
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   As soon as the word of the Lord came to Jonah, he was a prophet.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   And when this happens, you have great responsibility.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   And it doesn't really matter whether or not you like the people that the message is supposed to go to.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   God calls you to love them.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   In fact, he calls you to suffer for them that they may know.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   And in fact, the more you suffer to take the message to them,
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   the more it's a sign for them about how much God loves them.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   This is what was said of Paul when he was talking to the people that were in a certain town at that day called Ephesus.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   And he just said to them, he said, "Hey man, listen.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   Don't you lose heart when you hear about my tribulations, for they are your glory."
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   In other words, when you see how much God wants me to suffer just so you can get the message of redemption,
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   don't you worry about that.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   In fact, it ought to be a constant reminder of how much God loves you.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   The Bible tells us when we look at how much God loves us,
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   that he would take his only begotten son, who is eternally dwelt in glory with the rest of the Godhead,
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   and he would not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, but he emptied himself.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   In other words, he didn't stop being God, but he stopped holding on to his ability to act in a way that his divine, eternal perfection demands and deserves.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   And he humbled himself, and he found himself in the appearance of a man, and being made in the image of a man,
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   he became obedient even to the point of death.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   Why? Because God is a just God.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   He in fact will judge sin, but he's a loving God, and so he wants to justify those who deserve judgment.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   God solves this problem by letting himself in the person of his son,
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   which is the visible image of the invisible God, go through unspeakable horrors for you.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   And when we see what Christ went through, it's two things.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   It makes you wonder what kind of love is this, and it makes you wonder how valuable are those people that God gave his son for.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   When you look at who the Ninevites were in history, and you see what God's going to do with his prophet,
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   now Jonah was not just any prophet. Jonah was already kicking it.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   He had already been faithful as a prophet to Israel.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   His name is mentioned in 2 Kings chapter 14 as the guy who had done his job,
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   and God took this effective, faithful prophet, and he said, "Hey, guess what?
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   I don't just love folks who speak Hebrew. I love those folks over there that are worshiping, guess what? Dagon.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   Who is Dagon? He is the fish God."
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   And so even in Jonah's rebellion, you're going to watch how God works Jonah's rebellion for good
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   as a way to either further confirm his message to the Assyrians.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   Now, God didn't want Jonah to rebel, but God's going to work all things for good to those who love God
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   and are called according to his purpose.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   Jonah just happened to go through a little bit more heartache because he didn't obey God outright.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   When the word of the Lord comes to you, you are a prophet.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   And I don't really want to hear anything about how you don't think you're gifted,
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   how you don't think that you're capable.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   If the word of the Lord comes to you, you are his prophet.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   And if you have profited from the word of God, you carry with that prophet a necessary obligation to help others.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   The reason that you are blessed is to be a blessing,
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   not so you can scoff at those who do not have what you have.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   And by the way, you know that if you're blessed, it means you've received something you don't deserve.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   And so the last thing you want to do is look at arrogance with others who didn't receive what you have received.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   The word grace in Greek is the word charis, C-H-A-R-I-S.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   It's where we get the English word charity,
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   which means you receive something that you don't earn or deserve.
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   And so when you look at other people who don't have what you have,
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   the last thing you should do is go, "Well, how come you don't have what I have
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   when you have what you have because it was a gift?"
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   All we are is individuals who as beggars have received bread that we didn't earn or deserve,
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   and what any beggar who has received something they don't deserve should do
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   is to tell other people who are hungry where they can receive it.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   I don't ever get discouraged when I come up against people who don't know the kindness of God
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   and the goodness of who He is because frankly, I'm not really sure how in my arrogance
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   and in my self-sufficiency and in my general prosperity and blessed way
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   have come to a point in my life where I really understood my need for God.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   Other than this, the kindness of God let me see that there's lots of ways that seem right to me,
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   but they're always going to end in the way of death.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   I love the story of a guy that was a Supreme Court Justice in England,
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   and he was a very righteous man, a very philanthropic man.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   He was kind and gracious to many. He was just as a judge,
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   and he was a leader and a ruler in his church. He was an elder, if you will.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   He was one time at the communion rail, and next to him, a guy that he had prosecuted
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   and that he had actually adjudicated over and had sent to prison took communion next to him.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   Now, this particular distinguished judge was good friends with the rector
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   of that particular Episcopal church or Anglican church,
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   and they were walking home after that particular Sunday,
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   and the rector said to this distinguished judge,
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   "Hey, did you see who took communion next to you today?"
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   And the judge said, "Yes, I did."
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   And the rector said, "What an amazing picture of grace."
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   And the judge said, "I absolutely agree, but let me ask you a question.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   Of whom do you speak?"
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   And the rector said, "Well, I'm talking about the guy that was in jail, of course."
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   And he goes, "No, you shouldn't be saying it was an amazing work of grace that that guy came to Christ.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   The amazing work of grace is that I came to Christ.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   I was born into a loving home. I was raised and educated.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   I've been prosperous in my industry my entire day.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   I'm a respected citizen of this community,
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   and that God would allow me to see my desperation and need before him,
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   that's a work of grace.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   That man has been discouraged from his birth, abandoned by his father,
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   atheistic on society, in prison for his wrong,
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   suffered greatly for his rebellion.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   That man has every reason to see his need for salvation.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   The work of grace is in one as righteous and as acceptable in society's eyes as me,
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   that I know that I desperately need a Savior."
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   Look, some of you guys are out there, and you think you don't have some spectacular testimony,
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   that there's not been some journey through the great abyss.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   You haven't had three abortions, and you haven't come through 16 different bits of gender dysphoria
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   and clicked on every possible gender description on Facebook before you found Jesus.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   So you don't have a real testimony.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   Let me tell you something, man. You've got a testimony.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   If you've lived in this life and have largely lived a moral and good life,
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   maybe you've been raised in a godly home,
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   and you've come to see that the reason you're rightly related to God
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   is not because your parents took you to church,
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   or early on you were described about the goodness of God,
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   but that you in your life personally responded to that at some point.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   And you saw how great a need you had for a Savior.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   There is no one under heaven who doesn't need to repent.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   And when you look at others that maybe struggle in ways that are different than you,
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   and you look on them with arrogance,
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   you don't understand how great the salvation is that has saved you.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   Jonah's problem, you'll see, is that he thought that he was a prophet,
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   so God was lucky to have him.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   And what you're going to see is this prophet needed to be saved
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   as much as those that he was called to go preach to.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   Jonah was given the word of the Lord,
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   and if you've been given the word of the Lord, you are a prophet.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   He is told to arise, go to Nineveh, the great city, and cry against it,
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   for the wickedness has come up before me.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   Just know this, that there is no sin under heaven which God does not see.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   And sometimes we look at what's going on out there in the world,
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   and we see all this evil, and we wonder when God's going to act against it.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   Mark my word, it'll come soon enough.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   You need to know that God's always cared about sin everywhere.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   And it says in the Bible, in Ezekiel 33, Ezekiel 18, and other places,
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   that God takes no delight in the death of the wicked.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   Let me say that again.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   God takes no delight in the death of the wicked.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   And so neither should we.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   But God has appointed a time when he will judge all the world,
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   but that time, sometimes he delays.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   The Scripture says the reason he's delayed it, at least until June 14, 2016,
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   is not because he's slow, as some count slowness,
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   but God is patient towards you, wishing that none should perish,
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   but that all should come to repentance.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   For God doesn't take delight in your wicked death.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   And so I don't know how long God's going to tarry.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   I want to make this point right here.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   Listen, this is true, Ninevites,
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   that God always offers forgiveness to your repentance,
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   and you need to know that.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   But you also need to know that God does not promise tomorrow to your procrastination.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   Today is the day, the Scripture says,
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   that you should respond to the grace of God that's made known to you.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   Because surely in a flood of great waters you may not be found.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   And so none of us know when time's going to be rolled up like a scroll,
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   or when our day's going to come quickly upon us,
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   but it's going to come, and God knew when it was going to come for the Ninevites.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   It was 612 BC.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   Jonah appears somewhere in the 8th century BC,
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   about 150 years before Nineveh was judged, he sent them Jonah.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   Now what you're going to find out in this story is that Ninevites responded to Jonah's preaching.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   But what also happened is a couple of generations later,
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   they reverted back to the worship of their pagan gods.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   And so God sent them another prophet.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   Did you know that God sent two prophets, not just one to Nineveh?
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   The second one is called Nahum.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   The word means comfort.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   Jonah means peace.
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   God sent a dove, it means dove actually,
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   and dove is one that came in peace,
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   and he came to them and said, "Listen, I don't want to be at enmity between you and you wicked Assyrians,
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   but you've got to know this, that I'm a god that isn't just a god willing to make peace with you.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   I'm a god that if you don't make peace with me, you're going to have to do business with me.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   And you might think of me letting you run in your riotous reign over me
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   while you're in your 20s or in your excessive celebration of youth,
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   that judgment will never come, but mark my word, judgment is coming."
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   And so God kept sending people who had heard the word of the Lord to them.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   And their wickedness was not in any way missed by God.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   This is what it says in Jeremiah chapter 23, verse 24.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   It says, "Can a man hide himself in hiding places so that I do not see him?" declares the Lord.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   Do I not fill the heavens and the earth?
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   Psalm 139 says this, "Where can I go from your spirit?
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   Or where can I flee from your presence?
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   If I ascend to heaven, you are there.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   If I make my bed in Sheol, behold, you are there.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   If I take the wings of the dawn, if I dwell in the remotest part of the sea,
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   even there your hand will lead me and your right hand will lay hold of me.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   If I say, 'Surely the darkness will overwhelm me and the light around me will be night,'
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   even the darkness is not dark to you and the night is as bright as the day.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   Darkness and light are alike to you.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   There is no way I can go from the presence of God."
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   You're going to find out that that's not just true of Assyrians who haven't repented yet.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   That's true of believers who are not responding yet.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   So God was well aware of the Assyrians' wickedness.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   And he was about to send a prophet to them.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   It says, "But Jonah," in verse 3, "rose up to flee to Tarshish from the presence of the Lord."
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   So he went down to Joppa. Joppa is a port city.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   And it says he found a ship which was going to Tarshish, which is in Gibraltar,
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   which is in the southern part of Spain, which is about 2,500 miles the wrong direction from Nineveh.
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   Here's a map of it.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   So Joppa, it's a modern-day town.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   Today you can go to Joppa. I've been there at the port of Joppa.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   And you look across the Mediterranean Sea, and you've got to sail across the Aegean Sea
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   and make your way all the way underneath Italy,
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   and further make your way all the way over to where the Rock of Gibraltar is there in southern Spain.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   It was the farthest known part of the sea that anybody sailed to.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   And so Jonah said, "Let me get the fat out of anything that God has me doing."
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   Because what God has me doing didn't make any sense to Jonah.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   Watch what happens when Jonah, the prophet, decides to not walk in the light that he has been given.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   It says, "The Lord hurled a great wind on the sea, and there was a great storm on the sea,
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   so the ship was about to break up.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   The sailors became afraid, and every man cried to his God,
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   and they threw the cargo which was in the ship into the sea to lighten it for them.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   But Jonah had gone below into the hold of the ship, laying down and falling asleep."
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   One of the things you're going to see if you study this is just the way the writer talks about
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   how Jonah keeps going down. He went down to Joppa.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   He wanted to go down to Tarsus.
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   There's trouble, so he goes down to the bottom of the bowels of the ship.
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   He tried to go asleep. He tried to numb himself from the horrors that were around him
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   as he knew he was trying to run away from the will of God, but you can't do that.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   The captain approached him and said, "How is it you're sleeping? Get up. Call on your God."
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   In other words, we don't know who you believe in, but we're all calling on every God that we know.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   Perhaps your God will be concerned about us so that we will not perish because our gods aren't listening.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   "Each man said to his mate, 'Come, let us cast lots, so we may learn on whose account this calamity has struck us.'"
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   So they cast lots, and the lot fell on Jonah.
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   And they said, "Tell us now, on whose account has this calamity struck?
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   What is your occupation? Where do you come from? What is your country?
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   From what people are you?"
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   And he said to them, "I'm a Hebrew, and I fear the Lord God of heaven, who made the sea and the dry land."
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   Well, if only that was true.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   "The men became extremely frightened. They said to him, 'How could you do this?'"
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   Because Jonah apparently had gone on to explain to them that, "I know what's going on.
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   God's told me to go right, and I'm going left."
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   It says, "The men became extremely frightened. They said, 'How could you do this?'
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   For they knew that he was fleeing from the presence of the Lord, because he had told them so."
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   Can I just make a real simple observation here? Because, man, you guys need to know this.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   Whenever you run into somebody that is fleeing from the presence of the Lord, it's going to be trouble.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   This is why, and I want to say this as kindly as I can to you, this is why, you know, God says,
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   "Look, man, if you want to marry, you have not sinned. It's fine. Go ahead and get married.
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   But I'm going to beg of you, if you get married, don't yoke yourself.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   Don't enter into business with somebody whose business is fleeing from the presence of the Lord.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   Don't date somebody."
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   This is the big thing about sex and relationships.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   The problem with sex and relationships is that when you're having premarital sex,
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   it's not just the problems that premarital sex can create in your relationship.
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   And it can create some, because you're using a gift that God gave you in a way that he didn't decide or declare it should be given to you.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   God doesn't have any problem with sex. He designed sex. God's a huge fan of sex.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   But he's just saying, "Look, man, this gift I've given you, use that gift the way that it's intended to be used."
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   The most classic illustration of a gift.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   I mean, there's no greater gift that God has given man than fire.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   It brings light. It brings heat. It brings warmth.
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   I love fire. I have three fireplaces in my house in Dallas where the average temperature is almost 60 degrees.
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   Every chance I get, I build a fire in my home.
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   But here's the deal, man.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   This thing, whenever you build a fire, our family gathers around it.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   It brings light. It brings warmth. I love the smell. It attracts people.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   But if we took fire out of the place it is designed to be in our home, and we just moved it to the couch,
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   because we love fire, so we're going to take it everywhere, and we just put it in a cabinet?
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   Or go, "Hey, let's just put fire over here on the wall."
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   It's a great thing, but when you take that gift and you put it in the wrong spot,
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   it no longer is something that brings joy and warmth to the home.
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   It destroys the home.
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   Sex is just like that.
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   And here's the thing. There's consequences when we take a gift and we misuse it.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   God's not angry at you. You're not being punished for the way you misused the gift.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   That's why you get an STD, or that's why you get an unwanted pregnancy.
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   I mean, that's just what happens.
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   It's like sin is its own judgment. It's not God smiting you.
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   It's just what happens when you use gifts wrong.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   It's like if I gave you a chainsaw, and you go, "Hey, look, a chainsaw Todd gave me to cut firewood
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   and to take down trees that are going to fall on my roof," and you go, "You know what?
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   Let's use it as dental floss. It'll do a fine job."
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   Okay, that chainsaw is dental floss for you, but it's not going to also probably do well for the rest of your face.
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   It'll get that little annoying piece of popcorn out between your teeth.
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   Isn't it crazy that when you finally get that piece of popcorn out between your teeth,
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   what's the first thing you do? You chew it, right?
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   Don't we? We're like, "God dang it!"
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   "Mm, got it."
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   Isn't that like us in sin?
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   "This is really bothering me. This is really bothering me. Okay, good. The pain's gone.
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   Let me go back to that sin."
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   It's crazy. Spit it out.
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   So look, when you use a gift and you misuse the gift,
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   it's not like I'm judging you because you misused the gift.
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.000]   The misusing of the gift is the judgment.
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   I'm not mad at you. I don't have to be mad at you.
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   Just misusing the chainsaw is its own judgment.
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   There might be a moment where it pops out and it feels good, but boy, it's not going to last long.
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   And all I want to tell you is this. This is why God tells you,
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   "Hey, listen, I'm begging you to not sail with people who are running from the presence of the Lord."
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   You yoke yourself to that.
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   There might be a time because people and relationships are a gift for me
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   that that relationship initially will be a glory to you.
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   That chainsaw will work to get that little annoyance,
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   but it's going to keep moving through and it's going to hit the nerve
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   and it's going to cause all kinds of pain and create scars and death.
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   And so God just says, "Look, man, you're free to marry, but I'm just begging you, don't marry.
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   Don't yoke with somebody who flees from the presence of the Lord."
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   This is the biggest problem with premarital sex. Are you ready?
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   It's an indication that no matter what somebody tells you
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   about how serious they are about wanting what God wants,
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   what they really want is what they want, and they don't really care what God wants.
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   They're going to rationalize and justify whatever they want to
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   because it gives them pleasure.
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:27.000]   And when you yoke yourself to somebody that drags you into a relationship,
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   and no matter what they say about God, I don't care if you met them at the porch,
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   I don't care if they're a community group leader,
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   if they drag you into using a provision of God
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   and sail in their relational practices with you away from the presence of the Lord,
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   and you yoke yourself to them, what you are doing is you're saying right now,
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   "I want to sail with somebody who's already declared."
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   It doesn't matter what God says. They're going to rationalize and justify their own program.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   And I'm just going to tell you, that's going to be your problem,
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   not the fact that you had premarital sex,
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   but that you're yoking yourself to somebody who sails through this life
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   in a way that has no respect
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   for the navigational charts that God who loves you has given you.
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   It is a tell. It's an indication that they are their own sovereign.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   And that makes for really rocky seas.
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   So what you're going to find out is that God's not mad at you
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   when trouble comes in your life.
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   He's mad at you when you experience a little bit of the problems
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   that come when you move away from him.
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   And that's what a loving God does.
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   I'll show you that in just a moment with Jonah.
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   They said to him, "What would we do that the sea may become calm for us?
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   For the sea was becoming increasingly stormy."
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   He said to them, "Pick me up and throw me into the sea."
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:51.000]   Jonah's telling you, "This is what you have to do.
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   Then the sea will become calm for you.
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   For I know that on account of me, this great storm has come upon you."
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:00.000]   This is where Jonah, who is a type of Christ, he's a picture
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   of who Christ is going to be, is a picture but not the complete picture.
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   Watch this. Here's what he says.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   "What you've got to do is pick me up and throw me into the sea.
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   The only way that this judgment is going to leave you
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   is if I become a sacrifice for you."
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   This next line, "I know on account of me, this great storm has come upon you"
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:23.000]   is not what's true of Christ.
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   Christ says, "It's on account of you that this great storm is going to come upon me.
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   All of you, like sheep, have gone astray.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   The Lord will cause the iniquity of you to fall on me."
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   Jesus says, "I'm going to go a place you cannot go
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   to stand before the judgment of God.
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   I'm going to give my life, but because I'm without sin,
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   once I give my life for sin and the debt's been paid,
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   God can in his just pour out his wrath and in his justice
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   declare that the debt has been paid so that I, myself,
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   can be the first fruits of those raised from the dead
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   and all who believe in me and follow the words of this great prophet can be saved."
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   But watch what men do.
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   Sometimes the way of God doesn't make sense.
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   It never makes sense to pagans who don't believe in prophets.
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   The pagans here go, "That doesn't sound like what God would want me to do."
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   And so what do they do?
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   It says, "The men rode desperately to return to land."
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   See, this is what men do.
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   Men don't believe that the prophet has to be given for them.
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   Men believe that their own efforts can get them back to a place of safety.
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   And so they worked with all their might to make their way back to peace and safety.
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   Just like most men and women today, when you ask them,
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   "Hey, are you at a place in your life where you think the seas of wrath
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   between you and God can be brought to a place where they're calm?"
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   You go, "Yeah, well, how? Well, I think I just got to behave as I sail through life.
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   And if I behave more than I disbehave, the seas will eventually be calm
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   and I'll make my way into the presence of God."
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:49.000]   And God says, "No, man, you got to do something.
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   And that is to believe that the prophet has been thrown into the sea of judgment for you.
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   And that's the only way that you can be reconciled to me."
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   Men always try and row their way to God.
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   They always try and work their way.
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   But watch what happens when men try and earn their salvation.
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   It says the storm is becoming even worse against them.
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:13.000]   They could not make it for the sea was becoming even stormier.
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   And then they called on the Lord finally and said, "We earnestly pray, O Lord,
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   don't let us perish on account of this man's life.
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   Do not put innocent blood on us, for you, O Lord, have done as you have pleased."
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   So they picked up Jonah. Finally, they listened to the word of the Lord.
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   Because why? Because the pain got so great that they finally realized
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:40.000]   that the efforts of their own way to navigate through the sea of life were futile.
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:47.000]   You're going to see this theme show up in pagans and in disobedient prophets.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   And there's a little truth that I want you both to understand.
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   And I'm going to say it to you in a couple of different ways.
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   And then number one, I'm just going to tell you,
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   when you are doing things that God doesn't want you to do,
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   and consequence comes to you,
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   it's not because God's trying to pay you back for the wrong that you have done.
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   It's God is trying to bring you back to what you should do.
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:07.000]   Let me say that again.
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:12.000]   Is when you experiencing wrong is the wages of the wrong that you have done.
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   It's not God's punishment.
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   It's God's allowing you to experience the consequences of your choices
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:22.000]   so that you can learn to hate those choices.
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   Not because God's trying to pay you back for your choices,
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   but because he's trying to bring you back to him.
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:34.000]   And what you're going to see is that the pagans who didn't know who Jonah was
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   and what the prophet said, tried to work until that work failed them.
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   And there's a way that seemed right to them, but it was leading to death.
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   And so they finally stopped the way that seemed right to me.
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.000]   And they repented and listened to the prophet.
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   You're going to find that the prophet tried to go where he wanted to go
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   and do what he wanted to do until it got him further and further and further in trouble.
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:56.000]   And finally, he says, I think I'll start to do what God wants me to do.
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:01.000]   Can I just tell you something? God's not angry at you.
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   God is not trying to catch you in your sin.
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   He is looking to free you from the sin,
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:19.000]   which has captured you.
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:26.000]   And one of the grandest things that God can do for you is to let you reap what you sow.
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   And so the God of life and light and joy,
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:35.000]   when you leave him, lets you experience darkness and despair and death.
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:39.000]   Not as a judgment, because sin is its own judgment.
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:41.000]   Are you here? And are you at a place in your life where you're like,
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:45.000]   you know what, this way which seems right to me is not bringing me what I want.
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:48.000]   I mean, I might have momentary fits of pleasure.
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:52.000]   I might have that little kernel pop out of my mouth for a second,
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.000]   but there's a long scar there afterwards.
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:59.000]   There's a bitter aftertaste of me using the gifts God's given me in a way that he doesn't intend.
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:01.000]   I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired.
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:03.000]   And God goes, okay, well, come here, man. Let me heal you.
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:06.000]   Let me put you on a different course. I'm not mad at you.
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:10.000]   But I'm also not going to protect you from the consequences.
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:13.000]   Because that's what a loving father does.
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:16.000]   He doesn't enable you.
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:21.000]   And he doesn't move towards you in anger.
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:23.000]   Now, God hates sin. Why does God hate sin?
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   He hates sin because he loves you.
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   And so what'd God do as a result of your sin?
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:32.000]   He did something about it. He let himself be cast into the sea of judgment.
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:35.000]   And just like Jonah, Jesus would say to you,
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:37.000]   hey, look, man, here's the only way you're going to be saved.
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   Not by your rowing and trying to be righteous before God,
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.000]   but you got to let me be thrown in, man.
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:44.000]   You got to let me be thrown before the judgment of God.
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:48.000]   That's the only way that this sea is going to get calm.
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:51.000]   And you go, that doesn't seem right to me,
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:53.000]   that this guy would die, that I might live.
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:55.000]   But it's really not about you,
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:57.000]   because you're not an infinite, holy, perfect God.
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:00.000]   So you don't know what kind of infinite, holy, perfect sacrifice he demands.
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:06.000]   And so you can row all you want to try and make yourself righteous.
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:08.000]   I'm just going to tell you, the sea's only going to get more violent.
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:11.000]   You're never going to rest.
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:14.000]   You're never going to know if you're righteous enough.
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:16.000]   And if you would just listen, the answer would be,
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:18.000]   you'll never be righteous enough to meet the standard of God.
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:22.000]   If a man, it says, commits one sin, he is guilty of the law.
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:24.000]   He is a lawbreaker.
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:28.000]   The standard of Scripture is, be perfect as I'm perfect.
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:30.000]   If you're righteous, it doesn't surpass that of the Pharisees.
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   You won't enter into the kingdom of heaven.
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:35.000]   That's all of us. All of us have sinned and gone astray.
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:37.000]   And all of us need a savior.
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:40.000]   And you better find out who your prophet is to throw into the sea of judgment.
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:42.000]   Jesus says, "I'm the God."
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:48.000]   And they called on the name of the Lord in verse 14.
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:51.000]   They said, "We earnestly pray, O Lord, don't let us perish on account of this man's life.
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   And don't let us put innocent blood in us, for you, O Lord, have done as you've pleased."
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:57.000]   So they picked up Jonah, they threw him into the sea, and the sea stopped. It's raging.
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:01.000]   The men feared the Lord greatly.
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:03.000]   They offered a sacrifice to the Lord, and they made vows.
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:05.000]   It's always better to make vows after salvation,
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:07.000]   and not say, "Lord, I'll do this so you'll save me."
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:11.000]   Righteous men don't say, "God, I'll do this so you'll save me."
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:14.000]   Righteous men see what God has done to save them, and they respond to it.
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:19.000]   In other words, we as believers, we don't do what we do so God will love us.
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:22.000]   I don't say, "God, I'm going to serve you. I'm going to be faithful to share with the Syrians.
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:25.000]   I'm going to live my life. I'm going to stop premarital nonsense.
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:28.000]   When I'm married, I'm going to be faithful. I'm going to not look at that crap again.
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:31.000]   I'm not going to give myself over to numbing myself with drugs or other pleasures.
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:33.000]   And then, God, I'll be holy." No.
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:36.000]   Men see that God makes them holy, and they respond.
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:38.000]   We are not people who have performance-based acceptance.
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:40.000]   We are people who understand what God has done for us.
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:44.000]   We see it. We see the peace that we have with God
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:49.000]   through the sacrifice of His holy prophet, and we go, "I want to respond to that."
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:51.000]   Do you see that?
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:55.000]   There's nothing in me that will make me ever go, "God, you owe me salvation.
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:58.000]   It was a gift from the beginning. I don't know why
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:03.000]   He allowed His prophet to go into the sea of judgment for me,
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:07.000]   but having seen it, I just go, 'Man, why wouldn't I want to serve that God?'"
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:09.000]   Shane did a great job earlier tonight here in Dallas.
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:14.000]   If you were here singing and talking about the one who did not spare His own Son
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:17.000]   but delivered Him up for us all, won't He then do every good thing for us,
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:19.000]   it says in Romans 8?
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:22.000]   "Why wouldn't I serve that God?"
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:25.000]   And so these men saw when God had made provision for them
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:30.000]   through the sacrifice of another, they go, "Let's serve the God of that prophet."
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:34.000]   It is acceptance-based performance.
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:37.000]   It is love which constrains us.
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:44.000]   It's always good to make vows when you see love, not to make vows to earn love.
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:48.000]   "The Lord appointed a great fish to swallow Jonah,
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:51.000]   and Jonah was in the stomach of the fish three days and three nights."
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:53.000]   He kind of keeps getting worse for Jonah.
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:57.000]   He keeps going down, down, down, down, but finally, in his pain,
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:59.000]   and maybe some of you guys are here tonight,
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:02.000]   but he keeps going down low enough that you're sick and tired of being sick and tired.
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:06.000]   It says, "Jonah prayed to the Lord his God from the stomach of the fish."
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:13.000]   God loves you enough to bring you to distress with your disobedience.
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:16.000]   God isn't looking to catch you in your sin.
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:20.000]   He is looking to free you from the sin that has captured you.
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:23.000]   God's not looking to pay you back.
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:27.000]   God's looking to bring you back, and as soon as you cry out
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:30.000]   in your distress to the Lord, he will answer.
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:36.000]   It says, "I cried for help from the depths of Sheol, and you heard my voice."
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:42.000]   Jonah went on from there, the story says, to do what he should do,
[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:45.000]   because he understood, and if you read a little bit further,
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:50.000]   in chapter 3, verse 1, it says, "Now the word of the Lord came to Jonah the second time."
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:55.000]   And this time, Jonah got busy doing what he should do,
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:58.000]   and I just want to make a couple of quick observations now when we're done.
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:02.000]   There's really four people in life.
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:06.000]   There's folks that are lost, and they acknowledge that they're lost,
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:09.000]   and they know that there's no way they can row themselves to safety,
[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:14.000]   and to you, God says, "That's great. Take this provision that I've given for you."
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:18.000]   Some of you guys are here. You've never come to a place yet
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:21.000]   where you know you're forgiven, but you know you're lost,
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:25.000]   and I'm here to tell you that God has thrown the prophet into the sea of judgment for you.
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:29.000]   And God has made the way of mercy.
[00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:32.000]   Wherever you are that you're listening, if you're sick and tired of being sick and tired,
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:34.000]   and you know that you're separated from God,
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:38.000]   then I'm here to tell you that God wants you to be reconciled to Him.
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:40.000]   He wants to offer you this gift.
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:46.000]   "Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door,
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:50.000]   I will come in to him and dine with him, and he with me."
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:54.000]   And God's just here tonight to tell you, "Man, just let me in."
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:59.000]   If you're lost and you know it, then let the way and the truth and the life come into you and receive it.
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:02.000]   And then there are those that are lost and they don't know it.
[00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:08.000]   And to you, I want to tell you that while you're still rowing,
[00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:11.000]   maybe while your seas aren't rough enough, all I would say to you is,
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:13.000]   "Look, we're not going to love you more if you agree with us,
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:15.000]   and I'm just going to tell you that if you like what you got,
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:18.000]   I encourage you to keep doing what you're doing, but I'm going to remind you,
[00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:21.000]   if you keep doing what you're doing, you're not going to like what you got."
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:26.000]   Because it's just a matter of time before you get low enough
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:32.000]   that the pain's going to be intense enough that you're going to wonder
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:33.000]   how in the world you got here.
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:35.000]   You know, one of the things I do when everyone with my kids and we're out
[00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:40.000]   and we come up across somebody that's living on the streets and we're asked to help them,
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:42.000]   I always, "Man, tell me your name."
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:44.000]   "My name's Todd. I introduced myself."
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:45.000]   "Just go tell me your story."
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:48.000]   "You want to hear my story?"
[00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:49.000]   I go, "Yeah, man."
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:50.000]   I have my kids right there with me.
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:52.000]   I say, "Just tell us your story. How'd you end up here?"
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:54.000]   And they always say the same thing.
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:56.000]   They always go, "I'll tell you how I got here, man.
[00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:01.000]   One bad decision at a time, and then another bad decision after that."
[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:07.000]   And I always ask them if they want to turn around those decisions,
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:10.000]   or if they just want me to give them something that would give them strength
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:19.000]   given their rebellion and their self-will and their despair and their wondering further.
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:21.000]   And I go, "I'm not going to enable you in that, man."
[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:24.000]   The Bible's really clear in 2 Thessalonians 3.
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:27.000]   It says, "If a man doesn't work, let his stomach work for him.
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:29.000]   Let the pain of his circumstance go."
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:33.000]   Hey, being lazy, being a slugger, being irresponsible, being addicted,
[00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:36.000]   not taking opportunity to deal with my addiction and to find training
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:39.000]   and to maybe be reparented and to start to work my way out.
[00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:41.000]   Man, let your stomach work for him.
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:45.000]   Sometimes God is not trying to pay you back, but he's trying to draw you back.
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:47.000]   And what you don't want to do is keep enabling people.
[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:51.000]   You also don't want to look at those people and think, "Man, what a scourge of the earth.
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:55.000]   I look at them, and I just go, 'Hey, I really understand.
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:57.000]   I was with one of those guys today.'
[00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:59.000]   And I just told them, 'Man, you're going to have to trust me.
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:01.000]   I don't think I'm better than you.'
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:04.000]   But by the grace of God, I've encountered truth maybe earlier in my life
[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:07.000]   than you're encountering it, and I've started to make decisions to walk with this God.
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:09.000]   And that God wants to start to walk with you.
[00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:11.000]   And if you'll let me, I'll begin to walk with you.
[00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:14.000]   We'll get shelter. We'll get training. We'll get food. We'll get provision.
[00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:21.000]   And I'll let you know the God that keeps me from bringing despair to my heart on the streets."
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:24.000]   This particular friend wasn't ready yet.
[00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:27.000]   So we had a great conversation, and I said, "Bro, if you like what you got,
[00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:28.000]   keep doing what you're doing.
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:36.000]   But if you keep doing what you're doing, you're not going to like what you got."
[00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:41.000]   Thirdly, there's people who are saved, and they don't act like it.
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:43.000]   There's folks that are lost, and they know it.
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:44.000]   To you, I say, "Come."
[00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:47.000]   There's folks that are lost, and they don't think they're lost,
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:49.000]   and they like the way they're sailing, but say, "You keep sailing."
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:52.000]   And when the seas get rough enough, I hope you remember tonight's message.
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:55.000]   There's somebody who's been thrown in the sea for you to make it calm.
[00:56:55.000 --> 00:57:01.000]   But then there's some people that have been saved, and they don't sail like it.
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:05.000]   And to you, I wanted to tell you, man, when you are given the Word of God,
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:10.000]   and you don't deal to it kindly, you better check to see if you even know about the love of God.
[00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:13.000]   Because people that really know the love of God, when they see it, they make a vow.
[00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:15.000]   And they go, "I'm going to respond to that love.
[00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:23.000]   I'm not going to try and earn it, but I see that love, and that love compels me."
[00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:25.000]   And I want to just remind you of that earlier story.
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:27.000]   What about those people who have never heard?
[00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:29.000]   Well, I'm not so concerned about that person who's never heard.
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:31.000]   A better question is, what about those who have heard
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:35.000]   and don't care to share that, what we have heard, with others?
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:39.000]   Can we really have heard?
[00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:41.000]   And then there's the fourth group.
[00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:48.000]   It's those who have really heard the Word of the Lord, and they're serving.
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:51.000]   And they're out there, and they're faithful.
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:53.000]   And they don't look at others like they're Ninevites,
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:55.000]   and man, may the grace of God not come to them.
[00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:56.000]   No, they really love them.
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:58.000]   I want to tell you a story of a guy I was just with.
[00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:02.000]   I just got back from Turkey and Eurasia and that general region,
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:08.000]   and I was talking to a friend of mine that is a former imam in Jordan.
[00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:13.000]   He was a particular guy that was rowing and rowing and rowing and rowing as an imam.
[00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:15.000]   He said, "I was ready to die for Allah.
[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:19.000]   I was planning to give my life on a suicide mission for Allah
[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:22.000]   because I knew that was the only way that I could earn Allah's love
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:25.000]   in this system invented by men."
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:32.000]   And the systems of men are always, "Row your way to peace with Allah."
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:35.000]   And he said, "And I saw the futility of this,
[00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:38.000]   and eventually before I killed myself, I died to the idea."
[00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:41.000]   And he said, "I became an atheist, and as soon as I left Islam,
[00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:43.000]   becoming an imam, I didn't trust anything else,
[00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:49.000]   but because I no longer served Allah, men started to want to kill me."
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:55.000]   I had another friend who had come to understand that a prophet had been given for them.
[00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:58.000]   That there was a God that didn't want you to earn His love,
[00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:01.000]   but there was a God that loved you.
[00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:04.000]   Do you know in Islam, there's 99 names for Allah.
[00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:07.000]   They're called the 99 beautiful names for the Lord.
[00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:10.000]   That's what Allah means in Arabic.
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:14.000]   And not a single one of those 99 names that represent Allah
[00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:18.000]   have the idea of love in them.
[00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:24.000]   And this friend told him about a God who said, "He is love."
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:28.000]   And he demonstrated his love in that while we're still rowing,
[00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:30.000]   most of us in a disobedient direction,
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:34.000]   He died for us, and He made provision for us.
[00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:37.000]   Because He's just, and in no means will He let the guilty go unpunished,
[00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:40.000]   but He Himself has given His life for them,
[00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:44.000]   that He might be just and the justifier of those that He loves.
[00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:46.000]   And he heard the story, and he wept.
[00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:48.000]   And he left his atheism and he became a believer.
[00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:52.000]   And then he came across one of his former Islamic friends,
[00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:57.000]   who walked up behind him with a screwdriver and drove it through his back.
[00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:00.000]   He felt the pain and he turned around, the man removed the screwdriver,
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:04.000]   and shoved it in the front of his chest.
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:07.000]   And pulled it out to stab him a third time,
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000]   and he grabbed his hands and he took his by the head,
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:12.000]   and they were smashing, he was smashing his head
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000]   and the guy's weakness into the wall,
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:17.000]   and he just held on him screaming till somebody came and broke them up.
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:20.000]   Now in Jordan what they do when they see two men fighting,
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000]   is they arrest them both.
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000]   And so these two men were arrested.
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:27.000]   They stopped his hemorrhaging and bleeding, it missed all vital organs.
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:30.000]   He had a penetration through the back to the front,
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000]   and from the front toward the back,
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:35.000]   and they put them in the same jail cell that evening.
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:38.000]   And while he was in that same jail cell,
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:41.000]   he looked at that man, they were both cuffed so they couldn't hurt each other,
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:45.000]   and he said, "I want you to know I don't hate you.
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000]   "And I want you to know that if I live through this,
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:52.000]   "that my family's not going to try and strike revenge against you."
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000]   The next day they were separated,
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000]   they were asked to tell their story four different times.
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000]   The man who was stabbed told the same story four times.
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000]   The man who did the stabbing told four different stories,
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:03.000]   so they knew who was lying.
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:06.000]   And they were going to put this gentleman who had run the screwdriver
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000]   through him front and back in prison,
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000]   and he stood up, my friend, the former Irman,
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000]   who was now a follower of the prophet,
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000]   who was thrown into the sea for others,
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000]   and he said, "Judge, if you will, I want to speak to the man who did this to me.
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:20.000]   "I want to say again to the court, I forgive you, and I forgive him.
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:24.000]   "And I love you, and I know you're doing what you think you should do
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000]   "in order to please the God that you know,
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000]   "but the God that you know is no God at all.
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000]   "The God you need to know is the God who gave his life for you,
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000]   "and he gave his life for me,
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000]   "and if he was willing to save one such as me,
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:39.000]   "he's willing for me to forgive one such as you."
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.000]   And that man looked at him and said,
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000]   "Now I know that your God is the one true God
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000]   "because I've never seen love like that."
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:52.000]   That's what people who have come to know the kindness of God do.
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:55.000]   If you have received the word of the Lord, having received it,
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000]   there is an obligation to share it.
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000]   I love this little poem. It always encourages me.
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.000]   It goes like this. It's called "My Friend."
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000]   It says, "My friend, I stand in judgment now
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000]   "and feel that you're to blame somehow.
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000]   "On earth I walked with you day by day.
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000]   "Never did you point me the way.
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000]   "You knew the Lord in truth and glory,
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000]   "but never did you tell me the story.
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000]   "My knowledge then was very dim.
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000]   "You could have led me straight to him.
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000]   "Though we lived together on earth,
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000]   "you never told me of the second birth,
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:21.000]   "and now I stand to stay condemned
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:24.000]   "because you failed to mention him.
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000]   "You taught me many things, that's true.
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:27.000]   "I called you friend and trusted you,
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000]   "but I learn now that it's too late.
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000]   "You could have saved me from this fate.
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000]   "We walked by day, we talked by night,
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000]   "and yet you showed me not the light.
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:36.000]   "You let me live and love and die.
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000]   "You knew I'd never live on high.
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:41.000]   "Yes, I called you friend in life
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000]   "and laughed with you through joy and stripe,
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.000]   "and yet on coming to the end,
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:51.000]   "I cannot call you now my friend,
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000]   "because you didn't want to go through the awkwardness
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:56.000]   "of telling me that you believe that God threw a prophet
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:57.000]   "in the sea of judgment for you
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:04.000]   "because you thought it would make me think you were crazy."
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:05.000]   See, man, this is what prophets do.
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000]   People who are really saved and act like they're saved
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:08.000]   are a blessing to others.
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:14.000]   They realize that they were blessed to be a blessing.
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.000]   Can I just close this by telling you
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:18.000]   that there's another one who was a prophet
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000]   who was from Kephir Nahum.
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.000]   Capernaum is the town.
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000]   It means the village of comfort.
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000]   Just like there was a prophet, Nahum,
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:28.000]   that was sent to the Assyrians who worshiped the fish god
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000]   that God had once swallowed up by a great fish
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:34.000]   that was spit out probably with some sort of lactic acid
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000]   all over him so he was bleached white,
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000]   and so here comes this guy spit up on the fish,
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:44.000]   looked like a ghost, preaching reconciliation with God.
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:47.000]   They might have listened to that message.
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000]   In other words, his life was radically changed
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:50.000]   and he carried a message of power.
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:53.000]   So should yours.
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000]   If you're really saved, you start to become that one.
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000]   When Jesus was here, he was exactly that.
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:00.000]   He said if you don't believe my words, believe my walk.
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:01.000]   They said well show us some more signs.
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:06.000]   He said there's no more signs except the sign of Jonah.
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:11.000]   When I'm swallowed up, if you will, for three days
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000]   in what looks like certain death, only to live again
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000]   from which I will pronounce to you one more time,
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:21.000]   I am the way, the truth, and the life.
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:25.000]   See I don't know what you worship, but I'm gonna tell you
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:28.000]   that when you see a God defeat your great enemy death
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:33.000]   and he returns and tells you I did this for you,
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000]   that's not just some story in history,
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:38.000]   it is the pivot point of your eternity.
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000]   And what you do with that prophet who was thrown
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000]   in the sea of judgment for you will determine
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.000]   where you spend it.
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000]   And if you know him, you will make a vow to love him
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000]   the way he gave his life for you.
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:50.000]   And part of that is having received that word
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:55.000]   is to gladly share it with others.
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000]   And so this story that happened before Christ
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000]   anticipates Christ and the story about Christ
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000]   anticipates that you should respond to it
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:05.000]   and you should join Christ in suffering in every way
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000]   that you need to so that the world might know
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:10.000]   you died to yourself, that Christ might live in you
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:14.000]   and his message might go forth and his power might be seen
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:19.000]   so the Ninevites could be free.
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000]   Father I pray if there's any Ninevites in the room,
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:25.000]   folks who came in here that are living lives of terror,
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:28.000]   that maybe are in rooms in Houston and Fort Worth
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000]   and in Dallas and other places watching around the world
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:35.000]   tonight that all they seek to do is to live in rebellion
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:38.000]   against God and to bring others into their powers
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:41.000]   and into their patterns so that they can have sway
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:45.000]   over them and use them for their own pleasure.
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000]   And Lord we don't look at any of the people that are here
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000]   and listen to this message like we're better than them.
[01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:52.000]   That's the way we would have sailed unless grace came to us,
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000]   unless the great prophet convinced us that there was
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:57.000]   a better way and showed us love, that he gave his life for us,
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000]   that we might be reconciled to you in goodness
[01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:04.000]   so that we could start to sail towards safe harbors
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:07.000]   filled with hope and with song.
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:10.000]   So Lord we thank you just for this story in history,
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:14.000]   the way you seek after rebels.
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:18.000]   We thank you that that story anticipates the great prophet
[01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:23.000]   who gave his perfect life for the Ninevites like me.
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:26.000]   That I would stop rowing towards you to try and earn my way
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:29.000]   and I would receive the gift of your sacrifice
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:32.000]   that I might live.
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000]   So Lord help me now having seen your great love,
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000]   me to make a vow to try and respond to it.
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000]   Thank you that even my imperfection in responding to that,
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000]   your grace is sufficient.
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:43.000]   But Lord I want to learn more of your ways.
[01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:46.000]   I pray that my life would be as shockingly different
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:49.000]   as Jonas must have been when he was regurgitated
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:52.000]   from the belly of a whale for three days.
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:55.000]   That people would see that I've come from someplace else,
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:58.000]   sent forth from you, living in righteousness,
[01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:02.000]   sanctified by your work of deliverance.
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:05.000]   With a mouth filled with kindness and grace,
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000]   speaking of the glories and goodness of who you are,
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000]   not who I am.
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000]   Realizing that the only reason I'm a prophet is because
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:14.000]   I've received from you what I freely offer to others.
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000]   I pray Lord for people who really know you in this room,
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000]   that we would not sail on our own,
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:19.000]   but we would go where you tell us to go
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000]   and live as you tell us to live.
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:24.000]   In humility, faithfulness, and love.
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:28.000]   Thank you that this room is filled with such men and women.
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:31.000]   Thank you tonight that more can come.
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:38.000]   If they just say I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired.
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:42.000]   I thank you that you gave your life for me.
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:45.000]   I thank you that the sacrifice of your son
[01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:50.000]   calmed the seas of judgment due me.
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:53.000]   I thank you Father that you raised him from that sea of judgment
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:56.000]   as evidence that your wrath had been satisfied
[01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:59.000]   and my debt has been paid.
[01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:02.000]   And I pray that that power that resurrected him from the grave
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:05.000]   as a sign of your grace would live in me
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:10.000]   as I walk with you for the good of others
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:16.000]   as I sing songs of redemption to Assyrians and prophets alike.
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:19.000]   Lord would you help us to walk with you.
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:22.000]   Would you let us live in that grace in Jesus name.
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000]   Amen.
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:28.000]   Well man if that song is the cry of your heart
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000]   then you're in a really good place.
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000]   (laughter)
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000]   (applause)
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000]   Thank you.
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:39.000]   Yeah let me just tell you and remind you about that picture.
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000]   I didn't see that thing.
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:42.000]   Put it back up there.
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:45.000]   I didn't see that thing.
[01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:48.000]   And what's amazing is some of you guys think you're in a good place maybe
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.000]   and you don't want the Lord to take over yet.
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.000]   You think you just swim in the ocean.
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000]   There's no monster here that can swallow me up.
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:53.000]   This is all good.
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:57.000]   And you don't even know what's right there next to you.
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:00.000]   And God in his kindness one day
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:03.000]   if you're blessed because the Lord disciplines his children
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000]   and those he loves you're going to find yourself in the belly of a whale.
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:08.000]   And if you're not ready to respond tonight I pray you respond then.
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000]   I pray you know that God's not mad at you.
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000]   That he's not putting you in the belly of a whale because he's punishing you.
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000]   That's just what happens when you swim in a sea
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000]   where there are monsters that lurk.
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000]   And anytime you're not sailing with him you need to know
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:23.000]   there are monsters in that ocean that can swallow you easily.
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:27.000]   And God's always ready to hear your prayer.
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000]   But today is the day of salvation.
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:30.000]   Let us cry to God
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:35.000]   because in a flood of great waters he may not always be found.
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000]   But if you cry to him tonight
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000]   and you say take over lover of my soul
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000]   that you would throw yourself in the ocean
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:46.000]   that I might be free.
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000]   He says just come.
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000]   And if you have come and you know him
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000]   then would you just go faithfully?
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000]   Would you go and tell others unashamedly and boldly?
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000]   Would you live and would you suffer for them?
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000]   Would you go into their Nineveh and declare?
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000]   Don't go and mingle with the Ninevites.
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000]   You've got to be distinct and different.
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000]   As one raised from the dead
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000]   clothed in righteousness
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000]   declaring to them the reason
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:13.000]   for your otherworldly appearance.
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:14.000]   With freedom.
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000]   Not performing so God would accept you
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000]   but out of his acceptance
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000]   responding in love.
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000]   Would you come if you don't know him?
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:23.000]   Let him take over.
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000]   And would you go if he's taken over with you?
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000]   If you're here and you're headed to launch
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000]   and you want to serve others at launch
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000]   and head up to the loft and jump into our leaders meeting
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000]   and if you're in other towns
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000]   there's opportunities for you to serve there.
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:36.000]   Connect with your leaders.
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000]   Come.
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000]   Go.
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000]   Worship the King who gave himself for you.
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000]   In Jesus' name be free.
[01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000]   Bless you.
