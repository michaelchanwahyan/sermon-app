00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,460
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:28,440
 All right, well, hey, welcome everybody that's tuning in from

3
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,120
 wherever you are joining us.

4
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,200
 I know Fort Worth is back live.

5
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,280
 So is Houston.

6
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,680
 I think Northwest Arkansas is.

7
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,920
 Southampton is.

8
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,680
 And wherever you are listening and watching,

9
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,520
 we are, as JD just said, wrapping up the therapy series.

10
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,040
 Over the last six weeks, we've been

11
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:49,120
 looking at a huge issue in our culture right now.

12
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,360
 It was a huge issue before everything happened with COVID,

13
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,080
 but specifically talking about mental health.

14
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,040
 And COVID and everything that has

15
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,000
 happened with the lockdowns and challenges in society

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,120
 have only made that worse.

17
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,240
 So we have been jumping in.

18
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,680
 If you have missed this series, you

19
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,160
 can find all those on the porch app.

20
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,680
 We covered four weeks on anxiety.

21
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,160
 We covered what it looks like to get healthy

22
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,360
 and deal with your baggage.

23
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:14,200
 And tonight, we are launching into a really big issue

24
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:18,720
 that I'm going to have Hayden Browning, who's on our team.

25
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,480
 He's our worship leader.

26
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,280
 He's going to help.

27
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,040
 And let me set up and frame it like this.

28
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,440
 My son is four years old, and he, during COVID,

29
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,800
 has mastered the art of using Alexa.

30
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,880
 So he will find a song that he really likes.

31
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,080
 And all day long, he will drive his mother insane

32
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,720
 by going up and saying, Alexa, play this song.

33
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,520
 And he'll have the same song play over and over and over again.

34
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,760
 One of the songs that we've been jamming to that most--

35
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,960
 I feel like churches, Christians, people in general

36
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,240
 were jamming even before COVID-- was Waymaker.

37
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,880
 You guys familiar with Waymaker?

38
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,760
 Like JD said, we've got some volunteers,

39
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,800
 some friends that are here.

40
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,800
 Yeah, it's a great song.

41
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,560
 Waymaker, Promise Keeper.

42
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,080
 Hayden is going to do a much better job,

43
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,000
 because I've got some sort of bacterial infection.

44
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,380
 Break it off a little bit for us.

45
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,240
 Hayden, give the people what they want.

46
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,880
 For anybody who doesn't know this song,

47
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,120
 how does the chorus go?

48
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,240
 Oh, the whole chorus?

49
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,520
 Yeah, whatever you want to give them.

50
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,480
 No pressure.

51
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:15,320
 Waymaker, miracle worker, promise keeper,

52
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,040
 light in the darkness.

53
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,880
 OK, if you could try a little harder,

54
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:22,040
 I don't feel like you're giving 100% on this.

55
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,120
 I'm totally kidding.

56
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,040
 All right, so my son will go up, and he will jam.

57
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,080
 Yeah, you're doing great, man.

58
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,440
 He'll go up and have Alexa play this song over and over.

59
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,320
 If you've heard the live version of this song,

60
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,160
 it ends in a really interesting way.

61
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,440
 I don't know if you've heard the live version,

62
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,360
 because at the end of the song, he'll go off, the singer,

63
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:42,200
 and he'll begin to talk about how God's name is above X, Y,

64
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:46,560
 and Z. And it sounds a little bit like, give it to him.

65
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,160
 His name is above depression.

66
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,480
 His name is above cancer.

67
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,520
 Why are you lifting your chin so high like that?

68
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,080
 His name is above loneliness.

69
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,560
 That's right.

70
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,360
 Oh, I love it.

71
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,040
 Just like that.

72
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,720
 You killed it, dude.

73
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,560
 It's just like that.

74
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,040
 We have copyright laws, so we can't actually scream.

75
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,680
 So Hayden is just the face, and the beauty, and the voice.

76
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,400
 But he'll go up, and he'll play that song.

77
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,360
 And at the end of the song, if you're not

78
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,200
 familiar with it, the live version includes that.

79
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,000
 And as a four-year-old, you don't know what depression is.

80
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,960
 You don't know what anxiety is.

81
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,160
 You don't know what loneliness is.

82
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,040
 But because he's a four-year-old, he's a sponge.

83
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,960
 So anything he hears, he repeats.

84
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:25,360
 It's like locked in his mind, which means when we're out in public,

85
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,440
 he begins singing songs kind of in general all the time.

86
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:32,440
 But we'll be out at the Lego store, or at, you know, the neighborhood pool,

87
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,760
 or out just, you know, at the park with people around.

88
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:38,680
 And he will begin singing the song, and just immediately skip the entire thing,

89
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:43,240
 and go right into, "His name is above depression," with total strangers

90
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,520
 everywhere around us.

91
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,120
 I'm not kidding.

92
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,640
 Like, I'm saying in the middle of the mall, looking at the Lego thing,

93
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,640
 "His name is above loneliness.

94
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,520
 His name is above depression."

95
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:55,840
 And everyone's face all of a sudden goes, "Whoo," because there's a four-year-old

96
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,240
 singing about depression, and looking at his parents like,

97
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,480
 "What sort of parents are you right now?

98
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,720
 What is going on?"

99
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,000
 Because as weird as it is, you know, for anybody to talk about depression,

100
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 especially out in public, it's for sure weird when a four-year-old is doing it.

101
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,600
 And it's one of those topics that, as he doesn't understand, like,

102
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,560
 he laughs, and he sees the reaction, and he's like, "What is depression?"

103
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,160
 And it's like, "We'll talk about that later."

104
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,320
 But it's one of those subjects that it's a really weighty thing.

105
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,680
 And so, it's unusual, and you don't hear a lot of people move

106
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,880
 into that conversation.

107
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,840
 And yet, it's also a really big issue in our world.

108
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:34,240
 So the fact that, you know, not a lot of people talk about it openly,

109
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,280
 and even more tragically, not a lot of places in church talk

110
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,280
 about it openly, is such a miss, because millions of people

111
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:46,000
 around the country are dealing with this issue of depression.

112
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,400
 So tonight, we're going to launch into a biblical framework on depression.

113
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,880
 When I say millions, I mean literally millions.

114
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:57,000
 And this was well before COVID had ever hit, and it's only gotten worse.

115
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,880
 According to the CDC, there's been a 47% increase in major

116
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:10,360
 depression diagnoses among young adults in the last 10 years.

117
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,400
 The generation right behind them are college students graduating.

118
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,280
 This is from a couple of years ago.

119
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:19,840
 So the average 24, 25-year-old, they found that there has been a doubling

120
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,160
 of rates of anxiety, suicide, and depression.

121
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:31,680
 Americans, listen to this, are three times, or Americans consume three times

122
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:39,840
 more pills for anxiety and depression than the rest of the world combined.

123
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,160
 Hundreds of millions of prescriptions for antidepressants.

124
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:49,080
 The single most common prescription drug out there is in the category

125
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:52,120
 of antidepressants.

126
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,880
 Like, it's everywhere.

127
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:57,040
 And it's an issue that not enough people have talked about, and it's leading

128
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:02,240
 to devastating consequences, and it's never been a generation more

129
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,360
 significantly impacted than young adults today.

130
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,160
 And as likely study after study is showing, it's only, it's higher than it

131
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,280
 has ever been because of corona.

132
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:18,440
 It is more common to die of suicide than of homicide in America.

133
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,920
 It's more common to die of taking your own life than if somebody

134
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,600
 murdering you.

135
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,760
 Think about that.

136
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,960
 It's two times as likely.

137
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,040
 It's crazy.

138
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,520
 That means you are a bigger danger to yourself than any person in your life,

139
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,440
 statistically speaking.

140
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:33,440
 And generally speaking, the way that people end up in that place is because

141
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:39,480
 of a battle with this depression that they feel like they can't escape,

142
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:43,000
 that leaves them without hope.

143
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,600
 And yet, it's not an issue that is a new issue.

144
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:48,720
 It feels new to us, or it feels like heightened experiences of depression.

145
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,520
 But the Bible, over and over, talks about anxiety, and it talks

146
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,360
 about depression.

147
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:59,400
 Talks about people experiencing tremendous level of sorrow and pain.

148
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:03,880
 And so, this message is for anyone who's ever struggled with depression or anyone

149
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:07,440
 who has anyone in their life.

150
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,080
 Because when you're in that moment, or for anyone listening who's been there,

151
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,040
 it feels like there's no hope.

152
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,000
 It feels like God is done.

153
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,040
 It feels like I can't control it.

154
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:21,320
 It's been said it's an emotional issue, but in a lot of ways,

155
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:25,520
 people in depression, they feel like, "I don't have any emotions at all."

156
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,680
 And so, what I want to spend the next 30 minutes doing is not solving and giving a

157
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,480
 one-stop shop for everyone's depression every time it's going to fix it,

158
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,360
 here's the one cure.

159
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,120
 Nobody can do that.

160
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,720
 I want to give us a framework biblically to understand what depression is,

161
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:45,400
 what are some of the causes biblically of depression, and what are the ways or some

162
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,640
 of the ways that we combat depression.

163
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:51,800
 I wanted to call it the cure for depression, and I didn't think it was honest.

164
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,200
 I don't know that there is one cure that always works every single time,

165
00:07:55,200 --> 00:08:00,600
 but I do know that God knows more about depression, sorrow, pain,

166
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:04,440
 than any psychiatrist, any person in this world.

167
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:08,600
 And in His Word, He talks about how we can have a framework

168
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,600
 to approach this subject.

169
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,320
 So, we're going to look at, specifically, if you take notes,

170
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,720
 what is depression, what causes it, what combats it.

171
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,560
 So, let's first talk about what is depression.

172
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,280
 Depression, according to the dictionary, so let me start there,

173
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,320
 Oxford Dictionary says, "It is severe despondency and dejection,"

174
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:30,400
 just sadness, "typically felt over a period of time, accompanied by feelings

175
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,120
 of hopelessness and inadequacy."

176
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,840
 It's related to the emotion of grief, or sadness, or sorrow,

177
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,960
 but those can be appropriate things and not necessarily bad things.

178
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:45,000
 There's times in life where it would be bizarre to not have grief.

179
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,080
 It'd be bizarre to not grieve after a loved one dies.

180
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,920
 It's not just grief, though, it's prolonged grief and sadness

181
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,400
 that doesn't go away.

182
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:58,040
 It's when sorrow stretches out for long periods of time.

183
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,000
 That's depression.

184
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,400
 It's when sorrow becomes a way of life, it's not just a phase.

185
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:07,320
 It can look like a lot of things, and a lot of different ways it plays out.

186
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:11,880
 Sometimes people say, "Man, I just go to bed sad, I wake up sad,

187
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,080
 I can't shake this.

188
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,760
 It's what I constantly feel."

189
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,960
 Other times people describe it as, "I just feel tired all the time.

190
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,920
 I don't even want to get out of bed."

191
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,760
 People will feel like, "I don't know who I am.

192
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,760
 I'm not myself.

193
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,200
 Like something is broken."

194
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,400
 Other times you'll hear people describe, "I just have no motivation."

195
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:35,080
 And tragically, people describe, "I don't know that I want to keep living

196
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:39,160
 anymore," and they'll play suicidal thoughts like, "Maybe there's no point

197
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,080
 to it at all."

198
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,200
 You can take a lot of different forms.

199
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,200
 But in the Bible, we also were introduced to people who walked

200
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,920
 through what today we understand is depression, extended,

201
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:56,880
 prolonged series, and phases of sadness.

202
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,520
 In these biblical examples, I'm just going to give a few of them because there's so

203
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,280
 many to list, we don't even have time to go.

204
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,320
 But here's what I want you to hear.

205
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:08,320
 These were kings, these were prophets, these were men who knew God and saw him

206
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,480
 do amazing things.

207
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,520
 These were men that God said, "I'm going to have you write a book of the Bible.

208
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:17,600
 I'm going to have you write many, many sections of the Bible."

209
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,480
 And they saw God, as we'll see in a second, do incredible things,

210
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:27,200
 and yet they walked through serious sorrow and depression in their life.

211
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,440
 And God included their stories and wanted them included.

212
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,600
 And one of the reasons, I think, is because he wants you to know if you're

213
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,680
 in that place, you're not alone.

214
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,960
 You're not alone.

215
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,120
 You're not alone.

216
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,160
 One of the people that experienced depression based on his own description

217
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,000
 was Job.

218
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,520
 If you don't know Job, it's a book of the Bible.

219
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,600
 It's the oldest book of the Bible.

220
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,240
 It looks like if you're reading it, Job.

221
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,560
 It's not Job, it's Job.

222
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,680
 Job is a story all about suffering.

223
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,560
 It's the oldest book, like I said, in the Bible.

224
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,080
 Here's the big snapshot.

225
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:57,080
 Job was a guy who was a righteous man, we're told, before God.

226
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,440
 And God basically, he had a really blessed life.

227
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:04,280
 He had 10 kids, 10, seven sons, three daughters, had an amazing,

228
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:07,600
 essentially, business set up and operation, great home.

229
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,360
 Everything was great.

230
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,720
 And then one day, everything fell apart.

231
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:17,400
 In a matter of not even multiple days, his life collapsed.

232
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,800
 Somebody ran up and said, "Hey, these people just came from a foreign

233
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,560
 village and they stole everything.

234
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,360
 They killed all of your servants and they took all of the cattle and everything

235
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:30,440
 that you own, be the equivalent of your business, totally collapsing."

236
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,440
 And then somebody else runs up and they say, "There was a great storm that came

237
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,480
 when you were out in the field and it hit your house and it collapsed and it killed

238
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,840
 all of your children."

239
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:45,720
 We read that or I read that and it's like, "Oh, that's kind of a crazy story."

240
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:50,520
 It's not just a story, it happened.

241
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:54,560
 And he goes and he buries 10 kids in the ground.

242
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,360
 And then we're told that his body, like his body begins to war against him.

243
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:03,640
 He breaks out and boils, which is just this painful legions on his skin.

244
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,560
 And he feels like God is punishing and against him and he writes out some really

245
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:11,200
 depressing poetry in the midst of which he says this, something that I think some of

246
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,200
 us have felt or experienced, can relate to.

247
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,400
 He says, "Depression haunts my days."

248
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,160
 It's Job 30, verse 16.

249
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:25,200
 "At night, my bones are filled with pain, which gnaws at me relentlessly.

250
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,880
 With a strong hand, God grabs my shirt.

251
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,040
 He grips me by the collar of my coat.

252
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,600
 He's thrown me into the mud.

253
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,400
 I'm nothing more than dust and ashes.

254
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,960
 I cry out to you, God, but you don't answer.

255
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:42,040
 I stand before you and you don't even look."

256
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,640
 Job's not describing what's true, he's describing what he feels and he says,

257
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,680
 "It feels like God just grabbed me by the shirt and threw me into the mud.

258
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,200
 Depression haunts all of my days."

259
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,720
 In other words, every single day is filled with nothing but depression.

260
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:59,480
 It feels like God is absent, he doesn't care, and he won't answer me.

261
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,120
 Job wasn't alone.

262
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,640
 Elijah was a prophet, well-known.

263
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:05,600
 I wish we had time to go into more of his story, but he's a guy who saw God do

264
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,440
 incredible things.

265
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:11,040
 At one point, he basically places a bet with these false prophets, these men who

266
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,000
 worship a God that doesn't exist, and he was like, "Yeah, your God's not real,

267
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,880
 mine is, and let me show it to you."

268
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:19,600
 He calls down fire from heaven and consumes this altar, and he just saw God

269
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,720
 do amazing things.

270
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:27,520
 And then one day, he finds himself just exhausted that he's not sure that God is

271
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,040
 going to act in the way that he wants to.

272
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,240
 He's afraid for his life and he takes off and he just begins to experience

273
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:32,600
 suffering.

274
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,520
 And in the midst of that suffering, he finds himself saying, "I don't want to

275
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,040
 live anymore."

276
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,400
 I mean, this is a guy who just saw God call, or he just called fire down from

277
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,800
 heaven.

278
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,040
 And then shortly after, despite having seen that, he's saying, "I don't even know

279
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:46,640
 that I want to live."

280
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:53,120
 First Kings chapter 19 verse 4 says this, "I've had enough, Lord.

281
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,280
 Take my life.

282
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:58,240
 I'm no better than my ancestors who've already died.

283
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,240
 God, I'm all alone.

284
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,480
 I can't take it anymore.

285
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,000
 I just don't want to live.

286
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,440
 There's no point."

287
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:10,400
 Some of you listening, like, "You've felt that before, and you're not alone."

288
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,080
 David was called a man after God's own heart.

289
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:16,840
 He's another man that battled with depression.

290
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,840
 David wrote most of the Psalms.

291
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:21,720
 If you read the Psalms, you know, as you guys probably are familiar with,

292
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,280
 David is the most emo in the entire Bible.

293
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,600
 In one Psalm, he's like, "He's the greatest.

294
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,840
 It's God's the best."

295
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:31,760
 And the next, he's like, "Where are you, God?"

296
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,840
 Up and down and up and down.

297
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:38,240
 And yet God calls him a man after his own heart.

298
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,400
 And he would pour out, "God, I feel like you've turned your back on me.

299
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,120
 My life is full of depression and sadness."

300
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:50,680
 In Psalm chapter 6, he says this, "I'm worn out with sobbing and with crying.

301
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:54,160
 All night I flood my bed with weeping, drenching it with tears.

302
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,360
 My vision is blurred by grief.

303
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,200
 I'm just overwhelmed.

304
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:04,320
 I'm lying in bed, and I'm sad and filled with depression and sorrow.

305
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:10,320
 And I can't even sleep because when I do, I just lay there, and I'm overwhelmed with

306
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,040
 sadness."

307
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:19,240
 There's a guy most of you probably haven't heard of called Heman Son of Korah.

308
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,080
 What a great name, man, Heman.

309
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,480
 How do we not know more about Heman?

310
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,160
 Heman wrote Psalm 88.

311
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,280
 Psalm 88 would have been a psalm just like all the other psalms that...

312
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,840
 The book of Psalms is the Israelite Spotify list.

313
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:36,240
 These are the psalms that you go in to the temple, and they would sing the psalms.

314
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,760
 And this psalm that he wrote has been described as one of the darkest,

315
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:44,600
 if not the darkest, words in the entire Bible where he lays out how he feels like God has

316
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,560
 abandoned and betrayed him.

317
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:52,840
 He says this, "I'm forgotten and cut off from your care, God.

318
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:59,440
 You have thrown me into the lowest pit, into the darkest depths.

319
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:05,840
 Your anger weighs me down, and wave after wave, you engulf me."

320
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,120
 He feels like, "Man, I'm in this life."

321
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,640
 And he does what so many of us do when we're just in a bad place.

322
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:15,560
 We quickly turn and begin to point the finger at God.

323
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,720
 He's just expressing how he feels.

324
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,600
 He said, "Life, it's like, man, I'm already in the lowest place, and it's like one wave

325
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:24,840
 hits me, and another wave hits me, and another wave hits me."

326
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:33,280
 And he ends the psalm by saying this, "Darkness is my closest friend."

327
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,720
 That's in your Bible.

328
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:39,880
 I mean, this is well before Simon and Garfunkel with the, "Hello, darkness, my old friend."

329
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:43,120
 That came straight out of this dude's mouth.

330
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:53,360
 Psalm 88, verse 18, he says, "I feel alone and in darkness."

331
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,800
 Jeremiah had a lifelong battle with depression.

332
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,800
 He was a prophet.

333
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,360
 We don't have time to go into his story either, but he wrote an entire book called Lamentations

334
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,480
 of his grief, his sorrow.

335
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,360
 The word lamentation is lament.

336
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,320
 Here's the laments that I have, and he just pours his heart out to God.

337
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:14,280
 One point, chapter 2, verse 10, he says, "I've cried until the tears no longer come.

338
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,800
 My heart is broken."

339
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:25,280
 Jeremiah writes in the Bible, "I've cried so much, there's nothing left to come out.

340
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,280
 My heart is broken."

341
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:36,040
 The Bible's not full of men who are immune or unaware of what it looks like to experience

342
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,520
 sorrow and pain.

343
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:45,040
 God included and had these included in the Bible so that you wouldn't be alone.

344
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,080
 You would know you're not alone.

345
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:54,560
 And it's one of those experiences that can come for anyone, and God doesn't want you

346
00:17:54,560 --> 00:18:02,760
 to experience it, but God also understands what you're walking through.

347
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:09,920
 What's crazy is, you know, my wife is a counselor, and psychology is one of those fields that

348
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:15,520
 we are just in the last like 50 years getting our arms around, trying to understand, trying

349
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:20,120
 to better understand, specifically things like depression, clinical anxiety, all of

350
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,760
 that stuff.

351
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:28,360
 And as it relates to this topic, any doctor is essentially, they're going in, and because

352
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:32,120
 we're still trying to learn it, it impacts people differently, the way that it looks,

353
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,280
 and different people's lives looks different.

354
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,280
 I mean, they're practicing.

355
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,920
 They are doing what, you know, there's a reason they call it, "Here's my doctor's practice."

356
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:43,880
 They're just trying to understand and get their arms around it, but God fully understands

357
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,760
 it.

358
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,760
 It's like this, my son is really into dinosaurs right now.

359
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,400
 I mean, like he's all about dinosaurs.

360
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,640
 That's all we talk about.

361
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,440
 That's all the videos that we watch.

362
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,880
 It's like constantly we're looking at dinosaurs.

363
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,320
 He's memorized more, he memorized dinosaurs I didn't even know exist, names that I'm like,

364
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,720
 "How in the world did you even know that?"

365
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:07,480
 Because of this, we'll constantly on the weekends, or just kind of at times, who want to watch

366
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,800
 a YouTube dinosaur video.

367
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:14,720
 And I'll try to find one that's not like just straight off of Jurassic Park of ripping some

368
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,640
 guy a head so that his two-year-old sister is scarred, but we'll find some video, and

369
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,080
 it's often telling us about dinosaurs.

370
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,960
 His favorite, of course, the T-Rex.

371
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,120
 It's everybody's favorite.

372
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:29,840
 We watch these videos, and as I have continued to watch these with him, I just am reminded

373
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,040
 of how little we actually know about these things.

374
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,320
 Like we're just kind of guessing.

375
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,760
 We're taking hypotheses, we could be right, we could be wrong.

376
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,760
 Who really knows?

377
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,760
 Nobody does.

378
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,800
 And why I say that is the video we watched this past weekend, or one of them, was related

379
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,080
 to the Tyrannosaurus Rex.

380
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,360
 Here's a picture of a Tyrannosaurus Rex.

381
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,260
 If you notice, he's got very small arms.

382
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:51,100
 And people will begin to think, like, hey, why did he have such small arms?

383
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,200
 Because they've proven, hey, he can't even scratch his face.

384
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,440
 He's got something stuck in his teeth.

385
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,680
 He can't get it out with his hands.

386
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,800
 Like, they're just very little tiny arms that are there.

387
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,800
 So people hypothesize, why did the T-Rex have such small arms?

388
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,160
 It just doesn't make sense.

389
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,200
 And they throw these hypotheses out.

390
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:08,720
 And the most recent one has clearly pulled a veil back of like, I don't know that you

391
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,960
 guys know what you're talking about here.

392
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,160
 You're clearly just guessing.

393
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,160
 Why do I say that?

394
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:16,120
 The most recent hypothesis is that the reason they had such small arms was not to hunt,

395
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:19,200
 was not to do anything with, was not to just scratch, you know, their stomach, which is

396
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,740
 about all that they can do.

397
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:23,660
 But in order to attract a mate, here's how.

398
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:27,520
 They would embrace tickling, where they would go up to another Tyrannosaurus.

399
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,520
 I'm not kidding.

400
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,520
 You Google it right now.

401
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,760
 Another, and they're like, we solved it.

402
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,760
 That's why they're so little.

403
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:36,600
 They would go up and they would tickle the person, or the dinosaur of the opposite sex.

404
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,360
 And that was to do something like, hey, girl, how you doing?

405
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,360
 Okay.

406
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,280
 And that is the leading theory on Tyrannosaurus Rex.

407
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,360
 Look, that may be true.

408
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,360
 I don't know if it's true or not.

409
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,920
 But I at least know you don't know if it's true.

410
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,560
 You ain't got no video of some dinosaur going up to somebody.

411
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,680
 It's totally a guess.

412
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,920
 You even look in the hypothesis and they're like, we really don't know.

413
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:58,560
 I mean, we're just throwing stuff against the wall at this point.

414
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:06,040
 A lot of times that can be the way that in terms of psychology, science and psychologists,

415
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,040
 and it's an amazing field.

416
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,600
 I already said, I'm married to a counselor.

417
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,080
 I believe in what she does.

418
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,120
 I'm just saying, they're still figuring it out.

419
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,760
 They don't fully understand how all of it works, but God does.

420
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,760
 He knows what you're feeling.

421
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:22,720
 He knows better than you even know yourself, the depths of the hurt, what you're walking

422
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,720
 through.

423
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:27,200
 And he wants you to know you're not alone.

424
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:32,760
 So if that's a snapshot of what depression can look like, what causes depression?

425
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:40,040
 Because here's the truth, whether you believe me or not, there's a reason you're depressed.

426
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:43,200
 There's a reason your mom is depressed.

427
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,880
 There's a reason someone in your life is walking through depression.

428
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:54,400
 And so getting to the root of, man, what is causing that is crucial to addressing not

429
00:21:54,400 --> 00:22:00,920
 just the symptoms of what I feel, but the source that's causing those feelings.

430
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:04,080
 Psalm 42 is a really honest psalm written by David.

431
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:09,700
 And in it, three times, he asked the question, "Why are you downcast?

432
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:12,520
 Why are you depressed, oh my soul?

433
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,680
 Why are you disturbed?

434
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,720
 What's wrong with you?

435
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,720
 Put your hope in God."

436
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:19,160
 He says it three times in less than 10 verses.

437
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:23,840
 And he's asking the question, that is the question, I think, for anybody who's battling

438
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:32,000
 depression or anybody's walking through that, of asking, like, what is going on?

439
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 Why am I stressed?

440
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 Why am I depressed?

441
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 Why am I anxious?

442
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 What am I feeling?

443
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 Like, what's causing this?

444
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:43,160
 There's a number of reasons, biblically, that could be behind it.

445
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:47,720
 One reason that oftentimes people can find themselves moving into depression, and I have

446
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:54,120
 so much sympathy, and like God, I hate that you are finding yourself there, that you are

447
00:22:54,120 --> 00:23:00,560
 there in a place where you don't want to be, neither does God want you to be.

448
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:04,400
 But asking the question, like, man, what could be behind this?

449
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,040
 What is causing this?

450
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:14,760
 In Proverbs chapter 12, verse 25, Solomon says there's a cause behind some depression,

451
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,760
 and it's anxiety.

452
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:19,160
 He says this, listen to this verse.

453
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:24,160
 This is a verse that only in the last 75 years psychologists have discovered, oh yeah, that's

454
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,680
 actually true.

455
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:30,480
 Anxiety in the heart of man causes depression.

456
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,640
 Man knew what people today are just figuring out, that anxiety and depression, like they

457
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:38,520
 often go together, prolonged, I'm anxious, I'm anxious, I'm afraid, I'm afraid, leads

458
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,560
 to depression.

459
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:43,960
 This was written 3,000 years ago.

460
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:47,280
 And any psychologist or anybody in that field will tell you today, those are often really

461
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,280
 linked.

462
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,680
 That can be a clear cause.

463
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,200
 If you don't believe me, like, think about it.

464
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,480
 If you know anybody who's walked through either of those issues, they're often diagnosed the

465
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,480
 same medication from a doctor.

466
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,520
 They're like, oh, you're anxious, here, take this pill.

467
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,520
 Oh, you're depressed, here, take the same pill.

468
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:06,840
 Because even psychology knows there's a relationship between the two of those.

469
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:11,720
 So taking the step, if that's where you are, and you go, man, I think there is, like, there's

470
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:17,400
 just like some fear that is buried really deep that I've been suppressing and holding

471
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:24,680
 back and not dealing with and I'm afraid of, and it's making me feel out of control and

472
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,440
 depressed.

473
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:30,600
 If you're going to experience freedom from that, you've got to at least address what

474
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,600
 are those fears?

475
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,600
 What is that anxiety?

476
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,760
 And begin to work through that.

477
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:46,560
 It can also be caused by circumstances, like really hard, messed up, painful circumstances.

478
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:50,360
 Like someone in your life died.

479
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:55,840
 Like your mom got breast cancer and the chemo.

480
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:02,320
 It worked once and then it went away and then it came back and she's not here anymore.

481
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,320
 She was supposed to be at your wedding.

482
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:08,760
 She was supposed to be in your life.

483
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,960
 It spun you into a place where you're questioning everything.

484
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:17,920
 I mean, it's stuff that, as simple as like a breakup.

485
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,280
 You're dating the person, you're like, I thought we were going to be together for the rest

486
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,280
 of the rest.

487
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:25,160
 Like you and me, ride or die forever, and then the relationship ends up going in a different

488
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,160
 direction.

489
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:30,280
 And there are a few things, I mean, breakups are horrible.

490
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:37,280
 And it can lead to a discouragement that eventually turns into a depression.

491
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:43,840
 If you're going to experience freedom from moving out of that, identifying what could

492
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,840
 be causing that.

493
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,640
 And it could be circumstances that have caused it.

494
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:51,160
 Maybe there's a diagnosis with an autoimmune disease that just feels like you're going

495
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:54,520
 crazy because you talk to doctors and they can't exactly pinpoint it and you just have

496
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:58,600
 these symptoms and it just makes you feel like so overwhelmed, life will never be the

497
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:02,000
 same and depressed.

498
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,920
 Maybe it's just disappointment with where things are.

499
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:08,720
 Like life is incredibly hard and sad.

500
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:14,800
 And God is good, but this world is broken and it's full of disappointments for everybody.

501
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:18,160
 2019 was probably the hardest year of my life.

502
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:23,520
 Well, at least the last eight years.

503
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:27,360
 I'd been working in ministry for 10 years with one of my best friends.

504
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,360
 And then I'd been working in ministry for five years with another one of my best friends.

505
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,000
 I mean, we were like thick as thieves.

506
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,480
 One of them was named JP, who you've probably heard of if you've been around here at all.

507
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,480
 Another one was named Garrett.

508
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,920
 And within six months, God called both of them to go lead at another place.

509
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:43,400
 Now on the outside, a pastor should say, and I was pumped.

510
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,400
 I was like, it was awesome.

511
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,400
 This is what God's doing.

512
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,760
 I'm so pumped.

513
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:49,440
 But that's not what I felt at all.

514
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,560
 These were guys that we were like, we're going to do this forever.

515
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:57,400
 I mean, this is going to be, this is what we're going to do.

516
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,960
 And we worked together every single day.

517
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,200
 We spent more time together than anybody that I know.

518
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:07,160
 And in a moment, it was like my heart ripped apart.

519
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:11,480
 And God called these men away.

520
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:14,400
 And I found myself wondering like, God, what are you doing?

521
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,160
 What am I doing with my life?

522
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:21,720
 Like, am I depressed right now?

523
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:27,080
 Feeling like, man, I'm surrounded by people and God is good and I'm teaching, but I feel

524
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,080
 so alone.

525
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:39,600
 And had there not been people in my life, that could easily have spun me into a depression.

526
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,840
 It's not just caused by circumstances.

527
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:46,000
 It can be caused by unconfessed sin or undealt with sin.

528
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,160
 David says in Psalm 32, he's talking about hiding an affair.

529
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:57,240
 He said, "When I refused to confess my sin, my body wasted away and I groaned all day

530
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,240
 long.

531
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,240
 I was depressed.

532
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:04,920
 Day and night, your hand was heavy upon me."

533
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,840
 Unconfessed sin can lead to a depression in your life.

534
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:09,800
 You're sleeping with your boyfriend, you're doing something, you just kind of keep hidden

535
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,560
 to yourself.

536
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:15,360
 And God in his mercy allows, you're not going to experience joy in this life.

537
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,760
 It's going to get worse and worse and worse.

538
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:21,240
 It can lead to depression.

539
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:25,280
 I'm not saying that all depression, or even most depression, is the result of unconfessed

540
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,280
 sin.

541
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,280
 That's not at all what I'm saying.

542
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:30,320
 I'm saying, but it can be.

543
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:34,600
 Sometimes it's guilt from a past, you know, it's a past abortion, past sexual sin, past

544
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:43,240
 something that you regret from your life and you've never dealt with it, or you've never

545
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:46,000
 accepted God's forgiveness.

546
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,240
 You've never actually walked in like, "God's grace, I'm forgiven.

547
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,520
 I'm not defined by those things.

548
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,960
 I'm a Christian."

549
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:55,040
 Which means Jesus and what he did on the cross, "I am forgiven.

550
00:28:55,040 --> 00:29:00,640
 I will walk in that and I will believe that and I will embrace that."

551
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,320
 Guilt can lead to a place of depression.

552
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:06,800
 And then the last category I would just say is struggles.

553
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,000
 I don't know how to put this.

554
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,040
 Not necessarily sin, sometimes it's wiring, but this type of thing can lead to a depression.

555
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:15,240
 One of those would be, so there's a few of them, perfectionism.

556
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:19,560
 Perfectionism can be a wiring that leads to this place of, "Man, I'm just, I'm depressed

557
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:23,000
 because I'm anxious and I'm stressed and things are not perfect and I'm overwhelmed in this

558
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 life."

559
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,940
 And if you live that way in that mindset, it's a recipe for depression.

560
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:34,720
 Because we live in a broken world and everybody, according to the Bible, has fallen short of

561
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,760
 the glory of God.

562
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,000
 Nobody's perfect, including you.

563
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,680
 And if you critique everything that you do and you constantly criticize and you constantly

564
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:47,000
 beat yourself up, you're going to find yourself eventually depressed.

565
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,760
 You know that the average person, this is a Cornell study that came out a couple years

566
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:55,880
 ago, and it found that the average person makes 35,000 decisions a day.

567
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,400
 35,000.

568
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:02,840
 It found that they make hundreds of decisions as it relates to food and what they eat alone.

569
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:06,880
 35,000 decisions on, "Hey, this is when I'm going to go to bed.

570
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,000
 This is when I'm going to brush my teeth.

571
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,200
 This is when I'm going to take off my shoes.

572
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,080
 This is when I'm going to..." all these different decisions.

573
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:15,000
 Do you expect yourself, when it comes to those decisions, to be perfect every single time?

574
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 That's crazy.

575
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 35,000.

576
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,800
 You don't think you're going to miss once?

577
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:24,480
 You've got to give yourself some grace.

578
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,480
 There's no perfect world.

579
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:28,400
 You can't expect heaven on earth and perfectionism will lead to depression.

580
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:32,680
 If you do expect yourself to be perfect all 35,000, you probably have the second struggle,

581
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:36,080
 which is narcissism, where you expect that you are going to be perfect every time or

582
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:40,000
 you're just a focus on yourself and self-absorption that can look like two ways.

583
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,480
 It can be self-pity, "I'm so terrible.

584
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,480
 I'm so disappointed.

585
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,960
 No one cares about me," or an arrogance that is a, "Hey, look at me.

586
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:46,960
 I'm so great.

587
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,560
 These people don't even know how great I am."

588
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,380
 Both of those can lead to depression.

589
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:53,200
 This is one of the most common causes, I think, in the last 10 years of working with young

590
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,360
 adults.

591
00:30:55,360 --> 00:31:02,720
 Over and over, people, not every person, but a focus and obsession with self, it will make

592
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,360
 you depressed.

593
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,520
 You weren't made to live that way.

594
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:16,240
 And focusing on your job, my money, my car, you hurt me, you don't care, me, me, me, will

595
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,000
 lead to depression.

596
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,800
 In place of narcissism, the Bible says you and I are to walk in humility.

597
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:27,240
 It says this in Philippians chapter 2, verse 3, "Do nothing out of selfish ambition, rather

598
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,920
 in humility.

599
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:34,060
 Value others above yourself, not looking to your own interests, but also to the interests

600
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:35,060
 of others."

601
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:38,560
 Humility, as we've said before, is not thinking bad about yourself, like, "I'm horrible.

602
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,560
 I'm a nobody."

603
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,420
 That's narcissism.

604
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:44,600
 Humility is not thinking of yourself at all.

605
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:51,400
 A humble person is focused on the needs of other people around them, not lost thinking

606
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,640
 about themselves, but lost in the needs of other people around me.

607
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:56,180
 Today, somebody on my team was sharing about how one of the things that helped me in my

608
00:31:56,180 --> 00:32:01,160
 anxiety was that I began to focus on the needs of other people around me, and I stopped being

609
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:04,680
 so worried about myself.

610
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:07,180
 Narcissism is one of those things that, just like in that case with anxiety, will lead

611
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:12,220
 to depression.

612
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:16,380
 Two more would be comparison.

613
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,380
 Constantly comparing.

614
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:20,920
 And this, man, our world is so, we've just, like, created this environment where we are

615
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:25,280
 set up to constantly be focused on other people, comparing ourselves to others.

616
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,420
 Like, social media has only made this worse.

617
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:31,360
 And as I was thinking about it, it's not just that it's made it worse because I'm looking

618
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,860
 at the highlight reel of somebody else.

619
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:37,300
 It's because every time that you look at social media, and I do, think about when you do.

620
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,300
 When do you look at social media?

621
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:41,660
 When you're bored, when you're sitting in a light, when you're waiting for somebody

622
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,420
 to call you back, when you have nothing to do.

623
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:47,700
 Like nobody, nobody looks on social media when they're, you know, surfing a wave in

624
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:48,700
 Maui.

625
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:49,780
 You look at it whenever you're bored.

626
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:51,580
 When do you post on social media?

627
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:53,260
 Whenever you're like, "Look at me, world!

628
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:54,260
 Woo!

629
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:55,660
 Look how great my life is!"

630
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:58,780
 So we have two competing things where the person looking is looking because they're

631
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:02,780
 bored, and the person posting, like, nobody posts like, "Just getting my Chipotle, sitting

632
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:04,260
 at this traffic light right here.

633
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:06,620
 Look how awesome my life is."

634
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:08,380
 Unusual people post that.

635
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:10,620
 Most of us post like, "I want to show you my highlight reel."

636
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:14,220
 So we have people that we're comparing, not just like different stages, but different

637
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:15,220
 moments.

638
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:17,940
 I'm literally seeing your highlight reel whenever I'm bored, and you're seeing my highlight

639
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:19,680
 reel whenever you're bored.

640
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:22,180
 It's a recipe for comparison and for depression.

641
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:25,940
 And the last one would be burnout.

642
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:28,460
 It's not an exhaustive list of everything that caused depression, but burnout.

643
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:34,780
 If you run at a pace that is unsustainable, it will land you depressed, where you're constantly

644
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:40,780
 going, constantly going, constantly going from one thing to the next, from work to happy

645
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:45,220
 hour, from happy hour to some party to something else, to checking your phone, to staying up

646
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:50,980
 late, and it'll burn you out and cause depression.

647
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:53,420
 In order to solve it, you've got to address the roots.

648
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:56,300
 When I was getting married—or no, not when I was getting married, when I started dating

649
00:33:56,300 --> 00:34:01,540
 my wife—on my ring finger—this is such a weird illustration, but it's going somewhere—on

650
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:04,700
 my ring finger, I had like four warts.

651
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:05,700
 I know, it's gross.

652
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,180
 There's a point to this story.

653
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:08,740
 I mean, like, dude, it was bad.

654
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:13,340
 It was like, I am not ever going to get married, and clearly this is a sign from God because

655
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,820
 I can't get rid of these things.

656
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:17,540
 And you may be thinking, "Oh, we'll just go to CVS and get some wart remover."

657
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:22,220
 Did that about 20 times, but these things just kept coming back with a vengeance.

658
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:28,540
 Eventually, I had to go to multiple doctors that had to go in, and I had to get on medicine.

659
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:32,380
 There's apparently wart medicine you can take that helps go in and kill it, and then they

660
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:37,940
 had to go in with some cryo-freezing technology that drills all the way into your finger and

661
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:42,060
 gets out by the roots, those warts, in order for them to go away.

662
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:44,740
 Because if you don't get them by the roots, they're only going to come back.

663
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:49,260
 A lot of times, they come back even worse.

664
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:54,620
 When it comes to depression or anxiety, as we've talked about, but tonight, depression,

665
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:59,500
 if you don't get to the source, it's going to continue coming back and coming back.

666
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:07,180
 And this is like one of the, not dangers, but qualifiers to know about medication.

667
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:11,660
 Medication doesn't help you get to the source of what's causing depression.

668
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:17,540
 It addresses the symptoms of how I feel in a moment, but it doesn't allow you or it doesn't

669
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:19,040
 focus on getting to the source.

670
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:22,960
 My point is not you should not take medication or no one should ever take medication or medication

671
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:23,960
 is wrong.

672
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:24,960
 No, that's not my point.

673
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:25,960
 There are appropriate times.

674
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:29,280
 God gave us Advil, and he gave us different antidepressants at different times.

675
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,900
 My point is that it doesn't treat the source.

676
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:37,460
 So if that's all you do, your recipe is going to lead you to continually need to have something

677
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:41,720
 to treat the symptoms, not the source of your depression.

678
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:45,820
 As a believer and a Christian, as we've talked about before, there are times where it could

679
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:51,260
 be appropriate or is appropriate to take medication, but not at the expense or not without the

680
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:55,660
 two-pronged approach of God's word, living authentically with God's people, seeking to

681
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:57,720
 walk with him and dealing with that.

682
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:01,420
 And then there are times to supplement or be a part of that, but as a supplement, not

683
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:06,340
 a replacement for what God calls us to in Scripture.

684
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:12,260
 All right, so how do you combat, final point, how do you combat depression?

685
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:17,140
 So the cure, I'm sorry, so the cause of it, we look to what it is, what's the cause, how

686
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:19,700
 do we combat it?

687
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:25,200
 As Christians, your whole life, not even, as people, like your whole life is related

688
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,200
 to one another.

689
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:30,620
 In other words, there's a holistic approach in order to combat depression that we are

690
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:35,320
 to take as it relates to fighting and continuing to fight against depression.

691
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:38,940
 You can't just, it's not just, hey, read more Bible verses and that'll fix your problem

692
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:39,940
 every time.

693
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:43,060
 There's a connectedness between your physical body, between the decisions, between how much

694
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:46,940
 sleep you're eating, how much sleep you're getting, what you're eating, your just kind

695
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:49,260
 of lifestyle in general.

696
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:51,620
 There's a spiritual dimension, there's all types of dimensions.

697
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:56,260
 So I want to look at how we combat it, physically, spiritually, communally, and patiently.

698
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:58,140
 I'm going to walk through all of those.

699
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:04,300
 Physically, there's an aspect where you and I are to fight depression physically.

700
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:08,940
 In other words, your life is directly impacted by the physical choices that you make.

701
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:13,300
 Like, this morning, this is such a common thing, this is like just young adult life.

702
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:17,340
 You stayed up late last night, you were watching the sailing sunsets or the Umbrella Academy

703
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:20,340
 or whatever it was, and you stayed up way too late, but man, you just couldn't turn

704
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:21,340
 it off.

705
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:24,260
 And all of a sudden, despite the fact you wanted to go to bed at 10, it's 11.45, you're

706
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:25,260
 up way too late.

707
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:28,100
 So then this morning, rather than get up and have a quiet time, you overslept, you hit

708
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:31,380
 the thing, you get the sleep out of your eyes, you run out the door, you throw on your clothes,

709
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:34,420
 you drive through Starbucks, you get a latte and that little, you know, cake donut thing

710
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:37,860
 that they have, and all of a sudden you're jam-packed with caffeine and sugar, you're

711
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:43,820
 sitting in bumper-to-bumper traffic, rushing to work, you got music blaring from the radio,

712
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:47,460
 on in the car, you finally get to your job, you run into your cubicle, you throw on your

713
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:50,940
 AirPods and you sit there at the job that you're not sure that you really like until

714
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:56,060
 about 10.30, then you go get a Monster from the, you know, vending machine, and you're

715
00:37:56,060 --> 00:38:01,380
 jam-packed with caffeine, you're stressed and overwhelmed, and you wonder why you're

716
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:03,320
 depressed?

717
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,320
 Because it's all connected.

718
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,460
 Like, in other words, you can't just separate those things.

719
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:10,180
 Maybe that's not life for you at all, because COVID has got you locked up at home, and you

720
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:12,940
 sit at home every single day, and you get up and you don't go anywhere, you just, you

721
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:16,620
 don't go to the pantry and you get your Frosted Flakes, and you eat that and sit on the couch,

722
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:19,700
 and you work on your pajamas all day long, you never see any people, you don't go out

723
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:22,500
 and see the sun, and you're like, "Man, I just feel like I'm a little more depressed

724
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,500
 lately."

725
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,620
 Are you serious?

726
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:27,420
 There's an interconnectedness.

727
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:32,020
 God created you as a human with a body and a soul that are deeply connected together.

728
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:38,380
 So as it relates to physically addressing things like sleep, exercise, going outside,

729
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:39,540
 sleep.

730
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:42,700
 God wants you to sleep.

731
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:45,820
 There are times where it is totally, you know, appropriate to get up at four in the morning,

732
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:49,040
 and there are times where it is appropriate to go to bed at nine o'clock at night and

733
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,740
 turn off Netflix and get sleep.

734
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:55,100
 Psalm 127 says that God grants sleep to those he loves.

735
00:38:55,100 --> 00:39:03,580
 Exercise, there is a statistical proven link between anxiety and depression being combated

736
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:04,580
 with exercise.

737
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:09,140
 The National Health Service in the UK revealed that aerobic exercise like running has the

738
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:12,340
 same effect on your body as antidepressants.

739
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:17,260
 It's published in the Journal of Psychiatry and Neuroscience in 2007.

740
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:20,540
 God created Adam and Eve, and he put them in a garden in Genesis chapter 2, and he said,

741
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:23,700
 "Go out and work the garden that you and I were not created to sit in a cube for 12

742
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,060
 hours a day staring at a screen."

743
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:27,580
 And you got to move your body.

744
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:31,540
 Even in talking to a psychologist or a therapist for this series, he was like, "Man, one of

745
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:34,580
 the things I always say, you got to make sure they're in community, they got to make sure

746
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,580
 they're doing this, and they got to make sure they're exercising.

747
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:42,060
 If they're not doing those things, they can take all the medication they want, but they're

748
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:44,460
 never going to get to a place where they're healthier."

749
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:50,220
 So sleep, exercise, all underneath the banner of physical.

750
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:52,620
 I already said go outside.

751
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:56,300
 Vitamin D, there's a reason why Oregon and Alaska are two of the states in the country

752
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:58,380
 with the highest levels of depression and suicide.

753
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:02,540
 There's not a lot of sun for half the year in Alaska.

754
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:04,060
 Vitamin D is a part of that.

755
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:05,460
 And this isn't some just tips and tricks.

756
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,460
 It is how you were created.

757
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:11,060
 You weren't created to live in a cave, sit in your underwear, eating frosted flakes all

758
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:13,620
 day by yourself.

759
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:15,980
 And there's a connect in this physically.

760
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:18,740
 Research has shown that there are strong links between exposure to natural light and the

761
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:19,820
 serotonin system.

762
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:22,380
 In other words, we need light to be happy.

763
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:25,060
 All right, so not just physically.

764
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:29,980
 Even more important is spiritually, that addressing in a mental level and spiritual and soul and

765
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:38,740
 heart level where we're believing lies and addressing them with God's Word and the truth.

766
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:43,100
 Second Corinthians chapter 10, verse 4 through 6 says this, "The weapons that we fight with

767
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:45,500
 are not the weapons of the world.

768
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:50,420
 On the contrary, the weapons we have have divine powers to demolish strongholds."

769
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:55,260
 Some of you feel like depression is a stronghold in your life.

770
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:59,540
 And one of the ways we combat that stronghold is with weapons that God has given us, not

771
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:02,740
 weapons like the world, like a sword and a spear and a bow, but weapons like the Word

772
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:04,860
 of God and like prayer.

773
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:08,680
 We demolish arguments and every pretension, he says, that sets itself up against the knowledge

774
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:09,680
 of God.

775
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:13,260
 We take captive every thought that we have, every sad thought, every anxious thought,

776
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:18,260
 every happy thought, every mad thought, and we make it obedient to Christ.

777
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:23,460
 So I take God's Word and I take the thoughts that I have and I begin to go, "Man, what

778
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:25,060
 would God's Word say about this thought?"

779
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:29,060
 I wake up in the morning and I'm so depressed and sad thinking about the thoughts that,

780
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:31,060
 "Man, maybe I'll never get married for the rest of my life.

781
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:32,580
 I'm maybe going to lose my job.

782
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:33,580
 What happens if they get COVID?"

783
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:34,620
 And I can't believe that.

784
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:36,980
 And I have two options when those thoughts begin to come into my mind.

785
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:41,100
 I can take option one and go down that road and keep feeding those anxious thoughts, keep

786
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:43,580
 feeding those depressed thoughts, and I can run in that direction.

787
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:47,220
 Or I have option two and I can say, "Hey, what would God's Word say about this thought?

788
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:49,460
 I'm going to make this thought obedient to Christ.

789
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:52,220
 Am I going to be single or alone for the rest of my life?

790
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:53,220
 No.

791
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:55,340
 God's Word would say that I've never been alone.

792
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:56,660
 God will never leave me nor forsake me.

793
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:57,660
 I'm going to hold on to that.

794
00:41:57,660 --> 00:42:01,140
 God's Word also says this life is a vapor.

795
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:07,100
 So even if I'm single for the rest of my life, I'm going to be with Christ for all of eternity.

796
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:09,260
 And I can handle and I can face anything.

797
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:13,420
 God will not let me endure or face more than I can handle."

798
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:15,660
 I have two choices in those moments.

799
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:19,420
 I can take the thought and make it captive or I can feed the depression and the depressing

800
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:21,180
 thoughts and run in that direction.

801
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:27,500
 Part of combating spiritually is to begin to think about your thoughts.

802
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:31,020
 It's been said that the average person has 50,000 thoughts a day.

803
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:35,500
 Beginning to diagnose, "What are you thinking about?"

804
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:40,300
 And I'm going to take those thoughts and I'm going to say, "What would God say about these

805
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:41,300
 things?"

806
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:46,180
 In Psalm 42, as we've already talked about, David begins to say, "Man, why are you downcast

807
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:47,180
 on my soul?

808
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:48,180
 Why are you so depressed?

809
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:49,180
 Why are you so discouraged?"

810
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:50,180
 And at the end of the Psalm, he does something really bizarre.

811
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:53,260
 At the end of that verse, I'll read it again.

812
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:55,180
 "Why are you so downcast on my soul?

813
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:56,180
 Why are you so disturbed?

814
00:42:56,180 --> 00:43:01,740
 Put your hope in God, for yet I will praise you."

815
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:04,860
 The psalmist is asking these questions and he's like, "Man, I'm so depressed and I'm

816
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:05,980
 so discouraged."

817
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:10,380
 And he speaks to himself and says, "Put your hope in God.

818
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:11,380
 You're so depressed.

819
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,620
 Put your hope in God."

820
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:16,900
 He's talking to himself.

821
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:20,940
 Part of as Christians, we begin to have thoughts that flood our minds every day.

822
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:23,820
 We begin to go, "Hey, what would God's Word say is true?"

823
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:25,700
 I'm going to hold on to what is true.

824
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:27,060
 That's more important than what I feel.

825
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:28,420
 I'm holding on to what is true.

826
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:29,940
 It's more important than what I feel.

827
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:36,140
 A pastor named Martin Lloyd-Jones was a British pastor who battled depression for decades.

828
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:44,220
 And he said that this is, in this Psalm, we're confronted with the fact that there's a truth

829
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:49,940
 that a lot of us, by learning to do, will combat the battle that takes place in the

830
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:50,940
 mind.

831
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:56,380
 He says this, "Have you not realized that most of your unhappiness in life is due to

832
00:43:56,380 --> 00:44:01,540
 the fact that you're listening to yourself instead of talking to yourself?"

833
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:03,740
 The man's treatment in Psalm 42 was this.

834
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:06,940
 Instead of listening to himself when he woke up in the morning and all the flooded thoughts

835
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:11,100
 that popped in that he didn't decide to have, he began to speak to himself.

836
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:14,580
 He stands up and says, "Self, listen for a moment.

837
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:16,700
 I will speak to you.

838
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:20,860
 Put your hope in God."

839
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:25,380
 So the first part is by battling at a thought level with the truth.

840
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:28,060
 And the second part is involved in prayer.

841
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:29,060
 And this is really important.

842
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:30,060
 We're about to land the plane.

843
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:31,060
 We're almost done.

844
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:37,140
 But part of spiritually combating the issue of depression is prayer, talking to God.

845
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:38,620
 That's all that prayer is, spending time.

846
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:42,060
 I mean, in mindfulness, and this is a huge deal, and now there's apps being created,

847
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:43,060
 and people are like, "Yeah, it's so crazy."

848
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:46,940
 You like sit there, meditation, you kind of pause, still, quiet.

849
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:48,240
 It's called prayer.

850
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,380
 You're just not talking to God.

851
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:51,580
 You're just trying to avoid thinking thoughts.

852
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:54,940
 Only prayer works more effectively.

853
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:59,100
 And you'll experience a directing of your mind and a peace that comes over.

854
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:02,340
 We've already talked about in weeks past, but even study, there was a recent study done

855
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:07,260
 at a Baylor Research Center that found that a person who spends time consistently in prayer

856
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:12,260
 every day to a loving God, in other words, they said if they pray to someone they don't

857
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:14,300
 believe is a loving God, it won't have the same effect.

858
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:17,700
 But if they pray consistently to a loving God every day, there's a dramatic, I'll just

859
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:20,100
 read it so I don't butcher it.

860
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:23,020
 Researchers from Baylor University found that people who pray to a loving and protective

861
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:31,740
 God are much less likely to experience anxiety-related disorders, fear, worry, self-consciousness,

862
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:36,580
 social anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder, and on, compared to people who really don't

863
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:38,860
 pray to receive any comfort or any protection from God.

864
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:43,500
 In other words, those who spend time consistently praying and bringing the things that you're

865
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:47,300
 afraid of, bringing the things that you're scared of, waking up in the morning and saying,

866
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:49,060
 "God, this is everything on my plate.

867
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:50,540
 This is what I feel.

868
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:52,220
 I'm so alone right now.

869
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:53,940
 I'm so scared right now.

870
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:55,500
 I'm so sad right now.

871
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:56,860
 I'm anxious right now.

872
00:45:56,860 --> 00:45:58,380
 I'm excited right now.

873
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:00,780
 I'm distracted right now.

874
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:03,300
 I feel shame right now.

875
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:05,620
 But I know you love me."

876
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:10,540
 Research says brain scans showed it changes that person's brain.

877
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:17,620
 They begin to experience less anxiety and anxiety disorders like depression in their

878
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:19,180
 life.

879
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:22,420
 So spiritually combating it with God's Word, spending time in prayer, honestly and pouring

880
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:23,420
 out your heart to God.

881
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:25,980
 Some of you, let me just move quick, you need to journal.

882
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:27,260
 You're not very good with your thoughts.

883
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:28,620
 You need the right amount in front of you.

884
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:31,500
 You're talking to God and just say, "This is what I feel.

885
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:32,500
 This is what I'm thinking.

886
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:34,140
 This is what I'm afraid of.

887
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:35,340
 This is what I feel."

888
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:36,340
 And journaling and praying.

889
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:38,260
 And then finally, two more.

890
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:41,980
 Practicing things, and I don't love this phrase, but it's that stir your affections for God.

891
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:44,380
 Things that in the midst of, "Man, I'm feeling sadness."

892
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:45,500
 Go on a walk.

893
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:47,300
 Go outside.

894
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:50,060
 Go see whatever nature and beauty is around you.

895
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:52,140
 If you live in Dallas, find a lake.

896
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:55,020
 But do something that whatever makes you be like, "Man, God is big.

897
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:56,860
 I love Him and I trust Him."

898
00:46:56,860 --> 00:47:00,460
 And I can't tell you what all of those things are, but practicing those things and also

899
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:01,740
 practicing gratitude.

900
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:04,980
 And some of you, you're in a place where you're listening and you're like, "I have gratitude."

901
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:05,980
 You have no idea.

902
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:07,900
 I can't even get myself out of bed right now.

903
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:08,900
 Practice.

904
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:09,900
 I want to challenge you.

905
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:11,580
 One thing.

906
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:14,380
 If you're in a great place, do a thousand things.

907
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:15,620
 But if you're like, "I can't do anything."

908
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:16,620
 Do one thing.

909
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:18,980
 "God, I'm thankful for this one thing."

910
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:21,380
 If you're like, "I'm not thankful."

911
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:26,580
 Thank Him that you're able to process what I'm saying to you right now.

912
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:31,220
 Thank Him that you're still alive because that means He's not done with you.

913
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:32,540
 Thank Him for whatever you want.

914
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:33,540
 Fill in the...

915
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:35,740
 Thank Him for the fact that you have a tongue and eye, whatever it is.

916
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:36,740
 It's an endless list.

917
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:40,340
 But if you begin to practice that, it takes your eyes off of everything you don't have

918
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:43,940
 and puts them on gratitude or gratefulness towards God.

919
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:44,940
 So that's the spiritual dimension.

920
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:46,340
 And then finally, communally.

921
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:48,300
 So physically, spiritually, communally.

922
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:49,940
 You've got to have people in your life.

923
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:53,900
 The worst thing you can be if you're depressed is alone and isolated.

924
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:58,420
 And it's the thing you want to do most, and it's the thing that you need to do least.

925
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:02,420
 You've got to have people in your life who you can open up to, who you can call at 1

926
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:06,540
 a.m. and say, "Man, I'm really struggling with these thoughts.

927
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:08,420
 I don't know that there's any point in keeping going."

928
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:10,200
 You've got to have those people in your life.

929
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:11,700
 We all have to have them.

930
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:18,260
 But to walk through depression alone, there's a recipe to continue to walk through depression.

931
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:24,020
 In Galatians 6, verse 1, it says this, "Carry each other's burdens, and in this way you

932
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:26,960
 will fill the law of Christ."

933
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:29,740
 The Greek word for burdens is the word "barrios."

934
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:33,240
 It literally gives the picture of, hey, there are certain things.

935
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:34,900
 It's a word for cargo or for luggage.

936
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:38,820
 And he says, "There are things in your life, they're too heavy for you to carry on your

937
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:39,820
 own.

938
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:41,820
 You have to have other people that can help you carry them."

939
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:45,620
 This is why we hit on church membership.

940
00:48:45,620 --> 00:48:46,620
 We hit on small groups.

941
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:50,140
 You've got to have people like I do, like everyone in this room does, like everybody

942
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:54,860
 in our staff does, that know where you're not okay.

943
00:48:54,860 --> 00:48:56,820
 It's okay to not be okay.

944
00:48:56,820 --> 00:49:00,700
 It's not okay to have people who don't know the places in your life.

945
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:02,620
 You're not okay.

946
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:04,820
 If you don't have anybody in your life, and tonight you're at a place where you don't

947
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:06,660
 know what to do, I'm going to give you an answer.

948
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:08,740
 And somebody from our team, we're going to follow up with you.

949
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:11,020
 You can go to the porch.live/prayer.

950
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:12,300
 You didn't get in a small group.

951
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:13,340
 You don't have a church.

952
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:14,340
 You're totally isolated.

953
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:17,400
 I don't know what your story is, but you are not alone.

954
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:20,460
 And someone on our team, we will call you this week.

955
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:23,540
 Go to the porch.live/prayer.

956
00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:24,540
 You're not alone.

957
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:25,540
 You're loved.

958
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:26,540
 You're cared for.

959
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:28,180
 God is not done with you.

960
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:29,540
 And you can go fill out there.

961
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:32,820
 Any way that we can pray for you, you can just say, "Talk."

962
00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:40,500
 And someone will reach out, pray with, talk with, do anything that we can to help.

963
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:47,300
 Finally, dealing with it patiently, that healing takes time.

964
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:54,060
 We live in a microwave world with Instacart, Instagram, Uber Eats, and Insta everything,

965
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:56,980
 and microwave.

966
00:49:56,980 --> 00:50:01,060
 And I wish there was a one-stop shop because I know my heart breaks.

967
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:02,780
 You don't want to be depressed.

968
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:03,940
 You didn't ask for it.

969
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:05,820
 You can't even fully explain it.

970
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:12,500
 And if there was a button you could push, you would push it.

971
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:15,980
 And we don't just wait spirit, or we don't just combat it physically and spiritually

972
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:17,680
 and communally.

973
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:23,860
 We also do it patiently with the hope of eternity coming.

974
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:25,260
 Jesus is a great healer.

975
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:28,420
 He's called that in the Bible.

976
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:31,260
 And you can bring those things to Him and call out to Him in prayer and ask Him to take

977
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:32,260
 it away.

978
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:36,340
 I wish I could promise that He always does or He always will, but I can't.

979
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:39,300
 I do know that He's promised everything.

980
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:44,060
 Romans 8 tells us He will work together for good.

981
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:45,340
 Everything.

982
00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:46,340
 That means anxiety.

983
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:47,340
 That means depression.

984
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:48,340
 That means everything.

985
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:54,860
 And in the meantime, He's saying, "You can trust Me, and you can have hope."

986
00:50:54,860 --> 00:51:02,220
 And hope is one of those things that in the midst of your depressed, hope is one of the

987
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:04,260
 few things that can help pull you out of that depression.

988
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:06,220
 Like your story is not done.

989
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:13,100
 And in fact, Paul says, "Man, do you know as Christians, because of the hope that we

990
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:17,220
 have of eternity, it puts everything that we face in this life into perspective.

991
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:22,860
 We can handle it because it's not worth comparing as painful and as hard and as sad and as overwhelming

992
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:24,660
 and as broken as things feel."

993
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:31,700
 Paul would say, "It's not even worth comparing to what awaits us in eternity."

994
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:35,900
 Like it feels really big right now, but that's just because of what you're comparing it to.

995
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:37,380
 Like it's like this.

996
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:42,580
 The best illustration I could think of early today.

997
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:44,420
 Like this is a box.

998
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:48,820
 And if I was to say like, "Is this a big box?"

999
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:51,420
 Most people would probably say, "Oh, no."

1000
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:55,740
 Unless I was like, "Well, it really depends on what you compare it to."

1001
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:57,340
 Compared to a nickel, it's a pretty big box.

1002
00:51:58,020 --> 00:52:00,620
 If I was going to put a wedding ring in it, it'd be like, "Well, that's a little bit of

1003
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:01,620
 a big box."

1004
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:05,220
 It really depends on what you're comparing it to.

1005
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:12,660
 When you take it over here and you compare it to this, it's clearly not a big box.

1006
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:16,980
 The apostle Paul says, "In light of what awaits us in eternity," and it feels huge to you.

1007
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:18,580
 It feels like, "Man, this is so big.

1008
00:52:18,580 --> 00:52:19,580
 It's so out of control.

1009
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:21,180
 It's so like, this is my life.

1010
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:22,180
 This is my pain.

1011
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:23,180
 This is my depression right now."

1012
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:27,740
 He says, "Hey, in light of eternity and what awaits us, as big as whatever it is feels

1013
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:30,260
 to you right now.

1014
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:35,380
 It doesn't even compare to what lays ahead for you and me and as big as it feels."

1015
00:52:35,380 --> 00:52:44,980
 He says this in Romans 8, verse 17, "I consider the present sufferings are not worth comparing

1016
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:48,380
 to the glory that will be revealed in us."

1017
00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:58,420
 He says, "Man, as big and as hard and as difficult and as painful as it is, as much as it feels

1018
00:52:58,420 --> 00:53:02,900
 like it's consumed life," he says, "Man, it's not even worth comparing towards what's going

1019
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:07,180
 to happen for all of eternity, whatever is in front of you, or I'm sorry, what is in

1020
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:12,700
 front of all of us as believers, forever and ever and ever with God in perfect paradise

1021
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:16,580
 where no depression will ever exist because God's going to heal it either in this life

1022
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:19,980
 or the next and it's not even as big as it is worth comparing because there's something

1023
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:21,660
 way bigger that puts it in perspective."

1024
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:30,420
 In conclusion, you've got to get to the cure of whatever is behind that or the cause of

1025
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:33,580
 whatever is behind that.

1026
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:36,820
 Depression.

1027
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:44,460
 And then we combat day after day after day until Christ ultimately heals it.

1028
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:49,340
 Sometimes it happens in this life, sometimes in the next.

1029
00:53:49,340 --> 00:53:52,060
 My heart breaks just in studying this.

1030
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:57,780
 I told somebody it felt like I was going into Heath Ledger and the Joker of just, "Man,

1031
00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:01,780
 my heart breaks for so many people who are walking through depression and they can't

1032
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:08,420
 explain it and they don't want it and they feel so alone, they feel unknown, they feel

1033
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:12,740
 hopeless."

1034
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:17,180
 And I know as much as my heart breaks for people that are listening, I know there are

1035
00:54:17,180 --> 00:54:25,020
 thousands that will hear this message who are in that place right now.

1036
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:29,340
 As much as my heart breaks, here's something I know to be far much more true.

1037
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:33,620
 Christ, Jesus' heart breaks.

1038
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:36,180
 He knows the pain that you're walking through, He knows everything that you're facing, He

1039
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:41,020
 knows how overwhelmed that you feel and He cares about you far more than I do or anybody

1040
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:45,380
 does or even you care about yourself and not just that.

1041
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:50,740
 He also is someone who is well acquainted with sadness and depressing feelings and thoughts

1042
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:52,060
 while He lived on this planet.

1043
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:56,180
 Like if you read the story of Jesus, you'll discover He lived a really, really hard life.

1044
00:54:56,180 --> 00:54:59,660
 He didn't have a home, He had people, He had friends that betrayed Him.

1045
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:02,360
 He walked through this life in incredibly painful fashion.

1046
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:06,540
 And the Scripture tells us in Isaiah chapter 53, here's how it describes the Son of God

1047
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:10,140
 when He lived on the planet.

1048
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:13,500
 He was despised and rejected.

1049
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:21,700
 He was a man of sorrows, acquainted with the deepest grief.

1050
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:25,500
 In the garden of Gethsemane, hours before He would go to be crucified on a cross, He's

1051
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:30,180
 sitting there and He's praying with His closest friends and He says, "My soul is crushed."

1052
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:32,140
 Mark chapter 14, verse 34.

1053
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:39,780
 My soul feels crushed to the point of death with grief.

1054
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:44,300
 God didn't just care about you and love you and no, Hebrews chapter 4 tells us He is a

1055
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:49,460
 merciful high priest who walked through and had an incredibly painful life.

1056
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:50,800
 He's not immune to the pain.

1057
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:52,060
 He knows what you feel.

1058
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:56,200
 And in that same section, Hebrews chapter 4, it says because of that, we have a merciful

1059
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:59,780
 high priest that when you and I go to Him and we are filled with sadness and we're filled

1060
00:55:59,780 --> 00:56:06,500
 with despair and we don't know what to do, He's a priest that is merciful to our weaknesses.

1061
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:07,500
 You're not alone.

1062
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:08,500
 God is not done.

1063
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:09,500
 You've got to get up.

1064
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:10,780
 Your life is not over.

1065
00:56:10,780 --> 00:56:11,980
 You should not end it.

1066
00:56:11,980 --> 00:56:13,220
 God is not done with you.

1067
00:56:13,220 --> 00:56:15,380
 There are plans He has for you.

1068
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:17,820
 And you don't have to get into that.

1069
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:21,100
 There is hope and you can find hope in whatever you're facing.

1070
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:23,860
 Does not compare to what awaits you in all of eternity.

1071
00:56:23,860 --> 00:56:31,700
 And that same God who experienced the deepest level of grief would later go die on a cross

1072
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:35,680
 to defeat the depression inside of your life, to defeat depression inside of our world and

1073
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:40,540
 He rose from the grave three days later proving our hope is alive, He's alive, depression

1074
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:42,740
 is on an expiration date.

1075
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:44,980
 Death has been defeated and it's not over.

1076
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:46,340
 And you've got to listen to me.

1077
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:48,940
 You've got to listen to me.

1078
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:53,260
 He's not done with you.

1079
00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:54,340
 Depression has been defeated.

1080
00:56:54,340 --> 00:56:57,980
 I'm not saying it will always be easy in your life, but God is not done.

1081
00:56:57,980 --> 00:56:58,980
 You could get up.

1082
00:56:58,980 --> 00:56:59,980
 You've got to get up.

1083
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:01,940
 You've got to start taking those steps.

1084
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:03,840
 He's not done with you.

1085
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:05,140
 He defeated it on the cross.

1086
00:57:05,140 --> 00:57:07,900
 He'll ultimately do away with it in all of eternity.

1087
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:12,380
 And the hope that we have puts into perspective the pain that you're walking through.

1088
00:57:12,380 --> 00:57:15,420
 Because we have a living Savior.

1089
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:17,140
 That means we have a living hope.

1090
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:27,980
 Hope is the one thing that in the darkness without, things only get worse.

1091
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:28,980
 It's not done.

1092
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:34,580
 And if you're a Christian, He died on that cross for everything you've ever done.

1093
00:57:34,580 --> 00:57:39,040
 And He's set on the calendar.

1094
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:41,860
 This is when depression expires.

1095
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:47,580
 I don't know when that day will be, but I know it will not plague His people forever.

1096
00:57:47,580 --> 00:57:49,660
 And no, sorrow lasts for the night.

1097
00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:53,380
 Joy is coming with the morning and our King when He returns.

1098
00:57:53,380 --> 00:58:00,580
 And in the meantime, we combat, find the cause, and we fight and we walk together.

1099
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:07,580
 Let me pray.

1100
00:58:07,580 --> 00:58:16,940
 Father, I know that there are people listening who have a sibling who is depressed, who have

1101
00:58:16,940 --> 00:58:22,980
 a parent or a grandparent who is depressed, who knows someone who has taken their own

1102
00:58:22,980 --> 00:58:27,820
 life, who have wrestled with thoughts of taking their life, who have found themselves in a

1103
00:58:27,820 --> 00:58:31,380
 darkness where they feel like darkness is their only friend.

1104
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:32,540
 There is no light around them.

1105
00:58:32,540 --> 00:58:33,700
 They can't see what you're doing.

1106
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:37,900
 And so I pray, God, right now, you would be bigger than the pain, bigger than the sorrow,

1107
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:39,140
 bigger than the sadness.

1108
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:42,620
 You would break through and flood the darkness with your light.

1109
00:58:42,620 --> 00:58:47,500
 They would feel at a soul level, your Spirit, you're not done with them.

1110
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:48,980
 It's not over.

1111
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:49,980
 There's hope.

1112
00:58:49,980 --> 00:58:54,860
 A hope that doesn't fail and a hope that is alive.

1113
00:58:54,860 --> 00:58:55,940
 And you don't cast them away.

1114
00:58:55,940 --> 00:58:57,300
 You have mercy towards them.

1115
00:58:57,300 --> 00:59:02,420
 You felt pain and deepest grief on this life.

1116
00:59:02,420 --> 00:59:03,500
 And they can bring their sorrows.

1117
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:04,500
 They can bring their depression.

1118
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:08,220
 They can bring all of that because your name is above all of it.

1119
00:59:08,220 --> 00:59:11,980
 And like a four-year-old child in the midst of a storm, we can shout knowing your name

1120
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:18,460
 has defeated and will defeat and will ultimately has done away with and is ending depression.

1121
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:20,540
 And I pray that would happen in the lives of people.

1122
00:59:20,540 --> 00:59:24,660
 Would we hold on if the story you write is different than that and hold on to hope, a

1123
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:25,660
 hope that's alive.

1124
00:59:25,660 --> 00:59:26,580
 In Christ's name, amen.

1125
00:59:26,580 --> 00:59:36,580
