[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:18.580]   - All right, well welcome friends in the room,
[00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.100]   friends in Fort Worth, Houston, El Paso, Phoenix,
[00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.740]   Cedar Rapids, Fayetteville, Arkansas, Philadelphia.
[00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.740]   Hey, let me get this out of the way.
[00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:28.940]   I'm sitting on a chair.
[00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.900]   I woke up this morning and I felt great.
[00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.800]   Super excited last portion of the year.
[00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.700]   Got to work, which is here,
[00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.520]   and started throwing up for the last 12 hours.
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.620]   So I went and got an IV drip
[00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.240]   and was hoping that would work.
[00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.940]   So tonight could be interesting or short,
[00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.880]   but I did not wanna miss out on the last thing of the year.
[00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.800]   And I think God has something really fun
[00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:53.860]   and really in store for us.
[00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.340]   We know that 2 Corinthians chapter 12, thank you,
[00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:58.980]   verse nine and 10 says that his power
[00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.060]   is made perfect in weakness.
[00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.680]   And so if anything, this is just a discomfortable advantage
[00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.700]   in God speaking and showing up here tonight.
[00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.780]   We know there's an enemy who hates the passage
[00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:10.600]   that I'm about to read,
[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.400]   who hates just what's taking place in this room.
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.900]   But at the same time, if you see me dash off for side stage,
[00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.740]   I'll call somebody up here and we'll just keep worshiping.
[00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.940]   So hey, I'm gonna read in Matthew chapter one.
[00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.580]   As we wrap up this series, bloodline,
[00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:25.940]   Matthew chapter one, if you have a Bible,
[00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.780]   you can flip open to Matthew chapter one.
[00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:28.620]   I'm gonna start in verse one.
[00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.220]   If you don't have it, it'll be up on the screen.
[00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.220]   And we are gonna look at the final week
[00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.900]   of the bloodline of Jesus, where it says this, verse one.
[00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.340]   This is a record or a genealogy
[00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.060]   of the ancestors of Jesus, the Messiah,

[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.400]   and I don't think I've ever asked you to do this,
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.420]   but just for me to be clear, for this to come out,
[00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.680]   and for God to minister to all of us
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.040]   as we unpack some incredible truths
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.360]   from the line, the bloodline of Jesus.
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.880]   So I'm gonna give you a second, just where you're at,
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.040]   pray that God speak to you, and pray that,
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.880]   man, just health, selfishly,
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:10.880]   I'd love you to just say a prayer
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.720]   that I'd be able to get through this.
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.320]   And so I'll give you a second and pray there,
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.280]   and then I'll pray.
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.440]   (silence)
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:31.760]   Father, I thank you for every person in this room.
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:32.720]   I thank you for just the work
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.720]   that you're doing in their life,
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.040]   that you wanna do in their life.
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.640]   The finished work that you did on the cross
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.840]   for them and for their life.
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.640]   As we talk about the bloodline of our Savior,
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:48.200]   our Messiah, Jesus, our King,
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.240]   would you just illumine our minds
[00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.440]   to the incredible people that you instructed Matthew
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.520]   to include in the story,
[00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.360]   in the story it tells us about our story.
[00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.460]   We love you, amen.
[00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:07.100]   So what I have up here is a Christmas tree.
[00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.280]   And it is not just any Christmas tree,
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.080]   there's a lot of Christmas trees all throughout Watermark
[00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.340]   as they kinda get ready for the holidays.
[00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.040]   This is a real Christmas tree.
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.280]   By show of hands, who in this room grew up
[00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.560]   and you had a real Christmas tree, that's what you did,
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.040]   you didn't play that fake game,
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.120]   you had a real Christmas tree.
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.640]   Just raise 'em high, even the guys, it's okay.
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.060]   And yeah, okay.
[00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.640]   Who had, there's like different levels.
[00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.520]   Who was in a family, was anyone in a family
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.600]   where you guys, every time the holidays came around,
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:34.720]   you didn't just go to Home Depot
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.020]   and buy the real Christmas tree.
[00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:37.840]   You guys went like camping.
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.440]   And you went out and you found that tree
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:40.760]   and you chopped it down yourself,
[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:41.940]   and this was a part of your family tradition.
[00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:43.560]   Anyone in here?
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.680]   See, yeah, there you go.
[00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.840]   Man, if you were a lady, your dad just set the bar
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.600]   so high for the fellas in here.
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.000]   'Cause that is manly.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.240]   Who had a real Christmas tree,
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.200]   but it was what I would call the frosted mini-wheats
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.400]   version of a Christmas tree,
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.400]   where it was like white on the outside
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.960]   as though you lived in Vermont.
[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:02.600]   Anybody have that?
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.240]   Okay, there's like a couple of you.
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.160]   Always confused by that one.
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.520]   Because even in Vermont, where the trees do get snow
[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.780]   on that, no one has a tree like that inside of their house.
[00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:13.440]   I'm not exactly sure why,
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:14.660]   but there's like a cult following.
[00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:15.880]   There's like a group that does that.
[00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.640]   All right, so there's all the live Christmas,
[00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:19.840]   or the real Christmas trees.
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.480]   Who in this room had a fake Christmas tree growing up?
[00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.480]   You think it's irresponsible.
[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.240]   Yeah, you were in the majority.
[00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.320]   In fact, there's like 80 plus percent of Americans
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.440]   that do not do the real tree anymore.
[00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:34.040]   That a vast majority of people do the fake tree.
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.120]   I, and my family, we do the real tree
[00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.280]   because we're Christians.
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.880]   And so, I'm just kidding, good grief, I'm sick.
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.280]   I'm gonna blame everything on the sickness, save the email.
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.300]   We do a real tree.
[00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:47.420]   So we go out, and this is actually a real tree.
[00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:49.720]   And sometimes people will call a real tree
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:50.560]   something that it's not.
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:51.800]   And they'll say, "Hey, do you do a live tree?"
[00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.000]   This happened this past week.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   "Hey, do you do a live tree or a fake tree?"
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   And people unknowingly kind of just slip of the tongue,
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:58.840]   it happens.
[00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:01.500]   But one thing that is very clear about this tree,
[00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:04.640]   despite the fact that it is a real Christmas tree,
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.120]   it is not alive.
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:08.680]   The moment that it was separated from its root system
[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:10.380]   at whatever farm out there,
[00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:12.620]   these guys' manly dad chopped it down,
[00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:14.560]   it was dead.
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:17.160]   And it is no longer alive.
[00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.560]   And it kind of goes without saying,
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:19.400]   like, "Why are you telling us this?"
[00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.320]   It can appear on the outside.
[00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:22.520]   If you look at it, you may go like,
[00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.000]   "Oh, maybe that thing could be alive.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.240]   "If I saw it outside and I didn't know
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:27.880]   "what was at the base, I could be like,
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.380]   "oh, I think that thing is alive."
[00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:31.280]   But when you get close to it,
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:32.840]   you realize it's been chopped off.
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:34.660]   It's, without question, dead,
[00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:36.500]   despite the fact that on the outside,
[00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:38.660]   it still looks very close to what it did
[00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:40.020]   when it was alive.
[00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:40.860]   What does it have to do
[00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:42.280]   with what we're talking about tonight?
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:45.180]   The Bible says that when sin entered the world,
[00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:49.280]   everything was placed underneath the curse of death.
[00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:51.340]   If you've ever read the Bible and you hear verses like,
[00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:53.160]   man, and death entered and everything died
[00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:54.920]   and everything's been dead ever since,
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:56.840]   and you look at it, you can find yourself,
[00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:57.800]   or I can find myself going like,
[00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:59.320]   "Everything died?
[00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:00.540]   "Really?
[00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:02.480]   "Everything was broken and put under the curse of death?"
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:05.200]   Like, I know lots of people, they look very much alive.
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:07.120]   I got, you know, a dog looks very much alive.
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:08.660]   Trees in the backyard look very much alive.
[00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:10.420]   Everything was put underneath the curse of death
[00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:11.940]   in the same way.
[00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:14.740]   Then it's hard to tell right now, is this alive or dead?
[00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:16.800]   The longer time goes on,
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:19.280]   like when we get to January 1st or January 2nd,
[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:20.700]   this thing will not look like this anymore.
[00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:22.540]   It's gonna look like droopy all the way down
[00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:23.780]   and any ornaments that were a part of it
[00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:25.180]   are totally pulling it down.
[00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:26.500]   These are just gonna fall off
[00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:28.000]   and it'll be increasingly clear,
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.060]   oh, that thing has been, it was dead.
[00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:30.980]   It is dead.
[00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:33.260]   And it's clear to see it's dead.
[00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:34.100]   So it is in this life.
[00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:34.920]   But the Bible says,
[00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:37.060]   "Everything placed under the curse of sin."
[00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:39.080]   And in a moment, you may go like,
[00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:41.500]   really, is everything underneath the curse of sin,
[00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:43.380]   which means the curse of death,
[00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:44.740]   it kinda can seem like it's alive.
[00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:46.560]   And then the longer and older you get,
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:47.980]   you just bump into realities
[00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:49.600]   that are a part of our broken world
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:53.140]   that are reminders of everything is underneath the fall.
[00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:55.580]   Whatever dog you have, your dog ends up dying.
[00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:58.580]   Whatever person or family you're a part of,
[00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:00.140]   you are going to bury your parents
[00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:02.260]   or they're gonna bury you.
[00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:03.180]   Whoever you marry someday,
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.800]   you're gonna bury them or they're going to bury you,
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:06.640]   most likely.
[00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:11.000]   That you just intersect and we're confronted with the fact
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.540]   that this world is broken and not as it should be.
[00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:18.420]   And when you try to come up with a solution or a remedy,
[00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:20.320]   I'm like, how do I reconcile that?
[00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:21.640]   And what does that tell me?
[00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:24.000]   And what's a worldview that I should approach that with?
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.160]   There's a lot of different ways
[00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:27.440]   that you could think about addressing the brokenness of sin
[00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:29.760]   and the reality of things like greed and murder
[00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:33.000]   and school shootings and just tragic things, cancer.
[00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:35.820]   Things that if you were creating a world,
[00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:37.300]   you would never come up with.
[00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:39.340]   And the Bible gives a solution.
[00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:41.660]   It gives both the answers to why those things exist.
[00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:42.660]   We've covered that in the series,
[00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:45.680]   but it also does what no other religion does,
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:49.180]   provides a solution for the remedy of those things.
[00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:52.080]   And that remedy came in the person of Jesus.
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.460]   We're about to celebrate Christmas.
[00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:55.340]   Altogether, you're gonna see tons of different things
[00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:56.580]   that kind of fill the streets
[00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:59.420]   and fill different legacy strip malls
[00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:00.820]   and different lights that all celebrate
[00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:01.660]   this Christmas time.
[00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:04.280]   But this Christmas was God bringing about
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:07.480]   and introducing to the world the remedy
[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:10.000]   for the brokenness that is here.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.400]   So as we walk through some of the things
[00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:14.880]   that are in Jesus' genealogy,
[00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:16.600]   I just wanna pull out three really fast things.
[00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:18.920]   It's gonna be a shorter message tonight.
[00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:20.700]   But I think they answer some of the biggest questions
[00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:23.880]   that not only every other world religion fails to answer,
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:27.180]   because they all claim that you can fix the problems
[00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:29.440]   in our world if you just try harder,
[00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:30.680]   or you can have a relationship with God
[00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:31.760]   if you just do enough good things.
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:33.940]   Christianity doesn't claim that.
[00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:35.760]   It claims something entirely different.
[00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:37.460]   So I'm gonna start and just highlight some of the verses
[00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:41.840]   back in verse one of chapter one and point them out.
[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:44.080]   'Cause a lot of times when I read genealogies,
[00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:45.840]   it's like, what in the world?
[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:50.840]   Skip, move on, until you have enough time and space
[00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:54.280]   to study it and really evaluate what is being said
[00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:57.120]   and why does Matthew include the things that he does here?
[00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:58.460]   Genealogies in the ancient time,
[00:10:58.460 --> 00:10:59.300]   here's what they would have been.
[00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:00.120]   They were a big deal.
[00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:00.960]   It was like a resume.
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.160]   So not a really big deal to us.
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:03.480]   You got ancestor.com.
[00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:04.680]   You show up at your job and you're like,
[00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:05.520]   look at all these people.
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:07.360]   They're like, we don't care, get your job done.
[00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:09.600]   But in this time, it was a really big deal
[00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:10.540]   to have a genealogy.
[00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:14.320]   Only kings or people of great esteem would have a genealogy.
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:15.400]   And inside of the genealogy,
[00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:17.920]   you would often include very intentionally
[00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:20.440]   not some of the worst parts of your family past.
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:22.760]   You would conveniently skip over those.
[00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:23.760]   If you read like Caesars,
[00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:25.160]   you remember some of the ancient kings,
[00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:26.960]   they have genealogies and they would like skip
[00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:28.080]   hundreds of years.
[00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:29.280]   Where you're like, I'm pretty sure
[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:30.960]   there was something that happened there.
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:32.720]   But they would skip them 'cause they didn't want to include
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:33.920]   some of the worst parts of their story.
[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:37.120]   And they would include the best parts of the story always.
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:40.540]   But Matthew's genealogy is incredibly different from that.
[00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:42.600]   So in verse one, I'll highlight just the first idea
[00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:45.680]   just really quickly, the fastest of all three.
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:50.640]   It says this, this is a record of the ancestors of Jesus,
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:54.460]   the Messiah, a descendant of David and of Abraham.
[00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:58.080]   The word Messiah means deliverer.
[00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:00.960]   This is a record of Jesus,
[00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:03.280]   the deliverer that God would send to this world.
[00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:05.720]   It means the anointed deliverer that God would raise up.
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:07.760]   Do you know what the word Jesus means?
[00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.560]   God saves.
[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:10.800]   Even the name and the words Jesus,
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.880]   hey, Jesus, the Messiah are almost redundant.
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:14.800]   Matthew is driving home and the title
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:17.440]   and even the name that Jesus is given,
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:19.000]   the word Jesus is the word Yeshua,
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.280]   which means God is salvation.
[00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:23.560]   God is the one who saves.
[00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:25.840]   The solution that God introduced into the world
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:27.400]   was not some religious experience
[00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:28.940]   or some list of do's and don'ts.
[00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:31.560]   It was a solution that you and I need a savior.
[00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:34.200]   Christianity does not express that good people go to heaven,
[00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.760]   bad people go to hell, so just try to do good things.
[00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:40.240]   It expresses that everyone that ever lived and lives
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:42.920]   and is alive is a messed up person
[00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:45.200]   who doesn't deserve to have a relationship with God.
[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:46.540]   But there's a savior that showed up
[00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:48.540]   and he gives forgiveness to anyone
[00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:52.560]   who will just by faith receive it.
[00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:54.640]   It doesn't teach that good people go to heaven,
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:55.620]   bad people go to hell.
[00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:58.760]   It teaches saved or forgiven people go to heaven
[00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:01.400]   and the only way to get forgiveness
[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:04.080]   is through Jesus and what he did.
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:06.480]   God sent a savior, which is distinctly radically different
[00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:07.440]   and you may not be a Christian
[00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:08.700]   'cause a lot of times holidays,
[00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:10.900]   just different people will show up
[00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:12.880]   or there'll be a part of nights like tonight
[00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:13.860]   where you may have walked in here
[00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:14.800]   and you don't have a Christian faith,
[00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:15.640]   you don't have any faith,
[00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:17.340]   you're just figuring this whole thing out.
[00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:18.560]   One thing that is abundantly clear
[00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:20.440]   if you do any amount of study
[00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:22.760]   as it relates to the major world religions,
[00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:25.780]   Christianity is in a category all by itself.
[00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:27.000]   All the other world religions are,
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.080]   hey, do these five things,
[00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:29.100]   you need to pray five times a day,
[00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:30.020]   here's the different pillars,
[00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:31.200]   here's the things God wants,
[00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:32.340]   gotta make sure you're circumcised,
[00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:33.740]   there's a covenant relationship that God has.
[00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:35.740]   You go through Buddhism, Islam, Muslim,
[00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:37.820]   or I'm sorry, Islam, which is Muslims.
[00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:40.880]   You go through any of the major world religions, Hinduism,
[00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:45.460]   none of them put forward the picture that Jesus does.
[00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:47.380]   Everybody's messed up.
[00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:51.060]   And the good news is I came to be God who saves.
[00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:52.960]   That's what Jesus means.
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:54.240]   God who delivers.
[00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:55.860]   So that verse reads,
[00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:58.760]   the beginning genealogy of the God who saves,
[00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:00.020]   who delivers his people.
[00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:02.180]   Second idea I wanna pull out
[00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:04.580]   comes from the people that Jesus included.
[00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:07.560]   Not only did Jesus include some of the worst parts,
[00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:12.560]   he included something very unusual, which was women.
[00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:15.940]   At that time, it was a patriarchal society
[00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:19.400]   and you would not include women in the genealogy
[00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:21.700]   because the bloodline and rights and estate
[00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:23.060]   passed through the men.
[00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:24.620]   And Matthew doesn't just include women,
[00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:27.840]   he goes out of his way to include specific women.
[00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:29.440]   So let me read the verses again.
[00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:37.320]   Jacob was the father of Judah and his brothers.
[00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:38.240]   This is verse two.
[00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:40.840]   Why did he include that phrase?
[00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:41.680]   I just wanna highlight,
[00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:42.780]   like some of the stuff Matthew does here
[00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:44.040]   is very intentional.
[00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:45.120]   He's communicating a message
[00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:46.940]   and I'm gonna explain what I mean by that in a second.
[00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:48.400]   But this is the first one,
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:50.060]   as it relates to Jesus's family tree,
[00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:53.120]   he goes in and says, "Hey, you know who God chose?
[00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:55.140]   "Judah was one of 12 brothers."
[00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:56.540]   He had 12 brothers, 11 others,
[00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:58.520]   or I'm sorry, 11 brothers and then there's Judah.
[00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:00.980]   And all of them, some of them were not so bad,
[00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:02.540]   some of them were not good at all.
[00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:05.100]   And then there was one really good guy named Joseph.
[00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:07.180]   And Jesus, or God, when it came to,
[00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:09.500]   here's who the blood, the savior of the world
[00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:10.340]   is gonna come through.
[00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:13.080]   He's the superhero of the Bible, Jesus.
[00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:14.420]   And God looked down and he chose,
[00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:15.980]   out of all the 12 brothers
[00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:17.260]   that were the grandchildren of Abraham,
[00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:18.700]   who am I gonna choose?
[00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:19.660]   And he chose Judah.
[00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:22.620]   What do we know about Judah?
[00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:23.500]   Judah had a couple things.
[00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:24.940]   If you were to look at his life,
[00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:27.060]   Judah, there was a time where his brothers came around
[00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:28.060]   and there's 12 of them.
[00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:29.940]   And remember I said Joseph was kind of like the favorite,
[00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:30.780]   he was dad's favorite,
[00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:32.680]   he was the kid who got straight A's in school,
[00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:34.780]   he was like the star of the community.
[00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:36.460]   And his brothers hated him for it.
[00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:38.660]   And one day, they were like, "Hey, we should kill him.
[00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:40.940]   "He's dad's favorite, I'm so done with him."
[00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:43.520]   And one of the brothers says, "No, let's not kill him,
[00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:45.820]   "let's sell him as a slave."
[00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:47.420]   And so they take their brother,
[00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:48.460]   they throw him in a pit,
[00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:49.860]   and they sell him as a slave.
[00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:53.180]   And Judah and his brothers go and they kill a lamb
[00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:54.500]   and they take his brother's jacket
[00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:56.060]   and they rub it in his blood
[00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:57.980]   and they bring it back to their dad.
[00:15:57.980 --> 00:15:59.940]   And they say, "Joseph is dead."
[00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:05.400]   And for 20 years, they carried that lie.
[00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:09.260]   20 years Judah carried that lie.
[00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:11.260]   Who makes up the family tree of Jesus?
[00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:12.100]   Liars.
[00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:14.740]   If that wasn't bad enough,
[00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:16.220]   you look at the next passage
[00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:17.140]   or the next verse that's in there
[00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:19.960]   where it talks about Judah's kids.
[00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:21.860]   And I don't know if you caught this, but it says this.
[00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:25.000]   "Judah was the father of Perez and Zerah,
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.940]   "whose mother was Tamar."
[00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:29.340]   This is one of the more shocking, crazy stories,
[00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:30.920]   I'm talking like Game of Thrones stories
[00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:31.760]   in the Old Testament.
[00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:32.580]   Here's what happened.
[00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:34.020]   So Judah, he's got some sons,
[00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:37.180]   he was married and he had these three boys
[00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:38.660]   and eventually his wife dies,
[00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:39.980]   but he's still got these three kids.
[00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:42.660]   His kids grow up, one of them's named Er, E-R,
[00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:44.700]   and he decides, "Hey, I'm gonna get this boy
[00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:45.540]   "as my wife."
[00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:47.140]   So he goes out, he gets Tamar.
[00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:48.620]   Tamar and Er get married.
[00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:50.900]   Er, we're told, was also not a good guy
[00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:53.020]   and so wicked that it just says God killed him.
[00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:54.940]   So, you know, there you go, there's food for thought.
[00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:56.660]   He was so wicked that God put an end to him.
[00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:58.100]   And, you know, it's what you do.
[00:16:58.100 --> 00:16:59.700]   He made you, you can do that.
[00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:02.900]   So anyways, in that culture,
[00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:06.860]   the brother would then marry the wife of his person.
[00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:08.220]   I know that's crazy and weird
[00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:09.680]   and really uncomfortable to think about,
[00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:11.100]   but that was just normal at that time.
[00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:12.460]   And Abraham went and basically said,
[00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:14.460]   "Hey, I'm not gonna give you my son,
[00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:17.160]   "but someday when my other son gets old enough,
[00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:18.100]   "you know, I'll come back
[00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:19.420]   "and we're gonna get you married, Tamar."
[00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:21.100]   And Tamar's going like, "Who's gonna provide for me?"
[00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:22.600]   And he was like, "Just go back and live with your family
[00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:23.980]   "and your parents and I'll come get you
[00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:26.620]   "whenever my youngest son gets of age."
[00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:28.300]   Again, it's so creepy and weird to think about,
[00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:29.800]   but that was the story.
[00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:30.980]   And Tamar's over there living life
[00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:31.820]   and she's with her parents.
[00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:32.660]   She's like, "Yeah, I'm here.
[00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:34.160]   "Abe's gonna come get me whenever things,
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:37.700]   "when the young boy gets of age."
[00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:38.860]   And it never happens.
[00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:42.340]   And so she's left and he gives that other child away
[00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:43.620]   and he gets married.
[00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:44.980]   And she's left going, "What do I do?"
[00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:47.660]   So she dresses up as a prostitute
[00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:49.640]   and she goes up on the road.
[00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:54.640]   She knows that Judah was out and he was in heat
[00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:58.720]   and she posed on the side of the road as a prostitute.
[00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:01.200]   She totally veiled herself and Judah goes
[00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:04.220]   and he has sex with his daughter-in-law,
[00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:06.460]   whose husband was dead, his wife was dead.
[00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:08.480]   Doesn't make it any less creepy.
[00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:10.880]   In his defense, she was dressed as a prostitute,
[00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:12.580]   but whenever your defense includes,
[00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:14.100]   well, she was dressed as a prostitute.
[00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:16.740]   It's not a great defense to stand on.
[00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:17.580]   And time goes on.
[00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:18.900]   In three months, we're told to go by
[00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:22.880]   and she's pregnant with her father-in-law's baby.
[00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:23.900]   Babies.
[00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:26.460]   And Judah, before he knew it was his babies,
[00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:28.040]   he finds out that, "Hey, your daughter-in-law
[00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:29.620]   "has been sleeping around unfaithful."
[00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:31.800]   And he's like, "We need to bring her into the city square
[00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:33.080]   "and burn her alive."
[00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:34.620]   That's what he responds with.
[00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:36.260]   And then she shows up and says,
[00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:39.140]   "Hey, with the man whose staff I took
[00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:41.420]   "whenever we were sleeping together,
[00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:43.140]   "this is the father of the children."
[00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:45.400]   And Abraham realized, "That's my staff.
[00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:48.720]   "Oh no, I'm in trouble and everything's fine.
[00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:50.820]   "We'll get a game plan in place."
[00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:52.600]   But this was the person.
[00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:54.860]   So not only do you have that added, you got incest.
[00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:56.240]   In the family line, this was one of the more
[00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:59.360]   uncomfortable, scandalous parts of the line of Jesus.
[00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:01.220]   So when you look at who's up in a part
[00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:03.780]   of the family tree of Jesus,
[00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:07.280]   you got a liar, you got an incest, what happens next?
[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:11.000]   We're told that Salmon was the father of Boaz,
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.920]   whose mother was Rahab.
[00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:16.700]   Rahab had a stigma and a nickname attached to her.
[00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:18.040]   Anybody know what Rahab, if you grew up
[00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:19.620]   in Sunday school like me, you know this.
[00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:20.940]   You saw it on the felt board.
[00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:23.600]   And it was Rahab the prostitute.
[00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:27.580]   She wasn't just a prostitute, she was a foreign,
[00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:30.080]   a Canaanite, which basically was a big deal back then,
[00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:33.020]   that the Jewish mindset was, "Hey, God loves the Jews
[00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:34.120]   "and he's really focused about us,
[00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:35.760]   "and give me a J, give me an E, give me a W."
[00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:37.160]   That's who God is all about.
[00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:39.640]   And so to have a foreigner was not a great thing,
[00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:42.620]   but let alone a foreigner who is a prostitute.
[00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:45.140]   If you read the story of Jesus,
[00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:47.260]   or sorry, the story of Joshua,
[00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:49.720]   that Rahab was this prostitute in this foreign city
[00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:52.060]   that God just showed favor on.
[00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:54.540]   And not just favor in that he allowed her to live,
[00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:55.680]   you can go read the story later,
[00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:57.100]   favor in that he said, "She is gonna be
[00:19:57.100 --> 00:20:00.820]   "the great-great-great-great-grandma of Jesus,
[00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:02.040]   "the Savior of the world."
[00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:02.880]   Let me hit pause.
[00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:04.480]   Think about that.
[00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:06.200]   If you were Matthew and you're writing this,
[00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:07.340]   and you're going out of your way
[00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:09.140]   to include Rahab, the prostitute,
[00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:10.260]   I mean, think about how uncomfortable.
[00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:12.540]   How uncomfortable would you be if this Thanksgiving,
[00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:13.740]   maybe some of you guys are dating,
[00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:14.820]   you're going over to their house,
[00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:15.740]   you're gonna go meet the family,
[00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:17.700]   it's gonna be really, you know, it's a big deal,
[00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:18.760]   and here we go, we're meeting the family,
[00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:20.180]   and while you're hanging out,
[00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:22.160]   the family pulls out the family lineage book
[00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:23.860]   and some pictures of grandma and great-grandma
[00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:25.300]   and all the different stuff, and you're going through it,
[00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:26.580]   and they go out of their way to highlight,
[00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:29.940]   like, "Oh, and this is Beverly, she was the prostitute.
[00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:32.380]   "She was, she wasn't just any prostitute,
[00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:33.520]   "she was good at what she did.
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:35.940]   "I mean, she made it rain, okay?"
[00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:40.940]   And you would go, "Okay, I'm so uncomfortable right now,
[00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:42.340]   "and I don't know if he's weird
[00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:44.520]   "or if just everyone here is weird."
[00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:47.500]   That's what Matthew's doing.
[00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:49.240]   He's going out of his way to say,
[00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:52.460]   "You remember Rahab, prostitute."
[00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:53.300]   That was grammar.
[00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:55.140]   That's who's a part of Jesus's family tree.
[00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:57.160]   So just add prostitution to the list.
[00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:00.100]   And then last week, we covered the story of David,
[00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:02.620]   and I, dude, the shade that Matthew throws at David
[00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:04.500]   in this moment is tremendous,
[00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:06.940]   'cause look, but he's doing it intentionally.
[00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:10.480]   He said this, "David was the father of Solomon,
[00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:15.900]   "whose mother had been Bathsheba, the widow of Uriah."
[00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:18.260]   Matthew, why are you bringing up
[00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:19.460]   former marriages right now?
[00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:21.100]   Why would you feel like you need to introduce that?
[00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:21.940]   If you were here last week,
[00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:24.340]   you heard that David had the moment in his life
[00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:26.120]   that was the worst moment of his life,
[00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:28.620]   where he decided, after going out on the rooftop,
[00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:30.380]   being in a place he shouldn't have been,
[00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:33.280]   he looks across, sees a naked woman bathing on the rooftop,
[00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:35.860]   probably also not a great thing for her to be doing,
[00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:38.260]   and he decides, "I wanna sleep with her."
[00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:39.460]   He goes and gets her, and he's told,
[00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:41.140]   "Hey, that's Uriah's wife.
[00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:42.700]   "Uriah's one of your best friends.
[00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:45.700]   "He's one of your mighty men, they're called."
[00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:47.420]   And David says, "I don't care."
[00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:48.300]   Goes and sleeps with her,
[00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:49.860]   thought it would just be some one-night stand.
[00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:51.960]   Oh no, finds out she's pregnant.
[00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:54.720]   And he decides, "I'm gonna get my boy Uriah.
[00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:57.820]   "He's gonna come home, and Uriah, hey, good game.
[00:21:57.820 --> 00:21:59.540]   "I'm gonna let you go hang out with your wife for a night,
[00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:00.780]   "hoping they would sleep together,"
[00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:03.240]   'cause that's what you do if you've been gone for a while.
[00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:05.860]   And Uriah says, "All of my men are fighting at war.
[00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:07.420]   "I'm not going anywhere."
[00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:09.060]   And David's like, "Oh, okay, cool."
[00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:10.920]   And he tries to get him drunk, and he's like,
[00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:12.280]   "Hey, just another one on me.
[00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:14.060]   "It's okay, the palace has got it."
[00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:17.540]   And he gets Uriah drunk, but his integrity is so great,
[00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:20.740]   Uriah, that he just sleeps on the doorstep of the palace,
[00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:21.600]   says, "I'm not going home.
[00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:24.220]   "My men can't, so I'm not."
[00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:28.100]   And David realizes his plan to cover up that adultery,
[00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:30.140]   to make Uriah think, "Oh, that's his baby boy.
[00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:31.060]   "It's not gonna work."
[00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:33.740]   So he decides that one of his best friends
[00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:36.840]   would just be a casualty, and he tries to cover up that sin.
[00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:38.860]   And he sends word, "Uriah, go back to the troops
[00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:40.100]   "who are at war."
[00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:42.340]   And he says, "I want you to take Uriah,"
[00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:43.960]   he writes to the commander,
[00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:46.120]   "put him where the fighting is fiercest,
[00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:47.640]   "and then with a signal from you,
[00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:49.660]   "pull everyone back but Uriah."
[00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:52.900]   Certain death, and it happened.
[00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:58.120]   And Bathsheba, the pregnancy takes place.
[00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:00.140]   She's pregnant with David's baby,
[00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:02.180]   and God says, "The baby's not gonna live."
[00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:05.460]   And Bathsheba ends up becoming one of David's wives,
[00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:06.460]   but he had several wives.
[00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:08.220]   But when God said, "Who is going to be
[00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:10.220]   "the great-great-grandmother
[00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:12.100]   "of the Savior of the world, Jesus?"
[00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:14.980]   He didn't choose Michael, which was another of his wives.
[00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:18.760]   He didn't choose, he chose Bathsheba,
[00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:22.540]   a woman who had been, and Matthew goes out of his way
[00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:25.940]   to go, "And remember," just so they were all on the same page,
[00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:27.780]   "She had been Uriah's wife.
[00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:29.440]   "This never should have happened."
[00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:32.280]   But that's the woman who God said,
[00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:33.880]   "These will be the two."
[00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:35.360]   That's Solomon's mama.
[00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:37.440]   And then he includes Solomon.
[00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:39.840]   So not only do you add, when you add David to the list,
[00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:40.920]   and you add Bathsheba to the list,
[00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:43.640]   you gotta add murder, you gotta add adultery.
[00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:45.600]   Like the list and the family lineage of Jesus,
[00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:47.680]   Matthew is highlighting very intentionally
[00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:51.000]   in a way that no other lineage in the Bible does.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.600]   No other place do they go out of the way to be like,
[00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:56.560]   "Whose mother had been Bathsheba, or Uriah's wife?"
[00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:57.600]   He's highlighting it.
[00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:02.480]   And then you go to Solomon, and we're told in the next verse
[00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:03.880]   Solomon was the father of Uriah Boam.
[00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:06.000]   What do we know about Solomon?
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.160]   Solomon started off well, as we covered in,
[00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:10.560]   rated off of romance, but he went on and chased
[00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:12.640]   one sex relationship after the next,
[00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:16.560]   and eventually, under what, by any standard
[00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:19.360]   of definition today, we would call a sex addict.
[00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:22.000]   He had 700 wives and 300 concubines,
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.600]   which basically was like, hey, you don't get the rights
[00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:26.200]   of a wife, but I get the rights to your body.
[00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:27.320]   A thousand people.
[00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:33.120]   And Solomon, this polygamist, possibly sex addict,
[00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:34.320]   would be further.
[00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:38.160]   David had several children, and God said, "That one."
[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:41.600]   And Matthew doesn't want you to miss the point.
[00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:43.640]   And then you keep going, and the stories and the people,
[00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:46.000]   like we could go over Ahaz, I said earlier, Ahaz,
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   you know what Ahaz was most famous for as a king?
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   He burned his son alive because he worshiped foreign gods.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.160]   Ahaz was known as the worst king in Israel.
[00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:59.200]   Jacob, the son originally of Isaac,
[00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:01.640]   who stole the birthright, every turn that you look,
[00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:02.880]   Matthew is communicating.
[00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:04.400]   I mean, if you look over at Jesus' family tree,
[00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:05.920]   all of it is so jacked up.
[00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:07.800]   Why would you, Matthew, go out of your way
[00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:09.360]   to point out, hey, the prostitute,
[00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:10.920]   and you know, that guy, he was incest,
[00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:13.080]   I mean, that's just gross, and then the murder,
[00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:15.360]   he had adultery, why would you go out of your way,
[00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:16.560]   Matthew, to do this?
[00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:20.520]   Because Matthew knew those were the point
[00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:24.000]   of the gospel he was about to write.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.640]   That's the point of Christianity.
[00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:28.560]   Jesus came from sinners, and he came for sinners,
[00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:30.440]   because everyone is a sinner out there.
[00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:32.120]   Everyone is so broken and in need
[00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:34.200]   of someone to save themselves, and Matthew knew,
[00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:36.200]   I'm including these 'cause they are the point
[00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:37.400]   of the story I'm about to write.
[00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:40.200]   Further, here's why I think Matthew included it.
[00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:42.280]   You know what each one of those have in common?
[00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:44.560]   Each one of those people, you got Rahab, the prostitute,
[00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:47.200]   you got Ruth, the Moabitess, which means she's a foreigner,
[00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:49.400]   Jesus was a mutt, he was not purebred.
[00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:55.000]   You got Judah, the liar and the coward,
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.720]   Jacob, the thief, each one of them has a stigma
[00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:00.600]   and a label attached to it, and you know who also
[00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:03.120]   had a stigma and a label attached to him?
[00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:03.960]   Matthew.
[00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:07.000]   Matthew, before we met Jesus, was known
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   as Matthew the tax collector, and then he meets Jesus,
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.160]   and he starts a relationship with this guy
[00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:18.280]   who changed everything, and so Matthew,
[00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:19.880]   when it came to writing, I mean, he knew
[00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:22.480]   that this new relationship that he had to Jesus
[00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:25.040]   totally redefined what defined him.
[00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:26.200]   He was no longer a tax collector.
[00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:27.920]   In other words, tax collector, there's not
[00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:29.800]   a really modern-day equivalent of what a tax collector is,
[00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:31.160]   'cause that doesn't mean much to us,
[00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:33.460]   other than nobody's like, I love the IRS,
[00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:35.920]   but in that day, it wasn't just the IRS,
[00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:39.000]   it was the IRS meets the mafia meets a pimp.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.320]   There isn't a modern equivalent to it,
[00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:41.640]   but they were hated by everyone.
[00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:44.340]   To be a tax collector meant you had to abandon religion,
[00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:46.560]   you were basically like, God, if he is real,
[00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:48.680]   don't care about him at all, and Matthew was sitting there
[00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:50.680]   in a tax booth collecting money.
[00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:51.920]   He had the right to take as much money
[00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:54.240]   as he wanted from anybody, and sitting in a tax booth,
[00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:58.120]   we're told that Jesus walks up, and he says,
[00:26:58.120 --> 00:26:59.420]   I haven't given up on you.
[00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:04.280]   You may have given up on God, but I don't care
[00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:08.120]   about your past, I don't care about your present.
[00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:09.360]   I care about the ways that it's impacting you
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:11.040]   and hurting you and things like that,
[00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:12.560]   but it's not gonna keep me from wanting
[00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:16.600]   a relationship with you, and Matthew knew
[00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:18.680]   that the labels the world had assigned him,
[00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:20.280]   his past would have given him,
[00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:25.360]   were all redefined by his relationship with Jesus.
[00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:28.360]   Every person we just listed out has been redefined,
[00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:29.920]   not by the labels that the world,
[00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:33.200]   Rahab has gone down in history as not a woman
[00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:35.140]   who slept around and is a prostitute,
[00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:36.900]   the most famous title she holds
[00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:38.660]   is she is the grandmother of Jesus.
[00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:42.320]   Your relationship with Christ redefines and trumps
[00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:44.840]   any other worldly definition or stigma
[00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:47.720]   or anything from your past, because Christ,
[00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:51.440]   the third idea, redefines what defines us.
[00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:53.400]   When you become in Christ, or you put your faith
[00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:56.240]   as a Christian in him, anything the world
[00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:58.200]   attaches to you, all of your past,
[00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:00.880]   anything that you attach, man, I'm damaged goods.
[00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:07.360]   I'm someone who committed an abortion,
[00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:09.400]   or had an abortion, I'm someone who pushed
[00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:12.280]   my girlfriend to have an abortion, I am a porn addict.
[00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:15.640]   I am a thief and a liar.
[00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:17.440]   I'm someone who has totally abandoned my family,
[00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:19.240]   I don't even have the ability to save face
[00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:20.760]   when I go home because of all the different ways
[00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:23.000]   that I've hurt people in my hometown and I'm ashamed.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.080]   And Matthew would say, the reason I included
[00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:29.880]   all of the dysfunction and brokenness in the family tree
[00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:32.080]   is because that's the point.
[00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:34.240]   No matter how far you feel like you are from God,
[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:35.640]   he hasn't stopped pursuing you,
[00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:38.000]   his mission was to come from sinners
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.700]   'cause he came for sinners, and everybody is a sinner.
[00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:45.800]   On mine, if I was to add some of mine to the list,
[00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:47.440]   what would represent some of the things
[00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:49.520]   that Jesus came and he hung from me?
[00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:54.100]   It would be pornography, lust, fear of man,
[00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:55.320]   all these different things that I would hang
[00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:56.720]   on my family tree if you will,
[00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:58.560]   or just the tree of my life, anger,
[00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:02.200]   sexual sin with past relationships,
[00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:04.240]   I don't know what would be on your tree.
[00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:07.520]   Greed, and a thousand other things that could mark.
[00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:08.960]   And Matthew included these people
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:11.540]   because he knew they were the point.
[00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:14.160]   Jesus, in all of the brokenness of his family tree,
[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:17.080]   came and he hung on a tree for them,
[00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:20.480]   and for you, and for anyone who would trust in him,
[00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:22.560]   and even those who don't.
[00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:24.480]   And in doing so, he redefines and he changes
[00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:25.480]   every label that's out there,
[00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:27.200]   and it's no longer pornography, it's love,
[00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:29.040]   it's no longer adultery, it's clean,
[00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:30.640]   it's no longer theft, it's forgiven,
[00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:32.240]   it's no longer fear of man, it's alive,
[00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:34.920]   it's no longer sexual sin, it's restored,
[00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:36.640]   it's no longer anger, it's righteousness,
[00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:38.960]   whatever label that you carry, if you are in Christ,
[00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:41.140]   and it's crazy as you think that is,
[00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:42.820]   spiritually speaking, the Bible says
[00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:44.220]   you have been redefined,
[00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:45.980]   no matter what your present sin struggle is,
[00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:47.540]   no matter what your past sin struggle is,
[00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:49.960]   all of it has been redefined because of a relationship
[00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:51.400]   that you have with Christ.
[00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:55.540]   Every single year, you know what's interesting?
[00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:58.480]   We do something at Christmas time.
[00:29:58.480 --> 00:29:59.740]   We're about to enter into it, like I said,
[00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:03.100]   and there's a tradition that kind of marks society,
[00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:08.120]   where we take things and we hang them on a tree.
[00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:12.480]   And whether or not society ever realizes it,
[00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:19.020]   they're doing that in a season that is devoted
[00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:23.780]   to the birth of a Messiah who came and hung on a tree.
[00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:26.780]   I hope you never look at ornaments the same way again.
[00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:29.020]   Every ornament out there that sits and it hangs on a tree
[00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:31.620]   is all about a celebration of the birth of Christ,
[00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:35.420]   who came and was hung on a tree for you and for me,
[00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:37.640]   was hung on a tree for all of the brokenness
[00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:40.280]   and messed up stuff inside of his life.
[00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:42.520]   And the tree that defines humanity doesn't have to be
[00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:44.420]   the original tree in the Garden of Eden.
[00:30:44.420 --> 00:30:45.700]   Like, think about it.
[00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:48.380]   Jesus' family tree is jacked up.
[00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:51.380]   It's messed up, just like your tree is messed up,
[00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:53.020]   and my family tree is messed up,
[00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:56.160]   and my heart is messed up, and your heart is messed up.
[00:30:56.160 --> 00:31:01.900]   And it honestly makes sense that his tree would be so broken
[00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:08.860]   because it was at a tree that our world became so broken.
[00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:13.000]   In Genesis chapter three, when sin was introduced,
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.080]   and the message of the gospel
[00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:16.320]   and the message really of Christmas,
[00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:19.240]   which doesn't have to be celebrated on December 25th,
[00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:20.480]   it's celebrated every single day,
[00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:24.620]   is that one has come who was born to die in our place,
[00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:25.960]   to hang on a tree.
[00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:28.380]   And what defines us is not the tree from the garden
[00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:31.160]   where sin was introduced,
[00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:33.880]   but a tree that was made into a cross
[00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:39.320]   where our Messiah, our Savior, the Son of David, Jesus,
[00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:44.060]   the God who saves, was crucified for you and for me.
[00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:48.100]   You were handed, when you walked in this room, an ornament.
[00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:49.780]   And here's what we're gonna do.
[00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:51.100]   We're gonna give you a chance for the next few minutes.
[00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:52.160]   I just want you to write out
[00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:54.160]   one of the millions of different sins
[00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:56.020]   that are inside of your life
[00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:59.420]   that Jesus hung on that cross for.
[00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:01.820]   You should have been given a Sharpie,
[00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:04.380]   and there's about 1,800 and about 3,000,
[00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:07.020]   so there's gonna be some passing around.
[00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:10.880]   And I wanna challenge you, like, you can write out anything.
[00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:11.980]   Let's be honest, if you're going like,
[00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:13.540]   "Oh, man, it's really hard for me to think of,"
[00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:14.680]   I'm concerned about you,
[00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:16.700]   because today there were probably a million sins
[00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:19.580]   that were committed in my heart and my mind.
[00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:23.200]   But you write out any of 'em, anger, resentment, bitterness.
[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:25.660]   Some of you, I wanna challenge you,
[00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:26.700]   whatever the one that you're thinking,
[00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:27.540]   "Oh, I don't wanna write that
[00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:29.060]   "'cause I'm with these people," what are they?
[00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:30.820]   You should probably write that one.
[00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:34.820]   It's through stories that God sets people free.
[00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:36.540]   And I wanna give you a chance,
[00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:38.220]   and then we're gonna have a chance for you,
[00:32:38.220 --> 00:32:40.420]   once you write that down, to just go hang.
[00:32:40.420 --> 00:32:43.140]   And we're gonna hang on trees all throughout this lobby,
[00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:45.060]   or all throughout this worship center,
[00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:47.780]   sins that Jesus already hung from,
[00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:50.260]   or already hung for on a tree.
[00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:51.700]   And those things don't define us anymore,
[00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:53.400]   and when you put 'em on that tree,
[00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:56.700]   it's almost a symbolic representation of,
[00:32:56.700 --> 00:32:58.860]   "This doesn't define me.
[00:32:58.860 --> 00:33:03.100]   "The other tree, the tree that was made to have crossed us,
[00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:04.980]   "and so I can put this on here
[00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:06.360]   "and hang up whatever sin is there
[00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:09.400]   "because there's one who already hung from me."
[00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:12.900]   We're gonna have a chance over the next five to eight minutes
[00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:14.140]   the band is gonna play, and then I'm gonna come
[00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:16.100]   close this out, but right now, write it down,
[00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:17.860]   and then you can just go to this trees all throughout here,
[00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:19.380]   there's 10, and we're gonna leave 'em there.
[00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:20.420]   It's just testimony,
[00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:22.820]   God, this is the way that you worked in our life.
[00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:25.460]   And these don't define me, you do.
