[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.960]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:18.920]   Well, what's up, Porch?
[00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.760]   How are we doing tonight?
[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.480]   Hey, it's good to see you.
[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.920]   Glad you're here.
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.360]   I hope that all is well.
[00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.680]   If this is your first time with us, my name is Timothy Atik.
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.220]   I'm one of the teaching pastors here at Watermark on Sundays,
[00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.400]   as well as here at the Porch.
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.440]   Just shout out to everyone here in the room in Dallas.
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.200]   But I know that there are people all over the nation that
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.240]   are watching right now.
[00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.600]   So I want to say hello to Porch Live Tulsa, Porch Live
[00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.000]   Scottsdale, Porch Live Boise.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.080]   So glad that you guys are tuning in tonight.
[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.640]   And if you're just by yourself watching online, welcome.
[00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.080]   I'm glad that you're with us.
[00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.120]   We are in part two of a series that we are calling--
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.160]   I mean, just wait for it.
[00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.240]   The title is amazing.
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.880]   We are calling it Prayer.
[00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.880]   Yeah.
[00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.960]   Yeah, you should have seen the creative meetings that
[00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.560]   went into coming up with that.
[00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.740]   But the title of the series is Prayer--
[00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.360]   How to Talk to and Hear from God.
[00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.640]   And the goal of it is that we want every person in this room
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.600]   to take a step in their relationship with God
[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.520]   in regard to prayer.
[00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.440]   Some people here love to pray.
[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.160]   Other people rarely ever pray.
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.360]   Wherever you're at, if you never really pray,
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.160]   our goal is that you would start praying.
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.520]   If you pray occasionally, our hope
[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.600]   is that you'd begin praying regularly.
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.240]   If you pray regularly, our hope is
[00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.160]   that you would pray constantly.
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.000]   And I would just say that prayer is something
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.280]   that I've been growing in over my life.
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.520]   And for the majority of my life, it
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.280]   has been something that I've really struggled with.
[00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.400]   I remember when I was a freshman at Texas A&M University,
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.480]   I showed up on campus.
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.600]   And I moved into the dorm with my best friend.
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.080]   And before classes had even started,
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.240]   I had never even been to a class at A&M.
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.280]   And I remember being in my dorm room.
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.680]   And this guy knocked on our door.
[00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.840]   And he said, hey, there's a group of us
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.000]   that are going to go have a prayer gathering on the front
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.920]   line of the university.
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.720]   And my roommate and I, we were Christians.
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.100]   We were like, well, I guess that's
[00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.640]   what we're supposed to do in college.
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.000]   Like, if we're Christians in college and people are praying,
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.240]   we should probably go and do that.
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.280]   But I still didn't have much experience
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.320]   with prayer at that point.
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.040]   And so we sat down on the front line of the university at night.
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.080]   And we began to pray.
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.600]   And we prayed for 10 minutes.
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.160]   10 minutes turned into 20 minutes.
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.320]   20 minutes turned into 30 minutes.
[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.680]   And by that point, I'm like, guys, I think we've done it.
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.720]   Like, we've had the prayer gathering.
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.400]   Like, we have gathered.
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.880]   It's time-- you know you reach that point where it's like,
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.480]   all right, who's going to wrap this thing up and say amen?
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.240]   It's been a good go.
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.000]   30 minutes turned into 50 minutes,
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   which turned into an hour.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.600]   And finally, like, the leader began to pray.
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.220]   And if you've ever been in that moment
[00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.680]   and the leader starts praying, it's just like, finally.
[00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.600]   Like, you just kind of breathe that relief.
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.080]   And the leader said amen.
[00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.520]   And I was like, that was a great meeting.
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:28.600]   And then this girl in the group of 15 to 20 people gathering,
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.400]   she said, I don't think we're done.
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.680]   And I was like, no, we're done.
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.160]   Like, he said amen.
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.480]   Like, that's the ending word.
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.560]   You can't reopen it when you've said amen.
[00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.240]   She was like, I don't think we're done.
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:48.160]   And so we went back into it for another hour.
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.920]   And by the end, I was like, I'm not
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.680]   sure I want to do that again.
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.720]   And I think about that.
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:58.880]   And I think about this room.
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:59.840]   And here's the reality.
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.960]   There are people in this room who
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:07.240]   are the I don't think we're done yet type of people.
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.800]   Like, you love praying.
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.840]   You gear up for it.
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.760]   You're the person knocking on the door saying,
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.520]   hey, we've got a prayer gathering on the front lawn.
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.480]   Like, let's do it.
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.680]   And then there's other people in this room who are the I
[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.520]   think we were done about an hour and 30 minutes
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.000]   earlier type of people.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.040]   And that's OK, too.
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.840]   Like, we're all in different places.
[00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.160]   But the goal is that we would all take a step.
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.680]   As I've thought about my own journey with prayer,
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.840]   I think I've narrowed it down to two reasons why
[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.080]   I've struggled with prayer for a good portion of my life.
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.240]   It's really two reasons.
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.320]   First is that I've just bought into the thought
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.240]   that God's going to do what he's going to do.
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.800]   Like, God is sovereign over all things.
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.320]   He's going to accomplish his purposes.
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.880]   So whether I pray or not, the reality
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.680]   is that God is in charge.
[00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:03.680]   God is moving.
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.520]   God's going to do what he's going to do.
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.040]   So I can pray.
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.960]   But regardless of whether I pray,
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.880]   God is going to-- he's just going
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.920]   to do what he's going to do.
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:14.960]   The second reason I've struggled with prayer
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.480]   is that there have been times in the past where I've prayed,
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:22.600]   and God hasn't seemed to answer my prayers.
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.400]   And I don't know if you've experienced that.
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.640]   I would imagine that's true for everyone in this room.
[00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:31.920]   Like, there is times where I've begged God to heal someone who
[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:37.000]   is dealing with some type of illness, sickness,
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.920]   and God hasn't seemed to respond.
[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:44.920]   Even more recently, there have been prayers
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.840]   that I've prayed that it would just
[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:52.880]   seem so easy for God to say the word, and it would happen.
[00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.160]   And it would bring flourishing in people's lives.
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:00.400]   I look, and I just say, God, you have all the power in the world.
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:04.120]   It would be so easy for you to do this one small thing,
[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.040]   and then the opposite happens.
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:08.560]   And when that has happened, it's just
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:12.480]   caused me to wonder, what's the point anyway?
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.160]   And so I just wonder if anyone in the room
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.480]   can identify with that.
[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.800]   You know, over the last couple of years,
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:26.640]   God has done a significant work in my life in regard to prayer.
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:29.920]   And I'm embarrassed to admit that it took a better
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:33.800]   part of 40 years to really tap into the joy
[00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:37.760]   that you can experience through prayer.
[00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.320]   And I think where I've finally begun
[00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:42.560]   to land on those two things that were holding me back
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.320]   from praying is this.
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:47.240]   In regard to the thought that God's going to do
[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.440]   what he's going to do, here's what I've figured out,
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.760]   is that God is going to do what he's going to do,
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:59.520]   but part of God's sovereign plans is his people praying.
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:02.520]   And so there are times where God won't do things
[00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:05.000]   because his people haven't prayed yet.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.680]   And so God in his sovereignty will get the most glory
[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:14.160]   when his people pray and he responds,
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.560]   and they celebrate that he has worked.
[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:19.960]   And so part of God's sovereignty,
[00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:24.560]   he is able to work it out that he will work in a way that
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:30.160]   involves his people praying and him accomplishing his purposes.
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:31.880]   And so over the last couple of years,
[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:36.840]   I've just sensed God inviting me into his sovereign plans.
[00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:40.720]   And my role to play is praying.
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:45.560]   And then in regard to praying and God not answering
[00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:49.680]   some of my prayers, and that has been a very real thing
[00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:54.200]   for me, it's been a very personal thing for me.
[00:07:54.200 --> 00:08:01.400]   And I think where the Lord has been just stretching my faith
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:03.640]   in some of the hardest moments of life,
[00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:06.920]   where I've really felt like God is stretching me,
[00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:10.160]   is I have to make a choice if I believe
[00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:14.640]   that the word of God is true, and if the God of this Bible
[00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:17.000]   is the God that I believe in.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.600]   And if I truly believe that the God that I pray to
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:24.360]   is the God of this scripture, then where my faith has been
[00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:29.640]   stretched is to believe that even in the midst of the hurt
[00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:36.040]   and the heartache of life, that if I got to see what God sees,
[00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:38.400]   I wouldn't change a thing.
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:41.920]   And that is an aspect of faith where the Lord is just
[00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:44.360]   sinking my roots deeper to believe
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:47.960]   that from my limited perspective,
[00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:51.400]   all I can see is the moment I am in right now.
[00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:55.440]   And if I was in control, I would change this moment.
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.120]   But if I could see what God sees,
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:58.720]   he sees the beginning from the end,
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:00.160]   I wouldn't change a thing.
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.400]   And I wouldn't argue with any of it.
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:04.080]   And so God over the last couple of years
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:07.320]   has just been inviting me into deeper places of joy
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:08.440]   in regard to prayer.
[00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:10.360]   And I want it for you as well.
[00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:13.520]   And so what tonight and next week should feel like
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:16.400]   is in some ways a marriage counselor's office.
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:18.040]   And you're like, dude, wrong crowd.
[00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:19.800]   Like, none of us are married.
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:23.300]   You can counsel us on how to get married and find someone
[00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:24.280]   to marry.
[00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:28.600]   But in regard to saving a marriage, like not there.
[00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:31.520]   But here's the reality.
[00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:33.840]   Anyone who, any couple that finds themselves
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.120]   in a marriage counselor's office,
[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:38.320]   the reason they're there is because of communication issues.
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:40.740]   There's been a breakdown in communication.
[00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:42.000]   There's a lack of intimacy
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.420]   because there's a lack of communication.
[00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:47.400]   The same is true in your relationship with God.
[00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:51.240]   If you sense a lack of intimacy, I promise you
[00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:53.880]   it's because there's a lack of communication.
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:57.140]   And so this week and next week is just all about
[00:09:57.140 --> 00:10:02.140]   how to talk to God and how to hear from God.
[00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:04.160]   Here is the great news.
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:08.120]   The great news is that a good amount of people
[00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:13.120]   in this room already have memorized the key
[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:16.220]   to greater intimacy with God through prayer.
[00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:18.740]   It's the Lord's prayer.
[00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:21.960]   It's the most famous teaching in the Bible on prayer.
[00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:25.520]   It is Jesus's greatest message to us on prayer.
[00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:27.920]   So let's just say it together if you know it.
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:31.560]   Jesus says to pray in this way.
[00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:36.160]   Our Father who is in heaven, hallowed be your name.
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:39.520]   Your kingdom come, your will be done
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:42.000]   on earth as it is in heaven.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.440]   Give us this day our daily bread
[00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:48.440]   and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors
[00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:50.960]   and lead us not into temptation,
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:52.840]   but deliver us from evil.
[00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:55.720]   For yours is the kingdom and the power
[00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:58.980]   and the glory forever and ever, amen.
[00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:01.520]   Whether you realize it or not,
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:04.760]   Jesus has given us that Lord's prayer
[00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:07.200]   as the model for how to pray.
[00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:09.160]   Some of you are like, you said debts,
[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:11.960]   I say trespasses, what's up with that?
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:13.380]   (congregation laughing)
[00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:14.640]   Right?
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:19.240]   You're like, you said thy, he said it differently.
[00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:20.600]   Did I memorize it wrong?
[00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:23.980]   You're good, there's different versions, we're all okay.
[00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:31.320]   But it holds the keys and I wanna look at it tonight
[00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:32.240]   line by line.
[00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:34.400]   So if you have a Bible, I want you to turn with me
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:37.800]   to the Lord's prayer which is found in Matthew chapter six.
[00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:41.120]   Matthew chapter six falls in the longest sermon
[00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:42.200]   that Jesus ever gave.
[00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:44.360]   It's the greatest sermon that has ever been given.
[00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:45.960]   It's known as the Sermon on the Mount.
[00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:48.240]   It spans three chapters in the Bible.
[00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:50.240]   Matthew five through seven, I would encourage you
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:51.600]   to read it sometime.
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:55.480]   It is an amazing sermon.
[00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:58.200]   And in this sermon, the greatest sermon
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:01.980]   that's ever been preached, Jesus devotes a portion of it
[00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:05.320]   to the topic of prayer because he wants his people
[00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:07.480]   to know how to connect with God
[00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:10.840]   and experience intimacy through prayer.
[00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:13.880]   Now here's what I want you to see.
[00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:16.840]   Look at how verse nine starts.
[00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:20.120]   This is right before Jesus goes into the Lord's prayer.
[00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:22.040]   Look at how he starts verse nine.
[00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:26.560]   He says, "Pray then like this."
[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:29.200]   What Jesus doesn't say is pray this,
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:31.680]   he says pray like this.
[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:33.720]   So Jesus didn't give us the Lord's prayer
[00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:38.240]   just for us to put it on repeat and to mindlessly recite it
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:41.720]   like there is some value to us waking up in the morning
[00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:45.300]   and mindlessly going through our Father who art in heaven.
[00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:50.000]   No, he gave us the Lord's prayer as a framework.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.640]   He says, "Pray then like this."
[00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:57.520]   So what the Lord's prayer is, it's a template
[00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:02.060]   that shows us how to pray, not as much what to pray,
[00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:03.380]   but how to pray.
[00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:06.920]   And as we look at the Lord's prayer,
[00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:11.920]   it shows us that there are four key ways to pray.
[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:14.200]   And here they are.
[00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:19.200]   You wanna pray with clarity, you wanna pray expectantly,
[00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:22.780]   you wanna pray with humility,
[00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:25.280]   and you wanna pray dependently.
[00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:27.540]   I promise you, if you want your prayer life
[00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:30.580]   to go from zero to 60, if you wanna take a step
[00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:34.220]   to greater intimacy with Jesus,
[00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:36.700]   then begin to pray in these four ways.
[00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:40.060]   And we're gonna see those fleshed out in the Lord's prayer.
[00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:41.900]   So let's just begin to walk through it.
[00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:45.320]   First, if you wanna take a step in your prayer life,
[00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:48.040]   I wanna encourage you to pray with clarity.
[00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:50.440]   Look at how Jesus teaches us to pray.
[00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:52.160]   He says, "Pray then like this,
[00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:57.160]   "our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name."
[00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:00.860]   This is really interesting because Jesus encourages us
[00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:03.040]   to address God as Father.
[00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:05.480]   So when I talk about praying with clarity,
[00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:08.020]   what I'm really talking about is praying
[00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:11.500]   with a clarity regarding who God is.
[00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:15.060]   That when you close your eyes and you begin to talk,
[00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:16.540]   you wanna make sure that you know
[00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:18.820]   exactly who you're talking to.
[00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:20.780]   A lot of times when we go to pray,
[00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:24.500]   we just begin to pray about what we need,
[00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:29.500]   but where Jesus starts is praying in regard to the who,
[00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:32.580]   not what, but who.
[00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:35.300]   You wanna be clear on who you're talking to
[00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:40.300]   before you begin to clarify what you need from that person.
[00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:44.620]   And he wants us to realize that we are praying
[00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:47.740]   to our Father in heaven.
[00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:51.300]   See, this is the beauty of the gospel.
[00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:53.540]   And if you're new to Christianity,
[00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:55.740]   if you're just checking out the porch,
[00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:57.380]   if you got tricked into being here,
[00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:59.540]   your friend was like, "Let's go to happy hour."
[00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:01.020]   And they brought you here and they were like,
[00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:03.980]   "It's gonna be a happy hour here at the porch.
[00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:05.500]   "I'm so glad you made it."
[00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:08.460]   Like, you just need to know the good news
[00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:13.140]   that we rally around here is that we were enemies of God
[00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:16.220]   and we have become children of God
[00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:19.220]   because of the grace of God.
[00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:21.940]   That is the message of Christianity,
[00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:25.700]   that Jesus Christ has come, God in the flesh,
[00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:27.940]   he has died for all of our sins.
[00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:31.780]   He has risen from the dead, conquering all of our sins.
[00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:35.140]   And through faith, we can be made right with a perfect God.
[00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:38.140]   But without knowing, without a relationship with Jesus,
[00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:40.860]   the Bible would say that we are enemies of God.
[00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:43.060]   We're not in neutral standing with God,
[00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:44.580]   we are enemies of God.
[00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:47.540]   But when we put our faith in Jesus, we who were enemies,
[00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:52.460]   we become children so that we can go to God in prayer
[00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:55.280]   and address him as father.
[00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:59.420]   So we wanna pray with clarity about who God is.
[00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:03.060]   It's interesting that God is not referred to
[00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:06.900]   as a father of an individual anywhere in the Old Testament,
[00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:10.260]   which is the first two thirds of your Bible.
[00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:13.740]   But then Jesus shows up and he refers to God as father
[00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:18.740]   195 different times and he invites us to do the same.
[00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:22.820]   Because Jesus is trying to clarify for us,
[00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:24.940]   God is a personal God.
[00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:27.780]   God doesn't want you to just know him
[00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:29.980]   as the creator of the universe,
[00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:33.500]   he doesn't wanna just be known as a higher power.
[00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:37.240]   He wants you to know him as father.
[00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:42.060]   And I would just say that has become so meaningful to me
[00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:44.980]   as I've become a father of three crazy boys.
[00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:48.000]   I've got Noah who's 13, Andrew who is 11,
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.980]   and Jake who is five.
[00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:55.980]   And being a dad has shined so much light on who God is.
[00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:58.420]   Like I think about the fact,
[00:16:58.420 --> 00:16:59.780]   and I shared it a couple of weeks ago,
[00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:03.540]   but I delight in my three boys.
[00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:05.260]   So my five year old Jake,
[00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:10.260]   he just graduated from preschool yesterday.
[00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:12.820]   Like when I say he graduated,
[00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:15.140]   I mean like there was, thank you.
[00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:18.580]   I'll tell him that 2,000 people applauded for him.
[00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:20.260]   He won't know what to do with it.
[00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:22.100]   But when I say he graduated,
[00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:26.700]   I'm literally saying he wore a cap and a gown
[00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:28.440]   and he walked down an aisle
[00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:32.340]   and he walked across the stage, his name was called.
[00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:34.900]   And when I showed up to that graduation ceremony
[00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:37.520]   of like 10 kids and 30 parents,
[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:40.220]   and they push play on a slide show,
[00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:42.380]   I'm like getting choked up.
[00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:45.460]   'Cause I'm like, that's my kid.
[00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:47.420]   It's my kid graduating.
[00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:49.300]   And I was thinking about Jake, my five year old,
[00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:51.740]   like when he was two, I will never forget,
[00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:55.780]   I was preparing a message talking about God as father.
[00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:59.460]   And as I'm preparing it, I hear the doorknob
[00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:01.440]   of my home office rattling.
[00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:03.080]   Jake's two years old.
[00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:06.560]   He rattles it and just bursts in while I'm prepping.
[00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:08.700]   And he has a French fry in his hand.
[00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:12.200]   And he just came in to show me his French fry.
[00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:16.240]   And then he walked out and he closed the door.
[00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:19.120]   I'm like, dude, I just wanna get this straight.
[00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:23.960]   You were eating your nuggets and fries.
[00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:25.960]   You got up, you're like, you know who needs
[00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:27.220]   to see this French fry?
[00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:30.880]   You walked down the hall.
[00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:34.180]   You as a two year old figured out how to open the doorknob
[00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:35.440]   to show me that fry.
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:38.220]   And when he left, like I started getting choked up.
[00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:41.400]   I'm like, I just delighted my kid.
[00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:43.840]   You know, I think about my,
[00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:50.400]   one of my boys who has just navigated different challenges.
[00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:52.460]   And there have been moments where I've just thought,
[00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:54.040]   I will do anything.
[00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:58.560]   I will leverage any influence I have to do whatever I can
[00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:00.360]   to help him flourish.
[00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:05.360]   Like there's this like zeal in me for his wellbeing.
[00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:08.840]   Or I remember when my oldest kid was in kindergarten
[00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:11.680]   and he was getting bullied by this kid.
[00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:14.160]   Like I went to the lunchroom.
[00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:19.160]   I sat down at the table across from that six year old
[00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:21.640]   who was bullying my kid.
[00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:23.320]   And I was like, I'm the captain now.
[00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:24.620]   Like look right at me.
[00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:28.920]   And I was like, we're not gonna do that anymore, right?
[00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:33.100]   And my wife was like, you probably shouldn't do that.
[00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:36.900]   And I was like, well, it's just this like protective nature.
[00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:41.900]   And I think I am such a sinful, imperfect human being.
[00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:48.500]   If you were to ask my wife and kids, they'd be like, yes.
[00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:51.100]   He has his good moments
[00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:52.920]   and he definitely has his bad moments.
[00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:54.900]   Like he is far from perfect.
[00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:56.940]   He's a sinful human being.
[00:19:56.940 --> 00:20:00.420]   And yet I look at what Matthew chapter seven verse 11 says
[00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:01.260]   about God.
[00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:03.140]   It says, if you then who are evil
[00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:05.540]   know how to give good gifts to your children,
[00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:07.740]   how much more will your father who is in heaven
[00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:10.520]   give good things to those who ask him?
[00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:11.480]   Do you know what that's saying?
[00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:15.540]   It's saying, look, you look at earthly fathers.
[00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:19.340]   You, Timothy Atik, you experienced delight in your kids
[00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:23.580]   and this protectiveness and this desire for them to flourish
[00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:25.960]   and you're very imperfect.
[00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:30.540]   But Jesus says, when we address our father,
[00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:34.880]   we are addressing our father in heaven.
[00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:38.060]   Do you know what that means?
[00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:43.060]   It means that our heavenly father is a perfect father.
[00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:46.660]   And some of y'all desperately need to hear that
[00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:48.700]   because when you hear me talking about being a dad,
[00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:50.880]   you're like, none of this connects for me.
[00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:53.860]   Here's the reality.
[00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:58.860]   We often project our experiences with our earthly fathers
[00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:02.940]   under our experience with our heavenly father.
[00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:06.420]   And some of you guys had miserable experiences
[00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:08.380]   with their earthly father.
[00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:10.900]   And so the idea of God being father
[00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:12.660]   is the one that is an idea
[00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:14.460]   that will feel very distant from you.
[00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:17.100]   And I just wanna invite you in to see God
[00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:21.380]   in a new and redeeming way tonight.
[00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:24.300]   What I want you to know is that if you're here
[00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:26.100]   and you had a great earthly dad,
[00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:31.060]   all of the good that your earthly father has been,
[00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:34.200]   God is infinitely more.
[00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:35.100]   That's my story.
[00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:36.120]   I have a great dad.
[00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:37.460]   I have a great mom and dad.
[00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:41.100]   My mom and dad have shown me unconditional love
[00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:46.100]   and generosity and support for 42 years of life.
[00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:49.220]   And yet you might hear that and be like, not my dad.
[00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:50.660]   My dad was absent.
[00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:52.260]   My dad was abusive.
[00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:54.180]   I was never enough for my dad.
[00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:55.860]   My dad was controlling.
[00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:58.460]   My dad made relentless comments to me
[00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:00.860]   about my looks and my weight.
[00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:05.860]   My dad insisted on everything being perfect in my life.
[00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:10.980]   And so what I want you to hear me say
[00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:15.260]   is all of the bad that your earthly dad was,
[00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:17.960]   God is infinitely not.
[00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:23.900]   And your story doesn't have to be,
[00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:25.900]   I didn't have an earthly father.
[00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:32.160]   Your story should be, I have a perfect heavenly father.
[00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:37.020]   God wants to be the father that you never had.
[00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:39.940]   He wants to be the father that you never had.
[00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:42.620]   And so my encouragement to you
[00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:45.860]   is to begin to pray with clarity.
[00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:47.900]   God is your perfect father.
[00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:49.580]   You are his child.
[00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:50.940]   He loves you.
[00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:52.600]   He delights in you.
[00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:54.660]   The beauty, if you know Jesus,
[00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:57.500]   the scripture uses this phrase over and over
[00:22:57.500 --> 00:22:59.420]   that we are in Christ.
[00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:01.380]   We are hidden in Christ.
[00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:02.900]   Here's what that means.
[00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:06.300]   All of the love that God the father has for his son, Jesus,
[00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:09.300]   he now has for you because you're in Christ.
[00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:12.740]   All the delight God the father has for Jesus,
[00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:14.060]   he has for you.
[00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:18.720]   All the acceptance and approval, it is for you.
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:22.280]   Imagine how different life would be
[00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:24.540]   if you woke up tomorrow morning believing
[00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:27.420]   that you have a perfect heavenly father
[00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:28.820]   who delights in you.
[00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:31.100]   It's amazing.
[00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:34.500]   It's crazy because I have such an amazing earthly dad
[00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:37.380]   and yet when it comes to my heavenly father,
[00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:40.740]   I can still lean towards performance.
[00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:43.500]   So if I'm having great quiet times, I feel great.
[00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:46.200]   My quiet times aren't so great, I feel like a failure.
[00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:49.260]   And I just wonder if my perfect heavenly father
[00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:52.340]   is like, "Don't put that on me.
[00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:55.400]   "No, I delight in you.
[00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:58.660]   "I sent my son to redeem you,
[00:23:58.660 --> 00:24:01.220]   "to make you right in my eyes
[00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:05.680]   "so that I could pour out my love and acceptance upon you."
[00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:10.500]   And so Jesus says, "Pray with clarity."
[00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:14.060]   But he doesn't stop with just God being a perfect father.
[00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:16.100]   He says, "Our father in heaven."
[00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:17.180]   And what does he go on to say?
[00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:20.300]   He says, "Hallowed be your name."
[00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:23.200]   That word hallowed in the Greek,
[00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:26.780]   it means to be set apart or made holy.
[00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:29.780]   So Jesus is saying that when you pray to God,
[00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:33.100]   you wanna pray to the God who is set apart.
[00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:35.460]   God doesn't need to be set apart.
[00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:37.100]   He already is set apart.
[00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:38.980]   He doesn't need to be made holy.
[00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:42.380]   He is already holy, holy, holy.
[00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:44.540]   And so what Jesus does here,
[00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:45.940]   and I need you to see this,
[00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:49.340]   is because he is navigating this tension
[00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:54.180]   between familiarity and supremacy.
[00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:58.100]   That God wants you to feel that he is very familiar
[00:24:58.100 --> 00:25:01.020]   as a follower, as a father.
[00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:04.820]   And yet he is supreme, and there's no one like him.
[00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:09.220]   God is so other than anything we could ever imagine.
[00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:12.560]   Like we have to hold in tension the fact
[00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:14.900]   that the Bible refers to God
[00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:19.060]   as a God who dwells in unapproachable light.
[00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:23.340]   Like he is so holy that we couldn't even approach him
[00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:24.420]   if we wanted to.
[00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:26.740]   And at the same time, the Bible says
[00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:31.160]   that we should boldly approach the throne of grace.
[00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:33.900]   So we hold in tension that God is unapproachable,
[00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:35.720]   yet completely approachable.
[00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:39.180]   That if you read the Old Testament,
[00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:42.680]   if people saw God, they just collapsed on the ground.
[00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:44.260]   If God spoke audibly,
[00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:47.540]   people felt like they were having a near-death experience.
[00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:52.820]   And yet God wants us to see him and hear from him
[00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:53.880]   every single day.
[00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:58.300]   And so what Jesus is saying is that we hold this tension,
[00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:01.180]   this familiarity, he's a perfect father.
[00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:03.700]   And yet we hold in the other hand his supremacy,
[00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:05.340]   that there's no one like him.
[00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:08.220]   So we come to him with a reverence
[00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:11.300]   because he is holy, holy, holy.
[00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:17.940]   So Jesus' first encouragement is to pray,
[00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:20.160]   pray with clarity.
[00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:23.900]   Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.
[00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:27.660]   Number two, we wanna pray expectantly.
[00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:29.020]   We wanna pray expectantly.
[00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:32.300]   That's why Jesus encourages us to pray.
[00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:36.380]   Your kingdom come, your will be done on earth
[00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:38.220]   as it is in heaven.
[00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:41.580]   The kingdom of God is the realm
[00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:45.980]   where Christ rules and reigns.
[00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:47.120]   See, here's the reality.
[00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:49.500]   When you begin to pray with clarity,
[00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:52.600]   when you realize that God is a perfect heavenly father,
[00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:55.700]   when you begin to see God as holy, holy, holy,
[00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:58.120]   that there is no one like him,
[00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:00.580]   you know what you end up doing?
[00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:03.540]   You begin to pray expectantly
[00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:07.380]   like you want Christ's rule and reign in your life.
[00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:08.220]   Why?
[00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:10.440]   Because you're convinced that he's a good king.
[00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:14.460]   So when I begin to pray in my own life,
[00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:17.500]   when I start by reminding myself of who God is,
[00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:20.180]   because one of the things that you have to remember
[00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:22.260]   when you pray is your view of God
[00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:25.100]   will determine your response to God.
[00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:27.460]   If you start praying with a small view of God,
[00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:30.540]   you're gonna have a very small response to God.
[00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:31.820]   But when you go into prayer
[00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:33.860]   and you begin to remind yourself of who God is,
[00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:35.740]   it expands your view of him,
[00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:39.300]   so you're gonna have an expanded response to him.
[00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:41.300]   So when you begin to see God clearly
[00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:44.700]   as a good and perfect father and king,
[00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:45.700]   you know what you do?
[00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:50.420]   Is you begin to invite his rule and reign into your life.
[00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:51.980]   You want Jesus Christ to rule,
[00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:53.900]   you pray expectantly like,
[00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:55.440]   Jesus Christ, you're a good king,
[00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:58.820]   come rule and reign in my life.
[00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:05.020]   A while back, I decided to get into collecting sports cards
[00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:08.540]   and some of you are like, nerd alert, no, here's the deal.
[00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:09.660]   Like, I don't know if you know this,
[00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:13.660]   but over COVID, like the sport card industry hit a boom.
[00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:18.660]   That's why a Mickey Mantle card sold for over $11 million.
[00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:21.620]   Like there's been something crazy that has happened.
[00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:26.260]   So all of these middle-aged men started collecting cards,
[00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:27.500]   including this guy.
[00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:32.500]   But anyway, for my son, my oldest son's birthday,
[00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:36.220]   I bought him a few boxes of football cards
[00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:37.580]   and I handed them to him.
[00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:41.140]   I bought them for him because I wanted them.
[00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:46.140]   But anyway, I'm watching him begin to open them
[00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:49.100]   and as he's opening them, I'm like, here dude, I'll do it.
[00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:51.220]   And I take all the packs from him
[00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:54.600]   and I begin to open them myself.
[00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:58.540]   So now my son, who the cards belong to,
[00:28:58.540 --> 00:29:04.580]   is watching his middle-aged dad open these packs.
[00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:06.380]   Why?
[00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:08.860]   'Cause I didn't trust him with them,
[00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:11.260]   which is interesting because they belong to him.
[00:29:11.260 --> 00:29:13.660]   But you know what my fear was?
[00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:16.140]   My fear was that he wouldn't value them
[00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:17.340]   like I would value them.
[00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:19.700]   And I wonder if we do the same thing
[00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:23.140]   in our relationships with Jesus.
[00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:26.900]   Like we belong to Jesus.
[00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:29.980]   Psalm 24, one says, "The earth is the Lord's
[00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:32.480]   "and everything in it, including you."
[00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:34.620]   You belong to God.
[00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:37.140]   You are his.
[00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:42.140]   And yet we try and grab our lives back from him.
[00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:43.620]   Like, you know what?
[00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:47.540]   I don't know that I trust you to handle my life
[00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:49.160]   like I can handle it.
[00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:51.700]   Because I don't know that you're gonna value
[00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:53.860]   different things like I would value them.
[00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:56.980]   Like I don't know that you're gonna value
[00:29:56.980 --> 00:30:01.940]   my romantic life, my relationship,
[00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:03.140]   like I would value it.
[00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:05.160]   So I need to cling to this relationship
[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:08.220]   that is honestly toxic, but I don't wanna let go of it
[00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:10.620]   because I don't know that I trust you
[00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:13.780]   with my relationship status.
[00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:15.280]   And I think God's like, "Really?
[00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:16.820]   "You would value it more?
[00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:20.100]   "I invented romantic love.
[00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:21.720]   "I'm the one who thought it up.
[00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:23.180]   "You're welcome, by the way."
[00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:25.880]   Or we're like, "You know what?
[00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:28.380]   "I'm gonna cling to the money that I do have
[00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:31.100]   "because I don't know that you value money
[00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:32.780]   "like I value money."
[00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:37.100]   And God's like, "I own a cattle on a thousand hills.
[00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:39.940]   "The earth is mine and everything in it.
[00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:44.180]   "I think I value money more than you value it
[00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:46.120]   "because all the money in the universe
[00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:47.580]   "belongs to me anyway."
[00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:50.860]   Or sometimes we're like, "Don't touch my sex life
[00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:52.800]   "because that's kind of my thing.
[00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:55.060]   "And God, I know you're against it
[00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:56.140]   "and the world is for it
[00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:57.740]   "and I'm kind of with the world on this one.
[00:30:57.740 --> 00:30:59.260]   "It's good and I'm for it."
[00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:02.460]   And I think God's like, "You're for it?
[00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:05.620]   "I invented it.
[00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:10.340]   "Like I'm the one who thought it up."
[00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:16.680]   And so when we begin to see God clearly for who he is,
[00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:18.480]   we begin to realize, "No, he's a good king.
[00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:20.260]   "He can rule and reign in my life."
[00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:23.880]   And we begin to pray expectantly like, "God, have your way.
[00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:26.460]   "Do what you want to do in me."
[00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:28.820]   But we don't just want it in our individual lives.
[00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:30.660]   We want it throughout the world.
[00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:32.820]   We want it in the lives of our friends and family
[00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:33.820]   who don't know the Lord.
[00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:34.860]   So we begin to pray.
[00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:37.900]   You need to know I have prayed for you tonight
[00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:42.740]   that Jesus Christ would rule and reign in your hearts.
[00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:45.620]   Some of you tonight need to say yes to Jesus
[00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:46.820]   for the first time ever.
[00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:51.380]   But others of us, we see the brokenness in the world.
[00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:55.280]   We see the natural disasters and the mass shootings
[00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:57.120]   that are happening on a weekly basis.
[00:31:57.120 --> 00:32:02.120]   And there's rape and sexual abuse and cancer
[00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:04.700]   and all sorts of disorders.
[00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:07.820]   And we begin to pray expectantly
[00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:09.540]   when we are clear on who God is
[00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:13.640]   because what we want is we want the rule and reign of Christ
[00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:15.020]   to permeate the earth.
[00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:18.420]   And a day is coming according to the end of the Bible,
[00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:20.820]   Revelation 21, will there be no more death,
[00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:22.860]   no more tears, no more pain
[00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:25.460]   because Jesus Christ is gonna make all things new.
[00:32:25.460 --> 00:32:28.420]   And so when we pray, we pray expectantly
[00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:31.180]   that his kingdom would come and his will would be done.
[00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:36.780]   Third, we pray with humility.
[00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:38.660]   We pray with humility.
[00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:40.380]   So Jesus goes on and says,
[00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:41.820]   and give us this day our daily bread.
[00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:44.220]   We're gonna come back to that in just a moment.
[00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:46.260]   But I want you to see he goes on and says,
[00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:48.860]   and forgive us our debts
[00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:53.580]   as we also have forgiven our debtors.
[00:32:53.580 --> 00:32:55.220]   So Jesus encourages us,
[00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:59.300]   hey, if you wanna heat your prayer life up,
[00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:03.500]   then bring forgiveness into your prayer life.
[00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:06.900]   And what he means is like make it a regular rhythm
[00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:10.420]   to ask God's forgiveness.
[00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:11.740]   Let me explain it this way.
[00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:13.500]   What you need to understand
[00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:15.900]   is when you put your faith in Jesus Christ,
[00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:19.340]   Jesus didn't just die to save you from hell,
[00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:22.300]   even though he did die to save you from hell.
[00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:25.460]   But he died and rose from the dead
[00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:29.420]   to save you into a spiritual family.
[00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:31.740]   The reason I say that if you know Jesus Christ,
[00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:33.580]   you belong to a spiritual family
[00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:37.100]   is because you now have a heavenly father,
[00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:40.740]   but you also now have spiritual brothers and sisters.
[00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:42.580]   Every Christian on the earth
[00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:44.820]   is now your brother or sister in Christ,
[00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:47.780]   which means you have brothers and sisters
[00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:50.900]   from every tribe, tongue, people and nation,
[00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:52.260]   which is amazing.
[00:33:52.260 --> 00:33:59.620]   But if you want your prayer life to really take off,
[00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:02.020]   then what Jesus is encouraging is,
[00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:07.020]   hey, prayer is a key to maintaining health
[00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:10.100]   within the spiritual family.
[00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:11.540]   And there's a vertical component
[00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:15.020]   and there's a horizontal component to this.
[00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:18.260]   So prayer is one of the ways
[00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:22.820]   that you maintain intimacy with God when you sin.
[00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:24.860]   It's kind of like this, okay, I've told you,
[00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:27.740]   I've now talked about my boys a lot in this message,
[00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:30.740]   primarily because we're talking about God being father.
[00:34:30.740 --> 00:34:33.820]   But if one of my kids does something
[00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:35.580]   that I ask them not to do,
[00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:39.460]   like if they break the rules that I've put into place,
[00:34:39.460 --> 00:34:41.460]   I don't look at them and say,
[00:34:41.460 --> 00:34:43.020]   well, fine, if you're gonna break my rules,
[00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:45.020]   you are no longer in a teak.
[00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:48.100]   So you can't use my last name
[00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:50.660]   because you are no longer a part of this family.
[00:34:50.660 --> 00:34:54.100]   You are now just Noah or just Andrew,
[00:34:54.100 --> 00:34:56.460]   kind of like Pink or Usher.
[00:34:56.460 --> 00:34:59.140]   Like you are now just Jake
[00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:00.380]   'cause you're no longer in a teak.
[00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:02.640]   No, that's not how it works.
[00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:05.100]   They will always be in a teak.
[00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:11.060]   But when they sin against me, it disrupts our intimacy.
[00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:16.140]   It is good and right for them to come
[00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:17.980]   and to ask my forgiveness.
[00:35:17.980 --> 00:35:20.020]   That's what we've taught our kids to do
[00:35:20.020 --> 00:35:21.820]   and we try and model that for them.
[00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:24.300]   And when they ask forgiveness, you know what it does?
[00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:28.780]   It allows me to embrace them and extend forgiveness
[00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:30.580]   and it draws us back to one another.
[00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:32.620]   Same thing with God.
[00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:36.740]   If God is our heavenly father, when we sin against God,
[00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:37.820]   you know what prayer is?
[00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:42.820]   It is a vehicle to bring us back into intimacy with God.
[00:35:42.820 --> 00:35:46.880]   When we sin, God doesn't give up on us and say,
[00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:49.460]   well, fine, you're no longer my kid.
[00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:54.340]   But sin will absolutely disrupt intimacy with God.
[00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:57.300]   And so confession should be a normal,
[00:35:57.300 --> 00:36:00.700]   a daily routine for us where we are coming to God
[00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:02.860]   and we are asking forgiveness for the ways
[00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:05.540]   that we have lived contrary to his ways
[00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:07.780]   and it pulls us in close to God.
[00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:10.360]   But there's also a horizontal component to things.
[00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:12.860]   That's why Jesus says for us to pray,
[00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:17.860]   forgive us our debts as we also have forgiven our debtors.
[00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:21.680]   That there is a horizontal component
[00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:24.180]   to maintaining the health of the spiritual family
[00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:26.460]   because we as brothers and sisters in Christ,
[00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:27.800]   we are going to hurt each other,
[00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:30.180]   we are going to wrong one another.
[00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:33.100]   And that will impact our intimacy with God as well.
[00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:37.540]   It's kind of like this, if my son Noah gets mad at Andrew
[00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:39.860]   and he refuses to sit at the dinner table
[00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:41.980]   because Andrew is at the dinner table,
[00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:47.020]   that impacts his relationship with me.
[00:36:47.020 --> 00:36:49.820]   Because by being unwilling to sit at the table with Andrew,
[00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:54.140]   he is also unwilling to sit at the table with me.
[00:36:54.140 --> 00:36:57.620]   And I'm not gonna act like everything is okay.
[00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:03.380]   And so one of the ways that we maintain health
[00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:06.460]   in the family is through prayer,
[00:37:06.460 --> 00:37:09.060]   is by extending forgiveness to one another.
[00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:10.260]   And one of the ways that we do that
[00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:14.140]   is by asking God for strength through prayer
[00:37:14.140 --> 00:37:16.380]   to forgive those who have wronged us
[00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:20.100]   and to ask for forgiveness from those we have wronged.
[00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:22.620]   It's hard to hate someone that you're praying for.
[00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:27.560]   The reality is that sometimes we don't wanna forgive
[00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:31.580]   those who have hurt us, and yet God has forgiven us.
[00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:34.980]   When we refuse to forgive, it's like we're saying,
[00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:38.380]   "God, I deserved for you to forgive me,
[00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:42.560]   "but this person doesn't deserve for me to forgive them.
[00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:46.120]   "What I did against you was forgivable.
[00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:48.860]   "What this person has done against me is unforgivable."
[00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:51.480]   And it just shows a misunderstanding
[00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:54.300]   of the gravity of your sin.
[00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:57.460]   Prayer is one of the things that keeps health in the family.
[00:37:57.460 --> 00:38:00.340]   So we wanna pray with humility, where we just say,
[00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:03.780]   "God, you are God and I'm not.
[00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:05.780]   "Would you forgive me
[00:38:05.780 --> 00:38:07.940]   "for the ways that I've sinned against you?
[00:38:07.940 --> 00:38:09.900]   "Would you give me the strength
[00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:12.520]   "to forgive those who have wronged me?
[00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:14.600]   "I will not walk in pride saying,
[00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:18.580]   "no, it'll be my way, and my way is unforgiveness.
[00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:20.760]   "No, we're gonna say, it's your way.
[00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:22.500]   "You have called me to forgive.
[00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:24.840]   "Give me the strength I need to take a step."
[00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:30.640]   And then finally, we wanna pray dependently.
[00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:32.460]   We wanna pray dependently.
[00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:36.440]   We gonna circle back now to verse 11,
[00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:38.860]   where Jesus encourages us to pray,
[00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:40.760]   "Give us this day our daily bread."
[00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:44.840]   Bread symbolizes the most basic of necessities.
[00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:48.820]   In the first century, workers would get paid by the day.
[00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:53.280]   So just imagine if one of them got sick for a few days,
[00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:56.220]   it could be tragic for them and their family.
[00:38:56.220 --> 00:39:00.460]   And so the picture here is of this daily reliance
[00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:04.320]   upon the Lord to supply what is needed.
[00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:07.960]   And so what this is,
[00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:11.400]   is this is an invitation to complete dependence.
[00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:12.620]   My friend John Elmore, he says,
[00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:17.620]   "There's a reason that Jesus encourages us to pray,
[00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:19.340]   "give us this day our daily bread."
[00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:23.420]   He doesn't say our monthly bread or our yearly bread,
[00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:25.260]   because what God wants most for us,
[00:39:25.260 --> 00:39:30.260]   he knows that the greatest joy is in dependence upon him.
[00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:35.980]   So he invites us into a dependent lifestyle,
[00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:39.900]   where we are dependent upon him for our greatest needs,
[00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:41.820]   every moment of the day.
[00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:45.060]   And we express that dependence through prayer.
[00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:46.660]   So I just want you to think,
[00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:49.940]   what is making you anxious right now?
[00:39:49.940 --> 00:39:51.280]   What is it?
[00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:55.540]   Like what causes that low leveling of anxiety in you?
[00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:58.260]   God wants to know about it.
[00:39:58.260 --> 00:39:59.860]   Yesterday, my five-year-old,
[00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:02.320]   he was so anxious about graduation,
[00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:03.580]   almost to the point of tears.
[00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:05.420]   Like when he walked down the aisle,
[00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:07.120]   Kat and I were like, "Jake!"
[00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:10.900]   And he was like five feet away and he wouldn't turn
[00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:12.860]   because he was just robotic,
[00:40:12.860 --> 00:40:14.620]   because he was just so anxious.
[00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:18.540]   He was carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders
[00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:20.420]   and me as his dad, Kat as his mom.
[00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:24.100]   We can see the anxiety that he was carrying.
[00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:25.380]   Why?
[00:40:25.380 --> 00:40:26.780]   Due to a lack of perspective.
[00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:28.200]   He couldn't see what we see.
[00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:30.540]   He didn't know what we knew,
[00:40:30.540 --> 00:40:35.300]   that he had everything he needed to make it.
[00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:38.180]   And he had people who cared about his wellbeing,
[00:40:38.180 --> 00:40:40.140]   who could lead him through.
[00:40:40.140 --> 00:40:43.940]   And the same is true with God.
[00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:45.460]   From our limited perspective,
[00:40:45.460 --> 00:40:48.760]   we think that we need to have everything in control.
[00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:50.980]   God will intentionally lead you into places
[00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:52.740]   that you cannot control.
[00:40:52.740 --> 00:40:53.620]   Why?
[00:40:53.620 --> 00:40:57.580]   So that you would begin to understand Colossians 1:17,
[00:40:57.580 --> 00:41:00.340]   which says that Jesus Christ is before all things
[00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:03.720]   and in him, all things hold together.
[00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:05.540]   Not in your understanding,
[00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:09.740]   but in Jesus's understanding of all things.
[00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:13.280]   So we pray dependently, not just for our daily needs,
[00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:16.860]   but also for the sake of victory.
[00:41:16.860 --> 00:41:18.820]   Jesus ends the prayer by saying,
[00:41:18.820 --> 00:41:21.940]   and lead us not into temptation,
[00:41:21.940 --> 00:41:24.300]   but deliver us from evil.
[00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:26.420]   It's interesting in the Greek,
[00:41:26.420 --> 00:41:28.820]   the word that's been translated temptation,
[00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:31.220]   it can also be translated testing.
[00:41:31.220 --> 00:41:34.100]   So it always depends on the context,
[00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:37.740]   whether the implication is testing or temptation.
[00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:40.180]   God never tempts us,
[00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:43.080]   but God will lead us into tough situations
[00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:46.180]   where our faith will be tested.
[00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:48.580]   And in those moments of trial,
[00:41:48.580 --> 00:41:50.380]   when our faith is being tested,
[00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:53.680]   our enemy, the devil,
[00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:57.380]   will use it as an opportunity to tempt us.
[00:41:57.380 --> 00:42:00.460]   Sometimes the greatest moments of trial
[00:42:00.460 --> 00:42:04.260]   are also the greatest moments of temptation.
[00:42:04.260 --> 00:42:07.180]   And so what Jesus is encouraging us to pray when he says,
[00:42:07.180 --> 00:42:09.020]   lead us not into temptation,
[00:42:09.020 --> 00:42:10.520]   he's encouraging us to pray,
[00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:12.900]   don't lead us into a season of testing.
[00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:17.060]   Like God, please don't lead me into difficult circumstances.
[00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:19.940]   But then he says to pray, but deliver us from evil.
[00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:21.300]   So here's the thought,
[00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:23.720]   God, please don't lead me into a tough season.
[00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:26.080]   But if you do,
[00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:29.100]   if you do deliver me from the evil one
[00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:32.620]   who will seek to tempt me and discourage me
[00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:36.480]   while you testing me are trying to strengthen my faith,
[00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:39.260]   the devil will seek to shatter my faith.
[00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:42.100]   So in those moments, guard me,
[00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:44.860]   protect me from the evil one.
[00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:47.860]   And I would just say, over the last year I've shared,
[00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:51.700]   the last year of my life has been the hardest year ever.
[00:42:51.700 --> 00:42:54.700]   And my faith has been tested
[00:42:54.700 --> 00:42:58.340]   and I'm a stronger Christian today than I was a year ago.
[00:42:58.340 --> 00:42:59.180]   Why?
[00:42:59.180 --> 00:43:01.620]   Because a season of testing has strengthened my faith.
[00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:02.780]   But all along the way,
[00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:05.100]   the devil has sought to tempt me.
[00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:05.920]   Why?
[00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:06.760]   To shatter my faith.
[00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:10.500]   He has tempted me to believe that God is not good
[00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:12.200]   and he's not worthy of my life.
[00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:15.520]   And he will do the same with you.
[00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:19.340]   And so Jesus gives us the Lord's prayer.
[00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:22.100]   That's a, it's a great place to start.
[00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:24.540]   Look, here's the reality.
[00:43:24.540 --> 00:43:29.500]   I wanna be one of the, I don't think we are done yet people
[00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:31.300]   when it comes to prayer.
[00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:32.780]   I don't wanna be one of the,
[00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:34.660]   I think we were done 30 minutes ago.
[00:43:34.660 --> 00:43:35.500]   Why?
[00:43:35.500 --> 00:43:37.720]   Because I wanna see the value in prayer.
[00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:39.600]   Like that's where I wanna be.
[00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:41.120]   And over the last couple of years,
[00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:44.840]   I've begun to see that the joy is in prayer.
[00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:48.000]   That prayer isn't about getting something from God,
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:52.280]   is it is about getting more of God.
[00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:54.840]   And that's what I want for you.
[00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:56.400]   That's what I want for me.
[00:43:56.400 --> 00:44:00.240]   And a great place to start is with the Lord's prayer.
[00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:01.920]   And so I hope and pray that this week
[00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:04.440]   you would use it as a framework.
[00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:05.800]   But I'll close by saying this.
[00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:06.960]   Some of you are here tonight
[00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:10.080]   and you don't have a relationship with Jesus Christ.
[00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:12.320]   It's interesting that in the first century,
[00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:17.000]   unbelievers were prohibited from praying the Lord's prayer.
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:18.520]   Why?
[00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:21.000]   Because it didn't make sense for someone to pray
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:24.780]   to God as father when they were not yet his child.
[00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:27.240]   And maybe you're here tonight
[00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:29.260]   and you're able to say that God is a father,
[00:44:29.260 --> 00:44:32.680]   but you're not able to say God is my father,
[00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:34.440]   my heavenly father.
[00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:37.040]   That only comes through faith in Jesus.
[00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:39.520]   Jesus says, "I am the way, the truth, and the life.
[00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:42.340]   "No one comes to the father except through me."
[00:44:42.340 --> 00:44:46.760]   If you wanna be able to know God as your heavenly father,
[00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:49.600]   if you wanna know his love and delight in you,
[00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:52.840]   it starts with you saying yes to Jesus Christ.
[00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:54.920]   Yes to his death, yes to his burial,
[00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:56.200]   yes to his resurrection,
[00:44:56.200 --> 00:44:59.360]   that he went to the cross to save you from your sins.
[00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:02.080]   You can know him tonight.
[00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:03.080]   Let's pray together.
[00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:21.000]   Lord, I thank you that you're a perfect father.
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:25.680]   I thank you that you love us deeply.
[00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:29.800]   Hallowed be your name.
[00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:31.580]   God, if you were to walk into the room,
[00:45:31.580 --> 00:45:33.800]   we would all fall on our faces.
[00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:35.040]   If you were to speak audibly,
[00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:38.080]   we would feel like we just nearly escaped death.
[00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:45.120]   And yet you call us close to you to be your children.
[00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:47.680]   I praise you for that, Lord.
[00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:50.460]   Your kingdom come, your will be done in our lives.
[00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:53.120]   Would you rule and reign in our hearts, Lord?
[00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:54.440]   God, you know what we need.
[00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:56.960]   God, I pray that you would supply us
[00:45:56.960 --> 00:45:58.120]   with what we need today,
[00:45:58.120 --> 00:46:02.000]   knowing that tomorrow will take care of itself, Lord.
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.380]   God, wherever there is unforgiveness in our hearts,
[00:46:04.380 --> 00:46:07.180]   would you empower us to forgive?
[00:46:07.180 --> 00:46:08.700]   Wherever we've sinned against you,
[00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:12.320]   would you reveal it that we might seek your forgiveness?
[00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:17.180]   And Lord, in the tough seasons of life,
[00:46:17.180 --> 00:46:19.080]   God, would you strengthen our faith?
[00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:20.580]   Would you protect us from the devil
[00:46:20.580 --> 00:46:21.940]   who would seek to discourage us?
[00:46:21.940 --> 00:46:23.620]   We need you.
[00:46:23.620 --> 00:46:25.100]   We love you.
[00:46:25.100 --> 00:46:27.620]   In Jesus' name, amen.
[00:46:27.620 --> 00:46:37.620]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
