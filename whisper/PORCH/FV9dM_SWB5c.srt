1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:21,620
 - Well, welcome to the porch.

3
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,680
 My name is Josiah and I'm so glad

4
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,300
 that you decided to tune in with us tonight

5
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,420
 wherever you're watching from across the country

6
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:28,400
 and even the world.

7
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,740
 Welcome and thank you friends in this room for being here.

8
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,000
 Appreciate that very much.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,960
 Well, hey, we've been in a series called a fact check

10
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,320
 over the last couple of weeks

11
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,160
 where we are facing really the truth about our faith

12
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,920
 and putting the claims of faith,

13
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,180
 putting the claims that we hold true as Christians

14
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,800
 for thousands of years to the test.

15
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,880
 We're putting these truths on trial, so to speak.

16
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,860
 And so week one, we talked about this claim

17
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:59,840
 that God is still good and bad things happen.

18
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,800
 Last week, we talked about this claim

19
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,160
 that the Bible is the actual words of God.

20
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,520
 And tonight we pull up to this claim

21
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,960
 that many of you are probably familiar with,

22
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,520
 and that's the claim,

23
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,280
 Christianity is the only true religion.

24
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,600
 And even when I think about that claim,

25
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,420
 I can't help but think, man, how do we know that?

26
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:25,680
 Like, how do we know that Christianity

27
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,640
 is the only true religion?

28
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,840
 Isn't it just like people's opinions?

29
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,120
 I mean, for so long,

30
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,440
 people just throw out different opinions here and there,

31
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,720
 and we love opinions, don't we?

32
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,960
 We live in a world where opinions are given freely.

33
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,800
 I mean, I love giving my own opinion.

34
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:46,360
 How many of you are watching "The Last Dance"?

35
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,680
 It's basically a documentary of the Chicago Bulls

36
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,080
 and Michael Jordan.

37
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,700
 It happens every Sunday night at 8 p.m.

38
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,540
 Man, I love it.

39
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:55,980
 I've been tuned in the last two weeks.

40
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:58,920
 And basically, they're just retracing

41
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,680
 what took place that final season

42
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,220
 where they had the dynasty together.

43
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,560
 Man, you should check it out for real,

44
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:09,020
 8 p.m. on Sunday night.

45
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,280
 And so I got to thinking

46
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,940
 as I was watching the last two weeks, I couldn't help,

47
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,180
 and I'm gonna go on record tonight

48
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,460
 to say that Michael Jordan

49
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:20,700
 is the greatest basketball player of all time.

50
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:25,120
 Facts, truth, like that, there's just no debate, man.

51
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,280
 You're wrong if you say anything different, period.

52
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,780
 But here's the deal.

53
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:35,140
 There's another debate going on in our culture right now.

54
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:37,540
 And this one is more serious

55
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,980
 than the greatest basketball player of all time,

56
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,340
 the GOAT, Jordan.

57
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,820
 And it's really not so clear.

58
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,860
 It has to do with the coronavirus,

59
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:50,500
 the pandemic that's plagued our nation and the world.

60
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:56,180
 And people are debating when should we get back to normal?

61
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:58,220
 How should we reopen the country?

62
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,000
 When should people go back to work?

63
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,460
 And man, if you've just turned on the news for five minutes,

64
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:07,140
 you'll see that, man, there's people debating all over

65
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:12,140
 when it comes to how we should restore our country.

66
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,700
 And it's pretty clear that everyone disagrees

67
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:18,980
 with what should be done.

68
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:24,580
 But it's just not clear on what is the right way.

69
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,740
 And everyone has their own opinions.

70
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,220
 And so I start there tonight

71
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,580
 because when I think about Christianity

72
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:31,580
 being the only religion,

73
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:34,400
 when I think about this word religion as a whole,

74
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:40,820
 it reminds me of where I found myself 15 years ago

75
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,840
 in my college apartment,

76
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:46,220
 where I just thought, hey, it's just really a matter

77
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,620
 of people's personal opinion.

78
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:50,340
 And we can't really know what religion is true.

79
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:53,540
 And for Christians to claim Christianity is the only way,

80
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:54,940
 man, that just seems narrow-minded.

81
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,140
 That seems exclusive.

82
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:58,700
 That just seems wrong.

83
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:02,660
 And then I began asking questions like,

84
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:05,420
 man, how can we be certain that Christianity

85
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:10,420
 is the right faith, the right religion?

86
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:12,780
 Is it because we grew up here in America?

87
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:15,140
 I mean, what about the kid that grew up Islam

88
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:17,120
 in that family?

89
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,420
 I mean, he really didn't have a shot, did he?

90
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:22,780
 And then I would ask questions like,

91
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:26,220
 things like, isn't it arrogant and unloving

92
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,200
 for God not to be welcoming to all?

93
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,020
 I mean, these were questions that I was asking critically

94
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,400
 and trying to get answers.

95
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,960
 And maybe tonight you're here or you're watching online

96
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,960
 and you're asking questions similar to what I asked

97
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:46,180
 when I found myself in my college apartment wondering,

98
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:49,060
 man, is there anything outside of what I see

99
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,020
 underneath the sun?

100
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:55,340
 And so most people, I would say, in our generation,

101
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:57,980
 we're known as the millennials, would say,

102
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:00,760
 hey, you know, really all religions are pretty much

103
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,780
 the same and we have facts to back it up.

104
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:06,040
 There's stats, I should say, on this thinking and belief.

105
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:11,040
 And here's where we get some of this data right here.

106
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:15,300
 It says, although 65% classify themselves as Christians,

107
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:20,300
 43% said that it doesn't matter what religious faith

108
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:24,820
 you follow because they all teach the same lessons.

109
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:30,740
 65% of people who claim to be Christians

110
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:35,740
 and 43% say that it really doesn't matter, just pick one.

111
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:41,460
 70% of all major, 70% of Christians

112
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:45,940
 and non-Christian religious groups say many religions

113
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:48,300
 lead to eternal life, that was USA Today.

114
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,900
 48% believe if a person is generally good

115
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,260
 or does enough good things for others,

116
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,940
 they will earn a place in heaven.

117
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:59,780
 50% believe that all people are eventually saved

118
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:03,020
 or accepted by God no matter what they do.

119
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:06,160
 But when you start saying, hey, Jesus is the only way,

120
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:11,040
 hey, there's only one way to get to God,

121
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,540
 that's when people are like, whoa, bro, like calm down,

122
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:17,300
 chill, that just does not, that seems way narrow-minded.

123
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,740
 Like that doesn't even seem like it's accurate, man.

124
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:22,960
 We live in 2020, what are you talking about?

125
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,500
 You just need to calm down.

126
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:28,420
 And so tonight, can we fact check that?

127
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:29,980
 We're going to fact check,

128
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,820
 is Christianity the only true religion?

129
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:35,180
 So tonight I want you to see that Christianity is exclusive.

130
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,740
 And before we finish, I want you to see

131
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:41,260
 that Christianity is also very inclusive.

132
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,680
 We're going to be in Acts chapter four,

133
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,900
 and the Bible is made up of the Old Testament

134
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,640
 and the New Testament, so if you go to Matthew,

135
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,780
 which is the first book of the New Testament,

136
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:53,260
 just go Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, and you'll find Acts,

137
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:55,420
 and we're going to be in Acts chapter four.

138
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,560
 And this is where Jesus died, he rose again,

139
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,100
 and his followers are now bold men

140
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:02,260
 because what they have seen Jesus do,

141
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:04,580
 and there's a man named Peter, one of his disciples,

142
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:09,180
 who stands up boldly, and he's on trial for his faith

143
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:12,060
 because he's preaching there is no other way.

144
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:15,780
 And this is what he says in verse 11.

145
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:20,220
 "Jesus is the stone you builders rejected."

146
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,540
 So he's getting very personal,

147
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,380
 which has become the cornerstone,

148
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,380
 or some translation says the chief cornerstone.

149
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:29,460
 In other words, hey, Jesus is the person

150
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:32,300
 that I'm staking my entire faith on.

151
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,740
 And then he goes on and says,

152
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:36,980
 makes a very exclusive statement in verse 12.

153
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:39,460
 He says, "Salvation is found in no one else,

154
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:43,680
 "for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind,

155
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,060
 "which we must be saved."

156
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,540
 Point number one, if you're taking notes,

157
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:51,360
 and I hope you are, Christianity is exclusive.

158
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,700
 Christianity is exclusive, like it makes exclusive claims

159
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,420
 like we see Peter making here.

160
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:58,100
 "For there is no other way by which man

161
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,660
 "can be made right with God."

162
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,180
 Really?

163
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,220
 Like, is that true?

164
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,840
 And our culture today is much like the culture

165
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,680
 Peter was living in.

166
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,700
 For you say that there is only one way to God,

167
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:09,540
 and people would say, no, man,

168
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:11,300
 that's just too rigid of thinking.

169
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,460
 Like, you need to get outside the box.

170
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,540
 Let's get all along.

171
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:15,380
 Let's just get along.

172
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:16,420
 Can we just not coexist?

173
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:18,740
 You know, that bumper sticker?

174
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,420
 And I guess you have to ask yourself,

175
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,860
 what do you mean when you say coexist?

176
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,660
 Do I mean, hey, we should accept people,

177
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:25,540
 we should love people?

178
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,340
 Absolutely.

179
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,260
 But if we think that, hey, man,

180
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,900
 we should just think that all religions

181
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,340
 lead to the same place,

182
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:36,880
 that's where we would draw the line as Christians.

183
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,780
 See, the Roman Empire was a pantheon of gods,

184
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:42,980
 very pluralistic, much like our day.

185
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,900
 They were okay with you having your gods

186
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,480
 and you having your gods over here,

187
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,760
 but as soon as you said, hey, there's only one God,

188
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,720
 that's when they raised hell.

189
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,660
 And so you want to divide a room?

190
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,920
 Just give God a name.

191
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:00,500
 Say Jesus is God.

192
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,520
 This is why we can't pray in schools anymore

193
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,180
 in the name of Jesus.

194
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:08,940
 If we pray, it's got to be an all type of faith

195
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,620
 type of prayer.

196
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,740
 And we just need to generalize God is God.

197
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:17,260
 Listen, I don't believe that

198
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:19,700
 we're becoming a godless nation.

199
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,420
 Like, I believe we're becoming a nation of many gods.

200
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,900
 Like, I don't believe we're becoming

201
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:26,660
 a godless nation in America.

202
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:29,660
 I just believe we're becoming a nation of many gods.

203
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,580
 And here's what I mean by that.

204
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:34,140
 The temperature and climate in America

205
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,460
 is much like the climate of Rome

206
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:39,160
 where Peter was put on trial.

207
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,440
 So you have this pluralistic culture,

208
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,620
 a culture of many gods,

209
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:43,860
 and when Peter stands up and says,

210
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:46,700
 hey, there is no other name under heaven

211
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:49,860
 by which men may be right with God,

212
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,500
 and that name is Jesus.

213
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,620
 That's when people start having problems

214
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,180
 and saying, Peter, you have your thing,

215
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:00,060
 we have our thing, let us just get along.

216
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,220
 Like, why do you have to specifically

217
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,860
 call out who that God is?

218
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:07,020
 And so, you know, at the end of the day,

219
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:09,660
 here in America, yeah, your God,

220
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:10,780
 you might not claim Jesus,

221
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,500
 you might not claim Buddha,

222
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,780
 you might not claim Islam,

223
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,900
 but listen, your God might be sports.

224
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,340
 Your God might be money.

225
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:20,960
 Your God might be food.

226
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,880
 Like, it just looks different.

227
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,040
 Or your God might just be

228
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,560
 more of the secular humanism route

229
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,420
 where you just become your own God.

230
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:31,240
 I don't believe that we're becoming a godless nation.

231
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:35,360
 I believe we're becoming a nation of many gods.

232
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,280
 And listen, you've probably heard this argument before,

233
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:41,800
 but you have never heard that all roads

234
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,320
 lead to the same conclusion

235
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,540
 from someone who's really studied

236
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,840
 the different faith systems.

237
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,760
 And I would contend that not every religion

238
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,520
 and I would contend that every religion

239
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:57,080
 and every major belief system at its core is exclusivity.

240
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:57,980
 Let me explain.

241
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,560
 We'll start with Islam.

242
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:03,160
 This comes from the Quran, the holy writings of Islam.

243
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,240
 Directly from the Quran, it says this,

244
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:09,200
 "And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam,

245
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,640
 "it will never be accepted of him.

246
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:16,640
 "And in the hereafter, he will be one of the losers."

247
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,280
 He'll be one of the losers.

248
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,840
 Like that just seems pretty exclusive.

249
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,300
 It also says in the Quran that,

250
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,000
 "They have certainly disbelieved

251
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,060
 "who say that Allah is Christ, the son of Mary.

252
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:31,700
 "Allah has forbidden him in paradise and his refuge is fire."

253
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,820
 This feels pretty exclusive to me.

254
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,600
 I mean, it goes on and says,

255
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,360
 "Hey, basically, hey, if you're a Christian,

256
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,200
 "you're following Jesus,

257
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,760
 "then your eternal destiny is hell."

258
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,720
 Says it pretty plainly.

259
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,920
 Let's go to Hinduism,

260
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:52,160
 which many believers or people that think about Hinduism,

261
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,520
 the belief of Hinduism,

262
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:57,520
 and even people that have looked into Hinduism,

263
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,320
 says it's a very inclusive religion.

264
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,280
 This comes directly from the Bhagavad Gita,

265
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,540
 Bhagavad Gita, the holy writings of Hinduism.

266
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,880
 This is Krishna, one of the Hindu gods speaking,

267
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,660
 and this is what he says.

268
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:12,760
 "Those who are without faith in my teaching

269
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:16,920
 "cannot attain Krishna," or in other words, enlightenment.

270
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:21,180
 "I permeate all the universe in my unmanifest form.

271
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,360
 "All beings exist within me."

272
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,200
 So he basically is saying,

273
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,800
 hey, if you don't accept this view, then you don't exist.

274
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:31,800
 And we know that Hinduism, they have a different outcome,

275
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,280
 a different heaven.

276
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,240
 They don't even believe in heaven.

277
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,560
 They believe in reincarnation.

278
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,260
 They believe that you'll come back to life

279
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:40,740
 as an animal or another person.

280
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:43,320
 Then there's Buddhism.

281
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,800
 Buddhism says this from the holy writings of Buddhism

282
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:51,600
 in the passage, oddly enough, entitled "The Way,"

283
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,520
 which quite frankly,

284
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:56,440
 that's what Christians called themselves.

285
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,280
 Early on, they called themselves "The Way."

286
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:02,200
 It says this, "Buddhism is the only path,"

287
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,080
 feels pretty exclusive.

288
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,860
 "There is none other for the purification of insight.

289
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:11,140
 "Walking upon this path, you will make an end of suffering."

290
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,720
 That just feels pretty exclusive.

291
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,560
 Then you go to Judaism, the Jewish faith,

292
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,440
 and it expresses itself in the concept of chosen people.

293
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:24,160
 Like the Jews believe that they are exclusively

294
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,260
 God's chosen people.

295
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:31,260
 You see this idea of exclusivity again.

296
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:36,020
 And so all these faith claims have exclusivity written

297
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:38,360
 at the core of who they are.

298
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,360
 And so when we pull up to the Christian faith,

299
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,440
 like it shouldn't surprise you at all

300
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:47,040
 that at the core of the Christian faith is exclusivity.

301
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,440
 Turn with me to John 14, verse six.

302
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,560
 Jesus makes an audacious claim.

303
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,160
 And this is what he says in John 14, six.

304
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:01,160
 "Jesus answered, 'I am the way, I am the truth,

305
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,940
 "'and I am the life.

306
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:07,040
 "'No one comes to the Father except through me.'"

307
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:07,880
 In other words, he's saying,

308
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,960
 there's no way else to interpret this.

309
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:14,280
 Like he's saying, hey, he's the way,

310
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:17,000
 he's the truth, and he's the life.

311
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,200
 Very exclusive.

312
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,960
 No one gets to God except through Jesus.

313
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,920
 Jesus is not saying he's a way.

314
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,520
 He is saying he is the way.

315
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,160
 And what's crazy here is all religions

316
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,480
 contradict each other.

317
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:34,040
 So to say they're all right is to say they're all wrong.

318
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,160
 Like, let me say that again.

319
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:38,240
 All religions contradict each other.

320
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,440
 If they're saying they're all right

321
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,900
 is to say they're all wrong.

322
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:45,880
 And so this is where we have to, man, use our brain.

323
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,200
 Like, man, when you follow Jesus

324
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,200
 and you examine the evidence,

325
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,480
 like it's not like some lobotomy

326
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,800
 where you just check your brain at the door.

327
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,200
 And it's not brain surge.

328
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:58,600
 Like you actively think about what is at stake here

329
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,480
 and the evidence that we have.

330
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,920
 And so if someone says all religions are right,

331
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,680
 they speak from a position of ignorance.

332
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:09,640
 Like, I don't mean to be insulting or rude in any way.

333
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,460
 It's just a fact.

334
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,840
 All religions contradict themselves

335
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,400
 on the basis of exclusivity.

336
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,800
 And so what we've done in our culture

337
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,600
 is we've just watered down everything

338
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,400
 and we've gotten drunk on tolerance.

339
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,960
 I mean, we just watered down everything

340
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,280
 and just gotten drunk on tolerance.

341
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,560
 Let's just accept every way.

342
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,520
 Let me explain it like this.

343
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:37,000
 I was quarantined for, and many of you too,

344
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,120
 I mean, just the expectations of the CDC

345
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,120
 and what's coming out.

346
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,160
 And there was a moment where I thought I actually had it,

347
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,920
 but I didn't, but I was quarantined.

348
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,880
 And many of you, man, you've been laid up in your house

349
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,120
 and hanging out and having a lot of time.

350
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,240
 And so what I know about this season

351
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,160
 is that when I get outside of this season,

352
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,420
 like I wanna get out.

353
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,160
 Like I wanna go explore something.

354
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,680
 Like I haven't even been able to vacation

355
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,760
 or go hang out anywhere.

356
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,520
 And so imagine with me,

357
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:10,760
 imagine with me that the CDC comes out and they said,

358
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,280
 hey, everything's good to go.

359
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:16,400
 And things begin to open back up and the coronavirus,

360
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,260
 man, there's no trace of that anymore.

361
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:22,060
 Like our nation is healed pretty much, right?

362
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:24,680
 And I'll just be honest, like,

363
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,040
 hey, one of the first things I'm gonna do,

364
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,400
 it's like, I'm gonna buy a plane ticket.

365
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,280
 And so imagine you bought a plane ticket

366
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,160
 and you're like, hey, I'm gonna go out to,

367
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,200
 I'm gonna go to Destin, Florida.

368
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,440
 It seems like a pretty good time of year to go to the beach,

369
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,280
 white sands, clear water,

370
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,940
 man, we're gonna go to Destin, it's gonna be amazing.

371
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:43,920
 And so you get your ticket and you show up to the airport

372
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,600
 and you begin to look for your ticket

373
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,840
 and you can't find your ticket anywhere.

374
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,400
 And you don't know where to board,

375
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,400
 you don't know what plane to get on.

376
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,040
 And I come up to you, I see that you're distressed, right?

377
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,000
 I see that, man, you're freaking out.

378
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,800
 And I just come up to you and I just say,

379
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:05,520
 hey, don't worry about it, I see that you're stressed.

380
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,440
 Hey, don't worry about it,

381
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,880
 just jump on any one of these planes,

382
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,400
 go to any terminals and whatever plane you get on,

383
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,600
 it's gonna take you to Destin, Florida.

384
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,480
 Like you're gonna get there, it's gonna be fine.

385
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,120
 And in that moment, like, man, you're thankful,

386
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,920
 you appreciate that I've given you a solution.

387
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:26,800
 And, but what happens is you get on the plane

388
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:30,400
 and you're not that appreciative because you end up in,

389
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,320
 let's just say you end up in China, right?

390
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,440
 And at the end of the day, you end up there

391
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,400
 and when you get there, you're gonna realize

392
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,560
 that one of the most unloving things that I could have done

393
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,840
 is just told you, hey, there's just,

394
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,960
 anyway, just pick a plane, get on.

395
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,320
 That would be very unloving.

396
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,560
 And you would find out that I'm a liar.

397
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:53,560
 And so my whole point in this illustration

398
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:56,400
 is I'm making here is that all religions can't be true.

399
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,480
 And it's unloving to say they're all true,

400
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,720
 but it's unloving to say they all lead to the same place

401
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,520
 because religions are exclusive.

402
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,680
 Christianity is exclusive, Jesus is exclusive.

403
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,400
 So here's the dilemma that we find ourselves in.

404
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,960
 If every religion claims to be right,

405
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:17,720
 how do we know which religion is right?

406
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,560
 Great question.

407
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:22,800
 I wanna take the next few minutes that I have

408
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:27,120
 to unpack this and to share with you why I believe

409
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,920
 and why we believe as Christians

410
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:32,400
 that it is really the one true religion.

411
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,920
 Point number two, if you're taking notes,

412
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:38,960
 Christianity is the most inclusive.

413
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,320
 Christianity is the most inclusive of them all.

414
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,680
 Wait, bro, you just told me that Christianity is exclusive.

415
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,440
 So how can you now tell me it's inclusive?

416
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,560
 Here's what I mean by this.

417
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,080
 There is one way, that way is Jesus.

418
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,720
 But that one way is for everyone.

419
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,720
 It includes everyone, no matter your past,

420
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,520
 no matter your family, no matter your upbringing,

421
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:03,520
 no matter your socioeconomic status, right?

422
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,320
 Like it's for everybody, no matter your current religion,

423
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,880
 no matter if you're rich or poor,

424
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,400
 whether you're red, yellow, black, or white,

425
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,080
 it is for everyone.

426
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,720
 Like we find at the core of Christianity,

427
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:19,080
 this verse that is familiar with most of the world.

428
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,800
 I mean, we see signs of them holding this verse up

429
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,640
 in the end zone of football games.

430
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,600
 And the verse is John 3, 16.

431
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:32,880
 For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only son

432
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,400
 that whosoever believes in him shall not perish

433
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,560
 but have everlasting life.

434
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:42,880
 Not whoever behaves, whoever believes,

435
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,480
 not whoever looks a certain way,

436
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,600
 not whoever does enough deeds,

437
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,760
 but who believes seems inclusive to me.

438
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,080
 Christianity created the most inclusive community.

439
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:58,280
 Greeks and Romans didn't mix rich and poor, but Jesus did.

440
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:04,040
 Jews didn't mix races or nationalities, but Jesus did.

441
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,600
 Paul would pick up on this in Galatians 3, 28,

442
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,800
 where he says, "There is neither Jew nor Gentile,

443
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:12,080
 "nor either slave nor free, nor there's male nor female."

444
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,200
 You know how women got their rights?

445
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,600
 It was through Christianity.

446
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:18,120
 He says this, Jesus says this through Paul,

447
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:21,840
 "For you are all one in Christ Jesus."

448
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,080
 What Paul is saying is the ground

449
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,840
 at the foot of the cross is level.

450
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,880
 In other words, we all come into this place

451
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,960
 imperfect people with real problems,

452
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,560
 and Jesus extends to every single one of us the grace.

453
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,480
 In all, everybody who walks planet earth,

454
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,960
 there's an invitation and an opportunity to life

455
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,040
 and life abundantly because of what Jesus

456
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,400
 has done on the cross.

457
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,080
 Paul would say in Romans 10, 13, "For everyone,"

458
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,920
 that seems really inclusive,

459
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,720
 "For everyone who calls on the name of the Lord

460
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,640
 "will be saved."

461
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:57,060
 It's the only religion on the planet

462
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:59,400
 that wherever you are right now in this moment,

463
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,640
 you can sit and cry out to God

464
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,540
 based on what he's done for you.

465
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:08,440
 And he will grant you forgiveness

466
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,160
 and eternal life forever and ever.

467
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:13,360
 It's not based on what you do,

468
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,360
 but it's based on what he's done.

469
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,360
 See, I challenge you tonight,

470
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,200
 like when we finish up,

471
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:21,520
 like just jump on Google and just Google this.

472
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,600
 "How do I convert to Hinduism?

473
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,060
 "How do I convert to Buddhism?

474
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:29,680
 "How do I convert to Islam?"

475
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,680
 Here's what you're gonna find.

476
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,960
 At the core of all these religions,

477
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,120
 you're gonna find you have to do these things.

478
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,320
 At the center of these religions,

479
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,680
 you're gonna have to strive to walk this path,

480
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,560
 to hold up these pillars,

481
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,720
 to pray for forgiveness in this direction

482
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,360
 for this many times a day.

483
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:49,120
 You're gonna need to take a pilgrimage to a place.

484
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,480
 You're gonna need to do these things.

485
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,460
 And then maybe you can get to heaven.

486
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:55,280
 So you see, it's all about striving.

487
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,120
 Why?

488
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,220
 Because religion breeds insecurity

489
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:00,680
 because you never know if you've done enough.

490
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:04,660
 But a relationship breeds security.

491
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:09,520
 And a relationship that's marked by unconditional love

492
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:15,440
 and what you find is that when you die,

493
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,720
 if you're pursuing one of these other religions,

494
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,440
 you stand before whatever the God is

495
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,040
 and he will determine whether you've done enough.

496
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:24,040
 And that just seems exhausting, friends.

497
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,060
 That seems crazy to me.

498
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:29,260
 In Matthew 11, 28, Jesus says to me,

499
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:31,840
 "Come to me all who are weary and burdened

500
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,400
 "and I will put you to work."

501
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:37,720
 No, he says, "And I will give you rest."

502
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,200
 And I'll give you rest.

503
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,400
 Think of it like this.

504
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,280
 I have two little girls, I call them my muchachicas.

505
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,120
 I love them.

506
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:47,960
 I have a four-year-old,

507
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,720
 almost a four-year-old and a two-year-old,

508
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,040
 Camille and Isabella.

509
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,360
 There they are.

510
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:56,520
 Camille's almost four and Isabella's about to turn two.

511
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,840
 And so imagine,

512
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,480
 imagine my four-year-old Camille

513
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,480
 who loves to sing and dance comes up to me and says,

514
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:08,140
 "Daddy, daddy, do you like how I sing and dance?

515
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:11,000
 "Is it enough to be a Jones?"

516
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:11,960
 And I'm like, "What?

517
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,840
 "Like, what do you mean?"

518
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,360
 And then she comes up to me again and she said,

519
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:19,560
 "Daddy, daddy, do you love my painting?

520
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,120
 "Is it enough to be a Jones?"

521
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,520
 That's her last name.

522
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:25,420
 And I'm like, "Baby, baby, what are you talking about?

523
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:28,180
 "Of course, of course it is.

524
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,400
 "You're my daughter.

525
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,300
 "I was there when you came into the world.

526
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:34,200
 "I know more about you than you know about yourself.

527
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,100
 "Baby, you don't have to do anything to earn my approval.

528
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:40,980
 "I love you based on who you are in our relationship.

529
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,520
 "You're my daughter,

530
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:45,280
 "not because of what you can do for me."

531
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,160
 And some of you, man,

532
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:50,900
 you have a really skewed view of the God of the cosmos,

533
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:53,380
 of who Jesus is.

534
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:56,660
 Because you grew up with a father

535
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:58,760
 who only affirmed you when your performance

536
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,180
 was at an all-time high,

537
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:02,060
 who only loved you when you could perform

538
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:05,020
 and get all the As,

539
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:09,920
 or you performed well on the sports field or the court.

540
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:13,340
 And some of you have a really skewed view of God

541
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:16,540
 because you don't see God as a loving father.

542
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:18,820
 You see God as someone that wants to strike you down

543
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:21,200
 with lightning every time you fail.

544
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:29,540
 And so religion breeds insecurity of asking the question,

545
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:30,380
 "Have I done enough?

546
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:32,140
 "Have I done enough?

547
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:33,240
 "Am I good enough now?

548
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,460
 "Am I good enough now?

549
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:36,400
 "And my relationship with my daughter

550
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,280
 "is built on unconditional love.

551
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,660
 "Like she doesn't have to do anything

552
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:44,760
 "for me to love her.

553
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,940
 "And when she gets it wrong,

554
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,420
 "daddy steps in."

555
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:54,580
 And yeah, I rebuke, I discipline.

556
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:58,320
 But I say, "Baby, I do that because I love you,

557
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,520
 "not because I'm out to get you.

558
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,260
 "And my love isn't gonna run out

559
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,760
 "because of who you are,

560
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:09,680
 "not because of what you do or don't do."

561
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,520
 And in the same way,

562
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:15,160
 this is a picture of our relationship with God.

563
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,960
 And God loves you.

564
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,060
 All of us are invited into this relationship.

565
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:21,000
 You see, Christianity is a story of a God

566
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,740
 who wants a relationship with you and I,

567
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:24,960
 that we rebelled against the creator

568
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:29,640
 and we pursued created things above the creator himself.

569
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:34,660
 And he came down over 2000 years ago

570
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:37,220
 in the form of a babe, Christmas.

571
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:39,120
 And he grew in wisdom and stature.

572
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,720
 And he lived the life that you and I could never live.

573
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,860
 He was perfect in thought, word and action.

574
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:48,660
 Categories that I fall into every day.

575
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:51,420
 And because of that,

576
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:53,400
 it made him the only eligible one to die on the cross

577
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,680
 for your sin and my sin.

578
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,860
 And on the cross, all of our sin was poured out on him.

579
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:00,020
 And he soaked up every last ounce of God's wrath,

580
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:02,340
 the wrath that should have been poured out on you and me.

581
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,820
 Why? Because of our sin.

582
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:06,180
 For the wages of sin is death.

583
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:08,300
 See, he died the death that we deserve.

584
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:12,820
 And we get the life that he deserved.

585
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:13,980
 It's called the great exchange.

586
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:17,000
 It's a beautiful picture of redemption.

587
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,660
 Christianity is the only religion

588
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:22,380
 where we find a God who suffers.

589
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,460
 Every other religion says,

590
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:28,300
 "Hey, you have to suffer to get to God by doing X, Y, or Z."

591
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,340
 You see, religion breeds insecurity

592
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:34,740
 because you never know if you've done enough.

593
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:39,000
 But an unconditional loving relationship breeds security.

594
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,220
 And so this is where I would differ

595
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:43,180
 with those people who say Christianity is a religion.

596
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,660
 I would say, "No, it's not."

597
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:45,880
 At the heart of Christianity,

598
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:50,220
 you will find a God who is crazy about you,

599
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:53,820
 who loves you and wants to have a relationship with you.

600
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:58,820
 The God of the cosmos wants to have a relationship.

601
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,300
 I just think that's crazy.

602
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,060
 Like when I try to wrap my mind around that,

603
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:05,260
 it just seems wild that I don't have to do anything

604
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:07,660
 for this relationship that's already done.

605
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:10,240
 On the cross, he said, "It is finished."

606
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,260
 It means you can't do anything else.

607
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:18,340
 And so how would you want the God of the universe

608
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,340
 to pay for your sin?

609
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:23,180
 I would argue that anything less

610
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:25,020
 than Jesus dying on the cross

611
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:32,200
 would lessen our ability to see how much Jesus loves us.

612
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:37,240
 Anything less than Jesus dying on the cross

613
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:40,840
 would lessen our ability to see how much he loves us.

614
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,580
 I mean, John 15, 13 says,

615
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:45,920
 "Greater love has no one than this

616
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:49,240
 "to lay down his life for one's friends."

617
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,320
 Do you know this God?

618
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,280
 His name is Jesus.

619
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:57,000
 In closing, remember how I opened up?

620
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,800
 With what's the way forward for our country?

621
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,720
 I mean, people are coming out and debating and saying,

622
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,680
 "Hey, this is the way, this is what we need to do

623
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,000
 "to reopen the country.

624
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,560
 "Hey, we need to keep everything closed.

625
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:13,080
 "It's not over, it's gonna get worse."

626
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,580
 And so people are saying,

627
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:18,380
 "How do we restore the things that are broken

628
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:21,400
 "because of this pandemic?"

629
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,760
 And the truth of the matter is this.

630
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,480
 We're gonna have to have a cure.

631
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:31,200
 Or some type of vaccine to restore the havoc

632
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,280
 that's been caused by the coronavirus.

633
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:36,760
 And so I say that because in the same way,

634
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,880
 Jesus is our cure.

635
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,280
 Like Jesus is our cure.

636
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,840
 Spiritually.

637
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:49,660
 Left to yourself, left to myself.

638
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:55,800
 Man, we're gonna shipwreck our life if you haven't already.

639
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,360
 You have to bankrupt your life.

640
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,680
 The Bible says in Proverbs 14, 12,

641
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,680
 that there's a way that seems right to man,

642
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,080
 but that way ends in death.

643
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,560
 And I've experienced that.

644
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:11,800
 That same year, 15 years ago in my college apartment,

645
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,600
 I was playing college baseball,

646
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,500
 chasing everything underneath the sun.

647
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:18,840
 Only to find out I couldn't grab on to anything.

648
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,880
 It just, like I was chasing the wind.

649
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,300
 And for so long, I would compare my life

650
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,440
 to the rest of the world.

651
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,280
 And when you do that,

652
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,960
 you can always find someone worse than you,

653
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,800
 which gives you security in the fact

654
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,480
 that you're not that bad, right?

655
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:35,800
 And so like some of you, frankly, tonight,

656
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:39,100
 like you just don't see a need for Christ.

657
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:42,160
 Because you don't see your depravity.

658
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,600
 You don't see your sin for what it is

659
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,720
 in light of a holy God.

660
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:49,960
 You've never experienced the God of the universe who came

661
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:53,520
 for you and I.

662
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,440
 He died on the cross.

663
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,840
 Scripture says in history of court

664
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:00,040
 that he defeated the grave, Easter, right?

665
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,280
 That's what we celebrate.

666
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:05,000
 And he says, "The ball's in your court."

667
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,680
 What are you gonna do with Jesus?

668
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:13,320
 When he showed up, he reset the calendar.

669
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,960
 You know, the calendar that's on your phone right now?

670
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:19,320
 He reset the calendar.

671
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,700
 The Bible is the best selling book of all time.

672
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,880
 What are you gonna do with Jesus?

673
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:29,080
 The message of Jesus has stood the test of time.

674
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:31,280
 We're still talking about this God today.

675
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,640
 He's still changing lives.

676
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:37,040
 Even tonight, some of you are gonna have your life altered

677
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:41,680
 for all of eternity because God is moving in your heart.

678
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,720
 It's nothing that I've said.

679
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,680
 It's the God of the universe that's speaking

680
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,280
 to you right now.

681
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,580
 Do you know this God?

682
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:54,900
 Let me pray that you would tonight.

683
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:57,220
 God in heaven,

684
00:30:57,220 --> 00:31:01,980
 would you do what no man can do?

685
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:05,780
 And would you have your way?

686
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:12,300
 And God, would you allow people to see who you are?

687
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:19,180
 Allow them to see the beauty of what you've done?

688
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,760
 (gentle music)

689
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:26,440
 That there is no other name

690
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:31,560
 in heaven in which men must be saved.

691
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,860
 The name of Jesus.

692
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:36,400
 May you do what you've always done.

693
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,500
 May you arrest hearts in this place.

694
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:41,220
 And those that are watching online,

695
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:43,380
 would you have your way?

696
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:48,620
 God, we love you.

697
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,040
 And we worship you now in song.

698
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:52,880
 Christ's name.

699
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,920
