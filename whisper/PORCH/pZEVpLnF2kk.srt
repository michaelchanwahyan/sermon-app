1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:12,880
 - All right.

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:13,720
 (audience cheering)

4
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,560
 Hey, guys.

5
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,480
 Good to see y'all.

6
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,600
 See, I like this because normally at church,

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,680
 when they tell you to greet people,

8
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,280
 you like nod at one person.

9
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,600
 You're like, "Greetings," and then sit.

10
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,080
 Y'all were like making connections, exchanging numbers.

11
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:27,920
 This was fun.

12
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,620
 Well, hey, it is an honor to be here with you.

13
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:33,920
 Like I said earlier, my name's Ben Stewart.

14
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,600
 I'm a pastor, just moved to Washington, D.C.,

15
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,160
 so pray for us.

16
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,000
 My wife and I moved up there

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,760
 because it's a city of young people.

18
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,580
 One out of every three people in the district

19
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:45,840
 is between the ages of 20 and 35.

20
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,000
 And we moved there because my passion and heartbeat

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,760
 is to meet people right in your range of life,

22
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,960
 many of you, that are making huge decisions

23
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,680
 and are willing to leverage your life

24
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,880
 for some things that matter most.

25
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,760
 So it's exciting for us to be there,

26
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,960
 but man, it's good to be home back in Texas.

27
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,960
 It's good to be here at The Porch

28
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,080
 because I know many of you know this,

29
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,720
 but if you're visiting and don't,

30
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:11,000
 the leadership here is absolutely incredible.

31
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,680
 And these are some amazing men and women.

32
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,520
 Yeah.

33
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:20,200
 Jonathan Picluda, one of God's gifts

34
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,880
 to young people alive today.

35
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,520
 And man, last time I was here,

36
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,440
 The Porch was just a humble little ministry

37
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,040
 to thousands of people in Dallas.

38
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,480
 And now you're like in El Paso and Oklahoma

39
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,520
 and Switzerland and everywhere else.

40
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,960
 And in Houston, which is just amazing.

41
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,080
 And so if you're in Houston watching this,

42
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,040
 we're praying for you and we love you.

43
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,320
 And we're with you as you're going through

44
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,000
 all that's ahead of you in the days to come recovery.

45
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,280
 And it's an honor to pray with you.

46
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,160
 And man, what a cool place to be.

47
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,920
 So love you guys, honored to be here,

48
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,000
 honored to jump in right at the front end of a series

49
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,840
 on dating and relationships

50
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,200
 and to see what God might do with our time together.

51
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,440
 So let me pray for us and then we'll jump in together.

52
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,280
 Sound good?

53
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,240
 Father, I wanna thank you for every person here.

54
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:14,280
 God, whether they're here and church is their favorite thing,

55
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,800
 they mark it on the calendar,

56
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,000
 little alarms go off every Sunday

57
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,160
 that they can't wait to be in church, they love this place.

58
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,680
 Or whether they're here and aren't sure

59
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,840
 to think about any of this.

60
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,040
 Wherever we land on the spectrum of how we deal

61
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,560
 with rooms like this and moments like this,

62
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,000
 I just thank you God that we're here.

63
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,440
 In all different rooms in Fort Worth and El Paso

64
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,720
 and different places, we're here.

65
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:41,000
 And you've given us a moment to pause

66
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,280
 and to think about what our God thinks about us.

67
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,520
 And God, I pray as we think about what you think about

68
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,480
 that we would care about what you care about.

69
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,280
 And so God, I'm asking tonight

70
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,520
 that you not just change our thinking,

71
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,960
 but you change the way we feel and change the way we live.

72
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,440
 God, I feel like you want some young men and women

73
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:06,480
 to be different forever tonight, that this is their night.

74
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,960
 And I can't produce that, the porch can't, but you can God.

75
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,240
 And I just feel that tonight.

76
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,720
 And we just say yes to that God.

77
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,640
 And I wanna invite you if you're willing,

78
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,240
 you would take a minute and just ask him,

79
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,780
 say God, please teach me something tonight.

80
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:23,080
 (whispering)

81
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:27,420
 And then if you would, please pray for me

82
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:30,140
 that the Lord would use me and I'd be helpful to you.

83
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:38,740
 Well, Father, we love you and we trust you.

84
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:42,520
 Use this time and we pray that in Jesus' name, amen.

85
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,740
 Well, I became a youth pastor right out of college.

86
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:48,020
 And one of my favorite things to do

87
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,060
 is to take our students rappelling.

88
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:51,500
 And we would take them to some mountain

89
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,420
 somewhere in Colorado, and we'd go with one

90
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,980
 of those outfitters that had all the gear,

91
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:57,580
 had all the guides, and they would strap our kids in

92
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,580
 and then send them off the sides of cliffs.

93
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:04,140
 But every time we did it, these guys would circle us up

94
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,340
 and they'd give us the speech.

95
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,380
 And it always started the same way.

96
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,540
 The guide would get up front and he would say,

97
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:13,140
 I want you to know, every guide here today

98
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,500
 has been sending children off the side of mountains

99
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,100
 for over a decade.

100
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,620
 In that time, we've never lost a man, woman, or child.

101
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,840
 None of you will die today on the rocks below.

102
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,060
 Do you believe this?

103
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,680
 And as they would say it, all of us were like,

104
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:28,380
 we know, we know, we know, 'cause we'd heard it before.

105
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,900
 But he's undaunted.

106
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:33,820
 He would say, and this rope could hold over 6,000 pounds

107
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,500
 of weight, it could hold up a Buick with all of you

108
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:39,480
 inside it, wouldn't snap, twist, bend, break in the slightest.

109
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,380
 No one will die 'cause of faulty equipment today.

110
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,100
 And we were like, we know, we know.

111
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,780
 And on he would go to the Caribbeaners and whatnot,

112
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:49,340
 just explaining that we were gonna make it alive today.

113
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:52,020
 And we would all say we know 'cause we'd heard it.

114
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:56,420
 And then, when it came time to repel down the mountain,

115
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,540
 and many of you have been repelling.

116
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,340
 You know, when you repel, you don't climb down a mountain.

117
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,860
 You lean back onto the rope and you descend.

118
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:05,380
 As soon as that moment would start,

119
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:09,120
 half of the people would totally freak out.

120
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,420
 And weirdly, it was usually the guys.

121
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:15,700
 Which I don't know why that was.

122
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,700
 Like, I don't know if the guys just weren't paying attention

123
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,260
 during the instructions, like, wait, what are we doing?

124
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,420
 You know, or that.

125
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,020
 Or if it was the fact that the guide was like

126
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,980
 this young, cute guy that had huge biceps,

127
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,900
 like apparently everyone who works at Watermark.

128
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:30,220
 And he would just look in the girls' eyes and be like,

129
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,420
 just go ahead and lean back.

130
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:32,540
 And they were like, okay.

131
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,380
 And just off they would go.

132
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,440
 Like, all right.

133
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,140
 But it was the weirdest thing.

134
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:40,540
 Like, these guys would get to the edge of the cliff

135
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,900
 and they would get there and they would just go,

136
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,100
 wait, no, wait, no, stop.

137
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,620
 And you're like, like something was wrong.

138
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,300
 And you'd be like, what?

139
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,140
 Is the rope breaking?

140
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:50,980
 No.

141
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:53,100
 Is the carabiner snapping?

142
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:53,940
 No.

143
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,540
 Did he suddenly forget what he's doing?

144
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,540
 No.

145
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:59,900
 And yet on they would go, wait, hold on, no, wait, wait.

146
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:04,220
 And they would end up prolonging

147
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:07,320
 the absolute least enjoyable part of the experience.

148
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,340
 And it was a fascinating thing to watch.

149
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,500
 And you go, why are you even bringing this up?

150
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,540
 What does this have to do with anything?

151
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,320
 Because here's the deal.

152
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,580
 30 minutes before, you believe you're gonna make it.

153
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,960
 Yeah, I know, I know, I know.

154
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,340
 But when it comes time to trust it,

155
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:25,440
 your actions betray what you really believe.

156
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,260
 You go, why are you talking about that?

157
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:32,040
 Because in 1 John, we're in this series,

158
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,000
 kicking off this series, which I love this idea

159
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,620
 where it says, first comes love.

160
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:40,340
 And in 1 John, the word love shows up 46 times.

161
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:43,100
 46 times, John talks about love.

162
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,780
 27 of them in the passage we're gonna look at tonight

163
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,860
 in 1 John chapter four.

164
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:50,180
 And so the simple message of tonight is this.

165
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,980
 If you wanna know in advance, what's the message?

166
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,180
 Here's the message.

167
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,540
 You are loved.

168
00:06:55,540 --> 00:07:00,620
 And if you are in Christ, the most beautiful,

169
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:05,060
 powerful being in existence cherishes you.

170
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,580
 He likes you.

171
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:09,060
 He knows your name and he sees you tonight.

172
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:13,220
 But my guess is, when many of you hear that,

173
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:15,680
 you would say, I know.

174
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,220
 Like, that's your message tonight?

175
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,940
 Did you know God loves you?

176
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,700
 Uh, yeah.

177
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,260
 You flew here for that?

178
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,460
 Yes, I knew that.

179
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,020
 And yet, it's a fascinating thing.

180
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:29,340
 In 1 John four, he begins to tell us,

181
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:32,780
 he says in verse 16, so we have come to know

182
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:35,980
 and believe in the love God has for us.

183
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:38,260
 And then he gives us two attributes

184
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:40,420
 that characterize those who know

185
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:42,620
 and believe that God loves them.

186
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,580
 The first one's in verse 18.

187
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:47,220
 He says, there's no fear in love,

188
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,780
 but perfect love casts out fear,

189
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,460
 for fear has to do with punishment,

190
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:53,940
 and whoever fears has not been perfected in love.

191
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,780
 He says, the people who know and believe

192
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:01,660
 they are loved by God are characterized by a fearlessness.

193
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:05,060
 They're not an anxious people.

194
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,060
 The people who know that they know

195
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:10,380
 they're loved by God aren't stressed,

196
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,780
 not fearful, not anxious.

197
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:16,940
 There's a wonderful, sweet confidence about them.

198
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:20,600
 And not only are they fearless, they're free.

199
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,420
 They're free to love other people.

200
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,480
 And you see it in verse seven of the same chapter.

201
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,740
 He says, beloved, let us love one another,

202
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:30,620
 for love is from God, and whoever loves

203
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:33,140
 has been born of God and knows God.

204
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,540
 Fascinating thing about that.

205
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:37,140
 He says, beloved, let us love one another.

206
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,780
 And then he gives you a reason why, for,

207
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:42,100
 and he's gonna tell you why we should love one another.

208
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,260
 But it's a fascinating thing.

209
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,300
 He doesn't point downstream.

210
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,780
 He doesn't say love one another,

211
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,620
 and then God will reward you.

212
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:52,720
 Love one another, or else God will be mad and punish you.

213
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,300
 There's no pleasure offered or no threat offered,

214
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,440
 but he gives a reason.

215
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,280
 What is it?

216
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,820
 He says love one another, why?

217
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,900
 Because love is from God.

218
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,900
 He points upstream.

219
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:09,100
 And everyone who knows God and loves God loves others.

220
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,860
 The beloved love.

221
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:14,780
 Love embraced becomes love extended.

222
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,740
 It's the most natural thing.

223
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:20,460
 So those people who know and believe that God loves them

224
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:23,320
 have a freedom to love other people.

225
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,620
 They walk into rooms like this with open hearts

226
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:30,060
 and open hands to care about the other

227
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:32,500
 and the issues going on in your life.

228
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,940
 And so it's fascinating.

229
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:37,620
 If I gave you a quiz tonight,

230
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,340
 did you know you're loved by God?

231
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:42,100
 I bet most of you would get it right.

232
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,460
 Are you loved by God, true or false?

233
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,300
 True!

234
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:51,860
 But if I said, so your life is characterized

235
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:55,520
 by a fearlessness and freedom to love other people,

236
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,420
 I bet a lot of people in here would back away from that.

237
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,460
 Well, I don't know if that's true

238
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:00,940
 of how I roll into work every day.

239
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:03,860
 But those are the exact characteristics

240
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:06,580
 that are indicative of the person who knows

241
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,380
 and believes they're loved by God.

242
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,020
 So we say, yeah, I know it,

243
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:12,820
 but our actions betray what we really believe

244
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:13,860
 because here's the reality.

245
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,540
 We are afraid.

246
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,020
 We're an anxious people.

247
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:19,940
 And young people today have record levels of anxiety.

248
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:20,760
 Did you know that?

249
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,420
 Far more than your predecessors in this country.

250
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,880
 Anxiety marks this young generation.

251
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,360
 We are a fearful people.

252
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,540
 And you see it in dating.

253
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:32,800
 All the time when I talk to young people about dating,

254
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,660
 afraid that I'm gonna mess it up

255
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:37,300
 'cause I saw my parents mess up their marriage.

256
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,380
 Afraid that marriage might mess up my life.

257
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,820
 I have goals and somebody might derail me.

258
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,220
 Afraid I'm gonna miss out.

259
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,940
 Afraid that I'll never be satisfied.

260
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,420
 Afraid I'm not gonna meet the one.

261
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,820
 Afraid that if I commit to the one,

262
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:48,940
 I'll miss out on the other.

263
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,880
 Afraid I won't be sexually fulfilled.

264
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,180
 There's so much fear that marks our intimacy

265
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,820
 with one another, right?

266
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:58,760
 And because we're fearful, we're an anxious people.

267
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,200
 And because we're an anxious people,

268
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,460
 we're not free to love other people.

269
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,600
 So we walk into rooms like this.

270
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,800
 And rather than thinking about,

271
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,760
 I wonder how you're doing

272
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,040
 and how I can bless you in your life.

273
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,480
 We're worried about how do I look?

274
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,320
 Who sees me?

275
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,140
 Who noticed me?

276
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:11,980
 Who liked my post?

277
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:12,880
 Who sees me?

278
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,000
 Who values me?

279
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,180
 And we do things every day.

280
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,280
 We say things.

281
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:20,440
 And what's our sifting criteria for what we say?

282
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,960
 It's whether or not they'll think I'm funny.

283
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,800
 They'll think I'm cool.

284
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,720
 They'll think I'm wise.

285
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,640
 They'll think I'm valuable.

286
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,720
 They'll think I'm someone worth appreciating.

287
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,060
 I will be loved.

288
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:31,600
 We come in with a vacancy looking to fill it.

289
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,180
 Why?

290
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:35,280
 Because we are fearful.

291
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,480
 And we aren't free.

292
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:40,080
 And we're more insecure and inwardly focused

293
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,760
 than we are fearless and free.

294
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,480
 And here's the tragedy about that.

295
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:47,160
 The world is in desperate need of selfless love.

296
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,600
 It is.

297
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:52,880
 But you can't be a source if you don't have a source.

298
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,720
 You can't.

299
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,700
 So I remember a couple years ago,

300
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:00,100
 I had a friend go scuba diving.

301
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,640
 And she went with one of those crazy unsafe deals

302
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,520
 they do in the Caribbean where there's like,

303
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:07,260
 they just give you a 30 minute crash course on scuba,

304
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:11,020
 you know, and then just set you free in the ocean.

305
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,800
 And so she did that and they paired her up.

306
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,360
 They give you a swim buddy and they paired her up

307
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,040
 with this middle-aged guy.

308
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,400
 And they both have their own scuba tanks,

309
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,880
 but you're supposed to be swim buddies,

310
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,400
 you know, and point at fish together

311
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,960
 and just sort of enjoy the ocean together

312
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,240
 and just swim along.

313
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,440
 And then if there's a problem,

314
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,160
 they give you like a series of gestures.

315
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,600
 I don't know what it is to let one another

316
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,920
 if there's a problem.

317
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,160
 But the two of them are swimming along

318
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,900
 and then all of a sudden,

319
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:38,680
 something fails with this oxygen tank.

320
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:41,720
 Oxygen quits flowing, can't breathe.

321
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,880
 Now there was a protocol, series of hand gestures

322
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,520
 and then a slow ascent to the surface

323
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,040
 as they share her aerator.

324
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,880
 But as soon as he realized, man, there was a desperation,

325
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,320
 panic set in.

326
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,160
 Scarcity led to desperation,

327
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,760
 desperation, exploitation.

328
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,200
 He just grabbed her, began to shake her.

329
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,800
 And she's like, what is he doing?

330
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,220
 And then he grabbed the aspirator out of her mouth

331
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:07,120
 and shoved it into his mouth.

332
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,800
 And then he began to try to climb her like a ladder

333
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,200
 to get out of the water, which doesn't really work.

334
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,920
 What he was doing was drowning her, right?

335
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,960
 And so she was trying to figure out what is happening.

336
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,240
 This is not the hand gesture.

337
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,580
 And so finally she's having to like hit him back, right?

338
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,800
 To get him loose.

339
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,500
 And in a moment of panic, he just grabbed her

340
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,280
 because she had the oxygen tank on

341
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:29,520
 and he just swam full speed up to the top.

342
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,360
 Didn't adjust at all for depth,

343
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,160
 gave both of them the bends, they got sick, right?

344
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,880
 And so after that, they were no longer swim buddies

345
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:41,360
 or any kind of buddies for that matter, right?

346
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,800
 And he go, but what happened?

347
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,120
 That scarcity led to desperation.

348
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,880
 That desperation, exploitation, right?

349
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:53,480
 If I have a source of life, I can be a source of life.

350
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,320
 If I lack a source of life,

351
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,920
 I'm gonna use you to try to get life.

352
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,840
 And you go, what does any of this have to do with dating?

353
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,840
 This is the foundation of it.

354
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,280
 This is why so many relationships go wrong.

355
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,480
 I come in empty looking for fulfillment.

356
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,880
 And so I have nothing to give to you.

357
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:11,480
 I'm trying to suck from you, meaning value acceptance for me

358
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,920
 and I don't have much to give you.

359
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,800
 And I watched so many people get together

360
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,920
 that are trying to suck life out of one another

361
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,080
 and that desperation leads to exploitation

362
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,240
 and it doesn't last.

363
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,440
 And there's a better way

364
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:28,000
 that love must first be embraced before it can be extended.

365
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,120
 If I get a source of love, I can be a source of love.

366
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,880
 And if I have an eternal source of love,

367
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,080
 I can be an endless lover of you.

368
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,360
 And that's where healthy relationships start.

369
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,680
 You will never get a relationship with a guy or a girl,

370
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,680
 right, if you don't get a relationship with God right first.

371
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,320
 And so as I prayed about coming here tonight,

372
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,880
 there was so much I wanted to talk about,

373
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,520
 about dating, like communication,

374
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,880
 and so many of the unique challenges with technology

375
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,000
 and all these things, but I realized all that

376
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,480
 is just kind of tweaking the dials

377
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,840
 on a tank that doesn't work.

378
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,000
 You gotta get this right first, right?

379
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,600
 And yet some of us hear this and you go,

380
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,640
 well Ben, I want that.

381
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,800
 I wanna feel loved by God.

382
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,240
 I wanna have a love of God that'll be the foundation

383
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,640
 of a healthy relationship.

384
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,320
 You saw on the woman at the well,

385
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,520
 when Jesus came to her and he began to speak to her

386
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,960
 about thirst, he said, go call your husband.

387
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,880
 She didn't have one.

388
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,880
 He said, no, you've had five.

389
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,080
 And now you're living with a guy that's not your husband.

390
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,920
 And he's not shaming her in that moment.

391
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,920
 Then he begins to talk to her about a deep soul thirst

392
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,260
 that he can satisfy.

393
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:34,280
 What's Jesus doing?

394
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:38,280
 He's saying to her, you've been looking in the arms of men

395
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,200
 for what only God can give.

396
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,240
 You've misdiagnosed your need.

397
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,440
 You have to get a relationship with me right

398
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,400
 before you'll get a relationship with them right.

399
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,000
 And that's where we have to start.

400
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,200
 And I know some of you want that.

401
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,960
 Like I don't wanna be insecure.

402
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,800
 I don't wanna walk in the room self-absorbed

403
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,200
 and always feel like I'm not adding up.

404
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,080
 I don't wanna come in trying to get people

405
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,040
 to approve of me like me.

406
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,560
 I wanna be someone who is free to love other people

407
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,600
 in this world because I've been freely loved

408
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,280
 with the inexhaustible love of God.

409
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,960
 I wanna feel that way.

410
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,120
 How do I feel it?

411
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,560
 How do I feel loved?

412
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:15,000
 Well, the subjective affections burn off the fuel

413
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,040
 of objective truth.

414
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,360
 Feelings burn off truth.

415
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,640
 If you wanna feel loved, you need to know you are.

416
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:25,280
 And you go, well, how do I know that?

417
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,640
 Well, take it out of the supernatural for a minute.

418
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,560
 Take it out of the love of God.

419
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,540
 How do you know you're loved by anybody?

420
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:34,600
 How do you know love exists?

421
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,800
 Can't see it, can't touch it.

422
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,640
 What do you got there?

423
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,480
 A little cup of love, got it for you.

424
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,320
 Can't do that.

425
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,280
 So how do you know love exists?

426
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,880
 Anywhere, in any relationship,

427
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,680
 how do you know it's working, right?

428
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:51,280
 Some of you would say, Ben, love is like the wind.

429
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:56,640
 You can't see it and yet you feel the effects of it, right?

430
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:00,000
 And you'd be right.

431
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,680
 Think about your favorite books,

432
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,680
 your favorite romantic movies.

433
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:07,120
 When they wanna show you love exists, what do they do?

434
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,300
 I would submit to you they do three things.

435
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:13,160
 To show you love exists so that you know it and believe it.

436
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:17,040
 The first thing they show you is that love sends.

437
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:21,600
 It sends, love initiates, love cannot sit still.

438
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,600
 Love moves towards the beloved.

439
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,840
 Love sends texts, it sends emails.

440
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:28,240
 You will never see a guy

441
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,960
 when he suddenly realizes he loves a girl,

442
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,400
 not that she thinks she's cute or has some potential,

443
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,040
 but that he really loves her,

444
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:38,000
 like this is it, cashing out of singleness, love her.

445
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,060
 You will never see him sitting on his couch

446
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,680
 and realize that, I love her.

447
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,500
 Weird.

448
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:50,060
 Now, he's gonna rise and go to his beloved

449
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,660
 because that's what love does.

450
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:55,260
 Love sends text messages, it sends emails,

451
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:57,380
 it sends flowers, it sends the vibe.

452
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,340
 How you doing, baby, right?

453
00:17:58,340 --> 00:17:59,440
 That's what love does.

454
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:05,540
 Princess Buttercup says,

455
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:08,220
 "I know my Wesley will come for me."

456
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,280
 How does she know?

457
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:14,860
 Because it's true love.

458
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,860
 [audience laughing]

459
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:22,880
 And when the beloved is over there,

460
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,720
 the lover will not sit still.

461
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,040
 The lover moves towards the beloved

462
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,180
 and that's how you know love exists.

463
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:34,660
 It sends and it sacrifices.

464
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:37,340
 Love will give itself for the beloved.

465
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:40,560
 So Jack will give up his life

466
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,500
 so that Rose can stay afloat on that door

467
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,940
 after the Titanic sinks.

468
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:45,760
 And some of you going,

469
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,340
 "Isn't there enough room on that door for two?"

470
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:50,260
 No, just no, just Rose.

471
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:52,300
 And that's it, but he did it, right?

472
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:57,900
 Frozen, Anna will step in front of that falling sword.

473
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:58,980
 Why?

474
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:02,580
 Because it's true love that falls the frozen heart, right?

475
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:08,440
 Bruno Mars, step in front of a train for you.

476
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,440
 He'll catch a grenade for you.

477
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,680
 Think about that.

478
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:17,980
 That's a pretty grim picture.

479
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:22,580
 Why would he say that?

480
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:27,700
 Because he knows that we know

481
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:30,260
 when you're willing to sacrifice like that,

482
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,780
 true love exists.

483
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:34,820
 It will surrender its body to the flames for the beloved.

484
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:39,340
 And true love stays, it stays.

485
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:41,380
 It delights in the beloved

486
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:44,300
 and will stay even when it's hard.

487
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:48,900
 So Noah will stay and read the notebook to Allie

488
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:53,300
 even though she has Alzheimer's and can't remember who he is.

489
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:56,660
 I had to read my notes on that one, guys.

490
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,540
 If you don't know what that one is, I didn't know either.

491
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:03,540
 But think about our wedding vows.

492
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,940
 What do we say when we wanna declare

493
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,600
 before God and all of our friends

494
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,300
 we truly love the person we're up there with?

495
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,540
 What do we say?

496
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:14,860
 For richer or poorer, for better or for worse,

497
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,540
 in sickness and in health.

498
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:17,740
 Why do we say that?

499
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:20,620
 Because all of us understand when someone declares,

500
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:23,660
 I'm staying with you if it's good and when it's not.

501
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:26,260
 I'm staying with you when it's great and when it's hard.

502
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:30,100
 I'm staying with you even when everyone else walks out.

503
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:35,100
 When we declare that, everybody knows true love exists

504
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,980
 because love stays.

505
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:41,640
 It sends, it sacrifices, it stays.

506
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,500
 And all the movies you love

507
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,580
 will keep going back to those things.

508
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:46,420
 Why?

509
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,940
 Because they know that we know

510
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:50,860
 that when you see those things, you know love exists.

511
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:54,080
 Why am I saying this?

512
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,340
 First John 4, 9.

513
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:59,840
 In this is love.

514
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,800
 In this the love of God was made manifest among us.

515
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,960
 That word manifest, the root of it is the word light.

516
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,640
 When something happened, when this occurred,

517
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,080
 it shined a light on the reality

518
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,680
 that we're loved by God tonight.

519
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,680
 And for some of you,

520
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:17,000
 I'm praying that light goes on right now.

521
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:23,160
 In this, the love of God was made manifest.

522
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,520
 It was made manifest before us.

523
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,920
 What?

524
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:31,920
 That God sent his only son into the world

525
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,620
 that we might live through him.

526
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:37,960
 Love sends.

527
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,640
 And God sent his son.

528
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:43,680
 Didn't send a text, didn't send an email,

529
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:47,080
 didn't stop at just a prophet or a book.

530
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,520
 He sent the best messenger he had.

531
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,200
 He sent his son.

532
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,560
 The arrival of Jesus Christ on the planet

533
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,320
 is exhibit A of God's love for you.

534
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:00,640
 He will come from heaven to earth to live among us.

535
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,480
 Why?

536
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,040
 Because that's what love does.

537
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,920
 In this, the love of God is manifest.

538
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,480
 That he sent his son.

539
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,320
 Why?

540
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,420
 So that we might live through him.

541
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:14,920
 It's interesting to be in a city like DC

542
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,280
 and I've been there two weeks

543
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:19,560
 and already when people even hear that I'm a pastor,

544
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,600
 they start to put me in a lane where they think

545
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,440
 I'm someone who's just trying to read you a book

546
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,320
 to make you be a better person.

547
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:28,260
 And that's not what Christianity is.

548
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,880
 It's not read some rules

549
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,080
 and approximate your life to its teachings.

550
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,020
 It's being raptured by a man who came for you.

551
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:39,920
 Be devastated by the beauty of a love of one

552
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,380
 who would come this far for you.

553
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:45,280
 How do you know you're loved by God?

554
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,240
 Love sends.

555
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,180
 Love sends.

556
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,660
 How do you know you're loved?

557
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:54,780
 Love sacrifices.

558
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,220
 Verse 10.

559
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:57,700
 In this is love.

560
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:00,020
 Not that we love God,

561
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:03,980
 but he loved us and sent his son

562
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:06,760
 to be the propitiation for our sins.

563
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,420
 Now propitiation's a big word, so let me explain it.

564
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:13,140
 It says here's how love is manifest by God.

565
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:15,280
 He leapt over two barriers.

566
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,480
 The first barrier God leapt over

567
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,120
 was our indifference to him.

568
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,980
 And the second barrier he leapt over

569
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:26,240
 was his anger over the horrible broken things

570
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,940
 we've done to each other.

571
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:32,080
 That Jesus sacrificed for us,

572
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,000
 took on brokenness because of our brokenness.

573
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:35,840
 Why?

574
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,960
 Because love sacrifices, that's what it does.

575
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,260
 And it grabs this word propitiation

576
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:44,400
 because it's temple imagery of a sacrifice, right?

577
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:49,980
 It's interesting, the more I talk to people

578
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:52,300
 who don't know Jesus, don't care about religion,

579
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:55,040
 I never have to argue with them that we're not okay.

580
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:58,380
 Everybody believes there's something wrong with us.

581
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,300
 Everybody does.

582
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,660
 Science backs it up.

583
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:05,820
 Yale has an infant cognition center.

584
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,560
 And at Yale's infant cognition center,

585
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,700
 you can read about it on Google,

586
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,300
 they've done studies to realize

587
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:13,460
 there is a morality in babies.

588
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:17,380
 Three month old, four month old, pre-verbal babies,

589
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:20,400
 a rough morality is present from the womb.

590
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,640
 And you go, how did they even know that

591
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,840
 if the kids can't talk?

592
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,300
 I can't go into all the details of it,

593
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,020
 it would take too long, Google it, read it.

594
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:28,580
 But basically what they do is these little morality plays

595
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:29,900
 with puppets.

596
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:32,660
 One puppet will share, another will steal.

597
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:35,420
 One puppet will help, another will hit, right?

598
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:37,980
 And then they present these puppets to the babies.

599
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:42,400
 And way beyond statistical significance,

600
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,940
 almost 100% certitude, they said it's fascinating,

601
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,940
 these pre-verbal babies,

602
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:51,100
 when they saw these morality plays played out,

603
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,140
 it's not just when they were offered the puppets,

604
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:54,740
 they preferred the good one.

605
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:57,860
 When they saw the good one, they would laugh,

606
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:01,820
 they would smile, they instantly saw good as beautiful,

607
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,620
 they would hug him.

608
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:06,700
 When they saw the mean puppet that stole and hurt people,

609
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:09,540
 they would cry, they would hit it.

610
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:13,740
 They instinctively knew it should be judged.

611
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:16,740
 (audience laughing)

612
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:19,560
 And so these people at Yale are like,

613
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:22,120
 there's morality woven into us from birth.

614
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,260
 And they were like, so here's the big question,

615
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:27,000
 if all of us know what is good and beautiful

616
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,160
 and what is bad and ugly, if we know that from birth,

617
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,160
 why do we all choose the bad?

618
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,240
 And Yale said, we don't know.

619
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,240
 They can't test that.

620
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:41,720
 But the Bible tells us that all of us like sheep

621
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:45,480
 have gone astray, there's something wrong with all of us.

622
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,120
 Alexander Solzhenitsyn said it,

623
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,960
 if only there were evil people out there

624
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,160
 insidiously committing evil deeds

625
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,920
 and all that were necessary to do

626
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,020
 would be to separate them and destroy them.

627
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,160
 But the line dividing good and evil

628
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:01,160
 cuts through the heart of every human being, it does.

629
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,360
 There's something wrong with all of us,

630
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,340
 we know we're not okay.

631
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,140
 And the truth is some of you,

632
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:10,760
 the shame of your sexual failure

633
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,180
 is what's kept you from singing

634
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:14,580
 every time you come to the porch.

635
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,760
 I see it all the time.

636
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,660
 We know something's wrong with us

637
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:21,540
 and it saps away strength and joy.

638
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,820
 And I'm so tired of seeing it do it

639
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:27,940
 to young people with so much life, shame, steals, joy.

640
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:30,500
 And we all know something's wrong with us

641
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:33,000
 and we all know we can't fix it.

642
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:37,920
 I remember when my wife and I visited Italy.

643
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,000
 We were visiting one night

644
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,780
 and one night we went to this little town in Cinque Terre,

645
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:44,180
 sat out by the water at this little venue

646
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:45,560
 and we had dinner together

647
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:48,720
 and there were these yuppies sitting next to us.

648
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,880
 And I use the technical term,

649
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:54,320
 they were young, urban, professional women from London.

650
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,520
 Just like you, young, successful women from London

651
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,120
 and they were there and they were texting their friends,

652
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,800
 they were about to go party that night

653
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,620
 and my wife and I were sitting having dinner

654
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:04,640
 and they were over there and they're like,

655
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,480
 oh, where are you from?

656
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,300
 Oh, where are you from?

657
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,140
 Oh, where have you been?

658
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:07,960
 Oh, what have we seen?

659
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,880
 And after a while we scooted our tables together

660
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,840
 and we started telling stories,

661
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,680
 we started laughing.

662
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,800
 After that, they texted their friends,

663
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,320
 canceled their plans, we all hung out.

664
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,880
 By the end of it, we had closed out the restaurant,

665
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,000
 the manager had come out, his son was serenading us

666
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,560
 and playing us some liqueur he had made

667
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,600
 out of like Drano or something.

668
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,640
 It was really not good.

669
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,560
 But we just had this crazy party that night.

670
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:29,100
 And about an hour into it,

671
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,520
 they asked me, what do you do for a living?

672
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,120
 Which I love that it took an hour

673
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,780
 'cause if you ask me in the first five minutes

674
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:35,840
 and I say, well, I'm a preacher,

675
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,520
 boom, like kills the conversation.

676
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,540
 But an hour in, we had a chance to establish

677
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:42,640
 a base of coolness, you know what I mean?

678
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,520
 And so she asked, what do you do?

679
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,520
 And I said, I teach the Bible to young people.

680
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:52,240
 And she went, why?

681
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,400
 And her friend like hit her and I was like,

682
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,240
 no, that's totally fine.

683
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,200
 She was like, can I just tell you,

684
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,840
 I've never read the Bible ever and none of them have.

685
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:02,560
 And then the other one said, well, I have a question.

686
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,480
 And I said, well, what is it?

687
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,160
 And she said, why do religious people kill people?

688
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:10,500
 Why do religious people kill people?

689
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:15,240
 Because a terrorist had just blown himself up in the tube

690
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:18,080
 where some of her friends go to work.

691
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,880
 And I said, well, I don't kill people.

692
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,960
 I said, but I'll tell you this,

693
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,520
 if you take any human philosophy,

694
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:29,780
 from Christianity to atheism to everywhere in between,

695
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:32,020
 they can all be twisted and turn dark.

696
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:35,080
 There's terrorist Hindus and Buddhists.

697
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,540
 And if anyone should be cooled out,

698
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,680
 it's like the Hindus, right?

699
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:41,460
 I mean, like you got terrorists from every philosophy

700
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:44,040
 in human existence can be turned dark.

701
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,780
 I think what that shows you

702
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:48,120
 is that there's something wrong with us.

703
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,280
 And you know what's fascinating?

704
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,420
 She said, you're right.

705
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:55,660
 She said, I don't understand what,

706
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:59,200
 there are things I want to stop doing and I keep doing them.

707
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,200
 And I don't even know why I keep doing the things

708
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,160
 I don't want to do.

709
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:05,000
 And she had no idea she was quoting Romans 7.

710
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 [audience laughing]

711
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:13,700
 And then she looked at me and said, what's the solution?

712
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:16,120
 How do we fix it?

713
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:20,000
 And in the Old Testament, they had a picture.

714
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,400
 And the picture was in the center of Jerusalem,

715
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,720
 the city of peace, there was the temple of God.

716
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,440
 And in the center of the temple of God

717
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,480
 was a room called the holiest of holies.

718
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:32,000
 And in the center of that room was a box.

719
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,640
 And in that box was the perfection of God etched into stone.

720
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:39,700
 And no one could obey that perfection.

721
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:42,040
 So no one was allowed in that room.

722
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,640
 And it was a picture of our distance

723
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,880
 from who we were meant to be before God,

724
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,280
 because we're all wrong.

725
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:52,320
 Except for one day a year,

726
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,320
 the priest would take the blood of an innocent lamb,

727
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:58,400
 a lamb would die for us.

728
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,420
 It would pay for what we've done.

729
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:02,600
 And he would take that blood

730
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:06,360
 and he would put it on the lid of that box.

731
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:09,520
 And it was a picture that when God looks down,

732
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,280
 he no longer sees his violated law,

733
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:15,960
 he sees the payment of an innocent one for our violation,

734
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:18,500
 and communion with God can be restored.

735
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:23,280
 That lid had a name, the hilasterion,

736
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:27,680
 the mercy seat, the propitiation.

737
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:32,960
 He says, Jesus Christ became that lid.

738
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:37,640
 He said, you're all wrong and distant from God,

739
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,360
 and the source has been cut off,

740
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,800
 and that eternal love can't flow through you,

741
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,480
 but I will come live the perfect life you could not,

742
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,520
 and the debts you've incurred, I will pay.

743
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,440
 How do you know you're loved by God?

744
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,160
 He sacrificed for us.

745
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:55,720
 So right out of college,

746
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,160
 I had a friend who was great with money,

747
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:01,000
 in every way the opposite of me right out of college.

748
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,720
 Like we lived together as roommates,

749
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,080
 and he would be in his room,

750
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,200
 like with all of his receipts,

751
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,200
 and like a spreadsheet,

752
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,680
 one of those little like visors,

753
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:12,360
 that's green, and like a little like,

754
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:16,040
 you know, abacus, and he's just like doing his finances.

755
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,240
 And I was like, I've never seen anyone do that.

756
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,240
 And I'm not saying you should be like me,

757
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,200
 it was not a good place financially,

758
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,800
 but he was just so responsible.

759
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,520
 He knew his credit score, always.

760
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:30,240
 [congregation laughing]

761
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,200
 And I watched him fall in love with a girl.

762
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,400
 And he fell in love with a girl

763
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,120
 that through very irresponsible decisions in college,

764
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:40,040
 had racked up an enormous mountain of debt.

765
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:43,720
 And I watched them struggle.

766
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:47,440
 That he knew if I marry her,

767
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:52,440
 I have to pay back this debt for decades.

768
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,680
 And she had a difficult family life.

769
00:31:56,680 --> 00:32:00,960
 Like they had to have security and police

770
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,400
 at their wedding difficult.

771
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,800
 And he knew if I take that on,

772
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,580
 that doesn't get un-messy easily.

773
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:11,360
 And I watched my friend see the cost,

774
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:15,480
 and I watched him gladly pay it.

775
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,960
 First time I ever cried in a wedding.

776
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,080
 'Cause I saw him up there,

777
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,800
 and I knew what it was costing him,

778
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,320
 but he didn't care.

779
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,800
 He didn't rub it in like,

780
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,960
 yeah, for better or for worse.

781
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:29,760
 [congregation laughing]

782
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,880
 He stood up there beaming,

783
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,720
 because he said,

784
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,120
 "I will take any cost for my beloved."

785
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,160
 That's what love does.

786
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,460
 How do you know you're loved?

787
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,600
 Look at the cross.

788
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:45,240
 It's Jesus Christ running for you.

789
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,760
 Him seeing an obstacle of your sin

790
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,840
 that's stealing your joy and strength.

791
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,680
 And he says, "I'll take it from you.

792
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,960
 I'll absorb that debt for you.

793
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:57,160
 He who knew no sin became sin for us,

794
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,600
 so that we might be right with God."

795
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,200
 How do you know you're loved?

796
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,920
 Because he sacrificed for us.

797
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:05,000
 And greater love has no man than this,

798
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,400
 that he would lay down his life for his friends.

799
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:10,180
 So the latest naval warship

800
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:12,280
 is called the USS Michael Monsoor.

801
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:15,500
 And it's called that because in 2006,

802
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:18,880
 Michael Monsoor's Navy SEAL team was challenged

803
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,140
 with clearing out insurgents from Ramadi.

804
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:24,340
 And in one moment, while he was on a roof

805
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:26,220
 with some of his teammates,

806
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,980
 a terrorist took a grenade

807
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:30,200
 and threw it in the midst of Michael and his friends.

808
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,040
 And Michael, without hesitation,

809
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:34,420
 dove on the grenade, absorbed its blast,

810
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:37,780
 in doing so, losing his own life, but saving all of theirs.

811
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:41,500
 They gave his family the Medal of Honor,

812
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:45,020
 highest award our country will give to somebody.

813
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:49,280
 And as the president read about what he did, he said this,

814
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:55,380
 "Death came that day for Mikey's friends.

815
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:58,900
 And Mikey said, 'You cannot take my brothers.

816
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,580
 I will go in their stead.'"

817
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:03,980
 Let me ask you a question.

818
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:08,240
 Do you think those men right now wonder if Michael loved them?

819
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:11,820
 You think they question if he valued them?

820
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:16,480
 If they do, they can remember that day.

821
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:20,300
 Do you question if heaven smiles on you?

822
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:24,620
 Do you lay alone in bed and wonder if anybody cares?

823
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:26,740
 Look at the cross.

824
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:29,020
 Greater love has no one than this,

825
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:31,160
 that he'd lay down his life for his friends.

826
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:33,100
 And that's what God does.

827
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:37,980
 Love sends, it sacrifices, and then it stays.

828
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:41,740
 He says in verse 13, "By this we know we abide in him,

829
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:44,940
 and he in us, he's given us his spirit."

830
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:47,640
 When you put your faith in Christ, God says,

831
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:50,860
 "I stay with you for better or for worse,

832
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:52,840
 sickness and in health, I stay."

833
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:57,040
 So I met a couple when I was in high school,

834
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:01,100
 the most beautiful couple I'd ever seen in life.

835
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:03,060
 I mean like intimidating beautiful.

836
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,420
 And I don't know if some of you know it,

837
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:06,960
 like the kind of beautiful that like stops

838
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,620
 all conversations in the room.

839
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:10,060
 Have you ever seen people like that?

840
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:10,900
 As you're talking with your friends,

841
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,700
 you're like, "So anyway, I said this to them."

842
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,300
 [audience laughing]

843
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:17,020
 The kind of people that make you instantly self-conscious

844
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:18,200
 when they walk up, they're like, "Hey guys."

845
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,800
 You're like, "Hey, why am I so stupid and weird

846
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,640
 and ugly and ah!"

847
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,900
 And you're like, "What?"

848
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:24,960
 And they didn't put that on me.

849
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:30,040
 But they were nice.

850
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,200
 They were the easiest couple to cheer for.

851
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,880
 He was a pro athlete, she was a model or should have been,

852
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,280
 I don't know, but they were amazing.

853
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,600
 [audience laughing]

854
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,480
 And they were gonna get married, we were all gonna go,

855
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,080
 the most beautiful wedding in existence.

856
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:45,140
 And then on the way there, they find out she's got MS.

857
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,400
 And she starts to have trouble using her hands.

858
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,920
 And as their wedding day got closer,

859
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:57,100
 she couldn't lift her arms to comb her own hair.

860
00:35:57,100 --> 00:36:01,300
 So she took him and she told him,

861
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:04,840
 "You didn't sign up for this.

862
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:07,800
 "You don't have to do this.

863
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,600
 "There's a difficulty that comes with me

864
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,500
 "that's not gonna get easy and you don't have to do this."

865
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:16,220
 And he told her, "No."

866
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:19,040
 "No, I want you."

867
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:23,100
 It's the second wedding I ever cried in.

868
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:25,340
 [audience laughing]

869
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:29,400
 'Cause I watched as she choked up on the word sickness

870
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,900
 when it was time to say in sickness and in health.

871
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:34,540
 He didn't.

872
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:37,360
 He looked her right in the eye and said,

873
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:41,960
 "In sickness and in health, for better and for worse,

874
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:44,980
 "I am not going anywhere."

875
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:46,820
 And that's what God just said to you.

876
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:48,100
 Do you see it?

877
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,900
 It's what he just said.

878
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,200
 He knows what you are.

879
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,020
 Some of you, that lie in your head says,

880
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:56,040
 "Well, he wouldn't love me if he knows what I've done.

881
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,480
 "Well, he forgave me when I was a kid,

882
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,820
 "but look how far I'm gone."

883
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,660
 He knows what he got with you.

884
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:03,340
 He's not shocked and surprised.

885
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:06,220
 I forgive, oh, I didn't know what you were into.

886
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:07,060
 Sorry.

887
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:10,060
 [audience laughing]

888
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:14,580
 Don't belittle the sacrifice of Jesus

889
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,420
 by pretending your sin is too big.

890
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:18,460
 It's insulting.

891
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:22,060
 He's perfect and he's beautiful and he sacrificed for you

892
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:23,400
 and he looks you in the eye and says,

893
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,220
 "I'm not going anywhere."

894
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:26,720
 You're loved.

895
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,240
 You're loved.

896
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,940
 Love sends, love sacrifices, love stays.

897
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:33,940
 And let me tell you something, when you get that,

898
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:38,940
 the text says, "We love because he first loved us."

899
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:41,540
 When you understand this,

900
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:44,020
 you will enter into the world as a giver

901
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:49,020
 and not a taker, as a grantor and not an absorber.

902
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:52,740
 You will be positioned to be in a healthy relationship

903
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:56,260
 because you have a source so you can be a source, right?

904
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:59,500
 Because the beloved love, love embraced,

905
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,700
 becomes love extended.

906
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:03,060
 Last story.

907
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:08,100
 When I was living in Dallas,

908
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:11,260
 I remember I had a friend come up to me after church

909
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:14,180
 and she said, "Hey, we got some extra tickets

910
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:16,940
 "to a NASCAR race, do you wanna go?"

911
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:19,500
 I'd never been to NASCAR, didn't care about NASCAR,

912
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:22,120
 but wanted to experience the social aspect of NASCAR.

913
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:24,620
 I'd never seen so many airbrushed t-shirts in my life.

914
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:25,780
 (audience laughing)

915
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:26,820
 And I was like, "Sure."

916
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:30,420
 So it was her and her boyfriend and two of us buddies

917
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:32,020
 jumped in the car and we drove to NASCAR.

918
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:33,660
 And on the way there, the four of us are on the way there

919
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:34,980
 and we said, "How many tickets do we have?"

920
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:37,780
 And she said something like 200, something crazy.

921
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:38,620
 And we were like, "What?"

922
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:40,280
 And she was like, "Yeah, it was like a corporate event

923
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,660
 "that fell through and they just gave me all the tickets.

924
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:42,780
 "Last minute, I got 'em all."

925
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:44,440
 And as soon as she said that, we were like,

926
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,100
 "We're gonna sell 'em.

927
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:51,060
 "We're gonna make so much money off these NASCAR people!"

928
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,540
 And we were all excited about it.

929
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:54,440
 And then she was like, "What?

930
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,820
 "No."

931
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:58,420
 She was like, "These tickets were freely given to us

932
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:00,780
 "and thus we must freely give."

933
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:02,740
 And we were like, "How?"

934
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:04,900
 'Cause it sounded like Bible-y, you know?

935
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:05,740
 And we were like.

936
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:08,260
 (audience laughing)

937
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:10,920
 So we show up and there's like this line

938
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:11,940
 off into the distance.

939
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:14,800
 You can't see the end of very stressed out people

940
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,960
 trying to get into NASCAR.

941
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:18,260
 And there's no guarantee they're gonna make it.

942
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:21,360
 And as they're waiting in line to get tickets,

943
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,240
 I remember she just kind of sauntered up

944
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:25,240
 to someone in the middle of the line.

945
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,960
 And she was like, "How many people you got?"

946
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,720
 And they were like, "Four."

947
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:34,440
 She's like, "There you go, thank you."

948
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,440
 And you could tell they didn't believe.

949
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,480
 They're looking at her like, "What is this?

950
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,720
 "Some kind of like coupon?

951
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:40,700
 "What is this, stupid?"

952
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:42,980
 Like they just really blew her off.

953
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:45,460
 You're a fake, you know?

954
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:46,740
 But they had nothing but time.

955
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:47,680
 They're waiting in this line.

956
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,140
 So they gave like a ticket to their kid.

957
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:50,500
 It was like, "I don't know, just go check it out."

958
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,740
 And I remember their kid walks up to the gate

959
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:54,500
 and the gate person just scans the ticket

960
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,340
 and lets the kid in.

961
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:57,780
 And the kid's like, "I made it, I made it."

962
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:59,780
 (audience laughing)

963
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:01,500
 You know, and they go off into NASCAR.

964
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,100
 And this family's like, "What?"

965
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,540
 You're like, "Can't believe it."

966
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:05,480
 And they're looking at her like,

967
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,460
 "How could you, why could you, how is this?"

968
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:08,760
 And they're all going in like crying like,

969
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,600
 "We love you."

970
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,780
 And off they go in.

971
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:13,060
 And then this little buzz breaks out among the crowd.

972
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:14,300
 And we would just walk among them.

973
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:16,800
 We were just like, "How many do you got?"

974
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,380
 And it was crazy 'cause no one came up to us

975
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:20,380
 and was like, "Give me tickets."

976
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:21,900
 But they all like started to get near us.

977
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:25,760
 They're like, "Hey guys, first time in NASCAR?

978
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:29,780
 "I love it, got my Baylor and heart on."

979
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:32,340
 And they would just talk to us.

980
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:33,940
 And we just handed out tickets.

981
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:37,060
 It became like the coolest thing ever, right?

982
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:38,660
 And we did that for I don't know how long

983
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:39,860
 'til we ran out of tickets.

984
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:41,800
 And then we went in 'cause we had our tickets.

985
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,280
 So we went in and we just thought like

986
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,120
 we had let all those people in.

987
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,020
 Oh, that was kind of fun.

988
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:46,000
 We went in and we didn't think,

989
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:46,960
 oh, it's a block of tickets.

990
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,720
 So we walk in, turn the corner and they're all like,

991
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,560
 "Hey!"

992
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,380
 We're like, "Hey!"

993
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:52,200
 Like, "We're getting this party at NASCAR."

994
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:55,200
 (audience laughing)

995
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:59,220
 And you go, "What does that have to do with anything?"

996
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:01,860
 (audience laughing)

997
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:03,820
 How could we be so generous?

998
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:08,540
 How could we be so generous to people we don't even know?

999
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:12,900
 Because we had tickets.

1000
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:13,740
 We were fine.

1001
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:16,760
 So we could give tickets.

1002
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,620
 We had a source.

1003
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:19,820
 So we could be a source.

1004
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:23,140
 And that's what I want for you.

1005
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:25,980
 The heavens smile on you if you're in Christ.

1006
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:27,700
 And when you understand that tonight,

1007
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,460
 your failure doesn't define you.

1008
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:31,240
 Your shame doesn't define you.

1009
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:35,220
 The thing you did again last night

1010
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:38,020
 doesn't define you if you're in Christ.

1011
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:38,860
 You're loved.

1012
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:43,980
 I don't care what your mommy or daddy said or didn't say.

1013
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:46,360
 If you're in Christ, you're loved.

1014
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:49,060
 And when you fix your eyes

1015
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:51,360
 on the sacrifice of Jesus for you,

1016
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:55,700
 when you see what he did for you,

1017
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:59,200
 when you know that love,

1018
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,980
 love embraced becomes love extended.

1019
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:06,100
 It's the easiest thing and the most beautiful way to live.

1020
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:08,100
 Let me pray for us.

1021
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:13,460
 God, I just wanna thank you

1022
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:18,260
 that the message from heaven tonight

1023
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:22,560
 is not stop screwing up and maybe someday I'll smile on you.

1024
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:25,900
 The message from heaven tonight

1025
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:27,840
 is not get your crap together.

1026
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:31,580
 The message from heaven tonight

1027
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:35,780
 is even if you're a long, long way off,

1028
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:38,900
 the father runs

1029
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:44,160
 because the beloved will always chase after the loved.

1030
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:48,740
 Thank you, God, that the message is

1031
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:51,380
 even if we are buried in sin and shame,

1032
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:56,180
 we have a savior who came to pay for it, absorb it,

1033
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:59,060
 bury it in the grave and leave it behind.

1034
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:04,420
 Thank you that if we feel isolated and alone,

1035
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:09,420
 we have a God who says, I wanna abide with you forever.

1036
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:12,780
 Thank you, God, that the message of heaven

1037
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:17,220
 before we do a thing is that we are loved.

1038
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:22,180
 And when we get that, when we know it and believe it,

1039
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:25,660
 then we are a fearless people.

1040
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:26,860
 Then we are free.

1041
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:30,500
 And God, I think there's people in here

1042
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:37,100
 that maybe they've never really understood

1043
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:38,740
 that that's what's being offered.

1044
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:44,260
 And I just pray tonight they'd realize that's who Jesus is.

1045
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:47,180
 Not a great moral teacher, though he was that.

1046
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:49,660
 Not a motivational speaker.

1047
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:52,260
 He was the lover running for the beloved,

1048
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:54,640
 the sacrifice to pay our debt.

1049
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:58,380
 The husband who stays.

1050
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:02,360
 And God, I believe there's some people in here tonight

1051
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:04,760
 that maybe for the first time wanna believe that,

1052
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:05,880
 wanna put their faith in you,

1053
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:07,880
 wanna say I wanna be a child of God.

1054
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:10,640
 If you're forgiving, forgive me.

1055
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,240
 If you're rescuing, rescue me.

1056
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,760
 If you're adopting, adopt me.

1057
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:14,920
 I want in the family.

1058
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:17,600
 I wanna be loved by God like that.

1059
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:22,540
 And I wanna ask you, if that's you,

1060
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:24,520
 I don't wanna make this a real weird moment.

1061
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:27,020
 I'd love if everyone's eyes would just stay closed.

1062
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:29,600
 But if you're here tonight and you're saying,

1063
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,440
 that's me, for the first time in my life,

1064
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,080
 I wanna put my faith in Jesus.

1065
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:35,440
 I believe he loves me like that.

1066
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:36,960
 Would you be willing to put a hand up?

1067
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,000
 I could just see you.

1068
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,960
 Okay, I see you.

1069
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:43,400
 Down front here, okay?

1070
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:45,440
 See, there's a couple of you on the right.

1071
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,080
 Down front here, a couple folks.

1072
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:49,480
 It's awesome, it's awesome.

1073
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:51,960
 Praise God.

1074
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:52,800
 It's beautiful.

1075
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:56,980
 (congregation applauding)

1076
00:44:56,980 --> 00:44:59,920
 God, and I just believe there's some people in here

1077
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:02,520
 that maybe they've been in church a long time.

1078
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:05,020
 They've been doing this thing a long time.

1079
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:06,360
 But when they lay in bed at night,

1080
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:08,960
 the voice of shame and condemnation is so loud.

1081
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:11,360
 And I just think tonight, God,

1082
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:13,980
 that you wanna sing a different song over us,

1083
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:16,140
 that we're loved.

1084
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:20,240
 And Lord, I believe there's some people in here

1085
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:21,500
 that have struggled to believe that,

1086
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:23,200
 even this week, because of what they've done.

1087
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,200
 And I wanna challenge you, if that's you,

1088
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:30,560
 I just want you to thank him, even now.

1089
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:33,080
 Thank him for loving you in the midst of your brokenness.

1090
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:34,540
 Thank him for not walking out

1091
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:36,280
 in the midst of what you're struggling with.

1092
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:38,140
 Thank him that he's never gonna leave you,

1093
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:40,600
 but he commits to walk with you,

1094
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:43,660
 through the fire, through the flame, through the mess,

1095
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:46,280
 until you see the light of the sun again.

1096
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:48,640
 Thank him, even now, for being a lover

1097
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:49,520
 of your soul like that.

1098
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,080
 You don't have to make him any promises

1099
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:54,540
 or guarantees tonight, you just have to receive tonight,

1100
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:58,120
 the inexhaustible love of God.

1101
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:02,580
 Father, I pray that as we believe it,

1102
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:08,860
 as we know it, may our coworkers feel it,

1103
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:10,360
 may our friends see it,

1104
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:13,660
 that we come in with something to offer.

1105
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:18,760
 Thank you, God, that that's our message.

1106
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:22,260
 Heaven smiles on its children tonight.

1107
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:25,860
 Thank you, God, that you love us.

1108
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:35,860
