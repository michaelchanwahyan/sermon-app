[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.340]   (drum roll)
[00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.820]   - Howdy!
[00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:07.660]   - Howdy!
[00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.160]   - Okay, all right.
[00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.560]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.320]   Good to see you guys.
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.760]   If you have a Bible, we are in Mark chapter four,
[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.380]   and I want to read a couple verses there from you.
[00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.080]   If you don't have a Bible, don't stress.
[00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.600]   I think they're going to put it on one of these screens.
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.200]   Mark chapter four, but while some people are turning there,
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.200]   I'm going to say this, we're going to read
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.080]   kind of a big chunk of scripture.
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.920]   Don't let that scare you.
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.160]   We're going to read it all out front
[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.200]   to kind of load it into your brain,
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.240]   and then we'll pray, and then that'll let us
[00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.520]   just sort of talk through it together
[00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.800]   with all of us sort of familiarized to it.
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.640]   So Mark chapter four, I'm going to start in verse 35.
[00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.080]   We'll read through it, pray, and then jump in.
[00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.240]   And while you're turning there, let me say, too,
[00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.680]   I was here last week and taught some on the gospel of Mark,
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.280]   and then this week we'll do a little bit, too,
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.920]   we're going to stop because I'll be gone,
[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.560]   so there's a lot of the life of Jesus
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.400]   that won't happen today.
[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.640]   So if you're like, oh my gosh,
[00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:04.920]   what happens in the rest of Mark?
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.160]   Well, don't be afraid, you have a Bible you can read.
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.640]   There's a guy by the name of Tim Keller
[00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.080]   wrote a great book about the gospel of Mark.
[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.760]   I think it's called King's Cross or something like that,
[00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.520]   but his thoughts were really helpful to my own.
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.680]   And there's a guy named Darrell Bach
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.080]   who wrote a book called Jesus According to Scriptures.
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.480]   If you're like, I just want to know Jesus better,
[00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.480]   that's a really accessible book.
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.720]   Darrell Bach will help you do that.
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:29.960]   And so just throw those out there
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.360]   for those of you that are like, I want more Jesus.
[00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.080]   Good, and here's two books that could help you with that.
[00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.240]   Or just keep coming to the porch
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.360]   'cause this place is awesome.
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.360]   So anyway, Mark, chapter four, beginning in verse 35.
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.680]   And it says this.
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.640]   On that day when evening had come,
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.720]   he said to them, let us go across to the other side.
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.960]   And leaving the crowd, they took him with them in the boat
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.260]   just as he was, and other boats were with him.
[00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.000]   And a great windstorm arose,
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.800]   and the waves were breaking into the boat
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.860]   so that the boat was already filling,
[00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.920]   but he was in the stern asleep on a cushion.
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.160]   And they woke him and said to him,
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.640]   teacher, do you not care that we're perishing?
[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.360]   And he awoke and rebuked the wind
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.240]   and said to the sea, peace, be still.
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.880]   And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.880]   And he said to them, why are you so afraid?
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.240]   Have you still no faith?
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.000]   And they were filled with great fear
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.400]   and said to one another, who then is this
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.920]   that even the wind and the sea obey him?
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.280]   And they came to the other side of the sea,
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.960]   to the country of the Gerasenes,
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.440]   and when Jesus had stepped out of the boat,
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.400]   immediately there met him out of the tombs,
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.320]   a man with an unclean spirit.
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.920]   He lived among the tombs,
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.160]   and no one could bind him anymore,
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.680]   not even with a chain, for he had often been bound
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.320]   with shackles and chains, but he wrenched the chains apart
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.960]   and broke the shackles in pieces,
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.160]   and no one had the strength to subdue him.
[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.160]   And night and day among the tombs and on the mountains,
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.880]   he was always crying out and cutting himself with stones.
[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.560]   And when he saw Jesus from afar,
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.000]   he ran and fell down before him.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.120]   And crying out with a loud voice, he said,
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.840]   what have you to do with me, Jesus,
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.480]   son of the most high God?
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.840]   I adjure you by God, do not torment me.
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.160]   For he was saying to him,
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.920]   come out of the man, you unclean spirit.
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.320]   And Jesus asked him, what is your name?
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.800]   And he replied, my name is Legion, for we are many.
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.560]   And he begged him earnestly
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.560]   not to send them out of the country.
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.680]   Now a great herd of pigs was sitting there on the hillside,
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.880]   and they begged him, saying, send us into the pigs,
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.320]   let us enter them, so he gave them permission.
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.760]   And the unclean spirits came out, entered the pigs,
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.640]   and the herd, numbering about 2,000,
[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.400]   rushed down the steep bank into the sea,
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.080]   and drowned in the sea.
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.200]   And the herdsmen fled, told it in the city,
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.040]   and in the country, and people came to see
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.800]   what it was that had happened.
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.760]   And they came to Jesus and saw the demon-possessed man,
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.120]   the one who had had the Legion sitting there,
[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.800]   clothed and in his right mind, and they were afraid.
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.360]   And those who had seen it described to them
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.520]   what had happened to the demon-possessed man and to the pigs.
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.040]   And they began to beg Jesus to depart from their region.
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.240]   And as he was getting into the boat,
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.960]   the man who had been possessed with demons
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.240]   begged him that he might be with him,
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.040]   but he did not permit him.
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.800]   But he said to him, "Go home to your friends.
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.400]   "Tell them how much the Lord has done for you,
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.080]   "and how he's had mercy on you."
[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.120]   And he went away and began to proclaim in the Decapolis
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.720]   how much Jesus had done for him, and everyone marveled.
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.080]   And when Jesus had crossed in the boat again
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.120]   to the other side, a great crowd gathered about him,
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.680]   and he was beside the sea.
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.360]   And there came one of the rulers of the synagogue,
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.600]   Jairus by name, and seeing him, he fell at his feet,
[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.020]   and implored him earnestly, saying,
[00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.480]   "My little daughter is at the point of death.
[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:49.600]   "Come and lay your hands on her
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.440]   "so that she may be made well and live."
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.040]   And he went with him.
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.080]   And a great crowd followed him and thronged about him.
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.200]   And there was a woman who had had a discharge of blood
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.120]   for 12 years, and who had suffered under many physicians,
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.520]   and had spent all that she had,
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.040]   and was no better, but rather grew worse.
[00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.960]   And she'd heard the reports about Jesus,
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.600]   and came up behind him in the crowd and touched his garment,
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.600]   for she had said, "If I touch even his garments,
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.120]   "I'll be made well."
[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.220]   And immediately, the flow of blood dried up.
[00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.340]   She felt in her body that she was healed of her disease.
[00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:20.860]   And Jesus, perceiving in himself
[00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.260]   that power had gone out from him,
[00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:23.980]   immediately turned around in the crowd and said,
[00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:26.300]   "Who touched my garments?"
[00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.000]   And his disciples said to him,
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.100]   "You see the crowd pressing around you,
[00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:32.040]   "and yet you say, 'Who touched me?'"
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.160]   And he looked around to see who had done it.
[00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:36.800]   But the woman, knowing what had happened to her,
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.700]   came in fear and trembling, and fell down before him,
[00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.860]   and told him the whole truth.
[00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:42.680]   And he said to her, "Daughter,
[00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.100]   "your faith has made you well.
[00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:46.700]   "Go in peace, be healed of your disease."
[00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.700]   And while he was still speaking,
[00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:50.020]   there came from the ruler's house,
[00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.500]   someone who said, "Your daughter's dead.
[00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.520]   "Why trouble the teacher any further?"
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.620]   But overhearing what they said,
[00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:58.500]   Jesus said to the ruler of the synagogue,
[00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.740]   "Do not fear, only believe."
[00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:02.820]   And he allowed no one to follow him,
[00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.420]   except Peter and James, and John, the brother of James.
[00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:07.900]   And they came into the house of the ruler of the synagogue,
[00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.040]   and Jesus saw a commotion,
[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:10.660]   people weeping and wailing loudly.
[00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:11.900]   And when he had entered, he said to them,
[00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:13.360]   "Why are you making a commotion and weeping?
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.900]   "The child's not dead, but sleeping."
[00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.500]   And they laughed at him.
[00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.420]   But he put them all outside,
[00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:20.860]   and took the child's father and mother,
[00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:22.140]   and those who were with him,
[00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:24.420]   and went into where the child was.
[00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:26.320]   And taking her by the hand, he said,
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.680]   "Talitha kumi," which means,
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.380]   "Little girl, I say to you, arise."
[00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:34.620]   And immediately, the girl got up and began walking,
[00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:36.180]   for she was 12 years of age,
[00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:38.860]   and they were immediately overcome with amazement.
[00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:41.820]   And he strictly charged them that no one should know this,
[00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:44.460]   and he told them to give her something to eat.
[00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:46.460]   Let me pray for us.
[00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:52.620]   Father, we're coming from a lot of different places in life,
[00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:55.300]   coming with a lot of different baggage.
[00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:58.900]   I pray right now that you would help us see Jesus.
[00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:04.000]   See who he is, see what he's about,
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.180]   and see why that matters for us,
[00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:07.980]   living here right now in Dallas.
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:13.960]   God, I believe you wanna change lives forever tonight,
[00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:16.720]   the course of some human lives in here.
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.840]   And I don't say that to try to hype up this meeting.
[00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:20.760]   I don't think Watermark can pull that off.
[00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:21.680]   I don't think The Porch can.
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.040]   I don't think, certainly, Ben can.
[00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:26.200]   But you can, God, and you've given us a moment
[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:27.520]   to think about you together.
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.600]   And I just wanna ask, Lord,
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:33.960]   help us see you and be changed.
[00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:35.640]   Help us see us differently.
[00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:38.400]   And I wanna ask you guys, if you're willing,
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.480]   take a minute, just real quick, and you ask him.
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:42.400]   If you mean it, talk to God and say,
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.200]   please teach me something right now.
[00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:50.560]   And then if you would, please pray for me,
[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:53.160]   that the Lord will use me and I'll be helpful to you.
[00:07:53.160 --> 00:08:05.120]   Well, Father, we love you and we trust you.
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:08.040]   Use this time, and we pray that in Jesus' name.
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:09.640]   Amen.
[00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:13.280]   Well, where I grew up, we played a lot of kickball.
[00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:14.920]   I lived at the end of a cul-de-sac,
[00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:18.200]   and all the kids would go down there and play all the time.
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:20.960]   But I'll never forget one particular day
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:24.000]   when a stranger arrived in our midst.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.280]   He was, I think, the son of a repairman,
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:28.120]   'cause there was a repair truck in somebody's yard,
[00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:30.560]   and the kid was just sitting on the back of this truck
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:32.440]   watching us play kickball.
[00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:34.160]   And some of us felt bad for him.
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:35.240]   We were like, we should go ask this kid
[00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:36.840]   if he wants to play with us, right?
[00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:37.920]   So we went over there,
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:39.960]   and there was some resistance to asking him,
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:41.520]   'cause just to be honest with you,
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:45.120]   he was not an impressive specimen physically, all right?
[00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:49.240]   But we moved towards him, and we asked him.
[00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:51.080]   And so, of course, we asked the natural question
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:52.520]   you would ask at that moment.
[00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:55.120]   How far can you kick a kickball?
[00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:59.040]   I remember he looked at us,
[00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:02.160]   and then he went over those trees.
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:05.920]   And we went, ow!
[00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:07.840]   You know, I was like, are you joking?
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:10.200]   The furthest anyone had ever kicked a kickball
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.600]   was to the end of the street.
[00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:13.760]   And this kid's saying, "Pass the end of the street,
[00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:16.240]   "over the trees that are taller than the houses?"
[00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:17.880]   Like, there wasn't a single one of us that was like,
[00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:19.060]   "Really, that's amazing."
[00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:20.920]   We were all like, "Oh, he's a nut!"
[00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:22.920]   Like, we asked a psycho to play kickball,
[00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:24.280]   and everyone's mad at me,
[00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:26.640]   'cause I'm the guy that had extended myself socially
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:29.000]   to invite this crazy person into our game.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.540]   And so they're like, "Well, congratulations.
[00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:31.680]   "He's on your team."
[00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:32.920]   And so I'm like, "That's wonderful."
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:35.000]   So I look at him, and I go, "Well, you're up, hero.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.600]   "Let's see what you can do."
[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:39.000]   And I'll never forget, he stepped up there,
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.500]   and he kicked that ball.
[00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:46.440]   And it not only went over the trees,
[00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:49.000]   it went sailing over the houses
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.640]   and into the neighbor's backyard.
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:54.700]   And as we watched that ball sail into the distance,
[00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:58.200]   our lives were changed that day.
[00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:01.480]   (audience laughing)
[00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:03.120]   And kickball was never the same!
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:05.400]   And I remember, as we watched him
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:07.600]   just kind of waddle around the bases,
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:10.140]   we were like, "Who is this man
[00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:12.000]   "that can do that to a kickball?"
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.440]   And I'll tell you what happened to us.
[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.240]   We weren't laughing at him anymore.
[00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:22.780]   And when he spoke, we took him a lot more seriously.
[00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:26.440]   Now, I tell you this, for this reason.
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:27.880]   We were talking about Jesus last week,
[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:29.680]   and we were talking about how Jesus came on the scene
[00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:32.280]   and was telling people, "There's a new kingdom here
[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:33.660]   "because I'm here.
[00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:36.680]   "I'm a king, I'm a ruler, I'm your authority."
[00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:38.200]   And he starts saying stuff like that,
[00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:39.560]   and he gets a following around him
[00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:41.360]   'cause he's doing some wild stuff,
[00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:43.440]   but then we skip the section where he starts teaching,
[00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:44.520]   and he's like, "I'm the king,
[00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:46.340]   "I'm God's representative on the earth,
[00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:48.180]   "but it's not gonna look anything like you expect.
[00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:49.720]   "It's not like a military coup.
[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:50.920]   "It's like a little mustard seed,
[00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:51.840]   "and my kingdom's really small,
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:52.760]   "and one day it'll get big."
[00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:54.160]   And he's saying stuff that the people
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:57.080]   who were following him were like, "What?"
[00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:59.840]   And the more they're into Jesus,
[00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:01.120]   the more they're getting confused
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:02.320]   by some of the things he's saying,
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:04.420]   and he's calling for their allegiance,
[00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:07.340]   but he's not what they expected,
[00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:09.460]   and it's confusing to them.
[00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:10.580]   And so in the section before this,
[00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:12.520]   it says he taught them like this
[00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:15.180]   as long as they were able to handle it.
[00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:16.300]   Like he hit a point where they were like,
[00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:18.080]   "I just don't know if we can process any more of this.
[00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:18.980]   "Like you want my life,
[00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:21.260]   "but you're going in directions I'm not expecting.
[00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.240]   "Like you're calling for my allegiance,
[00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:24.940]   "but I don't get where you're going."
[00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:28.460]   And they're just kinda confused by what kinda guy this is.
[00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:31.420]   And then when we approach our text tonight,
[00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:32.740]   we're in the midst of that confusion.
[00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:35.060]   Are we hitching our wagon to the right guy?
[00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:37.440]   Should we even be on this Jesus thing?
[00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:41.560]   And then Jesus gets to step up and kick the ball,
[00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:43.740]   and we're gonna watch him go to work,
[00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:46.180]   and we're gonna see the power of Jesus,
[00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:48.340]   and we're gonna see the purpose of Jesus,
[00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:49.900]   and then we're gonna see the priority of Jesus.
[00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:50.740]   That's where we're going,
[00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:52.100]   and I know we read a lot of text.
[00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:54.300]   Normal people would just cover one of those at a time,
[00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:57.620]   but I read 'em all because I don't know if you caught this.
[00:11:57.620 --> 00:11:58.740]   There's a theme in it,
[00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:02.460]   and all of it happens in one crazy boat ride with Jesus.
[00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:04.700]   And so we're gonna go on a ride with him
[00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:07.720]   and see his power and his purpose and his priorities.
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:10.140]   And he saw his power in that first moment.
[00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:12.240]   It says, "On that day," the day he'd been teaching,
[00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:13.860]   "when evening had come, he said to them,
[00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:15.920]   "let's go across to the other side of the sea."
[00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:18.060]   Sermon's over, he says, "Let's get in the boat and take off."
[00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:20.720]   And it says, "When they did it, a great windstorm arose,
[00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:22.740]   "and the waves were breaking into the boat,
[00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:24.280]   "and the boat was filling."
[00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:26.540]   Windstorms were coming on that sea,
[00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:28.640]   and yet this one's called a great windstorm
[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:32.540]   at night, and it's so bad it's starting to swamp the boat.
[00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:35.260]   And it's getting to a moment where even the veteran sailors
[00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:36.580]   are starting to get spooked.
[00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:38.580]   It's scaring the pros.
[00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:40.380]   So they run and grab Jesus, and he saw,
[00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:43.540]   it said he was asleep in the stern on a cushion
[00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:45.940]   'cause he had been teaching all day, and that's exhausting.
[00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:48.540]   But they come to him, and you see it says,
[00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:49.380]   they came to him and they said,
[00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:53.460]   "Teacher, do you not care that we're perishing?"
[00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:55.620]   They get to a moment where even the veteran sailors
[00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:57.140]   are like, "This is out of our control.
[00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:59.600]   "This situation is one we can't handle."
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.760]   And they panic, so they grab Jesus,
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:04.680]   and notice what's the constant and what's up for debate.
[00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:06.960]   We are perishing.
[00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:10.560]   The only question in this moment is if you care,
[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:13.680]   or if you have the power to do anything about that.
[00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:15.600]   And they sound a lot like us, right?
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:18.080]   When our circumstances get out of our control,
[00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:21.560]   when we realize I can't run my life, we go,
[00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:23.760]   "God, do you care at all?
[00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:25.160]   "Or are you gonna do anything about it?
[00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:26.240]   "What's your deal?"
[00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:29.060]   And they come to Jesus and say, "We're perishing.
[00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:30.280]   "Do you care about that?
[00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:31.580]   "Does that interest you?"
[00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:34.660]   And Jesus hops up, and I think they're looking
[00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:36.660]   for him to pitch in, like grab a bucket or something.
[00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:40.580]   But in verse 39 it says, "And he awoke and rebuked the wind
[00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:43.660]   "and said to the sea, 'Peace, be still.'"
[00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:44.740]   Now what's interesting about that is,
[00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:46.340]   in Greek there's two words,
[00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:49.300]   and they're both the words for be quiet.
[00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:51.460]   One of them's in the present tense, which means right now.
[00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:53.780]   One's in the perfect tense, which means a continuous state.
[00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:55.060]   And so literally Jesus stands up
[00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:56.980]   and looks at the wind and says,
[00:13:56.980 --> 00:14:00.720]   "Hey, be quiet, stay quiet."
[00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:03.300]   And that's weird.
[00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:05.420]   I don't think that's what they were looking for,
[00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:07.900]   for him to rebuke nature like it's a baby.
[00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:12.700]   What's weirder is that it obeys.
[00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:16.100]   And Mark tells us that the sea was completely calm.
[00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:17.380]   It's not just like the rain stopped,
[00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:18.500]   and he's like, "I get credit."
[00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:19.940]   He says it's an eerie calm.
[00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:21.620]   That suddenly the boat is swamping,
[00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:22.820]   they think they're gonna die.
[00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:24.860]   They're like, "This is out of control, this is nuts.
[00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:25.820]   "Jesus, do you care?"
[00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:27.220]   And he goes, "Stop!"
[00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:28.720]   The weather stops, eerie calm.
[00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:32.340]   And all they hear is him look at them and go,
[00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:34.100]   "Don't you guys know be quiet now?"
[00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:36.580]   And he goes back to sleep.
[00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:39.420]   (audience laughing)
[00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:41.220]   And the moment ends where they says,
[00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:44.660]   and they are afraid, filled with great fear,
[00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:45.580]   and they say to one another,
[00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:50.420]   "Who then is this that even the winds and waves obey him?"
[00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:51.740]   Who talks like that?
[00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:52.660]   Who does this?
[00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:54.220]   And it's a great question.
[00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:55.260]   And the funny thing about Mark
[00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.380]   is Mark doesn't answer it in the gospel.
[00:14:57.380 --> 00:15:00.100]   He's like, "Who does that, that the wind and waves obey him?"
[00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:01.740]   The next verse is like, "So they had a sandwich."
[00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:05.020]   And you're like, "No, wait, well, who does that?"
[00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:07.740]   And if you know your Bible, you know who does that.
[00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:09.860]   The Old Testament's really clear.
[00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:12.700]   In places like Psalm 89, where it says,
[00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:17.700]   "O Yahweh, the God of hosts, who is mightier than you are?
[00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:20.640]   "You rule the raging of the sea,
[00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:23.600]   "and when its waves rise, you still them."
[00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:26.680]   The sea's the most out of control place you can be
[00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:28.040]   as a human being.
[00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:30.280]   Only one person can command it like a child.
[00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:32.440]   That's God.
[00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:37.280]   In 2 Maccabees, an evil ruler over the Jews,
[00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:40.400]   Antiochus Epiphanes claimed to rule the sea,
[00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:41.580]   and the Jews revolted against him.
[00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:42.640]   They said, "That's blasphemy,
[00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:44.760]   "'cause only God controls the sea."
[00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:48.120]   And here Jesus is calling the sea what to do.
[00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:49.500]   Why?
[00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:51.440]   Because he's God.
[00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:53.160]   He's the Son of God.
[00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:54.560]   Who does this?
[00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:57.560]   Not a moral teacher, not a prophet.
[00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:02.000]   Your Lord and your hero and your King, Jesus.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.680]   And did you notice, he doesn't conjure.
[00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:06.920]   He doesn't pray, he doesn't cast a spell,
[00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:08.960]   he doesn't need to call in any other powers,
[00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:10.080]   he doesn't pull a wand out and go,
[00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:11.880]   "Expelliarmus!" and anything like that.
[00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:12.960]   (audience laughing)
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:15.200]   It's out of his own power,
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:18.880]   he rules the most chaotic situation you can be in.
[00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:21.400]   And do you know what that does for us?
[00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:27.640]   That eliminates the possibility of us in this room
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:30.480]   listening to the words of Jesus,
[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:32.040]   and then trying to figure out
[00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:34.360]   whether or not we wanna take his advice.
[00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:38.640]   When this guy rules reality,
[00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:42.740]   and he tells you this is how the world works,
[00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:43.960]   that's not just some advice,
[00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:47.560]   you go, "Well, maybe it is, maybe it isn't in 2014."
[00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:51.040]   No, he's telling you how the world is.
[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:54.560]   And part of how it is, is he is the Lord.
[00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:58.640]   He is your authority, whether you like it or not.
[00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:02.240]   And did you see what happened to the disciples?
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:04.860]   How does that make them feel to hear that?
[00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:07.520]   How does it make them feel to see that?
[00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:09.560]   Did they get encouraged?
[00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:12.240]   Did it say they went, "That Jesus."
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:13.280]   (audience laughing)
[00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:16.200]   When Jesus is in the boat, he makes everything okay.
[00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:17.480]   Did you guys see that?
[00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:19.520]   We were going crazy and he just took the wheel.
[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:21.120]   ♪ He took it from my hands ♪
[00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:22.120]   Like, is that what they said?
[00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:24.480]   (audience laughing)
[00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:26.000]   No, what does it say?
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.240]   It says they were afraid of the storm,
[00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:29.840]   and then after Jesus calmed it,
[00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:32.440]   it said they were greatly afraid.
[00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:34.260]   They're even more afraid,
[00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:36.400]   'cause there's only one thing scarier
[00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:38.320]   than a storm that can kill you,
[00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:42.140]   and that's a guy that can control storms that can kill you.
[00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:43.800]   (audience laughing)
[00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:46.360]   And they look at him and they're terrified.
[00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:48.320]   Because like many of us, let's be honest,
[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:50.440]   when you hit situations that are out of control,
[00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:51.920]   you get sick, a friend gets sick,
[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:53.200]   something goes down in your life
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:55.920]   and you realize, "I can't control this, I can't fix this.
[00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:58.000]   "All my gifts, abilities, money, influence,
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.540]   "I can't handle this, that's scary."
[00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:03.240]   But then when you have somebody else
[00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:06.160]   that does have that power over your life,
[00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:08.480]   that can pull the strings in your life,
[00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:09.980]   that's a scary person.
[00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:14.200]   And what you see here is they're terrified of him
[00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:17.480]   because in the most out of control places in my life,
[00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:19.760]   he is in complete control.
[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:21.720]   He rules me.
[00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:24.260]   He's your authority, whether you like it or not.
[00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:27.640]   And I say this, and some of you maybe were here last week
[00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:29.360]   when I was hammering that and you go,
[00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:30.540]   "God, I just don't like that.
[00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:32.880]   "Like I don't like you saying that.
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:35.060]   "Like Jesus is your authority, he runs your life,
[00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:35.900]   "whether you like it or not.
[00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:37.120]   "Like I don't like to hear that."
[00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:39.240]   And let me just say why I think some of us
[00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:41.240]   don't like to hear that.
[00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:42.880]   And I don't know that I'm talking to everybody,
[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:44.280]   but I think for a lot of people in here,
[00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:47.760]   the reason why the idea of somebody else ruling your life
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:51.040]   is really scary to you is because somebody had authority
[00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:54.400]   in your life at some point and they abused it.
[00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:57.080]   And they abused you.
[00:18:57.080 --> 00:19:02.060]   And some of you in here, let's be honest,
[00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:05.440]   maybe it was your parents and your dad
[00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:06.980]   just wasn't a great dad.
[00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:10.700]   He took that role and he didn't fill it right.
[00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:13.160]   And you can spend your whole life bitter at him,
[00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:15.000]   you need to forgive him, but at the end of the day,
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.640]   you can just assess it and go,
[00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:18.920]   "My parents failed me in some key areas."
[00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:20.320]   Or maybe it was some teachers,
[00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:22.000]   or maybe it was someone that was just physically bigger
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.080]   than you or somebody, some guy, some person
[00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:27.880]   had authority in your life, had power in your life,
[00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:30.600]   and they took that power and they hurt you with it.
[00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:33.840]   And they abused you with it.
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:34.960]   And so I'm sitting here talking about
[00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:37.440]   how Jesus is your authority, Jesus has power over you
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:39.720]   right now, whether you submit to it or not.
[00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:41.440]   He runs your life, and you don't like that
[00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:43.200]   because you're scared, because you go,
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:45.540]   "Someone else had power over me once and they hurt me,
[00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:48.280]   "and I never wanna be out of control again."
[00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:52.040]   And can I just affirm something to you?
[00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:57.240]   Power alone is terrifying, it is.
[00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:01.900]   But power in the service of love
[00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:04.140]   is a deeply comforting thing.
[00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:09.120]   So I grew up in Houston, Texas,
[00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:13.000]   and we used to go to the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.600]   And part of that, we used to go to the Chili Cook-Off
[00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:20.000]   before the rodeo because my dad's friend had a booth there.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.320]   And I don't know if you've ever been to that,
[00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:23.320]   anybody from Houston ever heard of a rodeo?
[00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:24.160]   Or are you sitting there?
[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:26.240]   Okay, all right, so all right.
[00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:27.520]   We used to go to the Chili Cook-Off,
[00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:29.680]   and when I was a kid, it was guys that would go out there
[00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:31.440]   and make their best chili from all over Texas,
[00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:32.760]   and people would try it and kind of rake it,
[00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:34.240]   and you'd get a little ribbon if you had the best chili,
[00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:36.240]   you know, it was just real sweet, family fun kind of deal.
[00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:37.420]   And so we used to go as kids,
[00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:40.400]   and we would go to my dad's friend's booth and eat chili,
[00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:42.000]   and on we would go.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.440]   But then as time went on,
[00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:44.680]   there was kind of this progression
[00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:46.920]   of people would go to eat chili, chili is hot,
[00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:49.000]   you need something to cool off your mouth,
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.240]   beer is a great option.
[00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:52.880]   And then as time went on, it became more about the beer,
[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:53.760]   less about the chili,
[00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:55.640]   and then it was increasingly about the beer
[00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:57.360]   and about higher quantities of beer.
[00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:58.960]   And so over the years, as I grew up,
[00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:00.040]   I just watched the Chili Cook-Off
[00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:02.520]   get a little bit crazier and crazier.
[00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:03.360]   So when I was a kid,
[00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:05.000]   it used to be just a couple dudes out there.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.720]   Now it was like thousands of people,
[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:10.100]   and they began to put fences around their cooking areas
[00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:11.380]   to keep the crazies out.
[00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:15.260]   And then I remember I showed up in high school,
[00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:18.700]   and my dad's friend has his barricade out,
[00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:21.660]   and a massive bouncer standing in front of it.
[00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:24.900]   And I remember walking up and I'm like,
[00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:27.380]   oh, like, we're not getting in.
[00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:30.620]   This guy does not look happy to see me and my brother.
[00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:32.580]   And so we're like, oh, I swear I know that guy.
[00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:34.260]   And like someone in there sees us and goes,
[00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:35.540]   no, they're cool, and lets us in.
[00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:37.040]   And we're like, okay, thanks, all right.
[00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:38.920]   Just trying to get around this guy.
[00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:41.160]   So my brother and I go in there, we get our chili,
[00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:43.120]   we sit down, and right as we start eating,
[00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:48.120]   this shadow comes over us, and it's him, right?
[00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:53.440]   And I remember he said, can I sit there?
[00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:56.520]   And we were like, I think you can do whatever you want.
[00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:59.880]   It's how I picture you dealing with the world.
[00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:03.960]   So he sits down and starts visiting with us,
[00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:06.340]   and starts asking what we do.
[00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:07.980]   We tell him we play football, he's like, so do my kids,
[00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:08.900]   and he shows us pictures of kids,
[00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:11.180]   and we're like, look at that fine looking boy.
[00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:13.380]   On we go, and so after a while we visit,
[00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:15.000]   it's actually cool, and at the end of it,
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.580]   I remember he just kind of claps me on the arm,
[00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:17.780]   and he's like, I like you.
[00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:19.780]   And I remember I was like, I'm so glad.
[00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:20.820]   (audience laughing)
[00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:21.660]   Good, right?
[00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:24.700]   And he leaves, and after a while we're there,
[00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:26.460]   and my brother's there, and some of his buddies are there,
[00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:28.620]   and some of his friends decide to leave
[00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:31.360]   the safety of our little compound.
[00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:34.760]   And so they go out, and I'm waiting for them to come back,
[00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:36.080]   I'm not seeing them, and so after a while,
[00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:39.360]   I decide to venture forth to see if I can find them.
[00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:42.220]   And literally, as soon as I walk out of the safety
[00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:43.600]   of this controlled environment,
[00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:46.480]   out into the streets of this area,
[00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:49.120]   they come running back up, my brother's buddies,
[00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:50.360]   and their clothes are all ripped,
[00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:52.900]   and one of them's face is covered in blood.
[00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:55.680]   And what I can pick up in all the screaming
[00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:58.360]   is that a fight broke out that didn't necessarily
[00:22:58.360 --> 00:22:59.400]   go well for them.
[00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:01.000]   (audience laughing)
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.580]   But they're gearing up for round two,
[00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:04.400]   'cause it's coming, right?
[00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:06.620]   And so they're there yelling, and everyone's crazy,
[00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:08.020]   and I step out into the crazy,
[00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:09.820]   and these guys are coming, and these guys are here,
[00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:11.660]   and I realize, for the first time in my life,
[00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:14.660]   I'm like, I'm in that moment that every guy thinks is coming
[00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:17.420]   and you're like, okay, how am I gonna do?
[00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:20.060]   Like, here we go, been in a fight, let's do this, all right?
[00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:21.900]   And I'm just kinda waiting for it,
[00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:25.140]   but I never get to find out!
[00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:27.340]   'Cause as soon as all craziness breaks loose,
[00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:29.460]   I just see this arm slide around me
[00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:31.340]   and lift me up off my feet.
[00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:33.540]   (audience laughing)
[00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:35.660]   And it's the bouncer.
[00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:38.800]   And no kidding, he's got me tucked in one arm like this,
[00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:40.740]   and he's got the other one out like this,
[00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:41.940]   and he's doing this.
[00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:44.740]   (audience laughing)
[00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:46.500]   And he says, are you okay, little man?
[00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:47.620]   (audience laughing)
[00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:50.220]   And I looked and I was like, yeah.
[00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:51.640]   (audience laughing)
[00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:52.820]   Yeah, I think I'm good.
[00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:59.380]   Because power alone is a terrifying thing.
[00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:00.220]   It totally is.
[00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:03.340]   But power in the service of love
[00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:05.780]   is a deeply comforting thing.
[00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:08.140]   And some of you, I keep talking about
[00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:09.380]   how you don't run your life,
[00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:10.900]   whether you like to think you do or not,
[00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:14.820]   Jesus does, the Son of God rules when you live or die
[00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:16.640]   or however your life is gonna work out.
[00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:17.480]   He's your authority.
[00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:18.300]   You go, I don't like that.
[00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:21.460]   Well, before you just push him away, he is power,
[00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:23.380]   but let me show you the purposes
[00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:26.700]   he puts that power behind, and that's the second point.
[00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:29.040]   And you see it in that second moment.
[00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:30.780]   It says they came to the other side of the sea,
[00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:32.740]   so they're in this crazy boat ride,
[00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:35.140]   and they come to the country of the Gerasenes,
[00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:36.300]   and when Jesus stepped out of the boat,
[00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:38.160]   immediately there met him out of the tombs,
[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:39.580]   a man with an unclean spirit.
[00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:41.040]   So he catches, they're in this boat ride
[00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:42.300]   where they almost die, which,
[00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:44.660]   if you're one of his disciples, that's the story.
[00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:46.220]   You know, like when you get home with your buddies later,
[00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:47.920]   like, dude, we're on this boat ride,
[00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:49.220]   we thought we were all gonna die, it's crazy.
[00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:50.900]   Like, that's the story.
[00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:52.100]   And yet they get done with the boat
[00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:53.460]   and they're on the shore, like, this is nuts,
[00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:55.340]   and it's as soon as they land on the shore,
[00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:57.780]   a guy filled with demons is running at them.
[00:24:57.780 --> 00:24:59.580]   And the other gospels tell us he's naked,
[00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:01.180]   and so they're literally like, oh, we almost died.
[00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:02.420]   Just, ah, you know, and like,
[00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:05.780]   here comes this naked demon man coming at 'em
[00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:09.640]   because a life with Jesus is never boring.
[00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:14.900]   And he's coming, and the way it's set up,
[00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:16.760]   it sounds like it's gonna be another story
[00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:18.220]   about the power of Jesus, right?
[00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:21.340]   Jesus has the Holy Spirit, this guy has an unholy spirit,
[00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:23.260]   it's about to be like a spiritual throwdown
[00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:26.900]   and that kind of deal, but it doesn't play like that at all.
[00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:30.020]   There's no lightsabers come out, there's no fight.
[00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:32.180]   As soon as the guy gets to Jesus, what does he do?
[00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:34.300]   He just falls in his face at his feet.
[00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:37.540]   There's no debate, can Jesus win
[00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:39.940]   against the dark things in the world?
[00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:41.860]   It's no contest.
[00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:43.880]   He rules this place.
[00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:45.080]   You can't mess with him.
[00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:48.700]   And he falls at his feet, and what you see in this story
[00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:50.780]   is the story's not really about the power of Jesus.
[00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:54.660]   Mark zooms in on the estate of this man
[00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:55.900]   that Jesus is dealing with,
[00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:57.580]   and as he explains his estate,
[00:25:57.580 --> 00:26:01.780]   it's made me think about a lot of us in some ways,
[00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:04.740]   because that word unclean spirit,
[00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:06.500]   this guy's got an unclean spirit,
[00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:09.740]   that word means to be violated.
[00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:13.320]   It means to be defiled.
[00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:18.660]   If something got into his life that violated him
[00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:22.580]   and defiled him, and he is not clean anymore.
[00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:25.600]   And then Mark just begins to describe him.
[00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:28.100]   He says he lives among the tombs.
[00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:30.140]   He's among dead things.
[00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:33.340]   There's not a vibrancy to his life anymore.
[00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:36.780]   And then it says, and no one could bind him anymore.
[00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:39.540]   That means they used to be able to.
[00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:44.500]   That means that this guy got into some stuff
[00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:47.140]   that he thought he could control,
[00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:49.820]   and it ended up controlling him.
[00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:51.620]   That he started to dabble in some things,
[00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:53.540]   and he says, no, I got a handle on this,
[00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:56.120]   but as time went on, it had a handle on him,
[00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:58.640]   and now he can't get out, he can't control it.
[00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:01.080]   It's running his life, and by the time you reach him,
[00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:03.040]   it says that night and day,
[00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:06.040]   he's on the tombs and the mountains, and he's crying.
[00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:08.320]   There's sadness in his life, there's torment in his life,
[00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:10.800]   there's no peace in his life, there's chaos in his life.
[00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:12.840]   And it says, and he's cutting himself.
[00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:16.520]   He's become self-destructive, lifeless, hopeless,
[00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:18.960]   chaotic, self-destructive life.
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:20.240]   That's where this man is.
[00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:23.780]   And he's a real guy, but he's a picture to us
[00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:26.260]   of all of us, apart from God.
[00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:29.500]   The Bible says that we're all children of the devil,
[00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:30.860]   held captive to do his will.
[00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:33.380]   All of us are so far from what we're meant to be under God,
[00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:37.540]   but just reading this, I think some of us really feel this,
[00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:39.780]   because just to be honest, I think there's a lot of us
[00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:42.140]   in this room that we've gotten into some things
[00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:46.320]   that we thought would be life-enhancing,
[00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:47.900]   and they've become life-taking.
[00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:51.060]   That you thought, I'm gonna dabble in some things.
[00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:52.600]   I wanna experience some things.
[00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:53.680]   I wanna know about some things.
[00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:55.640]   I wanna be a part of some circles,
[00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:56.980]   and I'm gonna get into some stuff
[00:27:56.980 --> 00:28:00.840]   that I think will be good for me, and I can control it.
[00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:01.880]   And it's got you.
[00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:05.240]   And you've started playing with some substances.
[00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:07.420]   You've started playing with a scene.
[00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:10.180]   You've got into some relationships with a guy, with a girl.
[00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:12.120]   You got into some things online
[00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:14.800]   that you started playing in some worlds
[00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:17.120]   that even if you're sitting in here and saying,
[00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:20.720]   I'm a Christian, everything we're singing about in here
[00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:23.020]   and all that is not what dominates your reality
[00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:24.320]   on a day-to-day basis.
[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:27.140]   What dominates your reality on a day-to-day basis
[00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:28.560]   is there's some things in your life,
[00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:31.640]   some deep brokenness in you that you feed,
[00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:36.600]   and it's ugly, and it's defiling, and it's unclean,
[00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:40.000]   and you cry in the night 'cause you deal with it alone.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:45.120]   And the question is, what does Jesus do with people like us?
[00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:47.560]   Does he destroy this guy?
[00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:49.960]   No.
[00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:54.400]   How does Jesus use his power when he comes in contact
[00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:56.360]   with the defiled among us?
[00:28:56.360 --> 00:29:01.080]   He uses his power to set us free.
[00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:03.840]   That's what he does.
[00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:06.280]   It's power in the service of love.
[00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:08.600]   And my prayer as I was coming up here to Dallas
[00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:10.320]   for many of you is I was just praying
[00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:12.560]   that hope would rise in your heart,
[00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:15.200]   that there's some things that have held you captive
[00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:18.440]   and made you feel dirty, made you feel ashamed,
[00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:21.480]   made you feel violated, and has stolen life from you,
[00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:24.280]   and to be honest, stolen you from us.
[00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:26.720]   We don't get all of you 'cause there's some shame
[00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:29.320]   that has just got you locked up,
[00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:32.000]   and I'm prayer tonight is that you'll begin to believe
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.240]   that Jesus is as strong as he says he was,
[00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:36.680]   and he uses that power in the service of his love
[00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:38.480]   to set you free.
[00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:43.200]   And he takes this man that was tormented and ruined,
[00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:46.280]   and by the end of it, it says he's seated, he's at peace.
[00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:51.000]   He's closed, no more shame, and he's in his right mind.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.880]   He's got clarity again.
[00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:54.800]   And my prayer is some of you will understand
[00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:58.800]   power alone is terrifying, but power in the service of love
[00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:00.720]   is a liberating thing.
[00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:04.880]   So back when we played kickball,
[00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:08.920]   I remember we were out there and there was one day
[00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:10.640]   we were playing kickball like we always do,
[00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:13.560]   and I went inside to go get like a drink or something,
[00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:16.080]   and I came back out and everybody had stopped
[00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:18.720]   playing kickball, and they were sitting in my front yard,
[00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:19.680]   and I'm like, what are y'all doing?
[00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:20.520]   Like, what's going on here?
[00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:22.280]   And they had run up to my front door
[00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:24.360]   like breathless waiting for me.
[00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:25.520]   I'm like, what's going on with y'all?
[00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:26.360]   And they started telling me, you know,
[00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:27.720]   we were playing kickball like normal,
[00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:30.460]   and then they said, Ben, he came out.
[00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:34.320]   And I knew who they were talking about.
[00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:35.840]   It was this guy at the end of the street
[00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:40.640]   that he was a grown man, but he was a bully.
[00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:43.600]   He just used to like to pick on little kids.
[00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:45.400]   It was weird, and he was bigger than us.
[00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:48.640]   He's an adult, so he'd make fun of us and embarrass us
[00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:50.980]   and shame us and humiliate us,
[00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:52.520]   and that was kind of his thing.
[00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:54.880]   And they said, Ben, he had come out
[00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:57.040]   and he wanted to play like volleyball down there
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:58.480]   with some friends, and so he just starts
[00:30:58.480 --> 00:30:59.760]   making fun of us, whatever, and they're like,
[00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:01.880]   and then, Ben, he grabbed our ball
[00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:04.720]   and just threw it in his trunk and locked the trunk.
[00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:07.120]   And he's just mocking us, and we're powerless
[00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:08.200]   in front of a guy like that.
[00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:10.880]   We got no resources, and it's just,
[00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:12.280]   we're powerless, that's us.
[00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:14.960]   And that's a common story.
[00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:17.200]   We lived that story, and they said, Ben,
[00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:18.400]   that was happening, and they said,
[00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:19.920]   but something happened today.
[00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:25.040]   They said, your dad drove up, and he saw him.
[00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:29.660]   And he said, Ben, your dad got out of the car,
[00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:32.500]   and he just started to walk towards that man.
[00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:35.800]   They said, and Ben, veins started to pop out on him
[00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:37.800]   that I've never seen, and they said,
[00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:39.140]   and your dad, my dad's not a screamer.
[00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:40.880]   Like, he didn't scream, but your dad just came up
[00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:42.860]   on this guy, and it was something like,
[00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:45.140]   don't mess with these kids, you know, kind of deal.
[00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:48.400]   And they said, Ben, this guy that had dominated us
[00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:50.840]   and humiliated us and owned us just started
[00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:54.120]   folding like a lawn chair under the power of your dad.
[00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:56.280]   And they said, he was against the hood going,
[00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:58.760]   I'm so sorry, I'm sorry, kids, here's your ball.
[00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:00.800]   Here's some money, I love you guys.
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:03.240]   They're like, Ben, it was amazing.
[00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:05.640]   Like, this guy that had owned us and ruled us
[00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:08.480]   that any time he stepped in, had control over us,
[00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:11.860]   was powerless and nothing in comparison
[00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:14.280]   with the power of your dad.
[00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:15.680]   And they're telling the story, and I'm just like,
[00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:17.000]   this is unbelievable.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:18.640]   They hear the story, like, this is my dad.
[00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:22.080]   Like, the guy that knows me and loves me
[00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:24.800]   has that kind of power over the thing
[00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:27.560]   that tried to dominate and humiliate and violate me.
[00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:30.660]   And for the rest of my childhood, it was the funniest thing
[00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:33.120]   because guys would periodically break into that conversation
[00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:35.040]   about whose dad could beat up somebody else's dad.
[00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:35.880]   They would really do that.
[00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:37.840]   And I never entered that conversation once.
[00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:40.840]   They would all be like, look, we all know Ben's dad
[00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:42.000]   could beat up all of our dads.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.240]   (audience laughing)
[00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:45.600]   My dad's number two for the following reasons.
[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:47.240]   And that's how the conversation would go.
[00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:50.000]   (audience laughing)
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.020]   And look, I just,
[00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:56.640]   just try to imagine how that feels as a kid,
[00:32:56.640 --> 00:33:00.280]   of going, the man who's committed to me,
[00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:02.640]   bound to me, and loves me,
[00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:05.760]   has power over the scariest thing in my life,
[00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:08.840]   and he uses it to care about me.
[00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:10.280]   How would that make you feel?
[00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:16.240]   Jesus Christ is the son of God, and he has power.
[00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:18.640]   And some of you, you've been locked up by some things,
[00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:20.060]   and it's just time, man.
[00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:21.360]   It's time to stop.
[00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:24.400]   It's time to stop living out your story
[00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:26.520]   where you're just completely dominated
[00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:29.080]   by some broken and sad things.
[00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:30.840]   And it's time to bring it to him and say,
[00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:33.920]   I wanna believe again that you really are more powerful
[00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:36.640]   than this thing that has dominated my life.
[00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:39.540]   And I've seen it over and over again in ministry,
[00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:40.960]   people that have just had enough.
[00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:43.760]   I had kids that would just, when I was a youth pastor,
[00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:46.760]   would just get beaten up by voices of condemnation
[00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:48.140]   in their head and depression,
[00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:50.140]   that they were just medicating
[00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:52.520]   and trying to sleep to make go away.
[00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:55.020]   And I'll never forget sitting as a youth pastor
[00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:56.160]   in a room full of students,
[00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:57.960]   and just finally having some of them said,
[00:33:57.960 --> 00:33:58.800]   I've had enough.
[00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:01.580]   I've got these terribly depressing,
[00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:03.420]   discouraging thoughts in my mind
[00:34:03.420 --> 00:34:04.800]   that assail me,
[00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:07.500]   and I can't even get out of bed and function sometimes.
[00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:09.720]   And I remember a kid saying that,
[00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:12.560]   and this other kid looking at him and saying, I do too.
[00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:15.720]   And just saying that didn't fix it,
[00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:17.320]   but they began to enter in
[00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:19.640]   to the way you enter into Jesus now.
[00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:22.640]   He's not physically here, but the body of Christ is here.
[00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:23.780]   That's what the church is called.
[00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:25.480]   They began to come in around us
[00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:27.240]   and let us pray with them and support them.
[00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:29.800]   And I'll never forget the last couple of years
[00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:31.800]   for me at this church, I was a youth pastor out there.
[00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:33.280]   One of the guys would always come with me
[00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:36.700]   to the early service and he would slip out early.
[00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:39.220]   And he would always slip out and kind of smile back at me
[00:34:39.220 --> 00:34:42.280]   because he knew that I knew where he was going.
[00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:44.820]   That this kid that used to be just so dominated
[00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:47.000]   by negativity in his life
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:48.580]   was slipping out of the early service
[00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:51.080]   so he could drive around and pick up all his friends
[00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:54.500]   from theater and drive them to the second service.
[00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:57.960]   And he'd smile at me because he knew that I knew
[00:34:57.960 --> 00:34:58.900]   he drives a little bitty car
[00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:00.660]   and he'd pile like 20 of them in there.
[00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:01.980]   And he knew that stressed me out.
[00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:04.140]   And I'm like, I don't even wanna know how you're doing it.
[00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:06.580]   You know, there's like a little clown car of thespians
[00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:08.260]   just kind of like rolling out.
[00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:10.840]   And I'm like, I don't wanna even think
[00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:12.320]   about the safety concerns of that.
[00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:16.600]   But what was awesome to me was seeing this kid
[00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:21.340]   that his story was defeat and it wasn't anymore.
[00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:24.500]   And some of you, to be honest, I mean,
[00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:26.460]   and I know you've talked about it here
[00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:28.320]   and I love that JP's open about it too.
[00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:30.920]   But I mean, sexuality is just thrown at us
[00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:32.600]   in the craziest ways in this culture.
[00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:34.680]   And for some of you, you've gotten into
[00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:36.800]   some dark things online and you thought,
[00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:38.080]   I just wanna know this knowledge.
[00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:39.960]   I wanna see that, I wanna experience that.
[00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:41.960]   And you've gotten hooked onto some pornography
[00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:44.200]   or some things that you thought you could control it
[00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:48.120]   and it controls you and it's stolen you from us.
[00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:49.800]   That's the tragedy of it.
[00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:52.420]   The tragedy of it is it's stolen you from us.
[00:35:52.420 --> 00:35:54.560]   We don't get all of you.
[00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:56.160]   And you don't feel free to sing in here
[00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:57.760]   and you don't feel free to engage in us
[00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:00.480]   'cause there's this thing on you and it's just time, man.
[00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:03.480]   It's time to say no more, no more of this.
[00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:06.680]   And some of you have some relational dysfunctions
[00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:08.480]   that come from real wounds from your family
[00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:10.580]   and it's tragic and you need to cry about it.
[00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:12.420]   But in constructive ways that move forward,
[00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:14.480]   it's not just gonna go away, but it's time to say,
[00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:17.680]   you know what, I'm gonna believe that Jesus really is bigger
[00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:20.720]   than some of these broken things in my story.
[00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:22.480]   And I don't have time to unpack all of mine,
[00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:24.500]   but I just am telling you that's true.
[00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:27.320]   I don't know what it is that dominates you.
[00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:30.420]   I don't know what legion lives in your bedroom,
[00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:33.200]   but he's bigger than that.
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:35.600]   And he uses his power and service of his love
[00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:36.860]   to set you free.
[00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:40.720]   And you believe that, you know that.
[00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:43.560]   There are things I've seen in my life and others
[00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:46.120]   that I thought would be a part of my life forever
[00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:51.120]   that aren't anymore because of him, because of him.
[00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:54.200]   But some of you say, well, Ben, I've tried that.
[00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:56.100]   I mean, I've asked, okay, Jesus,
[00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:57.680]   take all these problems away, go.
[00:36:57.680 --> 00:36:58.740]   And he doesn't do it.
[00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:01.560]   So you're telling me that, bring your problems to Jesus.
[00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:03.560]   Well, I pray, why is he waiting so long?
[00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:07.040]   Well, you gotta look at the priorities of Jesus.
[00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:09.000]   And that's this last piece, and we won't go in detail
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:10.520]   in all of it 'cause we gotta go.
[00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:15.300]   But he gets back in the boat, goes to the other side,
[00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:17.600]   different guy comes running up.
[00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:22.600]   Not a naked Gentile, but a well-to-do, well-dressed leader
[00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:25.960]   in the religious movement of the day.
[00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:28.060]   And he falls at the feet of Jesus.
[00:37:28.060 --> 00:37:29.840]   Everybody has to at some point.
[00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:34.740]   And he says probably the most depressing,
[00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:37.560]   terrifying sentence I can imagine.
[00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:40.000]   My little girl is at the point of death.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.120]   And Jesus says, I'll come heal her.
[00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:46.380]   And so Jesus is on his way to heal this guy's little girl,
[00:37:46.380 --> 00:37:47.800]   and they're on the way there, and what happens?
[00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:49.400]   It says a crowd mobs him.
[00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:52.200]   Jesus was famous at that point, crowds mobbing into him.
[00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:54.360]   And you sense this is the tension of the story
[00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:56.240]   is that Jesus offered to heal her,
[00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:58.880]   and the text says she's literally at the point of death.
[00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:01.240]   And suddenly Jesus is mobbed, he's trying to get through.
[00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:04.560]   It's like 635 freeway on the way here,
[00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:06.720]   and it's just like, this is insane, am I gonna make it?
[00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:08.160]   And Jesus is trying to move through it,
[00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:09.520]   and you think, this is the tension of the story.
[00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:10.740]   Is Jesus gonna make it on time?
[00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:13.120]   Oh my gosh, people move, we gotta healing needs to happen.
[00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:14.960]   Get out of the way, and you're trying to get there.
[00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:16.800]   And then all of a sudden, Mark starts giving you
[00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:19.880]   the medical history of some random lady in that crowd.
[00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:20.920]   And he just goes on and on about it.
[00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:23.060]   He's like, she was bleeding.
[00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:26.880]   And it was like well over a year, or 10 years.
[00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:29.480]   And she had gone to like a number of doctors
[00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:32.200]   and spent a ton of money, and it hadn't gotten better.
[00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:33.040]   It actually gotten worse.
[00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:35.200]   And you're like, why are we doing this?
[00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:37.560]   There's a little girl dying,
[00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:39.480]   like why are we unpacking her story?
[00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:40.500]   I don't care.
[00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:43.360]   And then it says she just thought, if I can touch him,
[00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:44.480]   it'll fix it.
[00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:47.160]   And you go, fine, great, okay, then just touch him,
[00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:48.800]   but do it from behind and move.
[00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:50.080]   Like stay out of his way.
[00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:52.480]   He's trying to do something, and let him get there
[00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:55.040]   because she's at the point of death.
[00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:57.000]   And it says, so she comes up and touches his garment,
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:57.840]   and she's healed.
[00:38:57.840 --> 00:39:00.360]   You're like, great, story over, you're done.
[00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:03.200]   But then it says, but Jesus stops.
[00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:06.600]   And Jesus goes, whoa, whoa, somebody touch me.
[00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:10.840]   And his disciples are like, are you serious?
[00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:14.320]   Like we're thrown by a crowd of people,
[00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:15.680]   and you're like, somebody touch me?
[00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:16.600]   And Jesus won't let it go.
[00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:19.180]   Jesus is like, no, no, no, no.
[00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:25.440]   Somebody touch me, and we're not going anywhere
[00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:28.720]   until we figure it out, somebody touch me.
[00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:30.580]   And Jesus is making it a thing.
[00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:34.800]   And he's making it this thing, and he's not stopping.
[00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:37.520]   How are you feeling if you're Jarius right now,
[00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:39.400]   and your daughter's dying?
[00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:41.840]   You're like, are you serious?
[00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:43.200]   Like you're fine.
[00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:44.980]   They didn't, it's not like your wallet's gone.
[00:39:44.980 --> 00:39:45.920]   Like you're fine.
[00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:46.840]   She's not fine.
[00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:49.920]   Why are you prolonging this?
[00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:51.400]   And Jesus keeps looking around.
[00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:54.720]   Finally, the lady realizes he's not gonna let this go.
[00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:56.680]   She comes forward and starts telling him
[00:39:56.680 --> 00:39:57.880]   the whole medical story.
[00:39:57.880 --> 00:39:59.560]   You gotta sit through that again?
[00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:01.840]   (audience laughing)
[00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:03.280]   And if you're Jarius, how do you feel?
[00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:04.580]   I mean, honestly, think about that.
[00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:06.680]   Your daughter's dying, and this woman's had a disease
[00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:07.840]   that, oh my gosh, it's tragic,
[00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:09.880]   but it's been going on for over 10 years.
[00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:11.040]   It'll wait a day.
[00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:13.120]   I mean, really.
[00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:16.560]   She's at the point of death.
[00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:17.880]   You've been living here.
[00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:20.640]   Let's handle that, then get to this.
[00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:21.760]   Why is he doing this?
[00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:26.600]   And some of you, you go, man, I tried to trust God,
[00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:28.840]   and I wanted him to fix it this way, and he didn't do it,
[00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:29.800]   and I don't get why he does it
[00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:31.060]   so you keep your whole God thing,
[00:40:31.060 --> 00:40:32.520]   because I tried it and it didn't work for me
[00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:34.360]   'cause I don't understand his ways.
[00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:37.240]   How do you feel if you're Jarius?
[00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:38.560]   Why are you doing this?
[00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:40.640]   Why are you making this go on so long?
[00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:42.700]   Like, this is almost wrong.
[00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:46.960]   If I run into the emergency room with my little daughter,
[00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:48.920]   and they tell me to have a seat, and she's dying
[00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:52.160]   'cause they're fixing some kid's scraped knee,
[00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:53.040]   I'd be furious.
[00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:53.920]   How dare you?
[00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:57.640]   Jarius just has to sit there like, this is crazy.
[00:40:57.640 --> 00:40:59.760]   And nobody wants this moment.
[00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:01.360]   Jarius doesn't want it.
[00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:03.160]   This woman doesn't want it.
[00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:05.520]   She just wanted to touch him and leave.
[00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:07.480]   Only Jesus wants this moment.
[00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:08.400]   Why does he do that?
[00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:11.920]   Why does he do things ways that we don't understand?
[00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:16.320]   Well, he grabs this woman, and she tells this story,
[00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:18.240]   and he leans down and he says,
[00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:21.000]   "Your faith has healed you."
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:24.840]   He said, "You're looking for a quick fix
[00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:26.760]   "to your little problem.
[00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:28.600]   "You need more than that.
[00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:32.560]   "You need to understand that the fix you need is me.
[00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:35.860]   "Not some mystical little charm to get you done bleeding.
[00:41:35.860 --> 00:41:37.760]   "What you need is a face-to-face encounter
[00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:38.960]   "with the Son of God.
[00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:40.560]   "He gives her more than she was looking for,
[00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:44.340]   "but exactly what she needed, faith in me."
[00:41:45.340 --> 00:41:47.460]   They come to Jarius and say,
[00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:49.780]   "Don't bother him anymore, your daughter's dead."
[00:41:49.780 --> 00:41:51.120]   And what does Jesus say?
[00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:53.620]   "Don't be afraid when I'm here.
[00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:55.380]   "Believe."
[00:41:55.380 --> 00:41:57.180]   What's the priority of Jesus?
[00:41:57.180 --> 00:41:58.620]   "You trust me."
[00:41:58.620 --> 00:42:01.620]   And he goes to Jarius' house,
[00:42:01.620 --> 00:42:04.180]   and this woman just wanted a problem fixed.
[00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:07.260]   What she got was a face-to-face encounter with God.
[00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:09.820]   He wanted Jesus to heal a sick person.
[00:42:09.820 --> 00:42:11.740]   He's done a lot of that.
[00:42:11.740 --> 00:42:14.220]   What he gets is a miracle Jesus had not done yet,
[00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:15.700]   in his ministry.
[00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:18.280]   He gets to stand there and watch Jesus say,
[00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:21.740]   "Talitha kumi," little girl, "rise."
[00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:25.780]   And to step into what looks like the most hopeless moment
[00:42:25.780 --> 00:42:27.280]   and breathe life back into it.
[00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:30.420]   And so I don't know where you are tonight,
[00:42:30.420 --> 00:42:32.700]   but can I just sum it up this way and say,
[00:42:32.700 --> 00:42:34.820]   "Jesus is the Son of God,
[00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:37.760]   "he's the authority in our life, he has power.
[00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:40.500]   "Power bigger than any of your problems.
[00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:43.320]   "And he harnesses it in the service of his love,
[00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:44.820]   "'cause that's what he's like.
[00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:47.460]   "But as you come to him with your problems,
[00:42:47.460 --> 00:42:50.080]   "his ways may not be what you expect.
[00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:52.380]   "Some of you wanna just secretly sit in your chair
[00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:54.780]   "and confess your sin and just say, 'Fix it now.'
[00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:56.020]   "That's not how he works.
[00:42:56.020 --> 00:43:00.420]   "He will make you stop in front of a public and confess it.
[00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:02.460]   "Some of you, the dark things you're caught up into,
[00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:04.940]   "you won't get out of without a very public moment
[00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:05.780]   "with Jesus."
[00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:07.020]   That doesn't mean in a room like this,
[00:43:07.020 --> 00:43:09.620]   but it might mean in a room of three or four Christians
[00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:12.580]   who love you and love God, and you tell it all to him.
[00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:13.420]   Tell it all.
[00:43:13.420 --> 00:43:16.760]   Some of you, you're trying to dictate to Jesus
[00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:19.800]   how he's gonna fix it, and it doesn't work that way.
[00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:24.500]   But he's strong enough to handle the storms in your life.
[00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:29.700]   He's compassionate enough to set you free.
[00:43:29.700 --> 00:43:33.060]   And he's wise enough to do it in the best way.
[00:43:33.060 --> 00:43:33.900]   So trust him.
[00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:35.720]   Let me pray for us.
[00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:39.380]   Lord, I wanna thank you
[00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:44.580]   that you don't just give us what we want
[00:43:44.580 --> 00:43:45.820]   because we don't know what we want.
[00:43:45.820 --> 00:43:47.480]   I mean, honestly, I mean,
[00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:49.380]   maybe we want a little help with this problem
[00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:53.700]   or fix this insecurity in us or stop this nagging habit,
[00:43:53.700 --> 00:43:59.460]   but you're not looking for just a little fix-up problem.
[00:43:59.460 --> 00:44:01.200]   You're looking for a renovation.
[00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:07.260]   You're looking to take people who are dead among the tombs
[00:44:07.260 --> 00:44:09.660]   and make us the children of God.
[00:44:09.660 --> 00:44:12.820]   You're looking for something else entirely.
[00:44:12.820 --> 00:44:14.900]   You don't want a little quick fix.
[00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:18.260]   You want a face-to-face encounter with the son of God
[00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:19.780]   who heals and sets free.
[00:44:19.780 --> 00:44:23.660]   And so God, I don't know why everybody's here.
[00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:25.540]   I would guess some are here 'cause they just know
[00:44:25.540 --> 00:44:27.580]   they need a little religion to make 'em a little better,
[00:44:27.580 --> 00:44:28.720]   and I just pray they would hear
[00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:30.260]   that's not what you're selling,
[00:44:30.260 --> 00:44:34.700]   that you came, God, because we are much worse
[00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:36.500]   than we sometimes wanna admit,
[00:44:37.940 --> 00:44:39.420]   but the solution is much greater
[00:44:39.420 --> 00:44:40.980]   than we would dare conceive.
[00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:47.220]   The son of God came for us, lived a perfect life for us,
[00:44:47.220 --> 00:44:51.980]   died on the cross to take our shame and sin and guilt away,
[00:44:51.980 --> 00:44:54.940]   that the defiled can be made clean,
[00:44:54.940 --> 00:44:57.080]   that the violated can be made whole,
[00:44:57.080 --> 00:44:59.900]   that those of us who have been locked up
[00:44:59.900 --> 00:45:02.980]   in some dark things can be brought out into the light
[00:45:02.980 --> 00:45:05.980]   and be seated and clothed and given a right mind
[00:45:05.980 --> 00:45:09.060]   and spend the rest of our day celebrating in the city
[00:45:09.060 --> 00:45:11.820]   a Lord Jesus who will set us free, and we mean it.
[00:45:11.820 --> 00:45:16.260]   God, I pray for us that though we don't understand your ways
[00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:18.140]   even now we could throw up in empty hands
[00:45:18.140 --> 00:45:19.740]   and say, "But take my life."
[00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:24.500]   And some of you in here, maybe you're not a Christian,
[00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:27.380]   but maybe tonight is that night.
[00:45:27.380 --> 00:45:29.380]   You go, "Okay, if it's about faith,
[00:45:29.380 --> 00:45:32.500]   "if that's his priority, then I trust Jesus
[00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:35.380]   "with my life, with my sin, with my shame,
[00:45:35.380 --> 00:45:37.140]   "with all of me, then I wanna do that."
[00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:39.380]   And you cry out to him now and tell him that,
[00:45:39.380 --> 00:45:41.020]   and then tell the person who brought you,
[00:45:41.020 --> 00:45:43.660]   tell a pastor here, say, "Hey, I think I wanna belong
[00:45:43.660 --> 00:45:46.220]   "to this Jesus, I think I wanna submit to him,
[00:45:46.220 --> 00:45:47.600]   "I think I wanna join up with him,
[00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:49.580]   "I want my life linked to his life,
[00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:51.760]   "I want the jersey on, put me on the team,
[00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:54.600]   "I wanna belong to him, I wanna be a Christian."
[00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:57.060]   And if that's you, you cry that out to him tonight
[00:45:57.060 --> 00:45:58.400]   and you tell one of us.
[00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:02.420]   And then God, for those of us who know you,
[00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:04.540]   I just pray we wouldn't believe the lie anymore
[00:46:04.540 --> 00:46:06.940]   that whatever dark thing has a grip on us,
[00:46:06.940 --> 00:46:08.780]   that that's gonna dominate our story.
[00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:11.420]   There's no tragic heroes in the kingdom.
[00:46:11.420 --> 00:46:13.100]   There's no power bigger than you.
[00:46:13.100 --> 00:46:14.420]   There's nothing in our lives
[00:46:14.420 --> 00:46:16.660]   that you can't break us loose from.
[00:46:16.660 --> 00:46:18.220]   So I just pray there'd be some people in here tonight
[00:46:18.220 --> 00:46:19.860]   that believe that, that you really are
[00:46:19.860 --> 00:46:21.300]   as strong as you say you are,
[00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:23.740]   and you really are as committed to us as you say you are.
[00:46:23.740 --> 00:46:25.460]   And I just pray, Lord, that some of us in here
[00:46:25.460 --> 00:46:27.700]   need to right now confess, say, "This is it,
[00:46:27.700 --> 00:46:29.420]   "this is the thing that's got me."
[00:46:29.420 --> 00:46:32.200]   And I'm believing tonight that it doesn't have
[00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:33.340]   to hold me anymore.
[00:46:33.340 --> 00:46:35.260]   It doesn't have to dominate my family.
[00:46:35.260 --> 00:46:37.060]   It doesn't have to dominate my future.
[00:46:37.060 --> 00:46:38.540]   It doesn't have to ruin me.
[00:46:38.540 --> 00:46:42.140]   Nothing in my past has to control my future.
[00:46:42.140 --> 00:46:45.240]   When Jesus enters the equation, he changes everything.
[00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:48.700]   And I pray there'd be many of us in this room
[00:46:48.700 --> 00:46:49.820]   that would throw up an empty hands
[00:46:49.820 --> 00:46:51.260]   and say, "You do it your way.
[00:46:51.260 --> 00:46:54.140]   "If your way means public confession,
[00:46:54.140 --> 00:46:55.620]   "I'm gonna find some people."
[00:46:55.620 --> 00:46:56.940]   And I pray that some in here, Lord,
[00:46:56.940 --> 00:46:58.980]   would find a small group to plug into.
[00:46:58.980 --> 00:47:03.000]   If it means waiting longer than I wanna wait,
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:03.840]   I trust you.
[00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:08.020]   But God, I pray across this room now,
[00:47:08.020 --> 00:47:10.820]   there would be men and women rising up and saying,
[00:47:10.820 --> 00:47:13.500]   "You are the Lord and you love me.
[00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:16.380]   "You are strong and you are compassionate,
[00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:19.340]   "bigger than my storms, bigger than my shame,
[00:47:19.340 --> 00:47:21.980]   "and wise enough to care for me and lead me home.
[00:47:21.980 --> 00:47:23.640]   "We are yours, King Jesus.
[00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:25.920]   "May we rest in you tonight.
[00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:29.100]   "You're the King and you're good and we're yours."
[00:47:29.100 --> 00:47:29.940]   Amen.
