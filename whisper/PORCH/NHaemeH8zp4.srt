1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:13,780
 - Porch, what's good?

3
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:14,600
 How we doing?

4
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,640
 (audience cheering)

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,800
 Hey, it's so great to be with you.

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,040
 Great to worship with you.

7
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,440
 I wanna welcome those who are tuning in

8
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:24,320
 just through the stream and at other campuses and whatnot.

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,160
 And so it's just been a dream to be able

10
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,580
 to give you an alternative to the world,

11
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:30,040
 to the bars, to the clubs,

12
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,200
 to whatever else you might be doing on a Tuesday night.

13
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,360
 And so when I trusted Christ,

14
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,180
 like listen, I was a complete mess.

15
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:37,080
 And it's just, as I was worshiping,

16
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,520
 I was reflecting on God's grace in my life

17
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,760
 and the addictions that owned me,

18
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,960
 the drug use that owned me,

19
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,800
 the sexual addictions and perversions that owned me,

20
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,400
 and then got to experience His grace and forgiveness,

21
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,700
 came into the church.

22
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:55,340
 I was bored out of my mind at church growing up

23
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:58,280
 and didn't have a relationship with Jesus.

24
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,520
 And thought like really Christians were kind of weird

25
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,160
 and they were just kind of acting like,

26
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,600
 God was good, but really like, is God really good?

27
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,980
 And so as I came into a relationship with Him,

28
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:10,980
 I began to experience life for the first time.

29
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:12,380
 I'm not crazy, I'm not naive.

30
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:14,320
 I'm not just saying that because I'm up here.

31
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,920
 I truly began to experience life as it was intended.

32
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,220
 And a part of that was getting to share my faith with others

33
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:22,880
 and a part of sharing my faith with others

34
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,960
 was getting to travel all over the world

35
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,400
 on what you may have heard as called mission trips.

36
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,600
 We call them international discipleship trips.

37
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,920
 And so going to Africa and to Haiti and to different places.

38
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,280
 One of the places that I went to, in fact, my favorite,

39
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:41,280
 most memorable was to Brazil and getting on the Amazon River

40
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,440
 and going down the Amazon River, sharing the gospel.

41
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,840
 And the challenge with this particular trip

42
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,120
 is you stay on a boat the entire time for eight days.

43
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,760
 And so you got to pack for about 10 days, eight days

44
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,640
 in a bag about this size, okay?

45
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,360
 And that's honestly not the problem is packing,

46
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,520
 you know, for eight to 10 days in a bag this size.

47
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,360
 The problem with this particular trip

48
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:08,120
 is you've got to pack in a bag like this for 10 days

49
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,880
 and it has to weigh under 50 pounds.

50
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,480
 You guys done that thing where you get up there

51
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,200
 and you're like moving blow dryers around

52
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,720
 and switching shoes and hey, can I put this in your bag?

53
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,200
 And so you can't do that.

54
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,040
 Like we're going there, we're flying into Manaus, Brazil.

55
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,960
 We stay the night in a hotel and the next day

56
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,000
 we're on a boat and we're going down the river

57
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,440
 for seven or eight days and we're getting off at villages

58
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,920
 and we're sharing the gospel.

59
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,280
 And so you got to be packed up,

60
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,080
 the bag's got to be under 50 pounds.

61
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,040
 And so we're there with this team of young adults

62
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,080
 and you can imagine my confusion

63
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,440
 and a little bit my frustration

64
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,760
 when I see one girl pulls this out of her bag.

65
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:46,640
 It's a bag of rocks.

66
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,320
 In Brazil, she brought a bag of rocks to Brazil.

67
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,240
 I'm like, what are you doing?

68
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:56,160
 Like, how did you get that past customs first of all?

69
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,680
 And why, like they have rocks in Brazil.

70
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,840
 You don't need to bring American rocks to Brazil.

71
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,840
 Like, why are you doing this?

72
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,680
 And what did you not bring because of that?

73
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,200
 And we're having this conversation

74
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,240
 and she begins to tell me that she's in this Bible study,

75
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,580
 her and another girl on the trip are in this Bible study

76
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,920
 and they're working through forgiveness.

77
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,720
 And so what they had to do is for every person

78
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,000
 in their life that they had not forgiven,

79
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,200
 they had to put a rock and carry it with them

80
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,080
 until they were choosing to forgive them.

81
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:30,500
 And so as we're moving through Brazil,

82
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,320
 as we get on a boat, I think we have a picture of the boat,

83
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,920
 I don't know if we've shown that to you,

84
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:39,920
 but as we're on this boat traveling down the Amazon River,

85
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,540
 she's with this bag of rocks

86
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:45,320
 representing every person in her life

87
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,560
 that she hasn't forgiven is my friend, Ali.

88
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,920
 And so it's just this,

89
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,520
 it's a great example of the weight of bitterness.

90
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:58,280
 It's a great example of the weight of unforgiveness.

91
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,920
 A great example of the things that we carry,

92
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,460
 every one of you, when you came in here tonight,

93
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,560
 you're carrying some anger.

94
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,960
 You may not even see it, you may not even know what it is.

95
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,840
 And so we're in this series called Vice and Virtue.

96
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,240
 We've covered pride and humility, laziness and discipline,

97
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:22,240
 entitlement and gratitude, greed and generosity.

98
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,340
 And tonight we're talking about anger and forgiveness,

99
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:28,320
 really how the solution to anger is forgiveness.

100
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,080
 And I'm not talking about just regular, generic,

101
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,780
 you're angry that the Patriots lost.

102
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,180
 I'm not talking about that.

103
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:37,080
 I'm talking about an anger that's targeted towards someone.

104
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,160
 Call it bitterness, call it unforgiveness, if you will,

105
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,240
 but it's anger that you carry toward someone.

106
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,360
 And so I wanna ask you some questions.

107
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:51,500
 Who are the people in your life that have wronged you?

108
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,920
 Maybe it was a parent that abandoned you.

109
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:59,000
 Maybe it was an ex-boyfriend or an ex-girlfriend

110
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,920
 that hurt you.

111
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,640
 Maybe it was parents that broke their promise

112
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,120
 to love each other for the rest of their life.

113
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,640
 Maybe it was someone who made fun of you,

114
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,040
 or bullied you,

115
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:15,260
 or abused you.

116
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:18,220
 Those thoughts that you've suppressed

117
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:22,320
 that you promised never to bring up again.

118
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,500
 Has anyone betrayed you?

119
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,200
 I want you to think of their name.

120
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,340
 If revenge were possible right now,

121
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:31,780
 who would be the top person on your list?

122
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,860
 See, when I realized I was talking about anger,

123
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:36,280
 I'm like, do I really struggle with anger?

124
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,700
 You know, now that I've become,

125
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,060
 when I was, before I became a Christian,

126
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:42,400
 like, yes, anger was a tool that I would use.

127
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,100
 You know, it was something that I would,

128
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,380
 I thought I was displaying my masculinity.

129
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:49,140
 And I was either yelling at a girlfriend

130
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,780
 or in a basketball game, you know,

131
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,540
 getting hit with an elbow, and then, you know,

132
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,700
 next thing I know, I'm in a fight

133
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:57,100
 right in the middle of the court, displaying my anger.

134
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,060
 It was a tool.

135
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,180
 I thought it was something that I would use to win debates,

136
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,240
 something that I would use to lead people,

137
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,360
 something that I would use strategically

138
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,580
 to get the attention of others.

139
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:08,520
 And show that, hey, don't mess with me.

140
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,740
 And I was a child.

141
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:12,380
 I was a child.

142
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:18,220
 And I know some of you feel completely justified

143
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:23,860
 in the anger that you brought in here this evening.

144
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:28,740
 Maybe you resent people who seem to have an easy life.

145
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:31,240
 There, maybe there's conversations

146
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,140
 that are replaying in your head when you're alone.

147
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:38,600
 Americans, we've never been more angry than we are right now.

148
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,940
 You can just go on Google and search outraged

149
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:43,460
 and see the results, how many different groups

150
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:45,020
 of people are outraged.

151
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:47,940
 And there's these movements like Me Too and Time's Up

152
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:51,060
 and Black Lives Matter and all of the other hashtags

153
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,300
 that are out there that really just represent

154
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,900
 either an angry person or an angry people group.

155
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,040
 And some of them completely justified

156
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,780
 in the way that they were hurt by someone.

157
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:05,460
 All of those hashtags, all of those movements

158
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:08,900
 represent one person hurting another.

159
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:11,700
 Who are you angry at?

160
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:14,860
 Who hurt you?

161
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:21,180
 And so we're carrying rocks.

162
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,260
 If you're here in Dallas, I want you to hold your rock

163
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,100
 through this message.

164
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,020
 When you came in this evening, you got a rock.

165
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:28,160
 Some of you at campus has got a rock.

166
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,380
 I want you to pick up that rock.

167
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,420
 I want you to hold it in your hand throughout the message.

168
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:32,580
 As we dive into the scripture,

169
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,600
 we're gonna be in Matthew chapter 18.

170
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,140
 Listen, if you're listening somewhere else

171
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,640
 and you don't have a rock in your hand,

172
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,620
 here's what I want you to do.

173
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,980
 I want you to write down the name of a person

174
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:41,800
 that you're angry at,

175
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,060
 or I want you to write down an experience that you had

176
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:47,360
 that when you think back, it causes you some anxiety.

177
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,460
 It causes you to be overwhelmed with anger.

178
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,380
 So as you hold that rock, now moving to a serious moment,

179
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:55,660
 okay, as you hold that rock right now,

180
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:57,160
 I want you to think of what that is.

181
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,300
 What is that experience?

182
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,380
 Who is that person?

183
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,500
 What is the bitterness, the unforgiveness,

184
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:07,180
 the anger that you brought in here this evening?

185
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,620
 In research, this comes from everydayhealth.com,

186
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:13,340
 indicates the way that anger damages our health.

187
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:16,580
 It says that anger can cause damage to your heart,

188
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,620
 increases your risk of a stroke,

189
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,620
 it weakens your immune system,

190
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:23,180
 anger increases anxiety and stress,

191
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:25,020
 anger is linked to depression.

192
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,860
 It literally damages your lungs and respiratory health,

193
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:30,000
 and that people who are habitually angry

194
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,620
 are sick more often, and anger shortens your life.

195
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:36,420
 From a separate source, this comes from the Mayo Clinic.

196
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:39,860
 Doctors listed the benefit of forgiveness.

197
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,740
 They said that people who can forgive people

198
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:44,860
 have healthier relationships, improved mental health,

199
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:48,700
 less anxiety, stress, and hostility, lower blood pressure,

200
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,860
 people who forgive people have fewer symptoms of depression,

201
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:55,260
 stronger immune system, improved heart health,

202
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,740
 and improved self-esteem.

203
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:02,820
 And I know that you think, or some of you think,

204
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,460
 that the anger that you have, it's a righteous anger.

205
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:10,340
 That it's an anger that God's okay with.

206
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:12,760
 To that I say, maybe it is, maybe it is.

207
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,140
 Maybe.

208
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:21,140
 But for most of us, the anger that we carry most of the time

209
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:26,140
 it's simply sin that leaves us alone and bitter.

210
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:31,100
 And a God who loves you doesn't want that for you.

211
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:34,340
 And so we're gonna look at how you've been given,

212
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:37,580
 how you've given God a reason to be angry at you.

213
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:40,700
 Secondly, how God deals with his anger towards you.

214
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,860
 And how our anger against others is confusing,

215
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,840
 and what we are to do about it.

216
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,700
 I told you we'd be in Matthew 18.

217
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:50,180
 Matthew 18 is a chapter known as church discipline.

218
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:53,140
 And so this is literally how we deal with someone

219
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,440
 who sins against us.

220
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,100
 It says that we're to go to that person

221
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:56,920
 and we're to tell them.

222
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,660
 Such a novel idea that we don't practice.

223
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:01,380
 When someone hurts us, we don't suppress it,

224
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:04,040
 we don't ignore it, we don't flippantly just move on.

225
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,140
 We go to them and we look them in the eyes

226
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:08,100
 and we say, "Hey, you hurt me, bye."

227
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,300
 And if they don't listen to us,

228
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,820
 then we take a friend with us.

229
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,460
 So that they might listen to both of us.

230
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,980
 And they don't listen to the both of us,

231
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,740
 then we would go to the church.

232
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,940
 And we would say, "Hey pastors,

233
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,760
 "can you help us work through this conflict?

234
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,140
 "This person hurts me and they don't care."

235
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:23,180
 And it says if they don't listen to the church,

236
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:25,000
 then you treat them like an unbeliever.

237
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,820
 That is, assume that they don't have

238
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,820
 a relationship with Christ.

239
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,440
 And so you would share the gospel with them.

240
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,740
 You would live this out.

241
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,260
 Jesus is telling Peter this.

242
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,940
 He's instructing his disciples,

243
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,100
 which warrants this question.

244
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,820
 Peter comes back and he says this.

245
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,780
 Then Peter came to Jesus and asked,

246
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:42,780
 "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother

247
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,240
 "when he sins against me?

248
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,420
 "Should I do it up to seven times?"

249
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:49,420
 See, it was Jewish tradition that a good Jew

250
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:51,700
 would forgive someone up to three times.

251
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,540
 And so Peter's speaking in hyperbole.

252
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:57,060
 He goes ahead and takes that number,

253
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:00,180
 he multiplies it by two and adds one for good grace

254
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:02,500
 and says, "Should I do it up to seven times?"

255
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:06,420
 And Jesus says, "Not seven times, but 77 times."

256
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:09,660
 Or seven times 70 times.

257
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,940
 And what Jesus is doing, he's matching his hyperbole.

258
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:15,440
 He's not saying 77 times or 490 times.

259
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,900
 He's saying there's no limit to your forgiveness.

260
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:22,740
 When does God stop forgiving you?

261
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,300
 That's when you should stop forgiving someone else.

262
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:31,640
 Therefore, the kingdom of heaven,

263
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:34,540
 now Jesus is gonna tell us what heaven is like.

264
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:35,860
 He's gonna speak in a parable.

265
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:39,380
 A parable is a story that is told to illustrate a point.

266
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,520
 That's all it is, a story that's told to illustrate a point.

267
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,360
 So Jesus, he's gonna start preaching

268
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,540
 and he's using an illustration.

269
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:45,480
 He says, "Hey, the kingdom of heaven,

270
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,360
 "it's like a king who wanted to settle accounts

271
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,660
 "with his servants.

272
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,400
 "As he began the settlement,

273
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:55,520
 "a man who owed him 10,000 talents was brought to him.

274
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,620
 "Since he was not able to pay,

275
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:00,840
 "the master ordered that he and his wife and his children

276
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:05,660
 "and all that he had be sold to repay the debt."

277
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:10,540
 10,000 talents, a talent equals 75 pounds of gold.

278
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:15,540
 10,000 talents was 150,000 years worth of wages.

279
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:18,740
 Jesus is saying, "Hey, there's a servant

280
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:22,300
 "who had an impossible debt to pay to a king."

281
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:27,300
 A debt equal to $12,500,000,000.

282
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:30,780
 That would be today's equivalent of 10,000 talents.

283
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:33,580
 12,500,000,000.

284
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,820
 He's just saying, "Hey, it's an impossible debt.

285
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:35,940
 "I'll never pay it back."

286
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:39,600
 So the king says, "Hey, give me your wife,

287
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,500
 "give me your children, and give me everything you have,

288
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:47,340
 "and I'll cancel the debt."

289
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,740
 The king is angry.

290
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:52,120
 He has an anger toward this servant.

291
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:55,340
 And the servant fell on his knees before him.

292
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,860
 "Be patient with me," he begged.

293
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,380
 "And I'll pay back everything."

294
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,140
 No, he can't.

295
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:03,540
 What a joke, he can't pay back everything.

296
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:06,340
 The servant's master took pity on him,

297
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:08,700
 canceled the debt, and let him go.

298
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:09,780
 What?

299
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:12,040
 Did you hear what just happened?

300
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:16,500
 Some dude owes a king $12,000,000,000,000,

301
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,160
 and the king says, "Hey, I'm gonna take your family,

302
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,900
 "and I'm gonna take all your stuff."

303
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,820
 And the guy goes, "No, please don't take my stuff.

304
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:23,980
 "Please have mercy on me."

305
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:28,740
 And he says, "Okay, you got it, I will."

306
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,980
 And you'd be like, "Man, I'm so glad I asked."

307
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:33,900
 Is that not salvation?

308
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:37,700
 That every day we're marching against God,

309
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,500
 that every day we're wanting to be God,

310
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,900
 every day we're going our own way,

311
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,180
 we're doing our own thing,

312
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,060
 and then we come to a place in his mercy

313
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:45,340
 where we say, "God, have pity on me.

314
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:47,500
 "I know that you sent your son Jesus."

315
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,880
 And he says, "Okay.

316
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:55,620
 "Come and have an inheritance with me,

317
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:56,980
 "not because of what you've done,

318
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:59,300
 "but because of what I've done."

319
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,420
 My first point this evening is God's anger

320
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,180
 towards you was canceled.

321
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,500
 That God was angry.

322
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,100
 He's the king in the story.

323
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,740
 You're the servant in the story.

324
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:11,180
 You have an impossible debt to the king,

325
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:13,620
 and in a moment, if you've acknowledged Christ,

326
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:14,860
 his debt was canceled.

327
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:19,060
 See, our sin created a huge debt against God.

328
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,820
 We were created to be in relationship with him.

329
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,260
 So you can just think, right?

330
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:27,380
 You were created to live for God's glory.

331
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,500
 So what is sin?

332
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,900
 Sin is every moment that you live

333
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,260
 for anything other than God's glory.

334
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:36,500
 Every time you do that, so you can just see, right?

335
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,620
 I'm tripping over it.

336
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:40,540
 That time that you thought about yourself too much,

337
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:42,140
 that relationship you went too far,

338
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:44,620
 and that time you smoked that bowl, snorted that line,

339
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:47,940
 got drunk, hugged that toilet, went to the strip club, right?

340
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:50,060
 Okay, that you spent your money on you, right?

341
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:54,260
 You're just racking up all this impossible debt.

342
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:57,580
 Every moment, every second, every minute,

343
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:00,000
 you'll never pay that debt.

344
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,860
 You can't carry that weight.

345
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:04,740
 That's your debt against God.

346
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:07,620
 You see that?

347
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:11,300
 Every time the clock ticks,

348
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:16,180
 and you're living for anything other than his glory,

349
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,140
 it's sin against him.

350
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,840
 It's an impossible debt.

351
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:23,840
 It is a hopeless debt that you've created against God.

352
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:28,540
 You might've seen a video

353
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:32,700
 or seen that Larry Nassar in the news lately,

354
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,160
 a serial abuser.

355
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:38,780
 Many, many coming forward who was a victim

356
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:41,620
 to this man who did wicked things,

357
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:44,180
 and there was a dad who spoke up in court

358
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:47,680
 and just said, "Hey, can I have five minutes with him?

359
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,220
 I'd love to have my way with him.

360
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,140
 Hey, can I have five minutes?

361
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,820
 No, okay, judge, one minute.

362
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,620
 Can I have one minute with him?"

363
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:57,700
 And the judge says no, and the dad lunges forward

364
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,680
 to try to have his way to this,

365
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,660
 with this man who abused three of his daughters.

366
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,180
 This man abused three of his daughters.

367
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:06,700
 This is the rage of a father.

368
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:09,020
 And we look at that and we're like,

369
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,460
 man, that guy's my hero.

370
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:11,300
 What a wicked man.

371
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,180
 Do you know who you are in that story?

372
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,560
 You ever abused one of God's daughters?

373
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,560
 He watched every second of it.

374
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:25,520
 He says, "Hey, don't go past there."

375
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,680
 You ever gone on the internet

376
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,720
 and watched God's daughters naked,

377
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,480
 God's sons naked performing for you?

378
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,760
 You ever done that?

379
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,740
 He saw you.

380
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:41,960
 And a father, the rage of a father

381
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,280
 that could come against you,

382
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:48,280
 how dare you abuse one of my children in that way?

383
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:51,680
 And you were like, "Boy, that was consensual.

384
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,720
 It wasn't okay with her dad.

385
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:57,600
 It wasn't okay with his father."

386
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,380
 And so what do we do about it?

387
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:04,740
 I want you to understand

388
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:07,080
 that your sins are against a holy God.

389
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,640
 David, who slept with Bathsheba

390
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,240
 and had her husband killed,

391
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,980
 writes, "Against you alone, oh God,

392
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,240
 have I sinned."

393
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:19,240
 Your sins are against a holy, righteous God.

394
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:22,920
 And who your sins are against, it really matters.

395
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,000
 I was driving with my daughter this week in the truck

396
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,640
 and she was asking me just questions,

397
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,040
 just spit firing me with questions,

398
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,320
 which are sweet moments as a dad.

399
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,400
 And she said, "Daddy, if somebody walks on our property,

400
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,440
 is that against the law?"

401
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,880
 And I said, "Well, if they don't have permission,

402
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,600
 it's trespassing and it's against the law."

403
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,240
 And so she goes, "So they go to prison?"

404
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,100
 Like, that's a little harsh.

405
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,860
 You know, we probably would just tell them

406
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:47,120
 maybe to get off the property

407
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,580
 or invite them in and share the gospel.

408
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:49,740
 I don't know, something.

409
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:54,740
 And she goes, "So you don't go to prison if you trespass?"

410
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,700
 And I said, "Well, it depends.

411
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,140
 It depends who you trespass against.

412
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:01,380
 See, if somebody trespasses on our yard,

413
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,940
 I probably get angry.

414
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,380
 You trespass on the president

415
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,860
 of United States of America's yard,

416
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,940
 you jump the fence, you're dead.

417
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:10,100
 They kill you.

418
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,900
 You get shot at, right?

419
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:17,620
 Do you see who the offense is against matters.

420
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:18,700
 Let me go one more with you.

421
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,860
 You tell me a lie, I might be angry.

422
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:24,520
 You lie to a judge, it's perjury, 10 years in prison.

423
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,940
 You see who the sin is against matters?

424
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,580
 Your sin is against a holy God,

425
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:32,580
 the highest office that is imaginable.

426
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,860
 Every day you've sinned.

427
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,940
 You've sinned since you've been sitting here

428
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,560
 in your thoughts during worship

429
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,220
 as we're singing praises to God.

430
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:45,220
 You're sinning against the holy God.

431
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:47,260
 Where's the hope in that, JP?

432
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:51,420
 Your sin is bigger than you can imagine,

433
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:54,380
 and it costs more than you can pay.

434
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:57,460
 And if you don't think so,

435
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:58,800
 what you're really saying in your heart

436
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,500
 is that God wasted his payment.

437
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:04,380
 If you don't think that you're that big of a sinner,

438
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,740
 then why did Jesus have to die?

439
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:12,740
 And so God, he's that angry father.

440
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:17,820
 He looked at you and despised your sin.

441
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,560
 And so what did he do?

442
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:23,580
 He took the weight of your sin,

443
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:28,060
 and he took his wrath that otherwise would be against you.

444
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:30,500
 But if you've acknowledged his payment, right,

445
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,340
 he comes over here,

446
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:36,100
 and he puts it on Christ.

447
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,340
 (thudding)

448
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:45,100
 It says in Isaiah that he was pleased

449
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:49,660
 to crush the son on your behalf.

450
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:55,940
 Why would a father be pleased to crush his son?

451
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:58,820
 Because he loved you.

452
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:03,900
 And when he looks at you, he doesn't see your sin.

453
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,900
 He sees his payment.

454
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,460
 Isn't that a beautiful truth?

455
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:10,380
 That when he looks at you,

456
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:14,020
 he doesn't see the stacks of rocks.

457
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:19,500
 He sees what he paid for them to purchase you to himself.

458
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,340
 It says in the scripture,

459
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:22,980
 "No longer counting your sins against you."

460
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:23,840
 Do you feel that?

461
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:30,900
 That $12,500,000,000 in debt canceled in a moment.

462
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,220
 Canceled in a moment.

463
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:42,500
 We've sinned more against God than you could imagine,

464
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,740
 and his grace is so overwhelming

465
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:47,380
 that your sin is no match for it.

466
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:51,180
 It is no appropriate competitor for his grace.

467
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:54,980
 And so this is how a worldly master in the story,

468
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,380
 this king releases the dead.

469
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,860
 Imagine how much more a father who loves you

470
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:01,180
 and who controls all things erases your sin.

471
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,980
 It says in Psalm 103, verse 12,

472
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:06,340
 that he's removed them as far as the East is from the West.

473
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,180
 How?

474
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,700
 By you humbling yourself before him

475
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,260
 and acknowledging your need for mercy,

476
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:14,740
 your need for a savior, he wipes away your debt.

477
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:15,780
 And here's the deal.

478
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:19,140
 You can't pay a debt that's already been paid.

479
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:20,820
 Okay, if a debt has been paid,

480
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:21,940
 you can't go to the bank and say,

481
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:23,140
 "Hey, I wanna pay it again."

482
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,740
 They say, "No, it's already been paid.

483
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:25,580
 "It's clean."

484
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:27,020
 So you can't live your life

485
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:29,380
 trying to earn your way back to God

486
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:33,060
 when he's already erased the debt and said, "You're mine."

487
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,220
 What are you doing?

488
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:35,500
 He's paid the debt.

489
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,460
 What are you doing?

490
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:39,460
 Do you wanna keep going and racking up the debt?

491
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:42,660
 All your debt has been paid past, present, and future.

492
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:45,700
 It's been forgiven.

493
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,500
 And so when God looks at you,

494
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,940
 he doesn't see your sin, he sees his payment.

495
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:53,980
 It says that he delights to show you mercy.

496
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,660
 It's Micah 7, verse 18.

497
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:58,420
 "Who is God like you, who pardons sin

498
00:21:58,420 --> 00:21:59,900
 "and forgives the transgressions

499
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:02,300
 "of the remnant of his inheritance?

500
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,580
 "You do not stay angry forever,

501
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:08,700
 "but delight to show mercy."

502
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:09,540
 How beautiful is that?

503
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:10,780
 He delights.

504
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:13,100
 He takes pleasure in showing you mercy.

505
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:16,260
 Let's back to the story.

506
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:19,220
 But then, so the servant,

507
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:22,660
 he's had his debt canceled by the master, by the king.

508
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:23,740
 And so he goes out,

509
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,620
 and he found one of his fellow servants

510
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,980
 who owed him 100 denarii.

511
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:31,100
 And so he's been forgiven $12 billion,

512
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,660
 but he finds someone who owns him a couple dollars,

513
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:36,820
 and he grabbed him and began to choke him.

514
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:39,220
 "Pay back what you owe me," he demanded.

515
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:41,020
 His fellow servant fell to his knees

516
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,620
 and begged him, "Be patient with me,

517
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:43,740
 "and I will pay you back."

518
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,820
 See, Jesus is putting in the script.

519
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:48,220
 This guy said the same thing that other guy said,

520
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:50,580
 and the master forgave him of $12 billion.

521
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,860
 But this guy, he's angry.

522
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,420
 He's angry because what's happened to him,

523
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:55,620
 it's not fair.

524
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:57,580
 It's not fair.

525
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,140
 It's not something he wanted.

526
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,180
 It's not something he chose.

527
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:02,140
 And he feels that someone's come in

528
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,860
 and infringed upon his territory,

529
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:05,180
 trespassed against him,

530
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,100
 the sins against him.

531
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,340
 Now he says, he chokes him.

532
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:10,080
 "You give me back what you owe me.

533
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,340
 "Pay me back."

534
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:15,240
 But he refused.

535
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:19,580
 The guy asked for mercy, and he refused.

536
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,020
 Instead, he went off,

537
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:25,380
 and he had the man thrown into prison

538
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:26,940
 until he could pay the debt.

539
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:30,480
 When the other servants saw what had happened,

540
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,320
 those around there, they were like,

541
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,220
 "Man, this is just confusing."

542
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:36,100
 He says they were greatly distressed

543
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,180
 and went and told their master

544
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:40,180
 everything that had happened.

545
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:43,220
 That guy that you forgave, $12 billion,

546
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:45,620
 he found someone who owed him $100,

547
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:48,140
 and he choked him and had him thrown into prison.

548
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:50,740
 Master, something's off with that guy.

549
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:54,500
 It's just confusing.

550
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:57,620
 My second point is that forgiven people

551
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:59,340
 are forgiving people.

552
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:03,160
 That forgiven people are forgiving people.

553
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,600
 Keep holding your rock.

554
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,500
 Keep thinking of that person

555
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,780
 who has a debt against you,

556
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:10,580
 the one you'd like to choke in the story,

557
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,660
 the one who did that unspeakable thing to you

558
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:17,160
 or hurt you, or they did something unjust to you.

559
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:20,580
 It's a crazy story, but so relevant to 2018

560
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:23,180
 that we would forget God's abundant grace towards us

561
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:26,820
 and focus more on those who have hurt us.

562
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:28,700
 Now, I wanna make some things clear here.

563
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,880
 Forgiving someone does not mean forgetting

564
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,620
 what they've done.

565
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:33,540
 That's impossible.

566
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,820
 Outside of a lumbotomy,

567
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:37,020
 literally removing that part of your brain,

568
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:39,660
 you can't just erase a memory, okay?

569
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:42,180
 And so forgiving someone is not forgetting

570
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,260
 what they've done to you.

571
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:45,920
 It is not also, it's not allowing them

572
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,460
 to continue to hurt you.

573
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,420
 That's not loving to anybody.

574
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:52,100
 To allow them to continue to act out against you,

575
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,180
 you may have to create healthy boundaries.

576
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:55,980
 It's also not just flippantly

577
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,860
 writing off the wrong and moving forward.

578
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:00,460
 That's not what forgiveness is, okay?

579
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:02,060
 So what is forgiveness?

580
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:02,900
 Here's what it is.

581
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:03,720
 You ready?

582
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,560
 Listen.

583
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,220
 Forgiveness is you taking into true account

584
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:09,940
 the damage that they've caused you.

585
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:14,060
 You looking at the debt that they created.

586
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:16,180
 See, their hurt towards you,

587
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:18,100
 it caused you a debt.

588
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,620
 They took something from you.

589
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,780
 That debt, it could look like, you know,

590
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:23,460
 you driving down the road

591
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:25,300
 and wasting time thinking about it.

592
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:29,740
 It could look like you not being able to function for a day.

593
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:32,640
 It could look like a physical injury.

594
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,100
 It could look like any number of things.

595
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,840
 It could look like years of your life

596
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,580
 that you look back on and despise

597
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:39,380
 because of what they did.

598
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,780
 That's a debt.

599
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:42,740
 And so you take into true account that debt.

600
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,020
 You write down that debt.

601
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:46,660
 This is what they cost me.

602
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,660
 And forgiveness is saying,

603
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:50,460
 and they don't have to pay me back.

604
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:53,880
 I'm wiping that debt clean.

605
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:56,180
 They don't owe me anything.

606
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:59,140
 Because you don't win by carrying the bitterness.

607
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,260
 You need to know that.

608
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:02,600
 You living the rest of your life angry at them

609
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,700
 does nothing to them.

610
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:07,460
 They say that bitterness is like drinking poison

611
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,980
 and expecting them to die.

612
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:11,460
 You don't win.

613
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:13,420
 No one wins.

614
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:18,000
 So you take into account the hurt that they caused

615
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,120
 and you acknowledge that it's been paid for.

616
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,180
 About a year ago, Monica and I,

617
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:29,460
 we were going on a date.

618
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,480
 I love date nights.

619
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,360
 Date nights are fun.

620
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,820
 And so she and I, we were driving down a road

621
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:37,480
 right by our house, long straightaway road,

622
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,900
 going the speed limit in the middle lane,

623
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:42,560
 just minding our own business, having a conversation.

624
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:47,540
 And this person turns right in front of us.

625
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:51,360
 I mean, just right in front of us in the turning lane.

626
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,040
 And they just turned right in front of us.

627
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,200
 And I broadside them, hit them.

628
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,480
 And then we pull into the parking lot

629
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,260
 of the grocery store right there.

630
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:01,860
 And it's a girl.

631
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:02,840
 And she's on her phone.

632
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:03,960
 Of course she is.

633
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:08,480
 And so I get out to engage and make sure that she's okay.

634
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,760
 And she's erratic.

635
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,040
 She's going crazy.

636
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,320
 And I know that's an offensive word,

637
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,520
 but it's the most appropriate word.

638
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,920
 She's going crazy.

639
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,880
 Okay, she's like, "This MF here, this MF here."

640
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,240
 I mean, lots of curse words, okay?

641
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,760
 I'm like, "Hey, calm down.

642
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,640
 "You know, you calm down."

643
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,260
 And she's like, "He came out of nowhere.

644
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,160
 "He came out of nowhere."

645
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,240
 I was like, "Not really nowhere.

646
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,700
 "I came from my house.

647
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:32,160
 "I was driving the speed limit in the same lane.

648
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:35,080
 "You kind of came right in front of me."

649
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:37,800
 And she's like, "He came out of nowhere and just hit me."

650
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,840
 I was like, "Well, you kind of hit me."

651
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:43,520
 And I'm like, "Can we talk?

652
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,640
 "Do you mind getting off the phone?"

653
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,480
 And she just like turned around and was like,

654
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,320
 I was like, "Okay."

655
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:50,600
 And so I get in my truck and I call the insurance company.

656
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,120
 And so I'm on the phone with my insurance company

657
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,840
 and they say, you know, the first thing they ask,

658
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,240
 does she have insurance?

659
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,560
 And I rolled down my window, "Do you have insurance?"

660
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:04,300
 And she's like, "This is my boyfriend's car.

661
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,560
 "It's my boyfriend's car."

662
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,560
 I was like, "Oh no."

663
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,720
 I said, "Hey, it's her boyfriend's car."

664
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,680
 And so they were like, "Does her boyfriend have insurance?"

665
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,520
 Roll it down.

666
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,880
 "Hey, does your boyfriend have insurance?"

667
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:16,120
 And she didn't wanna talk.

668
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,880
 And so I'm keep going with the insurance company

669
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:23,880
 and Monica's calling the police and the boyfriend comes.

670
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:27,360
 And I thought she was crazy.

671
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,320
 (congregation laughing)

672
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,480
 No, this dude was crazy.

673
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,760
 He gets there and he falls to the ground

674
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,200
 and starts punching the concrete.

675
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:42,640
 And he's yelling, like crazy yelling, lots of words.

676
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,800
 I'm learning nouns, verbs, and adjectives.

677
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,080
 (congregation laughing)

678
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,240
 And I'm on the phone with the insurance

679
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:53,680
 and he comes to my truck window and he goes,

680
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:56,480
 "Get the F out of the car!"

681
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:02,160
 Did you hear that?

682
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,680
 (congregation laughing)

683
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,680
 Yeah, what was that?

684
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,580
 Do you need to go?

685
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:08,620
 I think I need to go.

686
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:11,220
 (congregation laughing)

687
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:16,220
 So I get out of my truck and yeah, that was foolish.

688
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:20,140
 He's a little guy.

689
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:21,780
 (congregation laughing)

690
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:24,260
 Yeah, you were picturing a big guy.

691
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:26,220
 He had a lot of anger.

692
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:31,380
 Why are you yelling at me?

693
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:34,260
 (congregation laughing)

694
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,420
 Why are you doing that?

695
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:39,820
 And he's like, "You're gonna tell the police

696
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,380
 "that I was driving that car."

697
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:45,780
 I was like, "Let me tell you why that's not gonna happen.

698
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:48,980
 "And I need to let you know that you hurt me

699
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:51,420
 "with your words in front of my wife

700
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:52,380
 (congregation laughing)

701
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:55,340
 "and the anger that you displayed."

702
00:29:55,340 --> 00:30:00,860
 And he's like, "I'm sorry."

703
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:02,740
 I was like, "That's good, thank you."

704
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,420
 You know, your girlfriend really pulled in front of us

705
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:09,940
 and he was like, "Well, it doesn't matter whose fault it is."

706
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:11,580
 I was like, "It kind of matters."

707
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:13,700
 (congregation laughing)

708
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:16,220
 'Cause let me show you why, come here.

709
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:17,740
 You see that damage?

710
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:22,540
 Somebody's gotta pay for that, right?

711
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:27,540
 You caused some damage and someone has to pay for that.

712
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:32,780
 This is an auditing of the transgression, if you will.

713
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:35,780
 I'm happy to forgive you for the hurt

714
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:37,940
 that you caused with your words earlier.

715
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:40,220
 Let me ask you a question, do you have a faith?

716
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,860
 He said, "Yeah, I'm a Christian."

717
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:43,660
 I said, "That is so confusing."

718
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:45,500
 (congregation laughing)

719
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:48,820
 Let me tell you, sir, why that is so confusing.

720
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:52,260
 There is nothing in your life right now

721
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:54,620
 that remotely resembles Jesus

722
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:57,380
 in the way that you're handling this situation.

723
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:59,380
 And so if you're saying you believe in a God,

724
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:02,260
 listen, let me tell you, we can trust him in this moment.

725
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:04,060
 Okay, and it was sweet, we got to pray

726
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:05,660
 and got to talk through the gospel

727
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:09,140
 and around why that was so confusing.

728
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:14,140
 But what happened was their insurance company intervened

729
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:16,760
 and paid for the damage.

730
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:20,780
 And see, what happened is Christ has intervened

731
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:24,260
 and he's paid for the damage.

732
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:26,780
 That's true, for God so loved the what?

733
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:29,280
 The world, the cosmos.

734
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:32,260
 Even the person that hurt you,

735
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:34,660
 and I know that might be hard to hear right now.

736
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:37,060
 God loves that person.

737
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:41,900
 And when Christ died, he paid a payment

738
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:46,300
 that they need to acknowledge, they need to accept.

739
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:51,100
 But he died for them too and he died for you.

740
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:53,860
 He canceled your $12 billion and their $12 billion.

741
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:59,020
 And so when we have that, right?

742
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:02,740
 We are able, when we understand how we've been forgiven,

743
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:04,460
 we forgive others.

744
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:05,660
 And so I know right about now,

745
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,380
 you're like, can I ever be angry?

746
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:12,620
 Listen, anger in and of itself is an unproductive emotion.

747
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:15,260
 You take your anger and you figure out

748
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:16,740
 what you need to do because of it.

749
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:20,140
 Is there an injustice that you need to act upon?

750
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:21,540
 Is there someone you need to forgive?

751
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:24,860
 Anger in and of itself, it's only killing you.

752
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:27,900
 I told you about the health, how it affects your health.

753
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:30,860
 It's only hurting you.

754
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:33,580
 You need to figure out what you need to do with your anger.

755
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:36,300
 It's simply an unproductive emotion.

756
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:43,020
 And so what happens when you carry it around

757
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:46,540
 is it shows up at really inopportune times,

758
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:49,220
 like car wrecks or when your boss says something

759
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:51,940
 you don't agree with, a relationship that goes sideways,

760
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:54,500
 and that anger that you're actually carrying

761
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,020
 towards someone else, it shows up.

762
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:57,980
 My friend Allie would talk about

763
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:59,980
 how she was carrying those rocks in her purse

764
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:01,700
 and she'd be at dinner and she'd reach in her purse

765
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,220
 to grab something, she'd pull out a rock

766
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:05,100
 and then she'd have to explain to everybody

767
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,060
 why she had rocks in her purse.

768
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:09,780
 And that's what anger does, is it shows up

769
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:12,520
 at really inopportune times in our life.

770
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,420
 It rears its head.

771
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:14,900
 Can I tell you something?

772
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,980
 You don't wanna marry someone who's angry

773
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:21,020
 because what's gonna happen is you're gonna be

774
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:22,980
 the target of that anger at some point.

775
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:26,340
 Okay, they're gonna take that anger out on you.

776
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:30,300
 And so I hate the stories, some of the stories

777
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,140
 that have been written on your lives.

778
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:36,500
 The abandonment, the hurt, the abuse,

779
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:40,320
 I truly, I hear them over and over and over all the time.

780
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:43,260
 God hates it.

781
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:49,460
 But you have something to do now with it.

782
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:53,140
 You've gotta figure out what you're going to do with it.

783
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:54,820
 It's only hurting you.

784
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:57,180
 Like that guy that was exploding with anger

785
00:33:57,180 --> 00:34:00,500
 outside my truck, that's not like a one-time thing.

786
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,700
 That's something that marked his life.

787
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:05,060
 That was a pattern that showed up in that moment

788
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:06,100
 'cause he carried it.

789
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:10,940
 Verse 32, "Then the master called the servant in."

790
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:13,020
 So now the king's talking again, okay?

791
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:15,780
 The servant went and said, hey, that guy that you forgave,

792
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:19,300
 $12 billion, he wouldn't forgive somebody $100.

793
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,540
 He had him thrown into prison.

794
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:23,260
 And so the king shows up now and he says,

795
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:25,020
 you wicked servant, he said,

796
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:28,300
 I canceled all that debt of yours because you begged me to.

797
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,900
 Shouldn't you have had mercy on your fellow servants

798
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,140
 just as I had on you?

799
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:34,200
 Why would Jesus be telling us this story?

800
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:37,700
 Why would God preserve this for thousands of years

801
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,980
 that we might read it this evening?

802
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:41,900
 I forgave you of your debt.

803
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:44,980
 Shouldn't you forgive them of their debt?

804
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:50,380
 In anger, his master turned him over

805
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:52,300
 to the jailers to be tortured.

806
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,680
 The Greek there is literally,

807
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:56,540
 he was handed over to the torturers

808
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:59,740
 until he should pay back all he owed, which is impossible.

809
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:01,900
 That would take eternity, forever.

810
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,940
 And then Jesus says this,

811
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:05,860
 this really controversial statement.

812
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:10,340
 Listen, listen, this is how my heavenly Father

813
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:12,000
 will treat each of you

814
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,020
 unless you forgive your brother from your heart.

815
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:19,140
 Okay, he says that he threw him in to be tortured

816
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:21,220
 until his debt was paid, that's forever.

817
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:23,860
 This is a clear allusion to hell.

818
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:27,340
 God is the master, we are the servants.

819
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:29,780
 God has forgiven us of an impossible debt.

820
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:32,920
 We don't forgive others of their minor debts against us

821
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:36,620
 that may not feel minor, but they're in this world offenses.

822
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:42,500
 And he says, you don't understand how you've been forgiven.

823
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:48,500
 And so where is God's wrath going to be satisfied?

824
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,060
 It was satisfied on the cross,

825
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:51,920
 or it will be satisfied in eternity.

826
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:58,180
 So why, why would we continue to be angry

827
00:35:58,180 --> 00:35:59,620
 when we say we are forgiven,

828
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:01,420
 but we don't act as forgiven people?

829
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:03,820
 We choke people with our words, our actions,

830
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:06,520
 or the hate in our heart, or just what we feel.

831
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,780
 It's confusing to a watching world.

832
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:10,540
 It belittles the gospel.

833
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:13,380
 And so it says, it almost says, does it not say like,

834
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,660
 hey, if you don't forgive others that you're not forgiven,

835
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:17,260
 doesn't it seem to say that?

836
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:19,380
 But it's probably just some weird text, right,

837
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:21,180
 that if we get into the Greek,

838
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,280
 it really means something else.

839
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,180
 Let's just look at a few others, okay?

840
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:26,500
 Matthew 6, verse 14 through 15.

841
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:29,020
 For if you forgive men when they sin against you,

842
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,220
 your heavenly Father will also forgive you.

843
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:33,280
 But if you do not forgive men their sins,

844
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:36,380
 your Father will not forgive your sins.

845
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:37,520
 We can go Mark 11.

846
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,680
 And when you stand praying,

847
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,780
 if you hold anything against anyone, forgive him,

848
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:43,900
 so that your Father in heaven may forgive you your sins.

849
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:46,620
 Ephesians 4, be kind and compassionate to one another,

850
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:49,740
 forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you.

851
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,740
 Colossians 3, bear with each other

852
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:53,460
 and forgive whatever grievances

853
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:55,140
 you may have against one another.

854
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:57,040
 Forgive as the Lord forgave you.

855
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,820
 Luke 6, but I want you to love your enemies

856
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:01,420
 and do good to them.

857
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:05,180
 Verse 36, be merciful just as your Father is merciful.

858
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:06,740
 Do not judge and you will not be judged.

859
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:08,740
 Do not condemn and you will not be condemned.

860
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:11,420
 Forgive and you will be forgiven.

861
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:12,860
 And so you hear all of that.

862
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:14,660
 And some of you may be really confused

863
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:16,540
 and you're like, is this works-based salvation,

864
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:17,860
 Lordship salvation?

865
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:20,100
 Are you saying the gospel plus something else?

866
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,860
 And I'm saying, no, no, no, no.

867
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:25,020
 I believe with all my heart, what God is teaching here

868
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:27,420
 is that when you understand the forgiveness

869
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:30,900
 that he has given you freely through his Son,

870
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,620
 you did nothing for it.

871
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:35,320
 When you really get it, you pass it on.

872
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:39,420
 And when you cannot give it to someone else,

873
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:41,820
 you may have to go back to the beginning and say,

874
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:44,780
 okay, did I really receive it from God?

875
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:48,940
 Did I truly acknowledge God's payment for my sins?

876
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:52,860
 Do I fully understand that 2018 years ago,

877
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:55,260
 God became a man in the form of Jesus Christ,

878
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:58,620
 lived a perfect life, the most notorious individual ever

879
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:02,100
 to walk on the planet, more books had been sold

880
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,740
 in his honor than any other books

881
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:05,140
 that have ever been written.

882
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:10,780
 And he died for you and he erased your sins.

883
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:15,020
 And he came back from the grave, making him world famous.

884
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:18,540
 Someone that people would talk about.

885
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:21,640
 Our forgiveness of others is evidence

886
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:24,300
 of a right understanding of God's forgiveness of us.

887
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:29,340
 We love God not because of what he might do for us,

888
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,620
 that's superstitious.

889
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:32,540
 If you're here, kind of leveraging,

890
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:34,680
 well, if I go to the porch, then maybe I'll get that job

891
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,560
 or maybe he'll ask me out.

892
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:39,100
 It's karma, guys.

893
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:41,860
 That's another religion, okay?

894
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:44,780
 I hope you're here because of what God

895
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,200
 has already done for you.

896
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:49,860
 He sent his son, Jesus Christ, to die for my sins

897
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:50,940
 and raise him from the dead.

898
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:54,220
 And by that, I'm healed, I'm forgiven, I'm set free.

899
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:56,820
 See my friend Allie, we were on that boat

900
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:59,420
 and she got this, like in the middle of the trip,

901
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:03,180
 she got it and she went onto the roof of that boat

902
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:05,980
 and in the middle of the Amazon, she grabbed those rocks

903
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:10,980
 and she said, "Forgiven, forgiven, forgiven."

904
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:14,540
 And she starts throwing them in the Amazon River.

905
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:17,140
 And then in a way that God would write a story

906
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:21,020
 so beautifully, we climbed down from the roof of that boat

907
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:24,900
 and we went into that same water and she got baptized.

908
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,620
 We have a picture.

909
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:28,420
 She was baptized in that very water,

910
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:31,420
 symbolizing that she had been buried with Christ,

911
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:33,420
 that her sins had been buried with Christ

912
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:36,860
 and she would raise up as a new creation

913
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:39,620
 that God had forgiven her.

914
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:41,440
 It's a story only God can write.

915
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:44,460
 And so your forgiveness, my third point,

916
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:47,060
 demonstrates God's forgiveness.

917
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:50,200
 Your forgiveness demonstrates God's forgiveness.

918
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,220
 It displays God's forgiveness.

919
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:56,020
 He desires to make himself known

920
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:59,900
 and he does this through each of you.

921
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:02,100
 It's why you live, why there's breath in your lungs,

922
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,780
 why your heart beats in your chest.

923
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,460
 It's not to make much of you,

924
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,780
 see how much fun you can have in this life.

925
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:10,220
 What you can experience is to live for his glory.

926
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:14,900
 And so when you leave here, you have an opportunity.

927
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:18,740
 You're gonna walk through those doors.

928
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:20,340
 And through those doors are tubs

929
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:23,280
 and you can make a choice.

930
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:27,020
 That rock, it can be a burden that you carry with you

931
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:28,000
 into tomorrow.

932
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,700
 You sleep with it by your side, put it under your pillow,

933
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:33,260
 you carry it everywhere you go,

934
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:35,340
 in your pocket, in your purse.

935
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:36,820
 You can have it tomorrow.

936
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:39,460
 Okay, you can have it the next day.

937
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:41,700
 You can continue to carry that.

938
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:45,140
 Or when you leave here and you pass that tub,

939
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:47,840
 you can drop it and say the word forgiven.

940
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:50,860
 I forgive you.

941
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:52,980
 I'm releasing this debt.

942
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:54,500
 But as you hold that rock right now,

943
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:55,780
 I want you to count the cost.

944
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:59,300
 I want you to consider what they cost you.

945
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:02,220
 I want you to take a true inventory

946
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:04,380
 of the bitterness that you've carried

947
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:07,060
 or whatever the infraction cost you,

948
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:08,220
 whatever the transgression,

949
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:11,180
 whatever the trespass has cost you.

950
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:14,300
 And you choose when you leave here

951
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:17,120
 if you're going to release that, wipe that debt clean,

952
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:20,780
 or if you're gonna continue to carry that debt against them.

953
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:23,020
 It's your choice.

954
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:25,440
 You can make that choice.

955
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:28,780
 I want you to know that God's anger against you

956
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:30,260
 was satisfied in Christ.

957
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:34,820
 In summary, as forgiven people, we are forgiving people.

958
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:38,020
 And that our forgiveness demonstrates God's forgiveness.

959
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:42,080
 I know that some of you are carrying some big rocks.

960
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:45,280
 They wouldn't fit in that bag right there.

961
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,220
 I want you to know that God desires

962
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:50,860
 to make himself known through your forgiveness.

963
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:55,140
 And I know that sometimes your anger,

964
00:41:55,140 --> 00:42:00,140
 it comes out of a fear that what happened might happen again

965
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:04,740
 or it comes out of love that you have something

966
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:08,300
 that you love so much that it was removed from you

967
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:11,820
 that it brings up as anger,

968
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,380
 comes up in your life as anger.

969
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:20,920
 I want you to know that Jesus takes away your excuse.

970
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:24,500
 When they hurled insults at him,

971
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,840
 he did not retaliate.

972
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:29,940
 When they spit on him, he didn't spit back.

973
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:33,500
 When they insulted him, he did not shout back at them,

974
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:34,900
 but he humbled himself.

975
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:38,220
 Says, "For the joy set before him, he endured the cross."

976
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:39,060
 For you.

977
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:41,380
 For you.

978
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:45,260
 He was publicly tortured and humiliated.

979
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:47,780
 You know the last thing he did before he died

980
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:48,620
 in his ministry?

981
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:50,080
 You know the last thing he did?

982
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:53,200
 Forgive them, Father.

983
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:55,920
 For they know not what they do.

984
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:59,000
 He modeled that for us.

985
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,160
 And maybe you would say, yeah, but that's Jesus.

986
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:06,480
 I get to see incredible examples of forgiveness

987
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:10,720
 all the time, amazing examples of forgiveness.

988
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:15,440
 And so for you women, maybe your worst nightmare,

989
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,400
 the worst thing that you can imagine

990
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:20,720
 is that a man would break into your home,

991
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,360
 a strange man you don't know.

992
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:25,120
 And that he would take something from you,

993
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:29,400
 that he would abuse you, that he would forcefully rape you,

994
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:32,200
 maybe taking your virginity from you.

995
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:33,200
 And you think, how?

996
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,600
 But then in that moment, I'm justified, right?

997
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:38,220
 I don't have to forgive him, right?

998
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:41,680
 I want you to watch my friend Rachel's story.

999
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:45,900
 (gentle music)

1000
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:49,240
 (gentle music)

1001
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:57,700
 On a Friday night, I was just coming home from work,

1002
00:43:57,700 --> 00:44:01,420
 was home by myself and started getting ready for bed,

1003
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:04,980
 was taking a shower, and I heard just some noise.

1004
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:07,580
 It was through my window in my bedroom.

1005
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:15,380
 I turned off the water, and when I came back up

1006
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:17,780
 on the left side, there was this strange man

1007
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:19,460
 just standing right next to me.

1008
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:23,580
 He was there to rape me, to sexually assault me.

1009
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:26,020
 And I just had just this moment of panic,

1010
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:28,940
 and I was scared to death.

1011
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:33,660
 I wanted to see if I could maybe convince him to stop.

1012
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:36,720
 It's my first time.

1013
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:37,960
 I don't know what I'm doing.

1014
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:39,660
 I just kept saying that and saying that,

1015
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:43,960
 hoping that he would stop, and he didn't.

1016
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:46,540
 (gentle music)

1017
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:53,240
 It happened in worst, worst moment of my life.

1018
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:59,480
 He left, immediately called my roommate in panic

1019
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:02,800
 and just said, "You need to call 911 'cause I can't do it."

1020
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:08,460
 About a couple weeks later, the police called me

1021
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:12,240
 and said that they had somebody in custody,

1022
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,440
 and to come in, I saw his face.

1023
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:18,360
 And that was the first time since that night

1024
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:20,560
 that I'd even seen a picture of him.

1025
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,720
 The monster that I had in my head

1026
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,320
 wasn't what I was seeing right in front of me.

1027
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:28,960
 He decided to plead guilty for the rape.

1028
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:33,280
 I became more hateful towards him

1029
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:38,280
 because now I was seeing the product of what he had done.

1030
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:43,880
 After the rape, I considered myself damaged,

1031
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:49,800
 unworthy of a man's love in the future, just a sad person.

1032
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:54,120
 All the precious things that I had held

1033
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:58,040
 for so long in my life, he took that all from me,

1034
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:02,560
 and I just started to see my future just going up in flames.

1035
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:05,500
 I couldn't be whole again.

1036
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:08,640
 It frustrated me that he could have such a hold

1037
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:11,520
 on my life and how I felt.

1038
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:12,380
 Why me?

1039
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:14,600
 Why did I have to go through this?

1040
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:17,000
 It was such a weight on my shoulders,

1041
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,920
 and I just fell apart.

1042
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:20,800
 I needed to do something

1043
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:24,380
 because I knew that forgiveness needed to happen.

1044
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:29,280
 It seemed so daunting, and it seemed so heart-wrenching.

1045
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:30,320
 When I was walking through,

1046
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:31,960
 I just thought maybe I would get an out.

1047
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:33,600
 Like, I don't have to forgive this guy.

1048
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,680
 He's done the worst of the worst.

1049
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:38,400
 I had just never thought of forgiveness as a benefit to me.

1050
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:41,320
 It's really hard to know the extent

1051
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:44,440
 of what God does for us through forgiving us

1052
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:46,440
 until you go through something like this.

1053
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:49,320
 It just changes your thought on what forgiveness looks like.

1054
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:51,880
 God has been softening my heart since that day,

1055
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:54,520
 and even through my breakdowns,

1056
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:57,700
 even in my times where I just yell at him

1057
00:46:57,700 --> 00:47:00,720
 and just get mad at him, what he's allowed in my life,

1058
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,840
 and he's still bigger than all of that.

1059
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:05,060
 He has been with me this entire way.

1060
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:08,500
 I'm letting him heal every part of me

1061
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:10,180
 that was broken that night.

1062
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:11,580
 I feel joy.

1063
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:13,740
 I feel incredible love when I shouldn't,

1064
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:15,500
 and that is total surrender,

1065
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:18,900
 and I have to do it every single day.

1066
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:22,180
 Christ forgave me of my sins.

1067
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:25,780
 If he can do that, I can do that for one man,

1068
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:27,640
 and that is enough to stand on.

1069
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:34,460
 - I want you to meet a hero of mine, Rachel Duncan.

1070
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:38,300
 (congregation applauds)

1071
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:46,740
 I want you to know, and Rachel, you don't know this,

1072
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:48,500
 but I think about you all the time.

1073
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:55,900
 There are times in my life where I feel

1074
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:57,660
 like someone has hurt me,

1075
00:47:57,660 --> 00:48:01,100
 and I feel justified in my anger toward them.

1076
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:03,480
 I think about revenge, and I think about,

1077
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:05,740
 hey, how do I wanna get even?

1078
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:07,860
 I think about you, and I think about

1079
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:09,820
 your example of forgiveness,

1080
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:12,380
 and the way that that has been displayed in your life.

1081
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:13,900
 I think about the community of friends

1082
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:15,540
 that God has raised up around you.

1083
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:18,460
 I want you to know you're one of my heroes.

1084
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:19,780
 I wanna thank you that you would allow us

1085
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:21,660
 to share your story here.

1086
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:24,340
 I just wanna ask, would you close us out in prayer?

1087
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:29,000
 - God, Heavenly Father,

1088
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:33,100
 just thank you for who you are,

1089
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:35,740
 for how much you love us,

1090
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:39,580
 and have forgiven us of our sin, God,

1091
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:44,580
 and you took away our debt through your son, Jesus.

1092
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:49,860
 And man, it is good to just reflect on that

1093
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:52,460
 and remind ourselves daily of how much

1094
00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:57,460
 we have been given in you and your son.

1095
00:48:57,460 --> 00:48:59,240
 God, just thank you for this message,

1096
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:03,440
 for reminding us of who we are.

1097
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,300
 We are followers of Christ.

1098
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:10,300
 We are called to live more like Jesus,

1099
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:12,860
 and that includes forgiveness.

1100
00:49:12,860 --> 00:49:15,380
 It's not easy.

1101
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:16,600
 It's difficult.

1102
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:19,960
 It can be overwhelming sometimes, Lord,

1103
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:24,960
 but gosh, there is freedom when we are able to forgive

1104
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:28,440
 and to trust you and to surrender it

1105
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:30,200
 all at the foot of the cross.

1106
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:34,240
 And I pray that, man, everybody in this building,

1107
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:35,400
 everybody in this church,

1108
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:37,320
 everybody listening online, God,

1109
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:40,200
 tonight would just, would surrender it all,

1110
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:44,940
 would give you the glory by just forgiving

1111
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:48,400
 those that have hurt us, that have wronged us,

1112
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:53,140
 and even asking for forgiveness ourselves

1113
00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:56,820
 and reconciling with our brothers and sisters in Christ, God.

1114
00:49:56,820 --> 00:50:00,640
 I just pray that these young adults

1115
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:02,840
 would be a light in this city,

1116
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:05,600
 that they would do something different,

1117
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:09,560
 that they would radically give their lives to the Lord,

1118
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:12,640
 and that you would give them the power

1119
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:16,880
 and the strength to forgive the unforgivable.

1120
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:21,320
 You did it with us, and I pray that these people,

1121
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:25,680
 these young adults, all of us, God, would do the same.

1122
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:27,260
 Just thank you for your son, Jesus,

1123
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:28,480
 what he did on the cross,

1124
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:32,100
 and I pray these things in his name, amen.

1125
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:33,700
 - Amen, thank you, friend.
