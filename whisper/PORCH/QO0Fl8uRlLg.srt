 [MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:29,720
 All right, ladies and gentlemen.

3
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:30,880
 Let's go.

4
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,280
 What is up to all of our friends tuning in live?

5
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,440
 The Porch Houston, Porch Indianapolis, Porch Austin,

6
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,480
 my special friends in the Porch Northwest Arkansas,

7
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,760
 and of course, my friends here in the house tonight

8
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:43,880
 at the Porch Dallas.

9
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,800
 How we doing?

10
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:50,360
 We are kicking off our first series of 2021 together

11
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,560
 tonight, and we are calling it Fortune Telling.

12
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,320
 And for my extra spiritual people,

13
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,960
 please save your emails.

14
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,840
 Don't freak out on us.

15
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,440
 We are not, by doing this series,

16
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:04,320
 endorsing that you guys go visit fortune tellers.

17
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,240
 Please do not do that, because let's face it, after 2020,

18
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,680
 no one knows what the future is going to look like.

19
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,840
 There is only one who knows what the future is

20
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,040
 going to look like, and that's who

21
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,080
 we're going to talk to tonight and about tonight,

22
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,600
 and his name is God.

23
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,920
 He is the only one who knows our future.

24
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,280
 And so what we're going to do with this series

25
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,720
 is our team has gathered around, and we're like, man,

26
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,680
 if God's the only one who knows our future,

27
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,120
 what do we think that young adults in their 20s and 30s

28
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,960
 navigating through their young adult years,

29
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,160
 what do you think is the one thing that they would ask God?

30
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,800
 If they got one question to say, hey,

31
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,920
 what is this about my future?

32
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,760
 What do you think they'd ask?

33
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,080
 And what we've dedicated ourselves to do through this series

34
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:48,040
 is take words from the past, aka God's word,

35
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:52,440
 the Bible that was written thousands of years ago,

36
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,560
 and tell you how it applies to your present reality

37
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,600
 into your future reality.

38
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,800
 Because God's word doesn't change.

39
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,280
 It does not return void.

40
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,920
 It can be used today, and there are so many things

41
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,600
 that so many questions that we're asking

42
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,040
 that God has already given us an answer to.

43
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,280
 And so before we get to the question

44
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,640
 that we're answering tonight,

45
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,040
 speaking of words from the past,

46
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,360
 I do this thing, if we're friends on Instagram,

47
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,480
 shameless plug, I do this thing where I do this thing

48
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,280
 where I kind of like self-deprecate and humiliate myself

49
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,200
 by sharing old Facebook memories.

50
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,560
 If you guys did not know, you can go to Facebook,

51
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,000
 I don't know why anyone would like knowingly do this,

52
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,360
 but you can go to Facebook

53
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,320
 and go to what's called your memories

54
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,680
 and see statuses that you made from like years ago.

55
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,280
 I'm talking like Facebook doesn't let you forget anything.

56
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,800
 It takes you back to like day one, 10 plus years ago.

57
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,160
 And what I do is I screenshot those memories,

58
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,400
 and then I go over to my Instagram,

59
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,960
 because only like my mom and my grandma

60
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,160
 are on Facebook anymore.

61
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,080
 And I go over and I take it to Instagram

62
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,760
 and I post it on my story,

63
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,320
 and I just kind of let people into

64
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,840
 a more angsty teenager, youthful JD.

65
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,320
 And it's quite humiliating.

66
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,440
 And I thought I would share some with you guys tonight,

67
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,400
 if that's okay.

68
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,040
 This is a safe place, this is a safe place.

69
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,880
 So here we go.

70
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:11,840
 10 years ago on August 19th, I let her know,

71
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,760
 I can't go on without you.

72
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,840
 Not Y-O-U, just you.

73
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,880
 I hope she saw it, bro.

74
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,480
 Next one.

75
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,120
 August 8th, 10 years ago, I said,

76
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,080
 gosh, I believe that a woman should be so lost in God

77
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,720
 that a man must seek him to find her.

78
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,200
 I was that guy.

79
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,040
 I was that guy.

80
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,800
 I was the preacher's kid, okay?

81
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,280
 This is all, I didn't know any better.

82
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,600
 Nine years ago on August 20th, someone hurt JD.

83
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,520
 I said, when it comes down to it,

84
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,880
 you just can't trust anyone these days.

85
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,720
 You live, you learn.

86
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,800
 I mean, like who hurt you?

87
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,360
 Like who hurt you that bad?

88
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,160
 Like to post about it on Facebook.

89
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,480
 And then I thought this one was interesting.

90
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,880
 Okay, here we go.

91
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,160
 Nine years ago on February 2nd,

92
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,760
 so this morning I'm checking it.

93
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,600
 Today's February 2nd, right?

94
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,320
 I said, people stay busy.

95
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,840
 This is deep, okay?

96
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,120
 I'm 18.

97
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,320
 People stay busy in order to not be alone

98
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,080
 because when you are alone, it's quiet.

99
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,640
 Dot, dot, dot.

100
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:22,000
 Which allows time for your mind to think

101
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,120
 and then you start to focus on reality.

102
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,400
 Boo.

103
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:32,240
 And what's so funny about that is I posted that

104
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,800
 nine years ago, not knowing that today

105
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:40,800
 I'd be asking God for all of us, will I be forever alone?

106
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,880
 That's the question we're answering tonight

107
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,280
 is will I be forever alone?

108
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,800
 If you got to ask God your one question,

109
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,560
 we think that a lot of people would wanna know,

110
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,160
 hey, is this it?

111
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,080
 Am I single as a Pringle for the rest of my life?

112
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,280
 Is it just me?

113
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,960
 Or am I gonna be forever alone?

114
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:00,880
 And even JD at 18 knew everyone hates being alone.

115
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,240
 No one likes being alone.

116
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,920
 I've said, you know why we don't have to be alone?

117
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,880
 Because when we're alone, it gets quiet

118
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:11,560
 and we're forced to think.

119
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,360
 And when we're forced to think,

120
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,920
 we're forced to come to grips with reality

121
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:20,840
 about how much life actually sucks at times.

122
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,080
 Like think about 2020.

123
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,200
 Think about, is that a cricket ringtone?

124
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,240
 [congregation laughing]

125
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,160
 What the?

126
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,000
 All right.

127
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,880
 If you're watching online,

128
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,080
 someone's phone's going off up here.

129
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,880
 But when you're sitting there

130
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,160
 and you're forced to be alone and think,

131
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,140
 a lot of us don't like the thoughts that come to our mind.

132
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:44,960
 One, we're faced to realize, one, I'm alone.

133
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,440
 That's scary.

134
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,040
 Or two, man, 2020,

135
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,160
 these things are really getting out of hand.

136
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,720
 The political world is crazy.

137
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,000
 Everyone just seems so hateful on Twitter and Instagram.

138
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,740
 Everyone just seems to be blowing up all the time.

139
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:00,200
 Man, quarantine has really hurt a lot of people.

140
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,000
 The world has never been more in a wreck.

141
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,640
 There are so many people who have lost jobs.

142
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,540
 There are so many people who are sick.

143
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,840
 We hate being alone.

144
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,060
 And not only that, when you think about it,

145
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,920
 being alone is so bad that America,

146
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,920
 we have literally made one of the worst punishment

147
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,180
 out there is something called solitary confinement.

148
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:22,720
 We literally force people to be around nobody

149
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,360
 because even our government knows,

150
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,780
 hey, people who go alone, there is nothing worse than that.

151
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:30,800
 You literally are drove insane.

152
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,780
 Like you go insane.

153
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:33,620
 We hate being alone.

154
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,120
 If you've had Corona, you know that,

155
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,480
 yeah, the body aches are bad.

156
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,400
 The fever and the chills are bad.

157
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,980
 But the worst part is having to literally be alone

158
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:44,280
 with no human contact for that many days in a row.

159
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,240
 It's awful.

160
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,960
 We hate being alone.

161
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,100
 We hate being alone so much that we'll do anything

162
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,320
 to claw out of it.

163
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,600
 We fill our time.

164
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,800
 We fill our schedule.

165
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,120
 We're always on Instagram.

166
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,120
 We're always Snapchatting.

167
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,080
 We're always FaceTiming.

168
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,920
 We're always texting and calling and being around people

169
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,800
 and going out and filling our schedule

170
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,440
 and doing and doing and doing

171
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,600
 because we do not want to be alone.

172
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,020
 But if busyness is the solution,

173
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:12,000
 why does busyness not fix our loneliness?

174
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,200
 Why do we still feel so alone?

175
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,280
 Why do we not fully feel known?

176
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:21,640
 Why do we not fully feel trusted or loved?

177
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,620
 Why do we still feel so misunderstood?

178
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:24,920
 Like no one really gets us.

179
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,280
 Why do we still feel alone

180
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,280
 even though we're always around people?

181
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,520
 What's up with that?

182
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,460
 We hate it.

183
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:35,360
 And so that's why I think we would ask God,

184
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,800
 hey, will I be forever alone?

185
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,560
 'Cause I don't want to be.

186
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,680
 And I know you don't want to be

187
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,160
 'cause that's why when you feel alone,

188
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,480
 you run to pornography.

189
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:48,000
 Because even if it means that I have to interact

190
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,600
 with someone sexually through a screen,

191
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,600
 it's better than sitting here alone.

192
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,480
 I'm bored.

193
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,320
 I'm lonely.

194
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,680
 Might as well.

195
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,200
 Or you'll run to a dating app

196
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,520
 or hook up with a stranger that you barely know

197
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,000
 because you want to fill some void.

198
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,080
 You want to fill some kind of intimacy

199
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,380
 and you will lower your standards

200
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,760
 if it just means that you don't have to sit

201
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,660
 in your loneliness.

202
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,120
 That's why on the weekends, you're like,

203
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,040
 man, I know I should actually go to church,

204
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,300
 but yep, yet again, I got invited to go out

205
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,480
 and I'll go out and I'll get high and I'll get drunk

206
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,440
 and I'll get the stuff I know I shouldn't be getting into

207
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,760
 because at least it makes me feel like I have friends.

208
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,320
 I don't have to just sit alone.

209
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,760
 I can't really find church friends.

210
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,240
 It's kind of hard to find, you know,

211
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,160
 start a new life and do this community thing

212
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,700
 and this church thing in the midst of a pandemic.

213
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:36,400
 And so as an escape, we run to the world,

214
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,680
 but that is not gonna fix your loneliness.

215
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,240
 And I think tonight, God has something to say

216
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:46,320
 from his words from the past, the word, the Bible,

217
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,420
 about the reality of our loneliness.

218
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:54,440
 And so while we're kicking off this series,

219
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,800
 you can go ahead and write down for your note takers,

220
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,140
 will I be forever alone?

221
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:02,380
 Will I be forever alone?

222
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:04,420
 God, what do you have to say to that?

223
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:08,480
 And the first answer is no.

224
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,400
 Why?

225
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,760
 This is deep, ready?

226
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,100
 Because God is with you.

227
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:18,040
 God is with you.

228
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,960
 Duh, it's simple, right?

229
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,480
 Did everyone here know that God was with them?

230
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,640
 Yes?

231
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,200
 Yeah.

232
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,540
 I don't think so.

233
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:29,220
 Like, I really don't think I even fully can comprehend

234
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,720
 what it means to know that the God,

235
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,840
 the creator of the universe,

236
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,620
 the maker of everything we see,

237
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:38,240
 the Bible says that he just spoke it into existence.

238
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,280
 The God that has never been defeated,

239
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,680
 has gone before and won wars,

240
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,780
 who has done everything that you know,

241
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:45,720
 has created who you are.

242
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,280
 He is literally with you.

243
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,760
 And I think that if I understood that reality fully,

244
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,880
 it would change a lot about the way

245
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,160
 that I live and view my life.

246
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,280
 I think if I heard the words and the reminder that,

247
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,840
 hey, God is with me,

248
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,480
 I would have no choice to be like, what?

249
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,320
 Let's go.

250
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,020
 God is with me.

251
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:06,100
 That's the greatest news I've ever heard.

252
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,000
 But we have just, we just forgot.

253
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,120
 Or we've normalized it.

254
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,720
 Or we've let what society tells us,

255
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,600
 what movies tell us,

256
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,120
 what church in the past has told us,

257
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,480
 that person told you, your parents,

258
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,600
 the way they talk about God,

259
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,680
 the traditional Catholic church you were raised in,

260
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,640
 all the different things,

261
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,920
 you let those things dictate your view of God.

262
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,580
 Therefore, when you hear reminders like,

263
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,880
 hey, you'll never be alone because God is with you,

264
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,120
 you're like, but come on, will I ever be married?

265
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,780
 That's what I really want to know.

266
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,320
 But God is looking at you and you come to Him

267
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,800
 and you ask the question, hey,

268
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,560
 is this the way it's gonna be?

269
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,160
 Will I always feel lonely?

270
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,520
 He's like, what do you mean?

271
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:49,900
 No, because I am with you.

272
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,000
 And that's the greatest news

273
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,120
 that we can start 2021 off with saying.

274
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,080
 Tonight is gonna seem like I'm kind of telling you

275
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,280
 the does of Christianity, like the,

276
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,760
 come on, bro, we knew that.

277
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,080
 But if you knew that,

278
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,280
 if you believe that God was with you,

279
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,260
 why does your life look the way it does?

280
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:11,520
 Like, think about it.

281
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:15,640
 If I put your life right now on these screens,

282
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:19,920
 do they declare God is with that man or that woman?

283
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:26,700
 Or does it declare fear is with them?

284
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:32,640
 Worry, doubt, anxiety, depression,

285
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,440
 loneliness, addiction?

286
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,940
 Is that what it declares?

287
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:42,280
 Because God tonight wants you to know

288
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,640
 that those things were never meant to define you,

289
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:49,920
 but He was because He's with you and in you

290
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,040
 and goes before you.

291
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,640
 And so what did He do?

292
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:59,840
 What did God do to make sure that you and I

293
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:03,720
 could be secure to know that God was with us?

294
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:07,780
 He gave us the greatest story of all time.

295
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,480
 It's like a movie.

296
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,400
 I'm about to take y'all in.

297
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,220
 I hope that everyone in this room has heard this story,

298
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,360
 but I'm about to tell you what we as the church

299
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,080
 call the good news, the gospel.

300
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,240
 'Cause I think there's no better way to start off 2021

301
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,000
 than just laying out the story

302
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,920
 that we based our whole life on as Christians.

303
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,600
 Y'all agree with that?

304
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,000
 Y'all need to be reminded of the gospel.

305
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,360
 Y'all love to be reminded of the gospel of the good news.

306
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:35,200
 I know I need it every single day.

307
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,920
 And so we thought, hey, what a better way

308
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,760
 than to show people the extent that God went for them

309
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,940
 to show them, hey, I am with you.

310
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,120
 Wake up.

311
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:51,640
 Because there's an enemy out there and his name is Satan.

312
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,520
 And since the very beginning of time,

313
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,800
 he has had the same play.

314
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,000
 He is not crafty.

315
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,160
 He is not creative.

316
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,920
 He has the same play.

317
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,120
 And it's to convince you that you are alone.

318
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,120
 Even worse, to convince you that you're forever alone.

319
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,080
 And he wants to tell you, hey, because God is not with you,

320
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,680
 because God is not for you,

321
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,640
 everything else around you is.

322
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,760
 That person is.

323
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,500
 That drug is.

324
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,560
 That alcohol is.

325
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,680
 That party is.

326
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,280
 Those things are for you and with you.

327
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,320
 Go do those things.

328
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,600
 That's where true life is found.

329
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,680
 He tried to tell you that God is not with you.

330
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,920
 And he will try to do everything right now

331
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,420
 to distract you from this moment.

332
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:29,200
 But I am about to tell you the greatest story that is true.

333
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,380
 That this is history.

334
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,760
 This reset the calendar.

335
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,160
 This is in the Bible that has never been proven wrong.

336
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,260
 That has stayed the same, has stayed consistent.

337
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:37,220
 This is the narrative.

338
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,500
 This is the whole Bible right here,

339
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,740
 that God, the links that he went through for you and I

340
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:43,580
 to show you that he is with you and he loves you

341
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,860
 and he is for you and he is never going anywhere.

342
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:46,700
 This is it.

343
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,380
 In the beginning, Genesis 1, 1,

344
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,780
 the first verse of your Bible,

345
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:52,780
 it says that God created the heavens and the earth

346
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:53,620
 and he filled it.

347
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,460
 Everything you see, the mountains, the oceans,

348
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,420
 the grass, the trees,

349
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:59,340
 he created it all in six days and said that it was good.

350
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:02,420
 And on the last day, he made something really special,

351
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:03,980
 man and woman.

352
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:06,800
 He created man and woman, but these people,

353
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,100
 he didn't just say they were good.

354
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,620
 He said they were very good

355
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:12,140
 because he made them in relationship with himself.

356
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:15,140
 He made them to know him and to make himself known.

357
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,220
 And all he asked of them was,

358
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,620
 "Hey, would you love me?

359
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,580
 And would you trust me?

360
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,540
 I'm gonna give you everything that you could have.

361
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,180
 It's gonna be called the Garden of Eden.

362
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:25,660
 It's gonna be, have all the fruit, all the shelter,

363
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:26,500
 all the animals,

364
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,660
 everything you need to be fully satisfied in me.

365
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,380
 You're also gonna have my presence."

366
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:33,260
 God walked with Adam and Eve, man and woman, in the garden.

367
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,980
 We see that in the beginning of Genesis.

368
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,140
 He walked with them.

369
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:39,260
 They had everything their heart could desire.

370
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:40,980
 He said, "But would you trust me?

371
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:45,860
 The only thing I asked for you to do is not to eat from,"

372
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:48,060
 boop, he planted this tree,

373
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,660
 called the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil

374
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:53,100
 because he knew what was best.

375
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,180
 He knew what man would do with that kind of knowledge.

376
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,420
 So he said, "Would you just trust me?

377
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,780
 I got this, I'm God.

378
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:59,220
 Do not eat from that tree.

379
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:01,620
 Everything else, have your way.

380
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,340
 Just don't touch that guy."

381
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:07,340
 So not even three chapters into our Bible,

382
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,060
 man and woman, Adam and Eve,

383
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:11,460
 do exactly what you and I would have done.

384
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:14,020
 The serpent, Satan, he comes down.

385
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:17,220
 And like I said, he begins to twist God's word

386
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,700
 and convince Adam and Eve,

387
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:22,140
 "Hey, did God actually say

388
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:26,460
 like you guys, what he might say to you is,

389
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:30,220
 'Hey, did God actually say that he will always be with you

390
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:33,540
 because hello, have you looked around at 2020?

391
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:37,500
 When's the last time that you heard from God?'"

392
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,820
 All these Christians talk about hearing from God.

393
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,300
 Do you ever hear the voice of God?

394
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,660
 Would you even know what it sounded like?

395
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:43,700
 Does God actually speak?

396
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,780
 Is God actually here?

397
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:47,740
 Are your prayers actually just hitting the ceiling?

398
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,860
 When's the last time you felt God?

399
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,620
 Haven't you been feeling really alone lately?

400
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,660
 Hasn't God seen to be withholding from you?

401
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:54,700
 Is he good?

402
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:58,420
 Does he actually know what's best?

403
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:59,540
 And he lies to you.

404
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,660
 He says, "No, but I do, trust me."

405
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,740
 And back in Genesis three,

406
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,940
 Satan looks at Adam and Eve and says,

407
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,700
 "He doesn't want you to eat that tree

408
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,740
 'cause it's bad for you.

409
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,880
 He wants you to eat it because it's good for you.

410
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,440
 And he knows that if you eat it, you'll be like him.

411
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,420
 So go ahead, try it."

412
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:19,140
 And it says, "When Eve looked at the fruit

413
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:22,260
 and saw that it was desirable to make one wise,

414
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,980
 she took of it and she ate of it.

415
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,940
 And then she gave it to Adam and he ate from it.

416
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:30,260
 And that was boom, when everything changed.

417
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:32,700
 Light turned to darkness.

418
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:36,040
 Sin entered the world and plagued humanity

419
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:39,100
 for the rest of the Bible.

420
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,980
 Sin came in.

421
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,020
 But the beauty of that is when you flip over

422
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:45,700
 to the New Testament and see in Romans chapter five,

423
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:48,180
 it says that, Romans 5, 8 says that,

424
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:50,020
 "God demonstrated his love for us

425
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:52,620
 that while we were still sinners,

426
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:55,300
 that when Adam and Eve all the way to you and I today,

427
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,220
 and that every sin that we commit moving forward,

428
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,340
 while we were sinners,

429
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:01,560
 he made a plan to send Christ to die for us."

430
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,860
 Not when we got perfect,

431
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,340
 not when we got things figured out,

432
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:05,660
 not when we started going to church,

433
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,540
 that while we were in our sin,

434
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:10,020
 God made a plan to send Jesus to die for us.

435
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,280
 And he made that plan from the very beginning.

436
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,860
 God set a plan in motion in Genesis chapter three.

437
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:17,340
 He said that, "Through Eve, through you,

438
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:19,140
 I'm going to send a Messiah."

439
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,660
 Another word for that is savior.

440
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,660
 He's going to come into the world

441
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:25,120
 and save the world from sin.

442
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,300
 Because God knew at that point,

443
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:29,080
 men and women or men and women were doomed.

444
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,460
 That sin, because he was holy,

445
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,700
 separated man from God.

446
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,720
 And that sin, when we choose ourself,

447
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,540
 would separate us further and further and further

448
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:39,380
 and further.

449
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:41,820
 And mankind just got further and further away from God.

450
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:45,060
 And so God chose this people by the nation of Israel,

451
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:48,820
 the Jews, to represent his glory to the world.

452
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,580
 And here's what you need to know

453
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,300
 about the entire Old Testament.

454
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,460
 The Old Testament is just tracking the story

455
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:58,080
 of that people group known as the Israelites, the Jews.

456
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,100
 And God said, "Hey, if you would just trust me,"

457
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,320
 like he asked Adam and Eve, like he asked us today,

458
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,620
 "If you would just trust me,

459
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:07,980
 you would see that I am with you and I am for you

460
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,100
 and I love you."

461
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,900
 But man did not trust God.

462
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,540
 Man wanted to be Lord of their own lives like we do today.

463
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,580
 And they chose their own way and their sin

464
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:18,860
 took them further and further and further away from God.

465
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,320
 Therefore they felt alone.

466
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,560
 And God said, "Man, if you want to be alone,

467
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:28,680
 if you really want to live life like you're alone,

468
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,620
 then have your way.

469
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:31,980
 Taste what it's like without me."

470
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:35,360
 And for 400 years, at the end of your Old Testament,

471
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,660
 in the Bible, God was silent.

472
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:43,120
 It's understandable for the Israelites to think

473
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,540
 that they were alone because God was silent,

474
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:50,620
 not leave, but he was silent for 400 years.

475
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:53,700
 But the story does not end there

476
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:57,440
 because when you open up to Matthew chapter one,

477
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,020
 the first page in your New Testament,

478
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,380
 here is what we read.

479
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:03,660
 Guys, this is life-changing.

480
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:07,180
 Romans 1:23, you want to ask the question,

481
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:09,780
 if God is with you, if you're alone, here's what it says.

482
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:14,720
 "Look, the virgin, Mary, will conceive a child.

483
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,240
 She will give birth to a son

484
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:21,760
 and they will call him Emmanuel, which means what?

485
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,680
 God is with us."

486
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,160
 What does it mean?

487
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,640
 God is with us.

488
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,960
 Say it one more time.

489
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:31,360
 God is with us.

490
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,440
 That is the best news ever.

491
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,680
 That God said, "Hey, I love you so much

492
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,640
 that I'm going to take on bodily form

493
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,640
 through my son, Jesus, and we're going to send him down

494
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,140
 and to make sure that I secure that you know,

495
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:46,540
 that you know in 2021 that I am for you

496
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:49,540
 and that I love you, I'm going to send my son."

497
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:52,700
 Just because I'm so wildly crazy,

498
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,880
 God said, "I'm going to name him Emmanuel,"

499
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,000
 another name for Jesus, which means God is with us.

500
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,220
 What did God do to secure his love for you,

501
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:06,820
 to make sure that you knew that he was with you?

502
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:10,960
 He sent his one and only son to die for you.

503
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,220
 And that's how the story continues.

504
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:15,560
 God knew that we would need a sacrifice

505
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:18,280
 for our separation between us and God.

506
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,260
 And so Jesus Christ came down, you've heard this story.

507
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:23,020
 He came down to carry our sins.

508
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:25,360
 He knew there was nothing that we could do.

509
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,940
 So he bore every sin on the cross.

510
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:33,160
 The Bible says that he who knew no sin became sin

511
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,280
 so that we might become the righteousness of God.

512
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,920
 And Jesus lived a life for 33 years.

513
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,380
 He was a young adult,

514
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:41,000
 but he did something that you and I could not do.

515
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,820
 He lived a perfect life, making him the perfect sacrifice.

516
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,820
 And they beat him because of it.

517
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:49,320
 They mocked him for calling himself Jesus.

518
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,500
 The Jews made fun of him.

519
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,000
 They pulled out his beard.

520
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,180
 They beat his flesh.

521
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:56,960
 They put a robe on him and took it off and on and off.

522
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,500
 And then they made him carry his own cross up a hill.

523
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,660
 And then they nailed him to the cross.

524
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:08,460
 And on that cross, he said, I know, I know in 2021,

525
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:11,580
 there are gonna be people who don't believe

526
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:14,180
 that I am with them, but look at me.

527
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,440
 I don't care, I love them.

528
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,900
 I love them.

529
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:23,020
 Emmanuel, God with us.

530
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:29,020
 Jesus on the cross to remind you today,

531
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:31,920
 hey, I know that the world seems hard.

532
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,440
 I know that your sin seems great.

533
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:37,400
 I know that you feel alone, but I'm with you.

534
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,920
 And how much do I want you to know that?

535
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,620
 I'm willing to die for you.

536
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:44,100
 So you don't have to let your sin separate you from God,

537
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,220
 but so that you can be with him forever.

538
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:50,320
 So that God with us can be a reality.

539
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:54,000
 And so that one day we could die because Jesus died

540
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,520
 and that he didn't just stay dead.

541
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,320
 He was buried in a tomb for three days.

542
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,400
 But on the third day, he rose in victory,

543
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,560
 defeating sin, defeating our sin,

544
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,160
 defeating death once and for all.

545
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,440
 And because when he rose,

546
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:08,080
 we now one day get to rise from our death and be with God.

547
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,640
 Not only is God with us in the form of Jesus

548
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,240
 through his death, burial, and resurrection,

549
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,360
 but now we get to go and be with God in heaven

550
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,920
 because Jesus said it is done.

551
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,860
 It is finished.

552
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:21,800
 No more separation, no more feeling alone,

553
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,640
 no more wondering, am I ever gonna find someone?

554
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,120
 Do I, am I ever gonna fulfill this need?

555
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:29,280
 Because no, you have all you need in Jesus.

556
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,520
 That was what he did.

557
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,200
 That's what God went through

558
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,880
 to make sure that when you ask the question,

559
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,240
 man, am I gonna be forever alone?

560
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,120
 He's like, no.

561
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:45,080
 Remember, I sent my son.

562
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:49,640
 God was with us in the form of man

563
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:53,880
 and he died so that you would never have to be alone.

564
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,560
 You get to be with God.

565
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:00,040
 And guys, that is why we call it the good news.

566
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:03,280
 It's not just the good news, it's the best news.

567
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,200
 It is what we stake our life on.

568
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,400
 If someone walks in here right now,

569
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,520
 I guarantee you guys, if someone walks in here right now

570
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,840
 and we're like, hey, are you a Christian?

571
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:13,120
 Do you believe that Jesus Christ came to earth and died

572
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,080
 and rose again for you?

573
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,360
 And he held a gun to my head, I would say, yes,

574
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,880
 I do believe that.

575
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,040
 And you can take me because I'm gonna go be with God

576
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,440
 because he came to be with me.

577
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,040
 God is with me.

578
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,720
 Guys, that is great news.

579
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:31,400
 And if you don't have that in your life,

580
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,400
 you're missing out.

581
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:39,400
 You are missing out and you are being sold a counterfeit life,

582
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,760
 a life that promises joy and happiness,

583
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,880
 but you'll always be searching

584
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,900
 'cause that is the only place that life is found,

585
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,060
 it's in Jesus.

586
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:54,160
 And the best part is it still doesn't end there.

587
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:57,160
 Look at this, Jesus, before he dies, look at his disciples.

588
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,380
 He looks at his Christ followers

589
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,480
 and this is what he tells them in John 14,

590
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,860
 verses 16 through 18.

591
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:06,720
 And I will ask the father

592
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,600
 and he will give you another advocate

593
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,920
 who will never leave you.

594
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:17,360
 He is the Holy Spirit who leads into all truth.

595
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,320
 The world cannot receive him

596
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,120
 because it isn't even looking for him

597
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,680
 and it doesn't recognize him,

598
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:27,340
 but you know him because he lives with you now

599
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:30,480
 and later will be in you.

600
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,040
 No, I will not abandon you as orphans.

601
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,940
 I will come to you.

602
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:40,600
 Jesus is looking at his disciples and he's like,

603
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,680
 "Hey, I'm gonna die.

604
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:45,600
 And I'm gonna raise again from the dead three days later.

605
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,120
 And then I'm going to ascend.

606
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,000
 I'm gonna go up, you know, all like mystical like,

607
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,380
 I'm gonna go up to heaven.

608
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:56,100
 But then the Holy Spirit is gonna come down

609
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:59,860
 and he's gonna be in you for those that are in Christ.

610
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:02,660
 He's gonna literally come and dwell inside of your body.

611
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:05,060
 And how does that happen?

612
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:06,460
 How do we become in Christ?

613
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:08,420
 How do we know that God has saved us?

614
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:11,820
 Romans 10, nine says that if you confess with your mouth

615
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:14,160
 that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart

616
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:18,220
 that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.

617
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,460
 It's that simple.

618
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:20,640
 If there's someone here tonight

619
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,740
 that has never heard the story that I just told

620
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:26,700
 and said, "Yep, I'm putting all my chips in."

621
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,460
 I believe that story.

622
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,520
 If you would confess and say,

623
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,260
 "I believe that Jesus died for me."

624
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,720
 And believe that in your heart,

625
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,680
 the Bible says that you will be saved.

626
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:37,180
 But guys, it isn't just words from your mouth.

627
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:39,540
 It is a life that you surrender.

628
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:42,260
 It is a call on your life.

629
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:45,820
 And the Bible says, Jesus says right here,

630
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:47,820
 if you would do that,

631
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:49,500
 confess with your mouth and believe in your heart,

632
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,340
 you will be saved.

633
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,260
 And then when you are saved,

634
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:53,160
 here's what Ephesians one says.

635
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,300
 It's a lot of Bible, listen up.

636
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,540
 Okay, here we go.

637
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:59,140
 God's purpose was that the Jews

638
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:01,220
 who were the first to trust in Christ,

639
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,480
 that's what I was talking about in the Old Testament,

640
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,760
 the nation of Israel,

641
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,340
 they would bring praise and glory to God.

642
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:08,100
 And now you Gentiles, that's us.

643
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,620
 Gentiles is just a word for a non-Jew.

644
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:13,980
 And now you Gentiles have also heard the truth.

645
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,200
 That's what you just heard.

646
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,780
 When I shared the good news, the truth,

647
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:19,740
 the good news that God saves you.

648
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:22,860
 And when you believed in Christ,

649
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:25,460
 like I just read, when you believe in your heart,

650
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,940
 that Christ saved you,

651
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:29,320
 he identified you as his own

652
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:34,280
 by giving you the Holy Spirit, whom he promised long ago.

653
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:37,020
 The word Holy Spirit kind of has this like weird aura

654
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:37,860
 about it.

655
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:40,380
 It's like, is this like some like ghost that like,

656
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:41,220
 do I feel it?

657
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:42,540
 Does it hurt when it comes inside of me?

658
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:44,780
 Like, I think a lot of people have a lot of questions

659
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:45,860
 about the Holy Spirit.

660
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:46,860
 It kind of freaks people out.

661
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:47,780
 It's like, can I be like,

662
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:50,060
 buzzah, and like the Holy Spirit can like do power stuff

663
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:50,900
 now that I have him.

664
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:53,860
 Like, what does it mean to have the Holy Spirit?

665
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:57,180
 And it just means that it's the way of saying

666
00:26:57,180 --> 00:27:01,300
 that God comes and dwells in you through the Holy Spirit.

667
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:03,980
 He is in you through the Holy Spirit.

668
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:05,660
 And here's what the Holy Spirit does.

669
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:08,420
 He does a lot of things for the believer,

670
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,300
 but the Holy Spirit,

671
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,500
 one of the things he does is he convicts you.

672
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,340
 You know that voice that like,

673
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:14,020
 you know when you start to try to like follow God

674
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:15,780
 and you start to like dive into your Bible

675
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,420
 and start living for God for the first time,

676
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,660
 the things that you used to do

677
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:20,380
 that were really sinful and wrong,

678
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:21,460
 it was kind of like, eh,

679
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:23,540
 but then once you gave your life to Christ,

680
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:26,260
 suddenly you felt really guilty after you did them.

681
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,180
 Anyone ever experienced that?

682
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:30,020
 It's like, why do I suddenly feel so bad about this?

683
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:31,820
 That's the Holy Spirit.

684
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:34,580
 He does this thing called convicts you.

685
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:35,620
 It's your conscience.

686
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:37,340
 He tells you, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,

687
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:40,900
 light and darkness cannot coexist.

688
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:41,900
 Light is in you now.

689
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,080
 So get that darkness out of here.

690
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,100
 That's what that conviction is.

691
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,860
 He encourages you.

692
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,780
 He speaks to you when you read God's word.

693
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:51,460
 He helps you understand God's word.

694
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:52,500
 He gives you discernment.

695
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,900
 He helps you make choices of what God's will is

696
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,180
 for your life.

697
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:58,500
 He guides you in God's ways.

698
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,100
 He helps you when you need to fight temptation.

699
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:03,460
 You think you don't have the power?

700
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:04,940
 The Holy Spirit gives you the power.

701
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:06,100
 You don't have the power,

702
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:08,340
 but the Holy Spirit in you has plenty of power

703
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:10,120
 to help you fight temptation.

704
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:14,740
 And that Holy Spirit is in you.

705
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:17,460
 And it says right here in that verse in John

706
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:19,980
 that it will never leave you,

707
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:23,140
 that it's in you.

708
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:25,060
 And so when you ask the question, man,

709
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:28,360
 will I be forever alone?

710
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:31,300
 The answer is no.

711
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,720
 If you are in Christ, it is impossible

712
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:36,860
 because the Holy Spirit is in you.

713
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:38,760
 God is dwelling in you.

714
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:44,620
 God dwells in you spiritually through the Holy Spirit

715
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:47,140
 until you go to be with God physically in heaven.

716
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:54,120
 And that Holy Spirit is how you can know I am not alone.

717
00:28:54,120 --> 00:29:01,640
 God sent his son so I can know that I'm never alone.

718
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:06,500
 It's like, so what JD?

719
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:09,820
 I've heard that story my whole life.

720
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:11,420
 I've heard that story so many times.

721
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:14,820
 And it's just like, why do I still feel so alone then?

722
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,700
 Like, why is this so hard?

723
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:20,660
 The reality is, is the Bible says that in this world,

724
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:22,620
 you will have suffering.

725
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:24,740
 God does tell us that hard times will come.

726
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:26,200
 Loneliness will come.

727
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:30,060
 A desire for a different way of life will come.

728
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:30,940
 And so what do we do?

729
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:32,140
 It's really practical guys.

730
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,620
 And I think this is why we're starting 2021 off this way

731
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:38,020
 'cause I know that I need a reboot every year

732
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:41,440
 of reminding myself how to remember that God is with me.

733
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:45,460
 The first one, just spend time with God.

734
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:48,380
 Like look at your schedule and ask yourself,

735
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:51,060
 do I just spend time with God?

736
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:53,220
 Like not just give him a little Devo a day,

737
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:55,900
 a five minute little like Jesus calling journal

738
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,580
 I read in the morning and post that on my Instagram

739
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:59,380
 with my latte and be like, Jesus things.

740
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:02,560
 Like what does it actually look like

741
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,820
 to spend time with God?

742
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:09,800
 It means knowing his word, reading it,

743
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,300
 not being okay with the status quo when you read something

744
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:14,980
 and it's like really a big name and all that.

745
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,260
 And you're like, oh, skip forward.

746
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:17,620
 Okay, Jesus loves you.

747
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:19,020
 And you're like, there it is.

748
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:22,500
 No, like take time knowing God's word.

749
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,900
 And guys, I know it's tough.

750
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,620
 I know sometimes when I'm reading the Old Testament

751
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:27,100
 to this day, I'm like reading through Leviticus

752
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:29,980
 and it's like, and don't eat pork and don't get tattoos.

753
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:31,500
 And I'm like, what does that mean?

754
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:34,800
 And I'm just like, so it can be hard.

755
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,860
 I get it, it's a big book.

756
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:39,700
 I for one don't like reading, but I'll tell you this.

757
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:44,700
 I am learning to love the word of God.

758
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,980
 And I believe that you can too,

759
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,900
 but you have to spend time with him.

760
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:52,800
 Just some really helpful, just easy handholds.

761
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:59,060
 Pick a time, pick a place, have a plan.

762
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:03,140
 Pick a time for me, it's the mornings.

763
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:05,000
 If I don't do in the morning, I'm probably not doing it.

764
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,100
 I'm just being honest.

765
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:10,220
 Pick a place that might be your little like nook

766
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:13,340
 in your kitchen, might be in your bed.

767
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:16,140
 It might be while you're driving in your car, audio book.

768
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,860
 I don't know, for me, I like going to a coffee shop.

769
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:20,800
 I'm basic like that.

770
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:23,600
 Pick your place and then have a plan.

771
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,660
 Watermark, if you don't have a church

772
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:26,960
 that gives you a Bible reading plan,

773
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,280
 we have a great one called jointhejourney.com.

774
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,620
 I would highly encourage you to write that down.

775
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:34,420
 And this year we are reading through the Bible together.

776
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:36,100
 It's really simple.

777
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:38,640
 Like all I have is this, it's online though.

778
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,020
 And it just has the entire Bible to read in a year.

779
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:44,520
 And I just go through and I cross it out every day.

780
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,900
 And if you can see right now, I miss some days.

781
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,260
 I'll catch up, okay.

782
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:52,740
 But I have a plan and this is gonna guide me

783
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:55,300
 to read the entire Bible in a year.

784
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:59,460
 And so ask yourself, do I have a plan in 2021

785
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:01,940
 to devote myself, to spend time with God,

786
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:04,380
 to really learn about Him and study His word?

787
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:09,840
 And as you study His word, second thing, pray.

788
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,900
 Pray and talk to Him.

789
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:15,540
 How do you expect to know anyone deeper,

790
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:17,940
 on a deeper level, if you do not communicate?

791
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:19,220
 God gave us the ability,

792
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:21,740
 because we have the Holy Spirit that we just talked about,

793
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:24,100
 He gave us the ability to communicate with Him.

794
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:27,360
 Through the Holy Spirit, we get to talk to God.

795
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:30,880
 And so take time.

796
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,540
 If you don't know how to pray,

797
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:35,180
 grab some people around you, say,

798
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:36,660
 "Hey, how do I pray?"

799
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:38,420
 It's that simple.

800
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:41,180
 But what I've learned, a great place to start,

801
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:42,220
 is this right here.

802
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:50,000
 Open up these hands and say, "God, here, here.

803
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:58,700
 I don't know what I'm doing.

804
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,540
 I need you.

805
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:03,100
 I need you today.

806
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,940
 Life is hard.

807
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:06,940
 Temptation will come.

808
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:09,800
 That computer is waiting for me when I get home.

809
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,640
 That girl is gonna text me tonight.

810
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:15,220
 That guy is gonna hit me up tonight and Snapchat me.

811
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:19,820
 The worries and the anxieties and the job

812
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:21,860
 and the daddy issues and all those different things

813
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:23,300
 are gonna be waiting for me.

814
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:25,420
 That toxic relationship is waiting for me.

815
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,420
 So here."

816
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:31,260
 And you see what God will do with this kind of posture.

817
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:34,420
 You see what God will do with that kind of prayer.

818
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:37,540
 He loves it when His sons and daughters come to Him

819
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:39,400
 and say, "Here, Father."

820
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:42,720
 He loves to provide for His children.

821
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,560
 Test me on it.

822
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:46,520
 I am sure of this.

823
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,860
 I've seen it in my friend's life,

824
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:49,540
 in my life personally, all around me,

825
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:52,900
 that you cannot start with the simple two basic principles

826
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,620
 of reading your Bible and praying in your life

827
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:55,720
 not radically changed.

828
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,620
 Try me.

829
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:58,440
 Try me.

830
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,860
 Start tomorrow.

831
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:03,860
 Read your Bible, pray,

832
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:08,580
 and email me and let me know how your life starts to change.

833
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:12,580
 And then thirdly, remind yourself of the gospel every day.

834
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:15,980
 You wanna be able to fight that lie

835
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,740
 that tells you that you're forever alone?

836
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:20,860
 Remind yourself of the message I just proclaimed.

837
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:21,980
 It's this simple.

838
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:27,360
 I was dead in my sin, separated from God,

839
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,500
 but He loved me so much.

840
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,740
 He said, "I wanna be with you."

841
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:32,540
 So He sent His son down to earth to die for me.

842
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:35,120
 And He rose from His death, and I believe in that.

843
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,900
 Therefore, I don't have to fear loneliness

844
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:41,980
 because the gospel is true for me, and I believe it,

845
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:43,620
 and God is with me.

846
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:48,580
 And guys, I need that reminder every single day.

847
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:53,360
 Every day, when my sin comes crouching,

848
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,420
 when the enemy reminds me of my mistakes

849
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:57,420
 and tries to tell me that I am damaged goods

850
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:59,500
 or that I'm not even worthy to be up here right now,

851
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,540
 or He tried to tell me that I don't know what I'm doing

852
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:02,820
 and I need to take control of my life

853
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:04,020
 because I start freaking out,

854
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:07,740
 I have to remind myself of the gospel every single day,

855
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:08,680
 and you do too.

856
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:13,640
 You wanna know that you are not alone?

857
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:18,680
 Remind yourself of the story of the extent that God went

858
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,360
 to prove that He is with you.

859
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:26,920
 And the beauty of this, heading into answer number two,

860
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:30,960
 God did not just leave us here and just drop us off

861
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,740
 to figure all this out on our own.

862
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:35,640
 He's not just like, "Hey, so now go in your room

863
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:39,000
 and sit Indian style and be like, God."

864
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 No, He wants you to have a way to be surrounded with people

865
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,160
 to remind you that you're not alone,

866
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,800
 which leads to answer number two,

867
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,880
 will I be forever alone?

868
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:54,840
 No, because God did not create you to be alone.

869
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,840
 How do I know this?

870
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:00,920
 Genesis one, talking back to when God created man and woman

871
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:04,200
 in verse 26, it says, "Then God said,

872
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:09,200
 "let us make human beings in our image to be like us."

873
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:16,040
 Verse 27, "So God created human beings in His own image,

874
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,180
 "in the image of God, He created them,

875
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:20,020
 "male and female, He created them."

876
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:25,020
 Notice that language, in our image, to be like us.

877
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:31,360
 What that tells me is that God exists in community,

878
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:36,160
 in we, in us, in our.

879
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,880
 God is not just one being, we actually call Him

880
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,440
 what is known as the Trinity, three in one.

881
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,780
 It's really confusing, actually,

882
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,040
 I still don't understand it,

883
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:48,160
 but what it means is Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

884
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:52,920
 God is three in one being,

885
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:58,060
 but it says that He made us in His image,

886
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:03,060
 which means that He created us to also not want to be alone,

887
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:09,380
 to live and exist with one another's in our mentality,

888
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:12,260
 in we mentality, in us mentality.

889
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:13,840
 That's why it feels so good to come here

890
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,100
 and be encouraged together,

891
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:19,140
 because God never designed for you to be alone.

892
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:24,140
 He made you in His image, just like He sees, you see.

893
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:28,500
 Just like God gets angry, you get angry.

894
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,420
 The only problem is, is you get simply angry,

895
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:33,120
 He gets righteously angry, but we won't go into that.

896
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:39,180
 God, just like He loves, you have the ability to love,

897
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:44,600
 because He made you in His image.

898
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:48,760
 Everything you are, God made in His image.

899
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,880
 And one of those things that is so unique is He said,

900
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:54,580
 "Let us make man and woman in our image."

901
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:59,160
 You are designed to want to be with others.

902
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,880
 And so what did He do?

903
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:05,400
 To ensure that you will not have to live life alone,

904
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:08,720
 He instituted two things that I wanna remind you of,

905
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,960
 and this is the fun stuff to talk about.

906
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,660
 This kind of might start to answer

907
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:13,160
 what you're actually wondering tonight.

908
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:16,320
 The first thing that God gave us to remind us

909
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:21,320
 that He is with us is the gift that we call marriage.

910
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:24,960
 Let's go, marriage, yeah.

911
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,720
 Who's ready to get married one day?

912
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,880
 Yeah, okay, okay.

913
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,860
 Who's afraid of, who's like terrified of marriage one day?

914
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:34,640
 Okay, yeah, that's right.

915
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,120
 It's all you people who are over here like,

916
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,480
 am I gonna be forever alone?

917
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,240
 But anyways, we'll talk about that.

918
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,360
 God gave us this gift.

919
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,160
 He didn't have to do this,

920
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,760
 but He gave us this gift called marriage.

921
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,600
 Let's read about it.

922
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:51,820
 In the beginning of Genesis, it says in Genesis 2,

923
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:53,920
 verse 18, "Then the Lord God said,

924
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,440
 "It is not good for the man to be alone."

925
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:59,240
 Even God knew it is not good for man to be alone.

926
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:01,740
 Look at him, he just looks so pathetic right there.

927
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:04,960
 So what did He do?

928
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,400
 He knew what to do.

929
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,040
 It says, "I will make a helper,"

930
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,400
 which ladies, by the way,

931
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,400
 it does not mean that you just belong in the kitchen

932
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,920
 and clean the house and help in the man.

933
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,040
 Can I get an amen?

934
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:18,160
 That is not, that is not what that means.

935
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:22,440
 God even calls the Holy Spirit our helper, all right?

936
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:26,020
 With a woman comes power, all right?

937
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:27,680
 That's what He means in a helper.

938
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:32,980
 And so He says, "Not good for man to be alone.

939
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:37,980
 "I will make a helper who is just right for him."

940
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,900
 Who is just right for him.

941
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:46,320
 And He calls her his wife.

942
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,860
 It says in verse 22,

943
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:51,040
 "In the rib that the Lord God had taken from the man,

944
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,480
 "He made into a woman and brought her to the man."

945
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,720
 He brought her to the man.

946
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,480
 And then He said, the man said,

947
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:00,960
 "This at last is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh."

948
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:01,960
 Kind of weird, but,

949
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:05,140
 "She shall be called woman

950
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:07,960
 "because she was taken out of man.

951
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:11,480
 "Therefore, a man shall leave his father and his mother

952
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,680
 "and hold fast to his wife

953
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,060
 "and they shall become one flesh."

954
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:20,100
 Y'all, this shows me that we serve a good, good father.

955
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:22,720
 Because He knew, I mean,

956
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,160
 can you imagine the world right now

957
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,400
 if it was just a bunch of men?

958
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,240
 Lord!

959
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:33,520
 He knew it was not good that man should be alone.

960
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,960
 And so out of man, He created woman

961
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,840
 and then He instituted this beautiful thing

962
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,600
 to forever remind each other,

963
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:44,720
 "Hey, you're not alone, I am with you."

964
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,000
 And I'm even gonna remind you that

965
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,760
 through the gift that is marriage.

966
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:48,760
 And some of you right now,

967
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,400
 when you hear the word marriage,

968
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,600
 you're like, "Man, I don't know about all that."

969
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,760
 Like, I'm riding solo, that's me.

970
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,800
 Like I've got this thing, I'm climbing the ladder of success.

971
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:58,960
 I'm good on my own.

972
00:40:58,960 --> 00:40:59,800
 I don't know about marriage.

973
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,600
 Let's just be honest, you're just hurt.

974
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,440
 (congregation laughing)

975
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,680
 Like you're just hurt.

976
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,520
 And hey, hey, hey, I'm being serious.

977
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:11,120
 Something happened to you that told you,

978
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:14,120
 "Hey, hey, that's not for me."

979
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:18,640
 And maybe some of you, there is the caveat

980
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:21,040
 that God could be calling to singleness.

981
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,520
 And others of you who have elevated marriage

982
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,120
 and made it some idol in your life,

983
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:27,000
 you need to look at the other side of the coin and go,

984
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,320
 "Would I be okay with submitting to God's call in my life

985
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,440
 if it were singleness?"

986
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,560
 And you need to stop running from that.

987
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:36,400
 Both people have to stop running.

988
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,040
 The person who's afraid of marriage because of their hurt,

989
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,240
 the person who's afraid of being single

990
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,320
 because they don't believe that God is enough.

991
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:45,720
 But God gave us marriage.

992
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,160
 And if He's called you to marriage,

993
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:50,520
 then He's called you to participate in a gift.

994
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:54,640
 But I know a lot of times the world paints marriage

995
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,680
 as a thing that's not a gift from God.

996
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,800
 We have distorted the institute that is marriage

997
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,000
 and what God always intended it to be.

998
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,080
 The rom-coms have distorted it.

999
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:05,580
 The Bachelor has distorted it.

1000
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:07,960
 Your parents' divorce distorted it.

1001
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:10,880
 That person who hurt you and abused you and cheated on you

1002
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,880
 made you believe that a good marriage

1003
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,320
 never was possible for you.

1004
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:18,500
 'Cause you look at your parents' marriage and you're like,

1005
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,500
 "I don't want nothing to do with that."

1006
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:23,160
 But that's not God's design for marriage.

1007
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,360
 Marriage is a gift.

1008
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:29,920
 And I, for one, I, for one, cannot wait.

1009
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:33,320
 And I pray that God would allow me to partake in that gift.

1010
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:36,080
 I'm saying, "Lord, please bring it in 2021.

1011
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:36,920
 Let me be married."

1012
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,500
 I'm just prophesying it.

1013
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:44,140
 And the statistics would say that most people in this room

1014
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:45,420
 are gonna one day be married.

1015
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:46,460
 You know that, right?

1016
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:48,780
 We are young adults now.

1017
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:49,600
 (gulps)

1018
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,220
 Like, it's time.

1019
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:54,620
 Like, it's time, all right, guys?

1020
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:57,140
 It's time to put your big-boy pants on.

1021
00:42:57,140 --> 00:43:00,140
 You're about to start providing for a woman.

1022
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:03,860
 Women, it's time to start knowing how to be the helper

1023
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:05,420
 that God called you to for a man.

1024
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:07,820
 It's time to start committing.

1025
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:10,120
 And if you're not ready to partake in this gift of marriage,

1026
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:13,720
 we always say this here, "Why are you even in the game?"

1027
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:15,860
 'Cause God wasn't here to play games.

1028
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:18,220
 He was here to design marriage for a purpose.

1029
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:21,220
 And that purpose is that that husband and wife

1030
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:22,960
 can look each other and go,

1031
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:27,960
 "Hey, this institution here is to point us to a God

1032
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,880
 that just like we are one with each other,

1033
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:34,060
 He is one with us.

1034
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:36,600
 And just like we are with each other

1035
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:40,160
 till death do us part, He is with us always."

1036
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:44,080
 That's what marriage was supposed to do.

1037
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:48,340
 And so God in His goodness said,

1038
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:49,520
 "Hey, I don't wanna leave you alone.

1039
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:52,220
 I'm gonna give you this thing called marriage."

1040
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:53,640
 And the reality is, like I said,

1041
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:56,680
 a lot of us will get to partake in that.

1042
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:57,860
 But what if we don't?

1043
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:00,860
 What if you don't get married?

1044
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:03,560
 What if God has called you to singleness?

1045
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:05,800
 He still did not leave you out to dry.

1046
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:06,980
 The second thing that He gave us,

1047
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:09,560
 the second institution that He gave us to remind us

1048
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:12,620
 that God is with us is His church.

1049
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:15,100
 His church.

1050
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:18,480
 Marriage is even supposed to point you to the church.

1051
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,920
 And in the same way, the church is supposed to point you

1052
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:24,320
 to the reminder that, "Hey, God is with you

1053
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,120
 because God's people are with you."

1054
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:28,120
 Another way for saying the church is God's people,

1055
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:31,520
 or what we say a lot here is community.

1056
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:35,060
 Living life with the people of God.

1057
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:39,320
 Those last two words are really important.

1058
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:42,200
 People of God.

1059
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:45,160
 Because I think a lot of times,

1060
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:47,900
 the reason why we are surrounded by people

1061
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:50,080
 and yet still feel so alone

1062
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:51,920
 is because they're not people of God.

1063
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:56,220
 They're people who are living for themselves.

1064
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:58,740
 And when everyone's sitting around living for themselves,

1065
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:00,460
 that means that no one is pouring into one another,

1066
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:02,460
 which means that every single person in that group

1067
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:06,260
 feels alone because they're also self-absorbed.

1068
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:09,140
 But God's people are other people focused.

1069
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:13,180
 Here's what the book of Hebrews says.

1070
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:15,360
 Hebrews 10, 24 to 25.

1071
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:18,580
 "Let us think of ways to motivate one another

1072
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:21,380
 to acts of love and good works.

1073
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:23,740
 And let us not neglect our meeting together

1074
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:27,180
 as some people do, but let's encourage one another,

1075
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:32,020
 especially now that the day of his return is drawing near."

1076
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:34,920
 That is the mission of the church,

1077
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:36,820
 that we're supposed to meet together,

1078
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:39,260
 remind each other of truth,

1079
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:42,300
 encourage one another until we see the day of Jesus

1080
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:45,820
 drawing near until he comes back and takes the church home.

1081
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:47,100
 That's our job.

1082
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:52,220
 When you see someone going, man, I just feel alone.

1083
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:54,860
 I've been praying for marriage for like three years.

1084
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:56,760
 It's true that there's no light at the end of the tunnel.

1085
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:58,260
 I can't find a job.

1086
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:01,460
 I'm miserable, I'm depressed, I'm full of anxiety.

1087
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:04,540
 It is the job of the people of God

1088
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:06,940
 to encourage one another and say, hey, hey, hey,

1089
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:10,180
 God is with you.

1090
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:11,900
 Just like God has always been with us

1091
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:14,140
 since the beginning of time, he is with you.

1092
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:16,460
 And when you cannot see past your own self,

1093
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:18,900
 it is the people of God's job to remind you

1094
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:20,740
 of who you are in Christ.

1095
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:23,040
 And it's your job to do that for other people.

1096
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:27,820
 And sure, the church can be messy.

1097
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:29,340
 Life on life, this kind of life,

1098
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:30,380
 signing up for this kind of life,

1099
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:31,820
 living this authentically

1100
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:33,140
 and doing this kind of life with people

1101
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:34,060
 is gonna get messy.

1102
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:35,620
 You know why?

1103
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:39,660
 Because it's imperfect people helping imperfect people.

1104
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:42,900
 But the beauty of that is it's imperfect people

1105
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:45,100
 helping imperfect people be reminded

1106
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:47,160
 that they serve a perfect savior.

1107
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:52,180
 And he is the one that we look to,

1108
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:54,260
 that we remind each other of.

1109
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:57,820
 And so right now, again, if I put your life on the screen,

1110
00:46:57,820 --> 00:46:58,760
 how are you doing?

1111
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:03,700
 Are you a part of the church of God?

1112
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:08,860
 Are you a member of a local church?

1113
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:11,460
 What I mean by that is have you gone through

1114
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:13,900
 a membership class and signed a covenant and said,

1115
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:17,220
 hey, I'm gonna go all in and invest with this church

1116
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:20,980
 and be the body of Christ and serve the mission of this city

1117
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:25,980
 with the body of Christ and use my gifts to help the church.

1118
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:28,100
 Have you taken that next step

1119
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:30,540
 or is church just something that you go and consume?

1120
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:31,380
 It's like a buffet.

1121
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:32,540
 You're like, I'll take the worship over here.

1122
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:33,980
 I'll take the teaching over here.

1123
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:35,340
 I'll take the aesthetic over here.

1124
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:37,100
 I'll take the Instagram story over here.

1125
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:39,580
 And is that how you view church?

1126
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:41,200
 'Cause that's not God's church.

1127
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:47,100
 I am calling you tonight to take that step deeper

1128
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:49,820
 and be a part of the church.

1129
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:53,500
 We have an amazing opportunity every Tuesday

1130
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:55,680
 at this thing called First Step up in the loft,

1131
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,340
 right up the stairs across the town center,

1132
00:47:57,340 --> 00:47:58,940
 where you get to go and sit in a circle

1133
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:01,180
 and you get to take that next step of faith of saying,

1134
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:03,320
 hey, I'm done just going to church on Easter and Christmas.

1135
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:04,540
 I'm going all in.

1136
00:48:04,540 --> 00:48:07,680
 I am serving as a member of the body of Christ.

1137
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,420
 Sign me up.

1138
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:11,980
 And you can do that tonight after this service.

1139
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:14,940
 And I would encourage you, be the church.

1140
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:17,520
 And when you become the church,

1141
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,820
 you start to live with members of the church.

1142
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:21,300
 You start to do life on life.

1143
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:22,620
 This thing that we call community.

1144
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:24,260
 How are you doing with community?

1145
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:27,180
 Do people fully know you?

1146
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:30,220
 Because you can never feel fully loved

1147
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:31,580
 until you are fully known.

1148
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:33,580
 I am convinced of that.

1149
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:36,380
 There were things in my life

1150
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:38,380
 that before I came to this church,

1151
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:41,420
 I was convinced I was taking to the grave.

1152
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:44,780
 Sins riddled with sexual immorality,

1153
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:48,260
 pride, decisions I had made in my past,

1154
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:52,100
 moments of abuse,

1155
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:57,340
 secrets, insecurities that riddled me.

1156
00:48:57,340 --> 00:48:58,260
 I didn't want people to know

1157
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:00,940
 that I thought less of myself than everyone else did.

1158
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:01,900
 I didn't want people to know

1159
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:06,000
 that I didn't think I was that manly or worthy.

1160
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:06,840
 I didn't want people to know

1161
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:08,460
 that I didn't think that women found me attractive.

1162
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:11,500
 I had all these insecurities that I never talked about.

1163
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:13,020
 I just walked around with this image going,

1164
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:14,860
 yeah, I'm just a perfect Christian guy.

1165
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:17,020
 That's what I thought it meant to follow God.

1166
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:19,500
 That's not living authentically.

1167
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:22,620
 And I came here and I started seeing people

1168
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:25,580
 actually do life on life and spend time together

1169
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:27,640
 and love each other and be fully known.

1170
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:29,020
 Therefore, they were fully loved.

1171
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:31,100
 And I sat down with one of my best friends who's here tonight

1172
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:32,860
 and I said, "Hey, I am not fully known."

1173
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:34,020
 And I let him have it.

1174
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:37,260
 And some of you guys, y'all wouldn't even know where to begin.

1175
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:42,260
 You'd be like, "Uh, so sometimes I'm afraid of the dark."

1176
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:45,900
 Like you just wouldn't even know what to like say

1177
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:48,140
 and that's okay.

1178
00:49:48,140 --> 00:49:51,500
 But what I'm telling you is it is up to the people of God

1179
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:53,300
 to remind you of the things of God.

1180
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:54,700
 And there's one thing that the enemies

1181
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,180
 and the community that's not true of God

1182
00:49:56,180 --> 00:49:58,340
 is that you cannot be fully known and fully loved.

1183
00:49:58,340 --> 00:50:00,240
 But I'm here to tell you that you can.

1184
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:03,800
 God fully knows you and fully loves you.

1185
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:09,900
 And so grab people, ladies, grab some ladies of God,

1186
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:13,020
 men, grab some men of God and take them aside and go,

1187
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:14,700
 "Man, I've never been fully known.

1188
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:16,580
 "I've never had that kind of friendship.

1189
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:19,100
 "I know how to talk sports, sure.

1190
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:21,740
 "I know how to talk about hookups, sure.

1191
00:50:21,740 --> 00:50:23,420
 "Or ladies, I know how to talk about the bachelor

1192
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:26,200
 "or that boy drama or that girl drama.

1193
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:31,080
 "But I've never actually experienced life on life like that."

1194
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:35,820
 But that's why God gave us his people.

1195
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:38,580
 That's why he gave us the church to remind us,

1196
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:41,260
 "Hey, you are never alone."

1197
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:46,560
 I'll close with this.

1198
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:51,500
 'Cause I can say all these things

1199
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:53,320
 and I can be up here on the stage and be like,

1200
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:55,980
 "Yes, I'm cool, like God is with us."

1201
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:58,620
 Believe it.

1202
00:50:58,620 --> 00:51:00,140
 Preach the gospel to yourself.

1203
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:02,780
 Read the Bible, pray more.

1204
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:06,100
 And you're like, "Man, I've tried that."

1205
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:09,660
 And I know there are some really, really dark times

1206
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:11,300
 represented in this room tonight.

1207
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:16,460
 And it can be really hard to believe,

1208
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:18,820
 maybe because of what you've done in your past,

1209
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:21,100
 what you're doing currently,

1210
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:27,540
 that God actually desires to want to be with you

1211
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:28,860
 and that you're not alone.

1212
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:34,940
 And today, when I was scrolling through my Facebook memories,

1213
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:38,860
 I was reminded of a time where I was reminded

1214
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:41,220
 that I wouldn't be alone.

1215
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:43,740
 'Cause today is February 2nd.

1216
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:48,100
 And out of all days, I was asked to teach tonight

1217
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:49,980
 and I'm scrolling through the Facebook memories

1218
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:52,020
 and I was triggered by this picture.

1219
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:57,180
 The picture of me and my dad at this event

1220
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:59,420
 called Finish Strong on February 2nd.

1221
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:02,060
 You can see it up there, February 2nd, 2015,

1222
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:04,980
 six years ago today.

1223
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:08,460
 And one of my favorite things to do up here

1224
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:11,100
 when I get the chance to speak is to talk about this man,

1225
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:13,860
 because my dad changed my life.

1226
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:15,420
 My dad reminded me of truth.

1227
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:16,460
 He was the church to me.

1228
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:18,140
 He was community to me.

1229
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:19,760
 He's one of my best friends.

1230
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:24,020
 But in college, I've told this before,

1231
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:25,780
 I got the news, "Hey, your dad's gonna die

1232
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:27,260
 in seven months of cancer."

1233
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:30,300
 And so what we did is he came to me like he always did

1234
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:31,940
 and was like, "Man, I wanna go out

1235
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:34,860
 reminding people that God is with them,

1236
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:36,180
 that they're not alone."

1237
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:38,340
 And so we planned this event,

1238
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:40,220
 Finish Strong on my college campus.

1239
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:43,540
 And in 2015, on February 2nd,

1240
00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:46,780
 2000 students came into this room that seated 900

1241
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:48,540
 and we packed inside of this room.

1242
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:51,300
 And my dad shared his story

1243
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:54,940
 of the day that the gospel intersected with his life

1244
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:56,180
 at the end of his life.

1245
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:58,540
 It intersected with his life at the age of 33.

1246
00:52:58,540 --> 00:53:01,520
 And he told this story.

1247
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:05,160
 And all of a sudden he asked people,

1248
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:07,740
 "Hey, if you want to believe and put your faith in Christ,

1249
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:08,900
 come down to the front."

1250
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:11,520
 And I just remember all these students coming down,

1251
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:12,900
 coming down, coming down.

1252
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:13,860
 We had to open up the door

1253
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:16,060
 'cause the line went out the door.

1254
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:18,740
 And so music is playing, emotions are high,

1255
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:19,960
 people are crying.

1256
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:24,780
 And I walk up on the stage just to soak it all in.

1257
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:26,140
 It was kind of like this.

1258
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:29,020
 And I just start weeping.

1259
00:53:29,020 --> 00:53:35,260
 And my dad on this day, six years ago, walks up to me.

1260
00:53:35,260 --> 00:53:38,060
 He just gave the message of his life.

1261
00:53:38,060 --> 00:53:40,380
 He put his arm around me.

1262
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:45,940
 And I'm just like, "This is amazing.

1263
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:48,220
 But why do you have to die?

1264
00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:51,480
 Why God?

1265
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:54,140
 Why does he have to die?

1266
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:55,540
 This is a good man.

1267
00:53:55,540 --> 00:53:58,600
 Why does he have to die?"

1268
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:00,900
 And my dad looked at me and was like,

1269
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:05,900
 "Hey, God is gonna use this in your life.

1270
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:08,620
 God is gonna be with you.

1271
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:10,220
 God has got you."

1272
00:54:10,220 --> 00:54:12,860
 And I'm like, "Man, I don't want God, I want my dad."

1273
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:15,920
 And he's like, "God is gonna be a father to you

1274
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:17,420
 more than I ever could be."

1275
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:19,220
 And he sat there and he tried to remind me

1276
00:54:19,220 --> 00:54:20,180
 of truth in that moment.

1277
00:54:20,180 --> 00:54:21,380
 And I didn't want to hear it.

1278
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:23,860
 And I didn't want to hear it for six months after that.

1279
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:24,900
 I went off the deep end.

1280
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:26,060
 I went to partying.

1281
00:54:26,060 --> 00:54:26,980
 I left my church.

1282
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:27,980
 I left my friend group.

1283
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:29,460
 I went drinking and I went to chase.

1284
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:30,700
 And guess what?

1285
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:33,200
 I started to do life on my own.

1286
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:36,260
 'Cause I didn't believe that God was actually with me.

1287
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:38,220
 'Cause if he was with me, then he would care about me.

1288
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:39,040
 And if he cared about me,

1289
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:40,380
 then he would have saved my dad from cancer.

1290
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:42,680
 And my dad died a few months after that night.

1291
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:46,500
 And I believed that I was alone.

1292
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:49,720
 It was miserable.

1293
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:53,580
 But I'll never forget it.

1294
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:54,820
 New Year's Eve,

1295
00:54:54,820 --> 00:54:57,620
 after I pushed everyone away from me

1296
00:54:57,620 --> 00:55:00,340
 and I literally was alone bringing in the new year,

1297
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:05,340
 I laid there and I begged God to show himself to me.

1298
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:11,660
 And I did that prayer where I said, "I'm afraid.

1299
00:55:11,660 --> 00:55:15,160
 I don't know what I'm doing, but will you be my father?

1300
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:19,660
 Will you help me see that I'm never alone?"

1301
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:22,400
 And guys, I wish I could tell you

1302
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,220
 that it has just been fun.

1303
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:26,540
 And I felt the presence of God in my life in a mighty way,

1304
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:27,620
 but that's not true.

1305
00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:31,500
 Every holiday, my mom is happily remarried.

1306
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:33,260
 She's with his family on the holidays.

1307
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:35,220
 My siblings, they're all married.

1308
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:36,300
 They're with their in-laws.

1309
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:38,180
 And I'm sometimes stuck here in Dallas.

1310
00:55:38,180 --> 00:55:40,420
 And yeah, I have luckily God's church around me

1311
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:42,340
 and people around me to remind me that I'm not alone,

1312
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:43,360
 but it doesn't help the feeling

1313
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:45,100
 that when I lay there on Christmas Eve,

1314
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:47,020
 that I sure do feel alone.

1315
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:50,260
 And I think the solution is a dad.

1316
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:53,360
 Or the solution is marriage.

1317
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:56,080
 But guys, the solution

1318
00:55:56,080 --> 00:56:02,200
 is that I choose to believe that God is with me.

1319
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:05,400
 And tonight you have a choice.

1320
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:08,760
 You can keep taking control and trying to do life

1321
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:13,520
 on your own, but you have a choice to believe the lie

1322
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:16,140
 that you'll be forever alone,

1323
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:19,520
 or that your life can radically change

1324
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:22,500
 if you would start to live like God is with you.

1325
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:24,720
 And in return, you wanna be with him.

1326
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:29,080
 And so choose that life.

1327
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:33,900
 Choose to be with the God who longs to be with you.

1328
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:37,320
 I don't know what your future holds.

1329
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:40,700
 As we talk about the future a lot in this series,

1330
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:42,820
 I don't know if you're gonna be married.

1331
00:56:42,820 --> 00:56:44,160
 I don't know if you're gonna make more friends

1332
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:45,380
 or grow your Instagram following.

1333
00:56:45,380 --> 00:56:46,780
 I don't know if you're gonna get that fixed

1334
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:48,140
 to make you convinced that you're not alone.

1335
00:56:48,140 --> 00:56:49,980
 I don't know, but one thing I do know

1336
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:54,300
 is that God will never leave you,

1337
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:57,020
 that God is with you and he is everything you need.

1338
00:56:57,020 --> 00:57:03,300
 And I just bet he is waiting for young adults

1339
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:07,060
 in Dallas, Texas to actually believe

1340
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:10,680
 and live a life that says, I am not alone.

1341
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:12,100
 God is with me.

1342
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:14,460
 And if you would live like that,

1343
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:17,220
 let's see what he will do

1344
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:19,720
 with the futures represented in this room tonight.

1345
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:21,940
 Let's pray.

1346
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:29,820
 Father, I know that there are circumstances like mine

1347
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:37,860
 where there has been death or cheating or sickness,

1348
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:44,060
 anxiety, depression, job loss, cancer.

1349
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:46,020
 There are so many things represented here tonight

1350
00:57:46,020 --> 00:57:47,980
 that have convinced your people

1351
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:51,340
 that maybe they will be forever alone.

1352
00:57:51,340 --> 00:57:55,900
 Or maybe marriage just isn't actually for them

1353
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:57,620
 and that sounds awful.

1354
00:57:57,620 --> 00:57:59,680
 Or man, why does no one pick me?

1355
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:02,060
 Why have I not been chosen for a date?

1356
00:58:02,060 --> 00:58:09,460
 And they sit and they feel so alone.

1357
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:14,580
 And God, I wish that right now I could snap my finger

1358
00:58:14,580 --> 00:58:15,760
 and everything would change

1359
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:17,740
 and that we would actually be fully convinced.

1360
00:58:17,740 --> 00:58:19,220
 And I know until we are in heaven

1361
00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:21,020
 and we are actually physically with you,

1362
00:58:21,020 --> 00:58:23,380
 we will spend our life learning what it means

1363
00:58:23,380 --> 00:58:25,580
 more and more to live like we are not alone.

1364
00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:27,820
 But until then, would you give us patience?

1365
00:58:27,820 --> 00:58:29,080
 Would you give us grace?

1366
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:31,100
 Would you give us steadfastness?

1367
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:35,540
 Would you give us endurance as we learn what it means

1368
00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:38,420
 to be sons and daughters of a father

1369
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:41,180
 who will never leave us or forsake us?

1370
00:58:41,180 --> 00:58:44,380
 Help us to remember the gospel,

1371
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:46,540
 the good news every single day,

1372
00:58:46,540 --> 00:58:49,240
 to learn more about your word and what it says for us,

1373
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:52,400
 to pray and talk to you more and open up our hands to you,

1374
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:55,720
 to spend time with God's people in God's church,

1375
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:58,180
 being God's church and living life,

1376
00:58:58,180 --> 00:59:00,900
 being fully known and fully loved by each other

1377
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:02,520
 and more importantly, by you.

1378
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:06,360
 And would you take that obedience

1379
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:08,680
 and change our futures forever with it?

1380
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:11,920
 In your name that I pray, amen.

1381
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:21,920
