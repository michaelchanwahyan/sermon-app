13
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,100
 Man, it's good to be with you guys.

14
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,220
 I was in the back in the green room,

15
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:50,620
 and Jason and Jackie and the band are piped in there,

16
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:52,140
 so I can only hear them.

17
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:56,580
 And it was interesting, because I came out this door right

18
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:59,060
 back here just a few minutes ago as we were singing that last

19
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,740
 song, "It's Who You Are."

20
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:03,820
 And all I could hear was you guys, and it was incredible.

21
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:05,100
 I wish you could have heard it.

22
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,900
 And just this tremendous choir made up

23
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,020
 of thousands of young adults praising the creator

24
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,220
 of the heavens and the earth.

25
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,220
 Man, I know life's crazy.

26
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,940
 And I'm so proud of you just for being here.

27
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:19,700
 I'm so proud of you for wanting to know God more.

28
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:22,460
 I know there's so many distractions in Dallas

29
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:26,780
 and Fort Worth and all over our cities.

30
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:29,940
 And just that you're here, I got here just a few moments ago

31
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,940
 and got the last spot.

32
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:34,620
 I waited in traffic, first of all, like many of you.

33
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:35,660
 And I was like, oh, no.

34
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:36,340
 This is not good.

35
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:37,980
 I didn't think about traffic.

36
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:41,820
 And then got the last spot in this parking lot over here.

37
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,940
 And it was just a humbling thing to walk in here

38
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:46,740
 and to watch a movement of God and to see a perspective

39
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,300
 that I don't have every week.

40
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,340
 And so thank you guys.

41
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:53,140
 I'm so proud of you for just the way that you give of yourself.

42
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:55,340
 And you're open to knowing God more.

43
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:59,500
 I'll start here with a question, where we're headed.

44
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,540
 Some are on the Mount in this series.

45
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:06,740
 What do people do when they see an explosion?

46
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:09,940
 I heard run, run.

47
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:11,580
 Yeah, like when you've seen this,

48
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,940
 you're probably like, well, I've never seen an explosion.

49
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,140
 It was that Kaboom Town thing.

50
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:18,700
 But no, whenever we see something blow up,

51
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,200
 or whenever you're watching a movie and they see something

52
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,540
 blow up, you kind of see everybody turns and runs.

53
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,360
 And then they're knocked over by the force.

54
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,740
 Or somebody yells, bomb.

55
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:27,900
 And everybody takes off.

56
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:28,400
 We see this.

57
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,500
 Any time there's an explosion, everybody

58
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,340
 runs away from that explosion.

59
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,940
 Which is why a year ago, a dear friend of mine, Cheryl Boyd,

60
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,300
 a dear partner in ministry, showed me this video

61
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,300
 that I found curious.

62
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,300
 And I actually showed it to you about a year ago.

63
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,340
 We're committed to teaching the topic

64
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:47,100
 that we're going to cover tonight at least every year.

65
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:50,100
 Because I think it's one of the single greatest

66
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,300
 needs in the room.

67
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,940
 And Jesus is covering it as he moves

68
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,260
 through the Sermon on the Mount.

69
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:56,180
 And so when people see an explosion,

70
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,600
 they run from that explosion.

71
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,300
 But when my friend showed me this video,

72
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,180
 I saw something curious.

73
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,600
 And I want you to watch this video.

74
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,220
 But I want you to pay close attention to the last thing

75
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:04,980
 the man says.

76
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,180
 When he comes back up and they're interviewing him,

77
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,140
 I want you to listen closely to what he says.

78
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:11,540
 Watch this.

79
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:14,180
 Take a look at this dramatic scene caught on video

80
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,780
 released surveillance tape.

81
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,100
 A driver pumping gas in Harrison, New York last week.

82
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,460
 And then this.

83
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:24,420
 Out of nowhere, a car flies in, crashing into the pump,

84
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:27,100
 and immediately starting a massive fire.

85
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,540
 The man at the pump, New York State Police Senior

86
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:33,060
 Investigator John Vesio, escaping the scene just

87
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,340
 in the nick of time.

88
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,900
 The impact was very sudden.

89
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:36,820
 It was very quick.

90
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:37,860
 Take a look again.

91
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:41,540
 Within two seconds, the car hits, the pump falls,

92
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:43,180
 and the fire erupts.

93
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:46,460
 I actually went to look up and see what was going on.

94
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:49,540
 And next thing I knew, the pump was coming down on top of me.

95
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,940
 Now watch as more drama unfolds.

96
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,340
 Vesio, who'd at first darted away,

97
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:58,380
 runs back after spotting the 70-year-old driver who'd

98
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:01,620
 crashed the car after suffering a diabetic shock

99
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,660
 and now could not move.

100
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,860
 He was not responsive.

101
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:10,780
 I found when I got to the car, he was pretty much helpless.

102
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:13,300
 Vesio struggles to get him out of the car,

103
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,740
 finally dragging him out by his shirt,

104
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,700
 only to return to the fiery scene

105
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,100
 to get a first aid kit from his car.

106
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,780
 And there wasn't a moment to spare.

107
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:22,420
 Take a look.

108
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:26,380
 Seconds later, a ball of fire consumes the car,

109
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:29,740
 both men miraculously out of the danger zone.

110
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,820
 I think John did a very heroic thing.

111
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:34,820
 I think he starts off as a civilian.

112
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,500
 He becomes a victim.

113
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,260
 And then his police training kicks in,

114
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:42,020
 and he actually saved somebody's life.

115
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:48,740
 He said he became a victim, and then his training kicked in.

116
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:50,940
 And one thing that it said that I disagree with

117
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:53,860
 is said both men miraculously free from the danger.

118
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,100
 It wasn't miraculously.

119
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,780
 It was due to one guy being trained in a situation

120
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:02,020
 to run toward an explosion and drag

121
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:04,260
 those who are going to be hurt by that explosion

122
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:06,500
 out of the situation.

123
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,140
 And so tonight, the topic that Jesus is going to cover

124
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,260
 is anger.

125
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:12,500
 And I'm equating anger with explosions

126
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,900
 because let me tell you something.

127
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:18,260
 Much of my life has been marked by this topic of anger

128
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,220
 in explosive ways.

129
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,900
 And I wasn't the solution to the explosions.

130
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,300
 I was the cause of these explosions.

131
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,940
 And this looked like friendships that went south.

132
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:30,740
 All of a sudden, my words would get out of control.

133
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,700
 I would escalate to an explosion,

134
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,580
 and those friendships would end.

135
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:37,900
 I mean, there are people that I no longer talk to

136
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,180
 because they won't talk to me because of the way

137
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,620
 that I treated them when I look backwards.

138
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:43,220
 I mean, people that I still to this day

139
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,580
 effort to reconcile with.

140
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,620
 True story.

141
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:48,300
 There are relationships, girls that I've

142
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:53,380
 dated that ended because of my terrible, terrible anger.

143
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:53,900
 OK?

144
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:56,900
 There were times I could think back in competitions

145
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,700
 or like playing basketball.

146
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:02,140
 And all of the sudden, blocking somebody out in the key

147
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,300
 turns to a fist fight.

148
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,500
 You're like, how did we get here?

149
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:09,260
 And it's because of this topic of anger.

150
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:14,940
 And I had no idea I wasn't trained in being the solution.

151
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:19,220
 Well, the other day, my wife and I, my wife Monica and I,

152
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:19,860
 went on a date.

153
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:22,220
 It was about three weeks ago.

154
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:25,660
 Had a sitter come, watched the kids, got in.

155
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,780
 Excited to go see a movie.

156
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:28,540
 We're in my truck.

157
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,740
 We're driving down Arapaho.

158
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:34,140
 And just going the speed limit, same lane.

159
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:38,180
 And this car turned left into a parking lot right in front

160
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:38,740
 of me.

161
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:41,020
 There's a car to my right, a car to my left.

162
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:41,900
 I have nowhere to go.

163
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:45,020
 I slam on the brakes and slowly hit them.

164
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:47,100
 We pull into the parking lot.

165
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,580
 I didn't anticipate being in a wreck that day.

166
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,820
 I'm just like, man, did this happen?

167
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,540
 Everything happens in slow motion.

168
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:54,300
 I don't know if you've been in a wreck,

169
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,340
 but your world's kind of spinning.

170
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,620
 You're like, what just happened?

171
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:59,060
 I get out of the car to talk to the young lady that

172
00:06:59,060 --> 00:06:59,620
 was driving.

173
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,500
 She's on her phone.

174
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,460
 Of course she was.

175
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:04,820
 And she's erratic, honestly.

176
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:07,820
 She's going crazy.

177
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:10,420
 And she just is like, I can't believe, oh man,

178
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,060
 I can't believe this guy.

179
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,380
 He just came out of nowhere.

180
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,140
 I'm like, well, it wasn't really nowhere.

181
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,100
 It was kind of--

182
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,940
 came from Hillcrest, you know?

183
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:21,980
 And I was like, hey, could we talk?

184
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,540
 And she's like, she's looking straight at me.

185
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,380
 And I'm like this.

186
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,780
 And she's like, I can't believe this MF.

187
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:27,980
 He just came out of nowhere.

188
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,660
 I'm like, whoa, OK.

189
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:33,620
 And so I call 911.

190
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,860
 And they're like, does she have insurance?

191
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:38,700
 I'm like, excuse me, not trying to interrupt your phone call,

192
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,660
 but do you have insurance?

193
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,940
 She's like, this is my boyfriend's car.

194
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,180
 This is my boyfriend's car.

195
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,060
 Cool.

196
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,820
 Does your-- I go 911.

197
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:50,260
 It's like, it's her boyfriend's car.

198
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:53,100
 So the 911 person goes, does her boyfriend have insurance?

199
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,620
 Does your boyfriend have insurance?

200
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:59,340
 So we kind of together go through the glove box,

201
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:01,540
 find the insurance card, get that.

202
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:03,740
 I call from the situation.

203
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,220
 She's still on the phone.

204
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,620
 And so I call the insurance company right away.

205
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,660
 I'm sitting there.

206
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:11,180
 You know, both of our vehicles pretty badly damaged.

207
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:13,820
 And I'm on the phone with the insurance company.

208
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,580
 And I'm explaining to them what happened.

209
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:18,380
 And now about 25 minutes have gone by.

210
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,940
 And the boyfriend gets there.

211
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:26,340
 Now, if she was acting crazy, he was that times 10.

212
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:30,220
 And so I knew he was there because I kept hearing MF,

213
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,900
 if you will, very loud.

214
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,540
 He's walking around the car.

215
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:36,860
 And he's like, oh, this MF, you know, I can't believe-- oh,

216
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:37,340
 man.

217
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,620
 And he kind of buries his head in his hands.

218
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,740
 And he's shaking.

219
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:43,640
 And I'm on the phone with his insurance company.

220
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,320
 And so he comes up to the window.

221
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,260
 And he goes-- like, puts his hands over his mouth.

222
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:53,140
 And he goes, get the F out of the car.

223
00:08:53,140 --> 00:09:05,660
 I'm like-- I was on the speaker, like, with his--

224
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:06,860
 it's like, did you hear that?

225
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:10,500
 I got to go.

226
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:16,620
 And so, like, here's the deal.

227
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:21,180
 For most of my life, this would have ended in one of two ways,

228
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:21,680
 right?

229
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,940
 Fight or flight.

230
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:26,540
 I would have said, man, I don't want to deal with that.

231
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:30,700
 Like, there's an explosion outside my car right now.

232
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,940
 I don't want to get burned, if you will.

233
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,020
 And so I'm going.

234
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:38,340
 Or somebody needs to teach this guy a lesson.

235
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:41,100
 And I think the Lord and sovereignty just elected me.

236
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,620
 And so it was one of those two things.

237
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,900
 And a lot of you, like, if you were sitting there,

238
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:49,260
 like, you got to think, what would you do?

239
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,940
 Because a lot of you would be like, man,

240
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,780
 I have no idea what to do.

241
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,780
 I don't know what I would do in that situation.

242
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,400
 Man, I just don't know what I would do.

243
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,100
 You know what the Bible tells us what to do in that situation?

244
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:03,220
 Took a deep breath, said a prayer, get out of the car,

245
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:06,140
 said, how you doing, bud?

246
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:08,660
 He continues with the explicatives.

247
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:11,740
 Tells me that I'm going to tell the officer that he

248
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:14,140
 was driving the vehicle.

249
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,820
 Said, I just can't do that, man.

250
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,660
 I said, in fact, before we move any further,

251
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:20,140
 I just need to tell you that your words hurt me.

252
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:22,860
 What you said in front of my wife a second ago,

253
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,340
 that wasn't cool.

254
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:27,020
 And I'd like to talk this out with you.

255
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:30,660
 And he kind of looked at me and kind of goes, I'm sorry.

256
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:34,340
 [LAUGHTER]

257
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,500
 And I said, hey, man, no problem.

258
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,860
 Let's work this out, you know?

259
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,260
 And then we did.

260
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:42,260
 And we proceeded to talk through the details.

261
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:44,900
 I kind of talked them off that cliff.

262
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,980
 I asked them both if they had a faith.

263
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:47,660
 I engaged them.

264
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:49,500
 I told them about a God that I believe in,

265
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,260
 that I can trust in.

266
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:53,780
 I told them they could trust in the same God if they knew him.

267
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:54,780
 They said that they did.

268
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,260
 I said, well, then, you know, what

269
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:58,300
 is the relationship with him if we can't trust him

270
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,820
 in situations like this?

271
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,180
 And we talked through the situation.

272
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:05,020
 But I tell you that because for most of my life,

273
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,820
 that would have turned out very poorly

274
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:09,820
 because I wasn't trained in how to handle conflict.

275
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,700
 But now, as I've understood the scriptures,

276
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,180
 it gives us some real practical advice

277
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,860
 in how to handle conflict.

278
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:18,700
 So tonight, we're talking about responding to anger.

279
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:21,300
 And you might think, well, I don't really get angry.

280
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:24,020
 I mean, that hadn't happened to me.

281
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,780
 I haven't been in a car wreck.

282
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,620
 And so I don't--

283
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,020
 tonight's going to be lost on me.

284
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,220
 I wish we were talking about something else.

285
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:33,820
 Well, let me just run through some scenarios in front of you

286
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,060
 just to make sure that's true.

287
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:38,540
 One is, I don't know if you've ever sat or called you

288
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:40,940
 need help with your cell phone.

289
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,940
 And you get the press one for this, press two for this.

290
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:48,820
 And I'm like, I just want to talk to somebody.

291
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:52,140
 And they're like, due to high call volumes right now,

292
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:55,220
 your call will be answered in the order that it was received,

293
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:59,780
 which is evidently number 6,792.

294
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:03,300
 And you sit there on hold for 42 minutes

295
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,940
 only to talk to someone who doesn't speak your language

296
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:08,180
 very well.

297
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:11,900
 And they are incompetent in the issue which you have.

298
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:14,260
 And they begin to troubleshoot with all the things

299
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:14,820
 you've already done.

300
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,140
 Yes, I've already turned it off and on.

301
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:16,980
 Yes, yes, I have.

302
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:17,980
 No, you want me to do it?

303
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,380
 OK, I've done that though, right?

304
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,740
 So I don't know if that makes you angry.

305
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:22,340
 Maybe not.

306
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:24,340
 And so I don't know if you've ever

307
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:27,540
 been at a stoplight that turns green.

308
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:30,180
 But because it takes you a total of five seconds

309
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:32,740
 to remove your hand-- your foot, rather-- from the brake

310
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:35,260
 to the gas, someone lays on the horn behind you.

311
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,220
 I don't know what is so offensive about a honk,

312
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:40,340
 but it is just offensive.

313
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:43,740
 I mean, it just infuriates me.

314
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:50,060
 Or-- this happened last week to me-- you get takeout,

315
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:55,860
 and you get home, and they forgot your burger.

316
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:56,540
 Just me, huh?

317
00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:02,620
 What traffic, man.

318
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,740
 Like, do you ever do this?

319
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,820
 You just sit in parked on a freeway,

320
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,100
 and you're like, this is so simple, people.

321
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:11,500
 Like, if we just all drive 70 miles an hour.

322
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,660
 You know?

323
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:16,820
 Like, who is the person in the front

324
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:19,620
 that decided to park their car in the middle of the freeway?

325
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,500
 Like, why would we do that?

326
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,100
 And then you drive up, and it's an elderly person.

327
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:27,460
 You're just like, somebody should take your license away.

328
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:27,980
 You know?

329
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,700
 And I don't know what that is.

330
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,900
 But I don't know how Jesus would have handled that situation,

331
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:36,340
 but I'm confident, different than I do.

332
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:36,820
 Right?

333
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:39,220
 There's just something in me that wells up.

334
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:41,780
 And so we're moving through this series, right?

335
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,460
 And we're talking about the things

336
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,940
 that Jesus addressed in the most famous sermon of all time.

337
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:48,540
 And tonight, he's going to say some crazy things about anger.

338
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,820
 In fact, some of you are just even uncomfortable

339
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:51,980
 with the things I said.

340
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:54,660
 And so what if Jesus stood up here, and he said, hey,

341
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:59,180
 if you ever get angry, you're probably going to go to hell.

342
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,620
 What if I said that?

343
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,340
 What if I came out here, and I said, hey.

344
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,460
 Hey, guys, good to be here.

345
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:03,940
 Welcome to the porch.

346
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:06,820
 Hey, if you've ever been angry, you're probably going to hell.

347
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:09,380
 Like, wouldn't you all be like, man, this dude's lost his mind.

348
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:10,180
 He's crazy.

349
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:14,100
 Tonight, Jesus is going to say that.

350
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:17,020
 That's almost verbatim what he says.

351
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:19,260
 Now, there's an interpretive challenge there

352
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,860
 that we're going to have to explain, and bring to the light,

353
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:22,940
 and understand better.

354
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:24,780
 And so that's what's before us.

355
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:28,900
 But he talks that-- he says, hey, you getting angry really,

356
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,300
 really, really matters to God.

357
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:34,020
 And so in this series, Summer on the Mount, where Jesus covers--

358
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:36,740
 if you went home, and you read the Sermon on the Mount,

359
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:39,020
 it would take you about 15 minutes

360
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:41,060
 to read it, beginning to end.

361
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:45,660
 He covers law, missions, adultery, lust, love, hate,

362
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:48,780
 judgment, marriage, divorce, enemies, the poor, prayer,

363
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:53,260
 anxiety, materialism, heaven and hell, and much more in 15

364
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,060
 minutes.

365
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,980
 And so tonight, we're just going to take this topic of anger.

366
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,820
 Matthew 5, verse 21.

367
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:05,540
 We're going to look at a change in perspective, a part to own,

368
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,860
 and a path to pursue.

369
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:08,380
 Verse 21.

370
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:13,220
 "You've heard that it was said to the people long ago,

371
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,900
 you shall not murder.

372
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:18,540
 And anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.

373
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:23,620
 But I tell you that anyone who--" uh-oh.

374
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:27,380
 Because I'm like, man, I haven't murdered anybody, so I'm good.

375
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:29,020
 But then he goes, "I tell you, anyone

376
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:31,380
 who is angry with a brother or sister

377
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,220
 will be subject to judgment.

378
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:35,740
 Again, anyone who says to a brother or sister,

379
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:39,260
 'raka,'" which just means worthless,

380
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:43,300
 which is just using your words to make someone feel

381
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:47,980
 undervalued or hurt, "is answerable to the court.

382
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:50,260
 And anyone who says you fool will be

383
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:53,180
 in danger of the fire of hell."

384
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:54,820
 Did you hear that?

385
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:58,540
 Jesus Christ on the earth said, you call someone a fool,

386
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,080
 you're going to be in danger of hell.

387
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,960
 Now, how do we reconcile that with the gospel?

388
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,580
 I mean, those are Jesus's words.

389
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:05,500
 Jesus said that.

390
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:09,220
 What is he saying there?

391
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:12,740
 Jesus is talking about a response to anger.

392
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:15,620
 He's not just talking about you even acting out on it.

393
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:17,380
 He's talking about what your thoughts are,

394
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:20,220
 you feeling the emotion, you giving into the emotion,

395
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:23,700
 you turning that emotion into words.

396
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:26,620
 And so being a Christian means restraining our response

397
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:31,700
 to anger and yielding it to God's spirit.

398
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:35,580
 And I think that many of us, we see anger as an opportunity,

399
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:39,740
 or we see conflict as an opportunity to display our anger,

400
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:43,060
 when really it's a very, very different opportunity.

401
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:46,660
 It's an opportunity to display the one we worship.

402
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,980
 Conflict is an opportunity to bring our anger

403
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,060
 under the Spirit's control.

404
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:52,900
 And so my first point is a perspective to change.

405
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:55,340
 He says it's not just acting out of anger,

406
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,620
 it's entertaining the thought of anger.

407
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:00,420
 It's driving down the road and letting that kind of wheel

408
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,300
 continue to turn, you taking a shower,

409
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,260
 the person's not even there, but you're talking to 'em

410
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:06,500
 and you're ahead and you're getting all frustrated.

411
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,780
 These are the things that Jesus is talking about.

412
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:12,580
 And he compares it to murder, which seems to be crazy.

413
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:15,660
 Like if we didn't have these words, and I just got here

414
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,920
 and I said, hey, you getting angry at traffic

415
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,960
 is the same as you taking a nine millimeter

416
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,260
 and taking someone's life.

417
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,900
 Like you guys would be like, that's crazy,

418
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,380
 but that's what Jesus says.

419
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:29,340
 And in Leviticus 27, this is Levitical law, verse 17,

420
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,900
 he says anyone who takes the life of a human being

421
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,440
 is to be put to death.

422
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,060
 Jesus is saying that if you get angry, you deserve to die.

423
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:40,020
 How could he say that?

424
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:45,180
 Why is he saying that at this section in the sermon?

425
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:47,580
 Why would he put this in front of the Pharisees

426
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,460
 and the Sadducees and his disciples?

427
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,860
 It's like he's gonna lose all credibility right up top,

428
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:54,460
 and he's telling them that their heart is messed up.

429
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:57,140
 He's saying, hey, your heart is messed up.

430
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:59,220
 Even if no one sees it, God sees it.

431
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,980
 Like some of you, you're here and you're like,

432
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:03,740
 yeah, but I don't really get angry, right?

433
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,540
 Like let me just show you a picture

434
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:10,860
 of Angry Andrew and Suzy's Sunday school here.

435
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,540
 And so there's Angry Andrew, and you're like,

436
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:15,100
 yeah, of course, of course, you know, he's angry.

437
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,140
 Like he might fight in the UFC or something.

438
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:18,820
 Like he's, yeah, he's angry.

439
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20,220
 You know, he may do something crazy.

440
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,220
 But look at her though.

441
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:23,260
 I mean, she's got it all together.

442
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:25,900
 She's carrying her Bible on her way to Sunday school.

443
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:29,060
 I mean, she loves Jesus, and her dad's a pastor,

444
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:30,980
 and everything is amazing in her world.

445
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,660
 But let me, but we can't see her thoughts.

446
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:34,620
 Like what if we could see her thoughts?

447
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,580
 Oh.

448
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:40,500
 Oh, and Jesus says, you're just as bad as he is.

449
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:44,180
 Jesus says, Suzy's Sunday school, you're the same.

450
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:48,180
 You see, none of you are off the hook.

451
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:51,020
 No one here is off the hook.

452
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,580
 You've all had those thoughts.

453
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:57,580
 You have all said you fool to someone,

454
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:00,940
 at least in your mind, to God's creation.

455
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:05,460
 And he says, you're susceptible to death, the death penalty.

456
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:14,620
 And so anger is an opportunity to respond in the flesh

457
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,820
 or to respond in the spirit, which is worship.

458
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,260
 See, some of the greatest opportunities

459
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:22,220
 for Christ followers, Christians, believers,

460
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:26,320
 to display their faith is situations of conflict.

461
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:31,740
 People tell me all the time, see, conflict

462
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,380
 is not a bad thing.

463
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,660
 That's the change in perspective

464
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,100
 that you have to have right now.

465
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,500
 Conflict is not bad.

466
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,340
 People tell me all the time, like,

467
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:41,380
 man, we have a great relationship.

468
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,620
 We don't fight, we don't have conflict.

469
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:46,260
 You don't have a relationship.

470
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,380
 That's not a real relationship.

471
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:50,300
 You're like, oh yeah, we have a great relationship.

472
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,780
 We've never even had an argument.

473
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,260
 I'm like, have y'all talked?

474
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:55,500
 You know, I mean, do you know each other?

475
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,140
 What does that mean, right?

476
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:59,180
 I mean, how can you have a relationship

477
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,460
 and not have conflict with someone?

478
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:02,780
 Because God made us, we are all now,

479
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,740
 as God put us here, and after the fall,

480
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,900
 because of our own choice, because of our own decisions,

481
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,900
 now we live in this broken world,

482
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:11,700
 and relationships are frankly marked by conflict.

483
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,620
 Healthy relationships are marked by conflict.

484
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:18,120
 Unresolved conflict marks the lives of unhealthy people.

485
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:18,960
 Let me say that again.

486
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,700
 Healthy relationships are marked by conflict,

487
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:28,460
 but unresolved conflict marks the lives of unhealthy people.

488
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,500
 Okay?

489
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,240
 Now, I'm not saying that you should stay

490
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,060
 in that relationship where you fight all the time.

491
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:37,820
 You probably should not,

492
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:40,420
 because the fact that you fight all the time

493
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:43,500
 might mean, in reality, that you haven't learned

494
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,260
 how to resolve conflict,

495
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:49,460
 but it is an opportunity to display your faith.

496
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,740
 Ephesians 4:3 says, "Make every effort,"

497
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:54,740
 your Bible might say, "Be diligent, work hard at,

498
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:56,660
 "keeping the unity of the Spirit

499
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:57,760
 "through the bond of peace."

500
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,440
 This is something that we work really, really hard at.

501
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,400
 Hard conversations are not fun,

502
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,000
 but they are not optional either.

503
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:05,820
 Let me say that again.

504
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,280
 Hard conversations are not fun,

505
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,400
 but they are not optional either.

506
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:13,920
 80% of what I do on staff at Watermark Community Church

507
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,400
 is resolve conflict.

508
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,140
 80%, you might be like, "Wow, that's really dysfunctional."

509
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:23,860
 80% of what I do is working through conflict,

510
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:28,180
 which means 100% of what I do is discipleship,

511
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,800
 because when we do this the right way,

512
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,580
 it displays who we worship,

513
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:33,220
 it displays who we belong to,

514
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,560
 it displays who we love,

515
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,520
 it displays who we're controlled by.

516
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:41,780
 And so when you feel angry, that is just a warning light.

517
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:44,260
 It's the way that you respond to that angry

518
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:46,540
 that shows who you're controlled by.

519
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:48,540
 The other day, we're driving through,

520
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:51,540
 driving in Monica's Suburban, my wife's Suburban,

521
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:52,980
 and the check engine light comes on,

522
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,660
 which is never fun, right, just 'cause I don't know.

523
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:58,680
 But when that light comes on, I have some options, right?

524
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,540
 I can ignore it.

525
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:01,420
 I can just be like, "Ah, you know,

526
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,340
 "it's probably a sensor or something,"

527
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:05,320
 and that doesn't go well.

528
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,120
 I can overreact to it.

529
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,620
 I can be like, "What, check engine light comes on?

530
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:09,660
 "Leave your car right here.

531
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:10,600
 "We're gonna go buy a new one.

532
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,440
 "Let's go, you know, we'll give this thing away,

533
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,540
 "piece of trash."

534
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,700
 No, right, right?

535
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,260
 I can overreact to it,

536
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:20,620
 or I can work really hard to find out what it is,

537
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:23,900
 which costs money and time,

538
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,460
 but it's the right thing to do.

539
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:27,940
 And so your anger is the same way.

540
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:30,540
 When you feel angry, you can ignore it.

541
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:33,140
 You can try to press it down, okay?

542
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:35,740
 You can overreact, you can explode,

543
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:37,820
 or you can put in the work

544
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,660
 to find out what's really going on.

545
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,820
 When someone feels anger towards you, right,

546
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,420
 you can overreact, you can ignore it,

547
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,660
 or you can put in the work,

548
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:45,580
 "Hey, we gotta talk.

549
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:46,860
 "Hey, come here, look at me.

550
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:47,860
 "We gotta talk.

551
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,660
 "Let's talk.

552
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,480
 "Now, I know you don't want to.

553
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,480
 "I know you're so mad at me,

554
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,180
 "but I really wanna understand why."

555
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:56,620
 And this is not natural to us.

556
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:59,300
 It is not natural to many of you in the room.

557
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,660
 That is the most scary thing that I could possibly say.

558
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:04,300
 You want me to talk to someone when I hate them?

559
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,860
 Yes.

560
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,620
 Yes, I do.

561
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:08,900
 I want you to look them in the eyes,

562
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,900
 and I want you to work really, really hard

563
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,180
 at resolving the conflict,

564
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:16,220
 because it displays the Spirit of God at work in your life.

565
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:21,560
 And so what does it look like to respond in the Spirit?

566
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,400
 Verse 23.

567
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,820
 Therefore, if you are offering your gift at the altar,

568
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:28,220
 and there, remember that your brother or sister

569
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:30,000
 has something against you,

570
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,060
 leave your gift there in front of the altar.

571
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:34,540
 First, go and be reconciled to them.

572
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:36,180
 Then, come and offer your gift.

573
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:38,980
 Did you hear what God just said to you?

574
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:41,640
 He says, "Don't come to me and seek forgiveness from me.

575
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,660
 "Don't bring a forgiveness offering to me

576
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:46,640
 "before you've sought forgiveness from them.

577
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,420
 "Don't come to me and worship me."

578
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:51,740
 He says, "I'm prioritizing.

579
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:54,440
 "I'm prioritizing horizontal relationships

580
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,180
 "over this vertical relationship.

581
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:59,160
 "And if you have broken horizontal relationships,

582
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:03,800
 "then you have a broken vertical relationship,

583
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,460
 "and you need to go and reconcile those."

584
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:09,220
 Do you know what this means?

585
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,060
 Like, you're here, and you're like,

586
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:15,060
 "Wow, Jason and Jackie Castro were singing."

587
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,980
 And God says, "Stop.

588
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:19,740
 "Stop worshiping me.

589
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:24,360
 "You need to go and be reconciled to that brother,

590
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:28,680
 "to that sister, to that mom, to that dad, to that roommate,

591
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,880
 "to that friend, to that boyfriend, girlfriend,

592
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,340
 "ex-boyfriend, ex-girlfriend, co-worker, boss.

593
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:39,340
 "Stop worshiping me, and go and be reconciled to them."

594
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,900
 This is serious.

595
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:46,440
 Like, Jesus is saying that some of you,

596
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,760
 frankly, need to leave.

597
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,740
 Like, pretend you're going to the bathroom or something,

598
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:55,420
 and go, and get on southwest.com and buy a plane ticket,

599
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:58,780
 or americanairlines.com, and you need to go home,

600
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:00,100
 and you need to sit in front of someone,

601
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,060
 and you need to make it right.

602
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:02,260
 That's what he's saying.

603
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:04,900
 He says, "Hey, you're carrying something

604
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,460
 "that I don't want you carrying.

605
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,600
 "I want you to go and make it right."

606
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:14,580
 And the second point this evening is a part to own.

607
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,540
 What is the part that you need to own?

608
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:23,140
 As simply as I can say it, yours.

609
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,900
 Own your part.

610
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,420
 You have a part in the conflict.

611
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:28,120
 If you are a part of the conflict,

612
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,700
 you have a part in the conflict.

613
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:30,540
 Let me say that again.

614
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:32,540
 If you are a part of the conflict,

615
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:34,260
 you have a part in the conflict.

616
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:36,240
 Now, be very, very, very careful,

617
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,900
 because anger does something weird to us.

618
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,700
 It makes us very blind.

619
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,860
 We cannot see our part in the conflict.

620
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:43,460
 Whenever we feel angry,

621
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:45,300
 we can only see their part in the conflict.

622
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:47,860
 This is why Jesus says, "Don't judge the speck in their eye

623
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:49,580
 "when you're walking around with a two-by-four

624
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:51,020
 "sticking out of yours," right?

625
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:52,580
 Because when you feel angry,

626
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:54,220
 you cannot see your part in the conflict.

627
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,660
 Now, I'm gonna tell you a story

628
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:58,100
 that really paints the picture of what I'm talking about.

629
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,740
 There was a young man who was marked.

630
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:03,940
 It was a friend of mine, pastored and shepherded,

631
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:06,160
 this young man, and his life was marked

632
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,360
 by anger and bitterness.

633
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,500
 And if any of you met him, you would know why,

634
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,580
 and you would get it, and you would, like,

635
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:12,920
 I understand it, and I don't even hold that against you.

636
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:15,160
 The reason his life was marked by anger and bitterness

637
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:19,920
 is because his father beat him nearly every day of his life.

638
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,080
 Okay, this is what it looked like.

639
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:24,480
 His dad would get drunk, and his dad would beat his mom.

640
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,320
 He would hide behind the stove,

641
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:30,160
 and one day, his dad found his hiding spot,

642
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:33,100
 which means he stopped beating mom and began to beat him.

643
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:35,520
 And that's what marked, that was his lot in life.

644
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:39,320
 As a four-year-old, as a five-year-old,

645
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:43,000
 as a six-year-old, as a seven-year-old,

646
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,560
 as a eight-year-old, on until he was an adult.

647
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:49,440
 Every week of his life, his father beat him.

648
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,920
 And so someone came into his life

649
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,400
 and began to share Jesus, and he said,

650
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,320
 "I get forgiveness, but there's no way

651
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,800
 "I can forgive that man."

652
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,440
 And as my friend was talking to him,

653
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,740
 my friend just said, "Well, do you have any part

654
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:01,760
 "in the conflict?"

655
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,360
 And he said, "What don't you understand?

656
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,820
 "My dad beat me nearly every day of my life."

657
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:07,800
 'Cause I get that.

658
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:12,720
 But as you look back, is there anything that you can own?

659
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,900
 Like if we're looking at 100% of the conflict,

660
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,740
 is there anything that you could own?

661
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:22,900
 And he said, "Yeah, I mean, of course I was disrespectful.

662
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,600
 "Of course I ran from him.

663
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,520
 "Of course I said terrible things.

664
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,860
 "I've hated him for over a decade."

665
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:32,020
 He said, "Well, do you think you could own that 2%?

666
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:36,660
 "Do you think you could own 100% of that 2%?"

667
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:39,480
 It sounds like your dad's at 98% fault,

668
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,600
 like this is all him.

669
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,680
 But you've got 2%.

670
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,700
 Do you think you could go to him

671
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:46,940
 and own 100% of your 2%?

672
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:48,720
 And the Spirit of God moved in that man's life,

673
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,060
 and he went to his father.

674
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,800
 He drove home.

675
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,240
 And this is father was poor in health.

676
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,220
 And he said, "Dad, I wanna ask your forgiveness

677
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:00,440
 "for the way that I've hated you.

678
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,400
 "I wanna ask your forgiveness

679
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,480
 "for the things I've said about you.

680
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,860
 "I wanna ask your forgiveness

681
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:08,060
 "for the ways that I was disrespectful to you."

682
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:09,540
 And he didn't even say,

683
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:11,220
 because what's the terrible things you did.

684
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:14,620
 He just said, "I wanna own 100% of my part."

685
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:17,420
 Which is only 2%.

686
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:19,500
 But 100% of my part.

687
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,100
 You know what the dad did?

688
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,940
 Broke down in tears, fell to his knees,

689
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:24,500
 and trusted Christ right there.

690
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:27,320
 And turned and asked his forgiveness to him.

691
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,180
 Didn't even know how,

692
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:30,340
 but just said he was sorry over and over and over

693
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:32,540
 and over and over and over.

694
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:36,900
 And that's what God is going for here.

695
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:40,780
 If you can own 100% of your 1%, your 0.5%,

696
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:43,300
 but if you are a part of the conflict,

697
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:45,860
 you have a part in the conflict.

698
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:49,500
 No one understand, no and understand your part

699
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,420
 in the conflict, right?

700
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:52,240
 Like who is it?

701
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:56,320
 Like we see the explosion, we see the heat,

702
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,820
 we see the fire and we wanna run.

703
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:00,380
 Who runs towards the fire?

704
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:05,380
 SWAT team, bomb squad, FBI.

705
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:07,940
 People who are trained to deal with it.

706
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:09,660
 When everyone else is running away,

707
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,940
 we are those crazy, crazy people that say,

708
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:13,780
 "No, we know the one true God, we're running in

709
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:15,820
 and we're gonna make this right.

710
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,820
 We're gonna disarm this situation.

711
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:20,740
 We've been trained to do so."

712
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:27,320
 And so understand if you're angry, right?

713
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:30,800
 Resist the urge to have the conversations in your head.

714
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:34,160
 Resist the urge to gossip and talk to other people.

715
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,320
 Don't assume you know why they did that

716
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,400
 or why they're doing what they did.

717
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,840
 You know when I saw that guy drive into that gas pump,

718
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,640
 I was like, "Man, this idiot drunk, right?

719
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,000
 He's drunk, that's why he did it."

720
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,360
 Like I just assumed I knew why he drove into that gas pump.

721
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:50,040
 No, no, no, he had a diabetic, he went into diabetic shock.

722
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,400
 It's a 70 year old man, right?

723
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,820
 Don't assume anything.

724
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:55,260
 You don't know what's going on in their lives.

725
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,940
 You don't know the road they walked.

726
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:58,100
 You don't know why they're angry.

727
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,580
 You don't have the full picture.

728
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:02,280
 Go and seek to understand.

729
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:08,900
 If you have something to own, the challenge is to find it.

730
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,380
 Not just to find it, but to find it quickly.

731
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:12,900
 Jesus speaks towards eagerness.

732
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:15,540
 Ephesians 4:26 says, "In your anger do not sin.

733
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:18,820
 Do not let the sun go down while you're still angry."

734
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:21,380
 Go eagerness.

735
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:23,600
 And I'm gonna give you some powerful words, you ready?

736
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:28,240
 Will you forgive me?

737
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,160
 Not I'm sorry, right?

738
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:33,760
 You could say, "Hey, I'm sorry."

739
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,720
 And they could say, "You are sorry, you're right.

740
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,760
 You're sorry.

741
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:39,120
 You're a sorry person, you're a sorry individual."

742
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,880
 You go and you say, "Will you forgive me?"

743
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,880
 These are the words Christ gave us.

744
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,760
 Will you forgive me?

745
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,840
 Not will you forgive me but.

746
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,820
 Not will you forgive me and.

747
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,760
 But will you forgive me for.

748
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:56,220
 Will you forgive me for what I've done.

749
00:30:56,220 --> 00:31:00,200
 Not will you forgive me but you did a bunch of things.

750
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:07,480
 Not will you forgive me for the ways I let you hurt me.

751
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,700
 Don't be strategic.

752
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:14,400
 Will you forgive me for and own 100% of your 2%.

753
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,300
 What does this look like?

754
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:23,760
 You know, so I left that situation with my car

755
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,340
 and thought we had it resolved.

756
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:28,320
 I explained to the boyfriend,

757
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,360
 "Hey bro, my wife and I were driving down the road

758
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:33,960
 when your girlfriend turned in front of me

759
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,340
 like in oncoming traffic."

760
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:37,720
 I mean, this is, you know, he was like,

761
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,180
 "It doesn't really matter whose fault it is."

762
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:41,800
 I was like, "It kind of matters whose fault it is.

763
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,080
 It's called the deductible."

764
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:49,080
 And so I left thinking we had the understanding

765
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:52,720
 but then they filed a claim on my insurance.

766
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,520
 I was like, "Man, that's confusing."

767
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:58,840
 And then their insurance was very difficult to work with.

768
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,240
 And then I got in a rental truck,

769
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,040
 which I'm still in today, and they called and they said,

770
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,880
 "Hey, we just wanna let you know your rental expires.

771
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,680
 We feel like it's taking you too long to fix your truck."

772
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:10,880
 And I'm like, "You know I've been emailing you every day

773
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,800
 asking you this very question

774
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,080
 and you haven't responded to me."

775
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,120
 And I'm feeling all these things

776
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,840
 and I'm hating this woman, frankly,

777
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:19,840
 and I'm so frustrated and I'm on vacation, by the way.

778
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,000
 I'm on vacation with my family and I get this car,

779
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,380
 I'm out of town and they say,

780
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:26,000
 "Hey, you need to return your rental car today.

781
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:26,840
 It expires."

782
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,000
 And I'm just like, "What?"

783
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,120
 And I feel like just crazy.

784
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,160
 Praise God for my wife.

785
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,520
 She kind of talks me off this cliff.

786
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,640
 And so I call this woman, I'm like,

787
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:38,380
 "Sandra, will you forgive me?

788
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:43,400
 Will you forgive me for being impatient with you?

789
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:46,200
 Will you forgive me for repeatedly emailing you?"

790
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,320
 I'm sure that's frustrating.

791
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,600
 I'm sure you've got a lot of things going on.

792
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,080
 And, "Will you forgive me for?"

793
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,120
 And we were able to work it out.

794
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,040
 But sometimes you're not.

795
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:58,080
 Sometimes it does not go well, okay?

796
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,600
 You have to trust God.

797
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,600
 You do not judge obedience by the outcome.

798
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,800
 You judge obedience by obedience.

799
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,520
 Do not judge obedience by what happens or how it turns out

800
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,620
 or you don't look back and say,

801
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:08,460
 "Well, that turned out well.

802
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:09,520
 I must have done the right thing."

803
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,680
 Sometimes you do the right thing

804
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,040
 and it turns out really, really bad

805
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,680
 and God makes sense of it in heaven.

806
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,720
 But you be obedient.

807
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:19,800
 Let's go, verse 25.

808
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,880
 "Settle matters quickly with your adversary

809
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,160
 who is taking you to court.

810
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,960
 Do it while you are still on the way

811
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,120
 or your adversary may hand you over to the judge

812
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,000
 and the judge may hand you over to the officer

813
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,160
 and you may be thrown into prison.

814
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,280
 Truly I tell you, you will not get out

815
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:36,160
 until you have paid the last penny."

816
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:39,560
 Okay, this is weird to me.

817
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,940
 Like Jesus is saying these things.

818
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:42,380
 He's like, "Hey, here's the deal.

819
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:45,520
 You know, if you've been angry, it's like murder.

820
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,600
 Leave your gift at the altar.

821
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,040
 Run and be reconciled to your brother.

822
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,880
 And if you're angry, you might go to hell."

823
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:53,040
 And by the way, let me give you some legal advice.

824
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,080
 And I'm just like, "What?

825
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,560
 Like, what is he doing here?"

826
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,520
 He's like, "Yeah, and by the way,

827
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,160
 if you're ever on your way to court,

828
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,080
 you know, this is how you wanna handle that conversation."

829
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,200
 What is Jesus saying here?

830
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:05,080
 He's saying to resolve conflict is costly.

831
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,460
 To not resolve conflict is more costly.

832
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:11,520
 To resolve conflict is hard and difficult

833
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,880
 and you might get burned.

834
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:15,020
 But if you do not resolve the conflict,

835
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:17,080
 you will always get burned.

836
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,880
 And when we're on the way to court,

837
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,960
 what are we thinking about, right?

838
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,600
 We're thinking about winning.

839
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,800
 We're thinking about winning.

840
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,520
 He says, "I want you to stop thinking about winning.

841
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:31,440
 And I want you to start thinking about what you can do

842
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,200
 to resolve the conflict.

843
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,960
 How you can pursue peace in the conflict."

844
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,620
 Because here's the deal, and I want you to write this down,

845
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:39,120
 tweet it out, tell everyone.

846
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:43,120
 "The person who seeks to win in conflict always loses."

847
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:49,520
 The person who seeks to win in conflict always,

848
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,200
 always loses.

849
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,640
 That person never wins.

850
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:54,600
 They may get the upper hand,

851
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,280
 you may feel good for two seconds.

852
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,280
 But then you realize you lost a friend.

853
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:03,960
 Then you realize you ruined your witness.

854
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,560
 Then you realize you did not respond according to the spirit

855
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,760
 that you said that you have.

856
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:16,480
 And so I'm calling you to be the bigger person.

857
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,200
 Jesus is calling you to be the bigger person,

858
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,680
 to seek reconciliation and not to wait on them.

859
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,400
 Not to sit there and think,

860
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,600
 "Well, if they call me, then maybe I will."

861
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,560
 No, no, you call them.

862
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,360
 You show up on their doorstep, you knock.

863
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,280
 You say, "I'm here, I wanna make this right.

864
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,960
 "I wanna work this out."

865
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,460
 My third point and final point is a path to pursue.

866
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:36,740
 And here's the path worthy of pursuit.

867
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:39,480
 Okay, and what is that path?

868
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,000
 It's the path of peace.

869
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,960
 Pursue the path of peace.

870
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:46,400
 And some of you are like, "Well, wait a minute.

871
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,160
 "Should I do this in every situation,

872
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,080
 "every time I'm angry?

873
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:52,600
 "Should I go and sit down and have the conversation?"

874
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,160
 No.

875
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:57,080
 The scripture says, "Overlook a small offense."

876
00:35:57,080 --> 00:36:00,320
 Okay, and so it's specifically Proverbs 19, verse 11.

877
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,120
 "A person's wisdom yields patience.

878
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,440
 "It is to one's glory to overlook a small offense

879
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,920
 "or to overlook an offense."

880
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,280
 And so let me ask you this.

881
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,760
 You say, "Well, how do I know

882
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,720
 "if I should overlook it or not?

883
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:10,760
 "How do I know if I should overlook it

884
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:11,960
 "or have the conversation?"

885
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,080
 It's simple, ready?

886
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,420
 If you can overlook it, you should.

887
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:18,360
 If you don't overlook it, you need to have the conversation.

888
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,200
 What does that mean?

889
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,020
 Make it more practical.

890
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:21,240
 If you're driving down the road

891
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,920
 and you're having angry conversations

892
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,240
 with them in your head, you have not overlooked it.

893
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,320
 You gotta have the conversation, okay?

894
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,760
 If you're sitting there and you continue to think about it,

895
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,600
 you haven't overlooked it.

896
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,800
 If you don't think about it anymore, you've overlooked it

897
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,640
 and you won't have to worry.

898
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:36,420
 The overlooking part kinda happens naturally.

899
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:39,120
 But if you haven't overlooked it,

900
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,240
 if you continue to think about it,

901
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,120
 you don't go to a friend and say,

902
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,620
 "Hey, I just gotta vet this situation to you."

903
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:45,680
 No, no, no, you only talk to people

904
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,120
 who are a part of the conflict,

905
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:50,080
 a part of the problem, or a part of the solution, okay?

906
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:52,240
 You don't vet to other people.

907
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,680
 You don't say, "Hey, let me just get this off my chest.

908
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,020
 "Hey, can I just tell you if I,

909
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,260
 "let me ask you if I should go to them.

910
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:58,160
 "Let me just get your advice.

911
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,920
 "Don't turn your prayer request into gossip.

912
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:04,000
 "Hey, can we just pray for David Marvin?

913
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,440
 "I mean, he just, you know,

914
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,920
 "he really did some terrible things to me

915
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:11,680
 "and I just think we should pray for him."

916
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,160
 So, that's gossip.

917
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,760
 Okay, some of you are praying for David.

918
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,600
 I appreciate that.

919
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,840
 (laughing)

920
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,360
 He appreciates it too.

921
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,120
 Listen, that's gossip.

922
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,920
 You only talk to people who are a part of the problem

923
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:27,540
 or a part of the solution and you wanna know what's best?

924
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:28,880
 Do it at the same time if you can.

925
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:29,820
 Bring 'em all together.

926
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:30,760
 Guys, can I tell you something?

927
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,500
 'Cause I can see you out there right now.

928
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,660
 Like, I'm up here and I'm looking at you.

929
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:35,020
 I see you in Fort Worth too.

930
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:37,740
 You're looking at me like I'm crazy.

931
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:41,900
 Like, this is what the scripture calls you to do.

932
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:44,100
 I'm serious.

933
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:46,300
 I have seen this process change lives.

934
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:49,420
 I have gone to Africa to train their government

935
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:51,460
 in the very things that I'm talking to you.

936
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:53,220
 I've seen this change nations.

937
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:54,300
 True story.

938
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:56,320
 We went to Rwanda after the genocide

939
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,760
 and talked about these very things.

940
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,980
 Guys, I'm not kidding.

941
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:02,280
 Christ is not kidding.

942
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,460
 You know the number one determiner in success in a marriage

943
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:07,320
 is the ability to resolve conflict?

944
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:11,500
 The number one determiner of success in a marriage

945
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,440
 is the ability to resolve conflict.

946
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,940
 This will make you a better employee, employer,

947
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:19,780
 friend, roommate, son, daughter, brother, sister, uncle,

948
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:23,380
 anything, if you can do this, like it's discipleship.

949
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:25,740
 If you can learn this and you can teach it to others,

950
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:28,620
 you sit down in a small group and you teach them this,

951
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:30,760
 it is worthy of your time.

952
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,780
 This will truly change your lives.

953
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:33,620
 I'm not kidding.

954
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:35,400
 You do this relentlessly.

955
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:38,500
 You hold onto it fast.

956
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,820
 Don't let anything change this.

957
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:43,860
 If you can overlook a small offense,

958
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:46,860
 overlook it if you can't, then have the conversation.

959
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:48,620
 And be wise in the way you act toward outsiders.

960
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:50,920
 Some of you are like, well, do I do this with nonbelievers?

961
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:54,640
 Sure, just don't expect them to respond well.

962
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:55,600
 They're pagans.

963
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,640
 It's their job description.

964
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:58,480
 They shouldn't respond well.

965
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,300
 They should yell at you.

966
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:00,560
 They should call you MF.

967
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,240
 I mean, they should swing at you.

968
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,160
 That's what they should do.

969
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:05,800
 They're controlled by some other spirit.

970
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:10,720
 So share the gospel and walk this process out of obedience.

971
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,760
 And it may respond really, really poorly.

972
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:16,440
 Be wise in the way you act toward outsiders,

973
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,560
 the scripture says.

974
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:23,240
 Conflict is an opportunity to show whose you are.

975
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:26,420
 I love the way that Jesus gives the Sermon on the Mount

976
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:29,000
 because he gives the application right up front.

977
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,640
 He says in the Beatitudes, right?

978
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:32,480
 And so check this out.

979
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,300
 I wanna show you something.

980
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,240
 Matthew 5, verse nine.

981
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,080
 He says this.

982
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:35,900
 This is in the same sermon.

983
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:38,200
 He says, "Blessed are the peacemakers,

984
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,480
 "for they will be called children of God."

985
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:44,400
 Do you see that the goal is just not,

986
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,880
 the goal is not to get angry.

987
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,620
 The goal is not not to get angry.

988
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:49,660
 Sorry, double negatives.

989
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:51,000
 Always throws me off.

990
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,060
 The goal is that you would be a peacemaker.

991
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:56,280
 That you would make peace.

992
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,800
 That you would be able to resolve these situations.

993
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,400
 And he says that's who is children of God.

994
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,040
 Those people are children of God.

995
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,320
 Like I have, I'm tall.

996
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,300
 I'm six foot, seven inches tall, okay?

997
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:08,080
 I have a son, he's two and a half years old.

998
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,800
 But because he's my son, at two and a half,

999
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,840
 he's about six feet tall.

1000
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,480
 I mean, he's really, really tall, you know?

1001
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,320
 And he's just kinda, yeah, he's just tall.

1002
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,000
 He looks like me, he's crazy tall.

1003
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,560
 He looks like he's six years old.

1004
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,420
 And why?

1005
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:21,000
 Because he has my DNA, he has my genes.

1006
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,720
 Jesus is saying, if you're God's children,

1007
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,660
 you look like God, right?

1008
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:28,720
 When my children act terrible, like we're in public

1009
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,840
 and they're like just acting crazy,

1010
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:33,220
 I'm always like, whose kids are these?

1011
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:35,040
 Like somebody needs to make this right, right?

1012
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,760
 But here's the, I know why they act that way.

1013
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:39,200
 I see my daughter's anger sometimes

1014
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,040
 and I know where she gets it from.

1015
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:41,860
 'Cause she's my child.

1016
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:43,560
 But you're a child of God.

1017
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:46,360
 And so you look like a child of God

1018
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,020
 in the way you resolve conflict.

1019
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:50,460
 That's what Jesus is saying here.

1020
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:51,820
 Blessed are the peacemakers,

1021
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:55,060
 for they will be called God's children.

1022
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:56,940
 And God's children make peace.

1023
00:40:56,940 --> 00:41:01,280
 And be cautious of people who are entertained by conflict.

1024
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:04,540
 Like I had a buddy that would always just kinda be like,

1025
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:06,540
 ooh, he said what, did you hear what he said?

1026
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:08,940
 And like always kinda turning people against each other.

1027
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:10,700
 You know, he didn't know Christ.

1028
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:11,860
 And so of course he's gonna do that.

1029
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:13,120
 But be cautious about those people.

1030
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:15,400
 I wouldn't hang out with those people if I were you.

1031
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,780
 I mean, hang out with them to share the gospel,

1032
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:18,500
 but not for any other reason.

1033
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:19,940
 Some of you are those people.

1034
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:22,100
 Proceed with caution.

1035
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:26,060
 Go back and read the words of Christ here in Matthew 5.

1036
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:27,060
 Okay?

1037
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:27,900
 Be careful.

1038
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:30,680
 And peace is powerful.

1039
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:34,420
 Let me just talk to the men for a second before we wrap up.

1040
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:40,500
 Men, any boy can turn his anger to throwing fists.

1041
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:43,340
 I've got a two and a half year old

1042
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:45,340
 and when he gets upset he pushes people.

1043
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:47,780
 Any child can do that.

1044
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:53,720
 But it takes a man to bring your emotions,

1045
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:56,400
 your childish emotions,

1046
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,600
 under the control of the Spirit of God

1047
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,240
 and respond in peace.

1048
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,320
 That takes a grown man.

1049
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:08,540
 And ladies, you grow up in a culture

1050
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:12,880
 where it's cool to be sassy and feisty

1051
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:13,880
 and have attitude.

1052
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:16,740
 It's not cool in God's kingdom.

1053
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:19,040
 It might be cool in Dallas,

1054
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,560
 it might be cool in Fort Worth,

1055
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:23,160
 it's not cool in God's kingdom.

1056
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:23,980
 Okay?

1057
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:26,080
 That does not show that you're a child

1058
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:28,480
 of the Creator of the heavens and the earth.

1059
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,560
 Okay?

1060
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:31,020
 And so Jesus says,

1061
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:36,680
 "Whenever you're angry, it's like murder.

1062
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:39,760
 "And murder requires the payment of a life."

1063
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,040
 Now we don't resolve this

1064
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:44,360
 in this little snippet of the sermon,

1065
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,480
 but we know the bigger picture

1066
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,920
 is that Jesus gave his life.

1067
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:50,760
 Jesus gave his life for your anger.

1068
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,560
 Jesus gave his life so that you can be

1069
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:53,800
 reconciled to the Father.

1070
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:57,080
 Jesus gave his life so that you don't have to be angry.

1071
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,660
 And so in summary, a new perspective

1072
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:00,840
 is to see conflict as an opportunity

1073
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:03,640
 to show who you belong to.

1074
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:06,360
 And this starts with you owning your part.

1075
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,860
 Be eager to own your part

1076
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:10,400
 and to overlook a small offense if you can.

1077
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,780
 And the path that you are to pursue

1078
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:14,360
 is the path of peace.

1079
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:17,400
 And I've seen incredible peace be brought about

1080
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,480
 when people do this.

1081
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,560
 I've seen roommates reconciled.

1082
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:24,440
 I've seen wives who have been cheated on by their husbands

1083
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,680
 reconcile with the mistress.

1084
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:30,640
 I've seen crazy things happen when people live this out.

1085
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:31,560
 Things that the world says,

1086
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:33,440
 "Who is your God?

1087
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,640
 "How do you do this?"

1088
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:38,920
 But after I gave this sermon,

1089
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:40,120
 the first time someone came up,

1090
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:41,580
 "What about righteous anger?

1091
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:44,800
 "Isn't there a time we're supposed to get angry?"

1092
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,240
 Anger is an emotion, right?

1093
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:48,820
 Anger is a natural emotion.

1094
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:50,560
 It's what you do with that anger

1095
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,160
 and how you target that anger

1096
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:55,320
 and what is the end result of what you do with that anger

1097
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,560
 that God cares about.

1098
00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:00,720
 I think the thing that makes us the most angry,

1099
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,080
 if I was to put one word on it, it's injustice.

1100
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:06,320
 Like any time we feel like we've been treated unfairly

1101
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:09,260
 or we've been slighted or taken advantage of,

1102
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:15,060
 I had a truck and it had been in a hail storm,

1103
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:16,740
 so it had all these hail dents on it

1104
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:18,820
 and I bought it like that 'cause I like deals

1105
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:20,220
 and it was a deal.

1106
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:22,940
 And so also because I like deals, I go on Craigslist

1107
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:26,780
 and I find this painless dent repair company.

1108
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:28,740
 And so these guys come over to my house

1109
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:31,500
 to fix these hail dents in my truck.

1110
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:34,420
 And they're there, it's four brothers.

1111
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:36,180
 And they're like, they're real kind, honestly.

1112
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:38,100
 Like they were super nice and shook my hand

1113
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:38,980
 and we got to know each other

1114
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:40,780
 and we were talking and I got to share the gospel.

1115
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:41,700
 Like hey, do you have a faith?

1116
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:44,420
 And he asked me a lot of good questions.

1117
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:45,780
 I mean, he was like, what about dinosaurs

1118
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:46,620
 and where are they in the Bible?

1119
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:48,020
 And I was like, well, let's talk about that.

1120
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:49,900
 Some of you are like, what about dinosaurs?

1121
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:53,220
 And so, we'll be up here, love to talk to you.

1122
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:56,060
 And so we were talking through like his,

1123
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:57,180
 as he wrestled with faith

1124
00:44:57,180 --> 00:45:00,140
 and he put this red stuff on all the dents

1125
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:02,920
 and they worked on my truck for a couple hours

1126
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:05,580
 and he came in and he was like, oh, Mr. Picluda, listen man,

1127
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:06,500
 I have great news.

1128
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:08,020
 You know, your truck was repaired

1129
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:09,460
 and everything looks great

1130
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:11,780
 and we're gonna paint the bumper tomorrow

1131
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:13,060
 and so we'll be back in the morning.

1132
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:14,580
 And he's like, hey, what time will you be here?

1133
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:16,460
 You know, will you be here at 9 a.m.?

1134
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:17,980
 That's, we really like to get started early.

1135
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:18,820
 I'm like, sure.

1136
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:20,420
 And he goes, I'd like for you to pay, you know,

1137
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:23,300
 for the dents today, but you can pay for the bumper tomorrow

1138
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:25,620
 and so, and I'm like, oh, okay, that's, you know,

1139
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:26,460
 totally understand.

1140
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:28,380
 So we go to the ATM together.

1141
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:30,780
 I give him 800 bucks for the,

1142
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:32,260
 to remove the dents over all my truck

1143
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:36,060
 and which is just a ton of money, by the way, to me.

1144
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:39,460
 And they leave and so the next day comes around,

1145
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:42,300
 9 a.m. comes and I'm excited about getting my bumper painted

1146
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:44,060
 and then 10 a.m. comes and 11 a.m.

1147
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:46,420
 so I call him and I'm like, hello, you know,

1148
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:47,500
 hey, this is Jonathan, you know,

1149
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:49,460
 you're gonna come and fix my bumper

1150
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:50,780
 and I hear a dial tone.

1151
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:53,260
 I go, oh, that's weird.

1152
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:54,180
 Maybe he actually hung up.

1153
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:55,020
 Call him again.

1154
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:57,660
 Hey, you're gonna come back and fix my bumper.

1155
00:45:57,660 --> 00:45:58,940
 And no one answers.

1156
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:01,460
 I leave message, leave another message,

1157
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:02,500
 leave another message.

1158
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:05,420
 Call three days later, someone answered.

1159
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:07,180
 Hey, it's Jonathan, hang up again.

1160
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:08,420
 I'm like, uh-oh.

1161
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:11,140
 Well, I still have this red stuff on my truck, right,

1162
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:13,500
 over all the dents that they fixed.

1163
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:16,380
 And so I go get my truck washed to remove the red stuff

1164
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:17,660
 to see how they had fixed the dents.

1165
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:19,660
 They didn't fix the dents.

1166
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:20,860
 They didn't do anything.

1167
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:23,500
 They just stole 800 bucks from me.

1168
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:26,780
 And man, I was so angry.

1169
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:29,940
 I'm a believer, I'm a follower of Jesus Christ,

1170
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:34,680
 but I was so mad because they were good, frankly.

1171
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:37,740
 I mean, they had took advantage of me, okay.

1172
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:39,020
 We got to know each other.

1173
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:40,420
 I trusted these men.

1174
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:41,660
 I cared for them.

1175
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:43,460
 I prayed for them.

1176
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:45,020
 And now I'm in this situation where I know

1177
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:47,580
 they deliberately stole from me.

1178
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:50,940
 And so I, they're just like, my mind runs towards revenge.

1179
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:52,700
 I'm like, I'm thinking about how I'm gonna call

1180
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:54,220
 from another person's phone and hey,

1181
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:55,860
 I've got dents in my car and I'm gonna meet up

1182
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:58,940
 with my boys in a tire iron and we're about to do work.

1183
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:00,860
 Like this, and I'm not even kidding.

1184
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:02,840
 Like honestly, I'm embarrassed to tell you

1185
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:03,900
 those were the thoughts going.

1186
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:06,900
 I'm thinking, how can I get even?

1187
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:09,580
 Like I'm smart enough to get even with these guys.

1188
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:11,900
 I got a buddy that can find them.

1189
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:14,260
 I've got their phone number, like I'll have their address.

1190
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:16,020
 Like I can get to these guys.

1191
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:18,100
 I can get back, I can get my $800.

1192
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:20,140
 And all of this stuff was happening in my heart

1193
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:21,600
 and I wasn't even fully aware of it.

1194
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:23,660
 And then a guy in my community goes, man, how you doing?

1195
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:25,860
 I go, what do you mean, how am I doing?

1196
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:27,140
 I'm angry.

1197
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:30,520
 She goes, can we read Matthew five?

1198
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:33,280
 No!

1199
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:36,920
 (congregation laughing)

1200
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:41,120
 And he goes, Jonathan, he goes, why are you angry?

1201
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:45,800
 And I said, because they took $800 from me.

1202
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:46,640
 This was a real cost.

1203
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:49,200
 I said, you don't understand, this was a real cost to me.

1204
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:56,360
 The next day, I go and we had deposited a check

1205
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:58,760
 and so I go on my checking account

1206
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:02,000
 and there's an additional $800 there.

1207
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:08,000
 And my buddy who I told this to and he saw my anger,

1208
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,960
 he just went and he paid me 800 bucks.

1209
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:15,160
 And I call him, I said, why would you do that?

1210
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:16,960
 I said, don't, that's crazy.

1211
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:17,800
 So why would you do that?

1212
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:20,320
 He goes, bro, it's not worth your anger.

1213
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:22,800
 It's not worth you compromising your relationship with Christ

1214
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:23,940
 because those guys took advantage of you.

1215
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:26,020
 They don't know God, of course they did.

1216
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:27,520
 That's what they should do.

1217
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:33,280
 He goes, but it's worth, I would pay $8,000

1218
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,360
 so that you don't have to be angry.

1219
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:36,640
 And that's what Christ is saying.

1220
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,320
 He said, I'll give my life

1221
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:41,560
 so that you don't have to be angry.

1222
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:42,960
 He said, people are gonna hurt you.

1223
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:44,740
 Don't trust people, trust God.

1224
00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:47,080
 People are gonna hurt you.

1225
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:48,040
 You know you're gonna leave here.

1226
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:49,560
 People are gonna hurt, they're gonna outright

1227
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:50,600
 take advantage of you.

1228
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:53,180
 You don't have to lay over, right?

1229
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:56,440
 But you respond appropriately in the Spirit.

1230
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:58,480
 Okay, if you don't know how to do that

1231
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,400
 in this situation, you widen the circle

1232
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:01,720
 and you bring others in.

1233
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:03,520
 You talk to people who are part of the solution

1234
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,200
 and a part of the problem.

1235
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,520
 And you pursue the path of peace.

1236
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:08,880
 Let me pray that you would.

1237
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:15,640
 And Father, you tell us in Romans 12, verse 18

1238
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:18,400
 that if it is possible,

1239
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:22,860
 as far as it depends on us to live at peace with everyone.

1240
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:26,880
 Lord, we're wrestling because our hearts are wicked

1241
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:27,920
 right now, we're wrestling with it.

1242
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:30,000
 Wait a minute, when do we do, do we always do that?

1243
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,800
 When is it appropriate to lash out?

1244
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:36,860
 When is it appropriate to respond to that hurt?

1245
00:49:36,860 --> 00:49:39,600
 And so Father, I pray that you would help us

1246
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:43,720
 to understand what your Spirit desires in these situations.

1247
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:46,000
 God, for some of us tonight as we sit here,

1248
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,640
 the tape is playing of others who have hurt us

1249
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:50,800
 or others we've hurt, and I pray that we would leave

1250
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,720
 our gift at the altar and we would run

1251
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,920
 and be reconciled to our brother and sister.

1252
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:58,200
 Father, I thank you for your word

1253
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:00,400
 and how it never returns void,

1254
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,180
 how it stirs our affections for you,

1255
00:50:02,180 --> 00:50:04,440
 it gives us a glimpse into your character

1256
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:07,200
 and how you love us, that you would give your life

1257
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:13,040
 so that we're not angry, so that we can be with you forever

1258
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:14,640
 in a place of peace.

1259
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:17,840
 In Christ's name, amen.
