1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:22,200
 - We're live, everybody, welcome.

3
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,400
 (audience cheering)

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,500
 It's hard to tell in here, normally the lights come up.

5
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,340
 This is fun.

6
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,080
 Guys, if we haven't met yet, my name is Josh Timms

7
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,080
 and I get to be a part of leading the porch

8
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,960
 over in Fort Worth, shout out to Fort Worth.

9
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,540
 And similar, just actually not similar,

10
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:36,880
 exactly the same as you heard,

11
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,000
 here in Dallas they are reopening.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,600
 We are also reopening next week in Fort Worth.

13
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,560
 So we would love to have you join us.

14
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,160
 And so here's where I'd like to start this evening.

15
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,940
 Who in here likes the, like New Year's resolutions?

16
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,880
 Anyone in here do New Year's resolutions?

17
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,640
 Few of you guys and some friends joining me, okay.

18
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,880
 I love them, I think they're great.

19
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,480
 It makes me feel like I'm moving the needle, you know.

20
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,760
 I feel, there's times where I've felt good about them

21
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,880
 even if I haven't done them,

22
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,360
 but I love New Year's resolutions.

23
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,080
 And there was a year that I decided

24
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,640
 for my New Year's resolution, I am quitting sugar

25
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,080
 or at least all things sweet, okay.

26
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,320
 I'm cutting sugar out, it's gonna be amazing.

27
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,720
 I'm gonna be fit, it'll be awesome.

28
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:17,760
 And there was one, there was like one singular thing

29
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,880
 that I was like, this is going,

30
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,680
 if anything's gonna take me out,

31
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,000
 there's gonna be one thing that robs me

32
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,220
 of fulfilling my year commitment to a year without sugar,

33
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,480
 and it was donuts.

34
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,720
 And to be really specific,

35
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,220
 it was the original Krispy Kreme donuts, okay.

36
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,060
 You feel me?

37
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,040
 Yes, because without, beyond a shadow of a doubt,

38
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,200
 it is the best donut out there.

39
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,880
 And so I knew that to be the case.

40
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,380
 And so friends, I pulled it off.

41
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,160
 I mean, largely, there's a Gatorade here too.

42
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,440
 I forgot that I drank a little sugar,

43
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:48,160
 but for the, largely I spent an entire year without sugar.

44
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,840
 But during the year I thought about donuts

45
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,800
 and I was like, man, it'll be awesome.

46
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,040
 And finally the day came.

47
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,320
 It had been a year, I fulfilled my commitment.

48
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,180
 It is time, we all know what's happened.

49
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,600
 I'm getting some donuts.

50
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,440
 So I'm excited about it.

51
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,940
 I drive up to Krispy Kreme.

52
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:01,780
 It's amazing.

53
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,040
 It feels like I can smell it from miles away.

54
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:03,940
 If you guys have ever been there,

55
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:06,280
 when it like rolls right off the like belt

56
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,620
 and it like melts in your mouth,

57
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:08,460
 and I'm excited about this.

58
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:11,580
 And I get there and my girlfriend now,

59
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,180
 girlfriend at the time, wife now had said,

60
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,220
 you know what, you should just have one,

61
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,340
 you know, just one donut.

62
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,180
 Get there, I'm like, yes, I will have a whole box.

63
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,180
 I'll take 12 of them.

64
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,300
 And then I was like, yeah, I'll just take 12 of them

65
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,860
 and then just leave them at home.

66
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,300
 And I'll just have one now.

67
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,480
 And then for the next 11 days,

68
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,980
 and I wholeheartedly did not follow that advice either.

69
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:32,980
 And I ate all 12 delicious donuts in one setting.

70
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,060
 And it was amazing.

71
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,580
 It really was, it was incredible.

72
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:39,280
 I loved it in the moment, absolutely amazing.

73
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,740
 And then there was something interesting that happened.

74
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:41,980
 I didn't see this coming.

75
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:44,380
 We're like, man, it's like my stomach

76
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,940
 started to like not feel good.

77
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,460
 And then I went from like not feeling good

78
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:51,380
 to where I spent most of the rest of my day

79
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,120
 on the porcelain crown of my home.

80
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,460
 Like that's just where I was, friends.

81
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,300
 It messed me up.

82
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,620
 There was things happening inside of me

83
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,660
 that I didn't know could happen inside of me.

84
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:01,620
 And all because what I had done is I had taken this desire

85
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:02,940
 and turned it into this like, man,

86
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:07,360
 fully indulging on everything that I wanted.

87
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,420
 And the reason I start this tonight

88
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:11,940
 is because we are going to talk about two sins

89
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,180
 the Bible identifies as deadly,

90
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:16,540
 and that is laziness and gluttony.

91
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:17,580
 Laziness and gluttony.

92
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,700
 And I just wrote some definitions down

93
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,140
 so we can have an understanding.

94
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,900
 We're all talking the same language.

95
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:27,620
 And gluttony is just this, it's excessive consumption.

96
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,040
 It's excessive consumption.

97
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,580
 We often think of it in relation to food,

98
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:32,900
 but it's not limited to that.

99
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:37,340
 And then laziness is really the avoidance of effort

100
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,580
 or responsibility.

101
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,340
 And at the core, they really are both

102
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,500
 like seeking to gratify self.

103
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,140
 And so for our purposes this evening,

104
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:49,060
 I'm going to put them under one umbrella of self-indulgence.

105
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,460
 And self-indulgence, I just wrote this down.

106
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,300
 You can do it as well.

107
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:56,980
 Self-indulgence is excessive or unrestrained gratification

108
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:59,420
 of one's own appetites.

109
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:05,460
 And friends, I want you to listen closely this evening,

110
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,620
 and it's incredibly important because genuinely,

111
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:12,620
 I believe that everything that you want in life

112
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:16,580
 rises and falls on your ability

113
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:19,420
 to master your self-indulgence.

114
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:23,620
 Like your future career depends on whether or not

115
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,060
 you're able to master your self-indulgence.

116
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:29,020
 Your future marriages depend on whether or not

117
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:31,380
 you can master your self-indulgence.

118
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,340
 And if I'm just really honest,

119
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,420
 especially in the United States of America,

120
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:38,100
 I believe that self-indulgence is responsible

121
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,660
 for sending more people to hell than any other sin.

122
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:43,120
 It's incredibly important.

123
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,620
 And it's something that every single one of us deals with.

124
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,380
 There's not a single person listening

125
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:52,500
 here in the room tonight that doesn't deal

126
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,500
 with the desire to self-indulge.

127
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,340
 And so tonight we're gonna talk through three things.

128
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:00,740
 We're gonna talk through the presence of self-indulgence,

129
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:03,540
 the problem of self-indulgence,

130
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,920
 and the path to true satisfaction.

131
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,500
 Before we jump in tonight, I would just like

132
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,140
 to take a moment, I'm gonna pray for us before we jump in,

133
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:12,020
 and just would invite you to pray for me

134
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,320
 as we open God's word and see what he has to say.

135
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,560
 Father, thank you for the opportunity to open your word,

136
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,320
 to sit underneath your truth,

137
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:25,320
 to understand what you have to tell us about how to live,

138
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,000
 and that life to the full is found in you.

139
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,040
 And Father, I pray that tonight

140
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,040
 for every person listening, Father,

141
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,920
 that you would do an amazing, incredible work in their life,

142
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,360
 that you would give us all humility

143
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,300
 to sit underneath the truth of your word,

144
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,120
 that we might be changed to look more like you.

145
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,760
 And Father, I just ask and pray selfishly for myself

146
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,160
 that, man, you would be with my words

147
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,600
 that anything that I would say that is not in line with you,

148
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,160
 that it would be forgotten.

149
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,720
 And Father, may we come, may we end our evening

150
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,760
 just being more in love and more excited about you.

151
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,040
 You know, I pray, amen.

152
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,720
 Okay, friends, for the first point

153
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,320
 where we're gonna jump in first this evening

154
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,200
 is in the text, Philippians chapter three.

155
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,080
 And so before we get to Philippians chapter three,

156
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,640
 just to pull our first point out,

157
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,720
 I'm gonna set up a little bit of context here.

158
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,680
 Paul is writing to the church in Philippi, okay?

159
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,000
 He's writing to church in Philippi,

160
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,480
 and here in chapter three, what he's doing

161
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,720
 is he's calling out false teachers.

162
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,640
 He's calling out false teachers

163
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,660
 that have been placing these like expectations

164
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:25,360
 on other believers that were not in line with God's word,

165
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,440
 and he's exposing their false doctrine.

166
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,280
 And so that's where we're at,

167
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,560
 Philippians chapter three, verses 17 through 19.

168
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,800
 If you've got your Bibles, open them up and follow along.

169
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,000
 Paul says this, "Dear brothers and sisters,

170
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,920
 "pattern your lives after mine

171
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,460
 "and learn from those who follow our example.

172
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,060
 "For I have told you often before,

173
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:47,480
 "and I say it again with tears in my eyes,

174
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,980
 "that there are many whose conduct shows

175
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:54,440
 "that they are really enemies of the cross of Christ.

176
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,320
 "They are headed for destruction.

177
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,980
 "Their God is their appetite.

178
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,600
 "They brag about shameful things

179
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:05,600
 "and they think only about this life here on earth."

180
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,520
 So the first thing we're gonna talk through this evening

181
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,360
 is the presence of self-indulgence,

182
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,040
 the presence of self-indulgency.

183
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:16,080
 I think that laziness,

184
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,480
 we believe that laziness and gluttony

185
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,120
 should be really easy to recognize.

186
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,480
 Like in our minds, it's kind of like,

187
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,300
 hey, you know, laziness and gluttony,

188
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,980
 that's like the guy who doesn't have a job

189
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:26,600
 and he still lives in like mom and dad's basement, you know?

190
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:30,000
 And gluttony, that's the person who like lays on the couch

191
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,780
 and eat potato chips all day long.

192
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,600
 So really, we just kind of shrink it down,

193
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,240
 you know, to overeating really.

194
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,160
 And we shrink it down to overeating and being overweight.

195
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,560
 And I think what happens when we do that,

196
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,040
 when we shrink those things down

197
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,560
 to just being overweight or overeating,

198
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,000
 I think that it's easy for us to go, oh, that's not me.

199
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,940
 That's not, like, that isn't, like laziness and gluttony,

200
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:54,280
 that's like for other people, but that's not really me.

201
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,280
 And here's the thing,

202
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,960
 self-indulgence is incredibly more subtle than that.

203
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,920
 It's incredibly more subtle.

204
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:05,820
 Like gluttony doesn't always look like being 400 pounds.

205
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,440
 Like here's what gluttony could look like.

206
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,160
 It could look like you're in the gym every single day

207
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,760
 so that on the weekends,

208
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:16,400
 you can drink as much beer as you want and not get fat.

209
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,560
 I actually remember that conversation when I was college.

210
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,080
 It could also look like this.

211
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,520
 Laziness could look like this.

212
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,960
 You know, we've all been here.

213
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,840
 Maybe you guys haven't been here,

214
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,280
 but I'm here a lot 'cause I own a truck.

215
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,280
 You got that one friend who's moving, you know?

216
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,680
 So they call you up, you got the truck,

217
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,560
 and you get a text from them,

218
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,680
 and you know what that text is about.

219
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,680
 And so you leave that text unread

220
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:37,800
 so that you can truthfully tell them like,

221
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,720
 "Hey, I'm so sorry after you've moved in.

222
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,480
 "I hadn't read my text yet."

223
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,320
 Okay?

224
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,560
 It hides itself in our lives,

225
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,960
 which is what makes it so deadly.

226
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,880
 It's because it isn't always easy

227
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,000
 for us to recognize in our lives.

228
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,240
 In fact, if I'm really honest,

229
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,640
 it shows up in a place inside of my heart

230
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,440
 where what I want to do is I want to work really hard.

231
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,960
 Like I wanna like hit the grind really hard

232
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,960
 so at 35 I can retire

233
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,160
 and then spend the rest of my life

234
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,040
 like in swim trunks on the beach.

235
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:10,880
 You know?

236
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,280
 And so it doesn't look like it.

237
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,400
 You're like, "Oh, that is not really,

238
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,280
 "is it discipline?"

239
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,480
 No, I'm telling you, like I want to work hard

240
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,920
 so that later on in life

241
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,960
 that I can just essentially do whatever I want

242
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,160
 whenever I want.

243
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,960
 And if we're honest,

244
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:28,560
 none of us actually think that we're self-indulgent.

245
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,600
 And the reason we don't think it

246
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,360
 is because we justify our actions.

247
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,440
 Maybe you can relate to this.

248
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,960
 Like, "Yeah, man, I've just had a hard day at work.

249
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,200
 "So like I deserve this glass of wine."

250
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:44,840
 Or maybe, "Man, I don't need to work hard at my job

251
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,680
 "because if I'm honest,

252
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,720
 "I'm just not really passionate about it."

253
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:52,040
 Or, "Man, I just had a really tough conversation, you know,

254
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:55,440
 "and so I need me just a little retail therapy."

255
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,640
 Or for here, I'll just welcome you into my life this week.

256
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,600
 "Come Saturday, and I just had a long week at work,

257
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,820
 "and there was a part of me that's like,

258
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,360
 "Man, this has been a stressful week.

259
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,160
 "And so I feel like it's okay for me to sleep in till 10

260
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,520
 "and neglect responsibilities that I have."

261
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:14,080
 That's inside all of us.

262
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,720
 See, none of us think that we're self-indulgent

263
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,920
 because it is hidden inside of us.

264
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,400
 But yet Paul is saying here in Philippians

265
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,340
 that our actions reveal our hearts.

266
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:28,160
 Paul tells us that our actions,

267
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,800
 really, they expose our self-indulgence.

268
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,960
 I mean, I'll read it to you again.

269
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,160
 He says, "For I have told you often before,"

270
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:36,000
 and I say it again with tears in my eyes,

271
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,120
 "that there are many whose conduct shows

272
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,700
 "they are really enemies of the cross of Christ.

273
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,640
 "They are headed for destruction.

274
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,400
 "Their God is their appetite.

275
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,700
 "They brag about shameful things,

276
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:52,120
 "and they think only about this life here on earth."

277
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:55,780
 Self-indulgence is present in your life

278
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:59,500
 when your appetite is your God.

279
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,340
 What do I mean by that?

280
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,680
 What do I mean by your appetite?

281
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,520
 What I mean by appetite is just your desires

282
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,940
 and your cravings, okay?

283
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,680
 Not just a appetite for food or drink,

284
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,400
 but like your desires and your cravings.

285
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,240
 And then what does it mean?

286
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,920
 What do I mean when making your appetite your God?

287
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,580
 It just means God, making something a God in your life

288
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:18,600
 means your whole life revolves and centers around it.

289
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,920
 Okay, so to make your appetite your God

290
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:24,360
 just means that your life revolves around satisfying

291
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,920
 your desires and your cravings.

292
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:32,780
 Plainly, what it means is that our life revolves around us.

293
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,500
 And if we see here in the text,

294
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,520
 man, Paul says some things that just hit home here for me.

295
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:41,380
 They sound really harsh,

296
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,420
 but I think he's trying to wake,

297
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,980
 he's trying to like shake us out of like,

298
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:46,180
 "No, no, this isn't just something that's outside

299
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,680
 "or just for those people over there,

300
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,260
 "but it's inside of all of our hearts,

301
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,960
 "this desire to self-indulge."

302
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,600
 And he says some three things that I think are really crazy.

303
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,160
 He says, "Man, if that's you, if that's me,

304
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:01,420
 "your life is headed for destruction.

305
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,620
 "You're gonna have a life that is marked

306
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:05,220
 "by shameless selfishness,

307
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:08,360
 "and it will not matter in eternity."

308
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:14,960
 Friends, our appetites were never meant to be our God.

309
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:21,160
 God is meant to be God.

310
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,440
 And here's what's crazy.

311
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,160
 And you guys, we all know this,

312
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,000
 we all understand this,

313
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,140
 that appetites don't shrink when you feed them,

314
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,880
 they grow.

315
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,700
 Like the more that you consume,

316
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,280
 the more that you want to consume.

317
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,560
 And so what makes them such a terrible God in our lives

318
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:40,040
 is that one, they're never satisfied,

319
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,700
 and then they're always changing.

320
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:46,520
 God is meant to be God in our lives.

321
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:50,920
 And so, man, I wanna like care for you,

322
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:51,980
 but there's some of you in the room,

323
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,720
 I can't help but feel like maybe hearing this

324
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,000
 and just invalidating me like,

325
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,080
 "Man, hold on, Josh, like, look, yes,

326
00:12:59,080 --> 00:12:59,960
 "I'll like have a drink or two,

327
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,360
 "but like, I don't need those things.

328
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,980
 "Like, I don't need a drink.

329
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:07,200
 "I don't need the food, the chocolate bar.

330
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,000
 "I don't need to play video games."

331
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,440
 Great, prove it.

332
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,440
 Like, don't do that for a week.

333
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,040
 I'm not saying that because those things are bad,

334
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:21,080
 but because there's often self-indulgences

335
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,760
 hiding inside of our hearts,

336
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:28,680
 and our conduct shows and reveals that inside of us.

337
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:32,080
 And so, man, those things in our life that we crave,

338
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,360
 that we desire, I'm not saying your desires,

339
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,500
 your cravings are bad,

340
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,720
 or that you can't fulfill them and satisfy them in moments.

341
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,760
 What I am saying is that

342
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,980
 they may not be as innocent as you think.

343
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:45,200
 And you may be feeding your self-indulgence.

344
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,040
 And so, just to recap,

345
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:52,040
 self-indulgence is often more present than we believe.

346
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,340
 And so now, with an understanding

347
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:58,020
 of just how present self-indulgence is in our hearts,

348
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:00,900
 let's see if we can understand the danger.

349
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,220
 So if all of us are dealing with it,

350
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:05,180
 what is the problem, why is it so bad?

351
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,260
 And why is it so dangerous?

352
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:10,560
 And we're gonna be in James 1, just two verses, 14 and 16.

353
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,640
 And just to set this up, James readers at this point,

354
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,500
 he's writing this letter to these people

355
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,980
 who are suffering persecution at the time.

356
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,400
 And they're living in poverty,

357
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,900
 and a lot of them were living,

358
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:23,720
 they were believers living just like really worldly,

359
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,780
 completely apart from what God had to say.

360
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:29,680
 And James is correcting them and challenging them

361
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,120
 to turn back to God.

362
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,740
 And here's what he says, it's James 1, verses 14 and 16.

363
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:39,380
 He says, "Temptation comes from our own desires,

364
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:42,340
 which entice us and drag us away.

365
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:45,020
 These desires give birth to sinful actions.

366
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:50,020
 And when sin is allowed to grow, it gives birth to death.

367
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:55,540
 So don't be misled, my dear brothers and sisters."

368
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:58,700
 My second point tonight,

369
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,700
 the second thing I'm gonna talk through this evening

370
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:05,700
 is the problem, the problem of self-indulgence.

371
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:08,300
 And it starts, here's where the problem is.

372
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:11,220
 It all starts with the desire.

373
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:14,780
 Self-indulgence begins at its very core,

374
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:17,780
 just a desire in our hearts.

375
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:20,140
 And here's the thing, every single one of us

376
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:25,140
 desires to be full, to be content, and to be happy.

377
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:27,440
 So what that means is you and I,

378
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,620
 we pursue things that make us that promise.

379
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,660
 Like anything that promises that it's going to fulfill

380
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:34,180
 those desires, we pursue those things,

381
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:37,500
 which means that we often self-indulge.

382
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,160
 It just means that when we feel these desires,

383
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,620
 which if you're anything like me,

384
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:46,180
 any desire that you have, you feel really strongly.

385
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:49,800
 And so we believe that self-indulgence

386
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:53,060
 is going to be the thing that appeases

387
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:55,080
 that desire or that craving.

388
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:00,220
 We self-indulge because doing whatever feels good

389
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,860
 in the moment is what we want.

390
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,900
 And the problem James explains here

391
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:08,900
 is that we are believing a lie or at least a half-truth.

392
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:13,360
 And if you go back and I'm gonna reread those verses to you

393
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,920
 because James in this moment uses

394
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,600
 a really jarring illustration,

395
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:22,700
 explaining just how this sin in our heart

396
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:25,020
 that hides itself in here and how we all deal with it,

397
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,820
 he uses a really jarring illustration

398
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:31,420
 to show us just how painful and dangerous it is.

399
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:32,260
 I'm gonna read this again.

400
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:36,820
 It says, "Temptation comes from our own desires,

401
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:39,760
 "which entice us and drag us away.

402
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,300
 "These desires give birth," or in your version,

403
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:45,800
 I might say, "conceive sinful actions.

404
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:50,740
 "And when sin is allowed to grow, it gives birth to death.

405
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:55,980
 "So don't be misled, my dear brothers and sisters."

406
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,880
 The illustration is one of a stillborn.

407
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:01,340
 And it's really sobering.

408
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:04,260
 I've had friends who have been pregnant

409
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:06,180
 and then had a miscarriage.

410
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:09,180
 And here's what's so jarring about it

411
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,820
 is that when someone is pregnant,

412
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:11,760
 you're like, "Man, there's life in there.

413
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,020
 "This is exciting."

414
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:15,780
 I recently, two months ago, my wife and I had our first kid.

415
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:16,620
 I mean, it's exciting.

416
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,340
 There's amazement.

417
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:21,380
 There's anticipation and you can't wait.

418
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:28,160
 And then you go from, "There's life in there.

419
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,260
 "There's life found there.

420
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:32,580
 "There's life in there," to like, "Life is not there."

421
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:35,980
 Leads to pain and sadness.

422
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,300
 And what James is trying to do

423
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,380
 is that he's trying to tell you and I

424
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,700
 that we often are going to think,

425
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:44,240
 "There's life found in indulging in what I want.

426
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,460
 "There's life found in satisfying my desires."

427
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,340
 But he's going, "Don't do that.

428
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:50,180
 "Don't believe that.

429
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,540
 "There's not life there.

430
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,460
 "And if you believe there's life there,

431
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:58,460
 "it is only going to lead to pain and sadness in your life."

432
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:03,620
 Self-indulgence works exactly the same way.

433
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:08,180
 You think there's life there, but in the end, there isn't.

434
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:11,660
 And so often, at least for me,

435
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,380
 I remember when I first started reading the Bible,

436
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,200
 it's easy for me, like,

437
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,640
 "Man, he's saying that sin leads to death,

438
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,060
 "but like, man, I just slept with my girlfriend.

439
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,820
 "I didn't fall over dead.

440
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:24,060
 "And so I don't know if I can trust the Bible."

441
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:27,700
 Let me do as best as I can, walk you through what I mean

442
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,620
 and what James is saying when he says

443
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:31,380
 that sin leads to death.

444
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:34,020
 You see, when self-indulgence becomes a habit,

445
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:36,620
 it consumes all of your time and energy,

446
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:38,100
 meaning all of your time and energy

447
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:41,620
 becomes focused around you just getting what you want.

448
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,360
 And what happens with that is it gives you

449
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:48,780
 or you begin to have a decline in your motivation

450
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,860
 and in your health.

451
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:54,420
 And so a lack of time and energy in a job

452
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:57,820
 often leads to a death of a job.

453
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:01,460
 Proverbs 10 says this, Proverbs 10, 11 and 12,

454
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,900
 "A little extra sleep, a little more slumber,

455
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,920
 "a little folding of the hands to rest,

456
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,420
 "then poverty will pounce on you like a bandit

457
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:12,020
 "and scarcity will attack you like an armed robber."

458
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:15,780
 A lack of time and energy for relationships

459
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:19,220
 can lead to the death of a friendship.

460
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:21,420
 A self-consumed friend is a really bad friend.

461
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:22,700
 A self-consumed friend is not a friend

462
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,340
 that stays a friend very long.

463
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:26,680
 And friends, if you and I continue,

464
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:29,260
 if we continue just to indulge,

465
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:31,820
 if we continue just to satisfy our own desires in the moment,

466
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:35,380
 do what we want, when we want in the moment,

467
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:38,220
 it really does lead in practical ways,

468
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:42,700
 death in our life here on earth,

469
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:47,700
 and then really in a much bigger and much more serious way,

470
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:53,100
 it can lead to death spiritually and for eternity.

471
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,660
 How?

472
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:56,500
 I'll explain.

473
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:00,380
 When you and I believe that life is centered around me

474
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:03,140
 getting what I want, what we are saying

475
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:07,060
 and what we are believing is that I'm God of my life.

476
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:09,660
 God isn't God of my life, I'm God of my life.

477
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:11,780
 And if you have taken over the throne

478
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,660
 where only God is supposed to stand,

479
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:16,340
 that means there is a, you and God are not reconciled,

480
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:19,840
 which means when the end of your physical life comes,

481
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:24,120
 it means eternal, eternally you'll be separated from him.

482
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:32,060
 Friends, I want to implore you, James is imploring you,

483
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:35,160
 do not be misled.

484
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,780
 There's not life there.

485
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:41,620
 And we're not alone, I do this.

486
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:45,140
 Like it is so easy for me to go like just in the moment,

487
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:48,420
 the easiest thing for me to do is whatever I want to do.

488
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:51,980
 And I just have to be reminded

489
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:55,260
 that ultimately there's not life there.

490
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:58,980
 Laziness and gluttony always over promise

491
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,020
 and under deliver.

492
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:07,220
 And so if self-indulgence equals making our appetite our God

493
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:11,320
 and if we self-indulge because we buy the lie

494
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,820
 that it will satisfy,

495
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:17,420
 a life marked by self-indulgence is going to lead to death.

496
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:21,380
 And so my next point for this evening is just,

497
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:25,700
 we're gonna walk through the path to real satisfaction.

498
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,780
 We're gonna walk through the path to real satisfaction.

499
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,900
 And just to go back to the problem of self-indulgence,

500
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,100
 if you're a note taker is this,

501
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:34,040
 it makes a promise that it can't deliver.

502
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,900
 The problem of self-indulgence is that it makes a promise

503
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,460
 that it can't deliver.

504
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,100
 And so we're gonna be in Matthew chapter five

505
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:43,620
 and this is the beginning of Jesus' most famous sermon.

506
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:44,580
 It's called the Sermon on the Mount.

507
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,380
 And he begins with the Beatitudes

508
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:50,200
 and he says something incredibly radical,

509
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:53,260
 incredibly radical because how are we to do this?

510
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,340
 'Cause if you're anything like me,

511
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:56,540
 I'm a little bit like, man, I've got like strong desires

512
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:58,980
 and I don't know how I can move

513
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:01,900
 from not choosing to do what I want, when I want.

514
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,180
 How is it that I make it there?

515
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:05,500
 And Jesus just says it really plainly.

516
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,260
 Matthew five, chapter six, he said,

517
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:12,260
 "Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness,

518
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:18,520
 "for they will be satisfied."

519
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,620
 He makes us a promise.

520
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:23,100
 You see the promise of self-indulgence

521
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:23,940
 that it doesn't deliver on

522
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:24,900
 is that you're going to be satisfied.

523
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:27,580
 And even though you may in a moment feel satisfied,

524
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,580
 in the end, it doesn't deliver.

525
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:33,300
 Jesus says, "Those who hunger and thirst for righteousness

526
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,500
 "shall be satisfied."

527
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:39,740
 And so our path, the beginning of a path

528
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:42,420
 towards satisfaction is to hunger and thirst

529
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:44,480
 for what alone satisfies.

530
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,540
 And here's where I want you guys to understand something.

531
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:53,500
 Your desires, your cravings, the fact that you want more,

532
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,340
 the fact that you want happiness,

533
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:58,220
 that there's something so real inside of all of us

534
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:00,380
 was given to you by God.

535
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,220
 Like he didn't give that to you

536
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,620
 as like some sort of a sick joke.

537
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:04,180
 If man, I'm gonna give you these desires

538
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:06,220
 and you guys figure out how to handle them.

539
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:08,620
 No, he gave them to you on purpose.

540
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:11,260
 He gave them to you on purpose

541
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:14,740
 because what he wants is for you to pursue them to the end

542
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:18,440
 with something that will truly satisfy,

543
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,980
 which is him and him alone.

544
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:24,500
 The desires that God gave you are not bad.

545
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,980
 In fact, they are God given.

546
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:31,380
 And then what he wants for you is to pursue them

547
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:35,000
 and to drive you to what ultimately will satisfy you.

548
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,660
 There's a author that I love a lot.

549
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,820
 His name is C.S. Lewis

550
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:43,380
 and he has one of my favorite quotes ever.

551
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,180
 One of my favorite quotes ever on this topic.

552
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:46,140
 And I think it's so insightful.

553
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,340
 He's a man that loved the Lord

554
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:50,220
 and he really understood humanity and our brokenness.

555
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,200
 And he says this,

556
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:57,060
 it would seem that our Lord finds our desires

557
00:23:57,060 --> 00:24:00,820
 not too strong, but too weak.

558
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,660
 I'm gonna say that again.

559
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:05,580
 It would seem that our Lord finds our desires

560
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,780
 not too strong, but too weak.

561
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:11,380
 I don't know if you're like me at all.

562
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:13,060
 I remember before I was a believer,

563
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:15,420
 I just thought like, man, there's just something,

564
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,740
 I just crave more than other people.

565
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,120
 Like this whole like Jesus thing is great,

566
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,940
 but like I just need more.

567
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,980
 And what C.S. Lewis is saying, no, no, no,

568
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:25,340
 you don't need more, you are settling for less.

569
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:27,660
 He defines our desires not too strong, but too weak.

570
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:30,780
 He says, we are half-hearted creatures.

571
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:34,900
 Fooling about with drink and sex and ambition

572
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:39,220
 when infinite joy is offered us.

573
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:44,940
 We are half-hearted creatures,

574
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:47,620
 like an ignorant child who wants to go on making mud pies

575
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:51,620
 in a slum because he cannot imagine what is meant

576
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:55,080
 by the offer of a holiday at the sea.

577
00:24:55,080 --> 00:25:00,400
 We are far too easily pleased.

578
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,960
 He's saying, don't settle friends.

579
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:07,080
 That desire God gave you is a good one, cultivate it,

580
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,960
 grow it, let it drive you to the thing

581
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,600
 that ultimately satisfies.

582
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,880
 And so the answer on how to overcome laziness

583
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,240
 and gluttony and self-indulgence in our lives

584
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,680
 is not simply just to grit it out,

585
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:21,240
 not simply, he's not God's like, hey, just like be strong,

586
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,680
 pull up your bootstraps, you're gonna make it,

587
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,560
 it's gonna be all right.

588
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:26,640
 No, in fact, it is to pursue wholeheartedly

589
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,080
 what alone will satisfy you.

590
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:32,920
 And Jesus says it, he says, hunger and thirst

591
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:37,120
 for righteousness, because if you do, you'll be satisfied.

592
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,200
 Desire and pursue righteousness.

593
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,740
 And what's really cool, what I love about his language there

594
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,600
 is that just the terms hunger and thirst

595
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,040
 implies that it's very natural,

596
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,440
 implies that our cravings and the fact

597
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,520
 that we want something more,

598
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,920
 the fact that we want fulfillment

599
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,940
 is something God gave us, it's a natural thing.

600
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:57,980
 And also what he means when he says righteousness here

601
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:00,600
 is he just means a personal faithfulness and loyalty to God.

602
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:04,560
 He says, pursue personal faithfulness and loyalty to God,

603
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:08,100
 pursue God and you will be satisfied.

604
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:12,560
 And so the path to long-term victory over sin

605
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:15,520
 is to gain a superior satisfaction in God.

606
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,760
 The path to long-term victory over sin

607
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,760
 is to gain a superior satisfaction in God.

608
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,240
 And so I just wanna give us some practical steps this evening

609
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,080
 on what to do.

610
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,920
 How do I grow a hunger and thirst for righteousness

611
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,800
 or a superior satisfaction in God

612
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,100
 and the first one is this,

613
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:35,700
 you need to believe that God alone can satisfy.

614
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:38,980
 Like we're never going to move the needle,

615
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:43,420
 we are never going to be able to quit our desires

616
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:48,340
 or our self-indulging hearts and ways

617
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:52,620
 if we do not believe that God alone can satisfy.

618
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:53,460
 Here's what I want you to know,

619
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:55,020
 I just wanna be so real with you.

620
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,580
 That belief, if you get there,

621
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:59,600
 that belief is going to be constantly challenged.

622
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,960
 There is never going to be a day that you wake up

623
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,960
 where that belief isn't challenged

624
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,200
 because there are going to be things that are in your face

625
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:09,120
 that like you know will bring you satisfaction like this.

626
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,520
 That belief is going to be constantly challenged

627
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,720
 and so you need the truth of God's word,

628
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,480
 you need to know what God's word has to say

629
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,420
 and then you need his people around you to remind you

630
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:22,640
 that God alone can satisfy you.

631
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,840
 So the first way to grow a hunger and thirst for righteousness

632
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,740
 is to believe that God alone can satisfy.

633
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:31,040
 And the second way is this, is to discipline yourself.

634
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:34,240
 Discipline yourself to grow a taste for righteousness

635
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,420
 and a distaste for self-indulgence.

636
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:39,700
 And I've just simply,

637
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,260
 there's lots of ways you could explain discipline.

638
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,140
 I just said it this way,

639
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:47,140
 discipline is consistently making the choice

640
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:49,220
 to do what is best.

641
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:52,060
 Not just what you want in the moment,

642
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:54,300
 but discipline is consistently making the choice

643
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,180
 to do what is best.

644
00:27:56,180 --> 00:28:01,180
 It is a daily moment by moment choice.

645
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:04,900
 Friends, be aware of your choices.

646
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:07,660
 If you really want to desire and pursue something

647
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:08,760
 that's going to satisfy you,

648
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:11,160
 you need to be aware of your choices.

649
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,660
 You need to discipline yourself in your choices.

650
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:15,460
 I've had someone explain it to me like this

651
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:17,020
 and this is really helpful.

652
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:20,580
 Said discipline begets desire.

653
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:22,340
 Meaning it starts with just like,

654
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:23,800
 getting out of, I'm doing this thing

655
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,980
 because I know it's good for me.

656
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:27,540
 And that moves to this place of like, man, I like desire.

657
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,700
 Like I want to do this.

658
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:31,780
 And then desire moves to a place of delight

659
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:34,260
 where you're going, I find life here.

660
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:36,900
 Not moving away from just like, man, I'm doing this

661
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:37,820
 'cause I know it's good for me.

662
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:38,980
 It's like, I think I'm starting to enjoy this.

663
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:43,020
 Like this is what life is about.

664
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:45,220
 Discipline begets desire.

665
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:46,740
 Desire begets light.

666
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:48,140
 And here's the thing, and we all know this.

667
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:51,100
 And I just want to be so honest with all of you

668
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:53,640
 is that discipline does not feel good in the moment.

669
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,400
 It doesn't.

670
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,640
 Like discipline never feels good in the moment.

671
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:00,800
 If you're like me, I'll put it this way.

672
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,640
 I like to work out.

673
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,200
 It's a thing that I do really into CrossFit,

674
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,740
 you know, boo, yay, whatever.

675
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:08,480
 Heart of my joints, whatever.

676
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,680
 Every single workout for me starts like this.

677
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,140
 I don't want to.

678
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:14,980
 I mean, I'm serious.

679
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:15,800
 Like every single workout starts like that.

680
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,320
 Like I just like don't want to.

681
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,960
 And every single one of it ends like this.

682
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,500
 I'm so glad I did.

683
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:29,140
 And friends, discipline isn't going to feel good.

684
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:32,140
 And Jesus also is incredibly honest about this.

685
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:33,380
 He speaks directly into it.

686
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:37,260
 Luke chapter 9, 23 to 25, Jesus says this.

687
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:39,980
 "If anyone would come after me,

688
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:43,100
 "let him deny himself and take up his cross daily

689
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,260
 "and follow me.

690
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:47,440
 "For whoever would save his life will lose it,

691
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,640
 "but whoever loses his life for my sake

692
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,620
 "will save it.

693
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:52,040
 "For what does it profit a man

694
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,440
 "if he would gain the whole world

695
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:57,300
 "and loses or forfeits himself?"

696
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,420
 He's really honest.

697
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:02,620
 He says, "Following me equals denying yourself."

698
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:05,200
 But the promise he makes is wild.

699
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,880
 He says, "If you deny yourself in this life for his sake,

700
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,300
 "you will save your life for eternity."

701
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:14,540
 And I want you to know, friends,

702
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:16,140
 we, you and I, in and of ourselves,

703
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,940
 are unable to deny ourselves.

704
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:18,820
 Like it's impossible.

705
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:21,820
 But what's amazing is that when we trust in Christ

706
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:25,500
 and what he has done on a cross for us,

707
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:28,460
 that he actually gives us the strength and the power

708
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:31,020
 to like, to turn away from the things that we want,

709
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,580
 to turn away from the immediate gratification

710
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,820
 and satisfaction and to pursue wholeheartedly

711
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:36,740
 what's going to satisfy us.

712
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:40,460
 And so just to finish the point,

713
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:43,560
 like the path, the path to change,

714
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:48,560
 self-indulgence is in believing a different promise.

715
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,120
 For happiness.

716
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,920
 It's believing a different promise,

717
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:56,880
 believing the one person and one thing

718
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,320
 that can come good on that promise.

719
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,140
 And it's Jesus.

720
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:05,140
 And he says, "Hunger and thirst for righteousness."

721
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:08,640
 And here's what I want to close this evening.

722
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:12,720
 I just want to welcome you into my life

723
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,180
 and what this journey of self-indulgence,

724
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:19,460
 of sin has looked like for me.

725
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:22,880
 And so at 17, when people are graduating high school,

726
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,060
 I was leaving home.

727
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:27,720
 I was leaving home to pursue a career in riding bulls.

728
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,460
 I know that's really crazy.

729
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:33,080
 And, but I was doing that because I had found out

730
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:36,360
 that I was like, I had, there was a guy,

731
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,480
 friend of mine that said,

732
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,880
 "Hey, there's some guy who rides a buck in bulls.

733
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,220
 "You can go get on.

734
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:41,820
 "You can go pay $30 and get on."

735
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:42,940
 And I was like, "Man, I'm gonna try that out."

736
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:45,100
 And then as it turns out, I was good at it.

737
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:48,520
 And like, I was really good at it.

738
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:52,080
 So at 17, I left home to go pursue this dream.

739
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,580
 And here's what it did for me.

740
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:59,880
 I lived exactly how I wanted to every single day.

741
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:02,160
 I was making a lot of money.

742
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,080
 I was free to live.

743
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,160
 And I didn't have a coach.

744
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,320
 I wasn't tied to anything.

745
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,000
 I literally lived out of a minivan.

746
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,560
 I rode bulls in almost every single state.

747
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,600
 It allowed me experiences.

748
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:16,580
 I crave and desire and long for experiences.

749
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:17,820
 I got that in spades.

750
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:19,160
 Wherever I wanted to go, I could go.

751
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,860
 I was free.

752
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:25,860
 Relationships with women in different cities

753
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,360
 every single weekend.

754
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:31,960
 Fame, people knew my name.

755
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:35,500
 Like I did it.

756
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,340
 Like I got it.

757
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:37,260
 Like everything that I was pursuing,

758
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:39,620
 all those cravings that I wanted,

759
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:42,060
 God in his kindness allowed me to find that.

760
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,800
 And here's what I found.

761
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:51,480
 It was incredibly and devastatingly empty.

762
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:56,540
 In the middle of like when I was at my peak,

763
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:58,440
 when I was like everything is going well,

764
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,120
 I couldn't be any better.

765
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,600
 Like more people know my name.

766
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,880
 I have more money than I ever have.

767
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,680
 I'm dating someone who's beautiful.

768
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:09,260
 I had never felt so empty.

769
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:12,980
 Because the truth is, friends,

770
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:16,800
 you and I were never meant to be God in our lives.

771
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,680
 God is meant to be God.

772
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:22,840
 And if you don't know him,

773
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:26,640
 and if you don't know what it's like to be fully satisfied,

774
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,560
 I can tell you now on the other side of this,

775
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,800
 on the other side of pursuing all of my fleshly desires

776
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,980
 and finding it and making it,

777
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:40,220
 that the only time that I've truly felt satisfied

778
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:41,560
 is when I sit in a relationship

779
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,960
 with the one who created me and made me.

780
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,620
 And I want that same thing for you.

781
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:52,880
 But man, there's a hidden little thing in our hearts

782
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,480
 that hides itself that we're gonna justify.

783
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,200
 It's a sin of self-indulgence,

784
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,280
 and it will rob you

785
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:02,960
 if you just hold on to the satisfaction it brings.

786
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,480
 And instead of running to the true satisfaction

787
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,040
 that's only found in Jesus.

788
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:06,880
 We pray for us.

789
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:11,480
 Father, I confess in my own life

790
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:15,780
 that even though I know these truths,

791
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:20,680
 that even though I know and understand and believe

792
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,440
 that you alone can satisfy,

793
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:28,640
 that I turn to myself,

794
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:31,880
 that I frankly want to be God of my own life.

795
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:34,120
 And I pray for every single one of my friends

796
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:38,900
 that they would understand that there is more to be found

797
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:43,420
 there's more life, life to the full you say found in you.

798
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:47,880
 So would you give us the strength?

799
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,200
 Would you give us the courage?

800
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,920
 Would you give us the ability to deny ourselves,

801
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,520
 to let go of the things that we think

802
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,380
 are going to satisfy us and hold on to you,

803
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:57,800
 the only one who will satisfy.

804
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:03,160
 Father, forgive me, forgive us

805
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:07,440
 for the ways we turn from you.

806
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,140
 And we look to satisfy ourselves with our own desires.

807
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:12,840
 And may you grow in our hearts,

808
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:17,340
 a superior satisfaction in you and you alone.

809
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:18,180
 Thank you for this evening.

810
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,000
 Thank you for your word.

811
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,560
 Thank you for the fact that I can run to your word

812
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,560
 and be reminded of your truth.

813
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,120
 And father, I just ask if there's anyone out there

814
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,760
 that doesn't yet know you.

815
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,200
 If there's anyone out there that is still sitting

816
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,960
 in the desires of thinking

817
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,600
 that they're going to find satisfaction

818
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,520
 and just the emptiness,

819
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:37,560
 they're sitting there empty alone, wondering what happened,

820
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:40,000
 wondering how they got to this feeling of emptiness,

821
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,220
 this feeling of loneliness,

822
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:42,840
 because they pursued all the things they wanted to.

823
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,560
 Father, would you just step into their life tonight

824
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:51,560
 and show them that you love them,

825
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:54,240
 that they need you,

826
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:58,140
 and that life to its full is found in you.

827
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:01,080
 We love you a lot, so we pray, amen.

828
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:11,080
