1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (gentle music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:17,620
 - All right, hello, friends in the room.

3
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:19,580
 Hello, friends of Fort Worth and in Houston

4
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:23,740
 and those tuning in around the country and the state.

5
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:24,620
 I'm gonna start with a question.

6
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:29,100
 Have you ever received bad advice about something?

7
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:30,940
 (laughs)

8
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:33,180
 Yeah, a lot of people have.

9
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:37,360
 I received bad advice related to wedding invitations.

10
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:43,820
 And since we're talking about adulting in this series,

11
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,500
 part of adulting is attending weddings

12
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,980
 and filling out wedding invitations.

13
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,660
 And so some of the bad advice that I received

14
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:51,180
 happened when I was 18 years old.

15
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:52,020
 It was really the first time

16
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,540
 that I'd ever received a wedding invitation.

17
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:56,500
 For me personally, I had friends that were getting married.

18
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,420
 I get this invitation.

19
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:58,900
 I'm in college at this point.

20
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,700
 I get the wedding invitation and I'm not really sure

21
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,100
 what I'm supposed to do with this thing.

22
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,300
 How do I fill it out?

23
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,140
 And if I don't fill it out,

24
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,180
 does that mean I for sure can't come?

25
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:08,580
 So I ask my roommate and he begins to,

26
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:09,940
 I explain, hey, what do I do with this?

27
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:11,980
 It says number of guests.

28
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:13,100
 What do I put there?

29
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:14,580
 And he says, look, you just fill it out.

30
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,380
 You say I'm coming or I'm not coming.

31
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:17,640
 And then in the number of guests,

32
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,100
 you put how many are coming.

33
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,560
 And I'm like, okay, so I just put the number

34
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,500
 of people that are gonna come.

35
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,260
 And I put in yes, coming or not coming.

36
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:24,100
 That's all that I do.

37
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:24,920
 Yes, that's all you do.

38
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,760
 It's really easy.

39
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,580
 Are you kidding me?

40
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:27,740
 I'm like, perfect, okay.

41
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:28,580
 So I put it down.

42
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:31,020
 And what I did not understand is that he was saying

43
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,180
 you only fill out the number of guests

44
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,860
 if they have told you you can bring another person.

45
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:38,900
 That's the only time that you say I'm bringing two.

46
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,780
 In other words, every wedding invitation that you receive

47
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:43,860
 is not just a chance for you to put in

48
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,060
 as many people as you would like to bring.

49
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,620
 I'm gonna write down eight or nine people.

50
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:50,500
 My little posse is gonna come with me to this wedding.

51
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,920
 And you're laughing now, but it only gets worse

52
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,580
 because I did not understand that.

53
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,700
 And so every wedding that I attended,

54
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,660
 based on that bad advice that I had been given,

55
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:03,700
 I would always bring a date with me

56
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,340
 because who likes to attend a wedding by themselves?

57
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:08,460
 Can I get an amen from a sister or brother?

58
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:11,900
 And so I would always bring a date with me

59
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,180
 to every single wedding I go to

60
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,660
 'cause it'd be like, how many number of guests?

61
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:15,740
 Of course I'm bringing two.

62
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:18,660
 Sometimes it would have one written already on there

63
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,740
 and I would cross it out and write two.

64
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:21,700
 (audience laughing)

65
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,220
 Oh my gosh, it's so terrible.

66
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,860
 But I would always bring someone with me.

67
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:27,060
 It wasn't until I got married and my wife was like,

68
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,540
 we can't just bring anyone to the wedding

69
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,300
 when she helped me fill out the intendant.

70
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,900
 But I didn't realize that this was the case.

71
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,620
 In fact, I cannot believe this actually happened.

72
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:38,220
 At one wedding, I brought two dates with me

73
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,620
 because I was like, yeah, come on, it's gonna be great.

74
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:41,460
 It's gonna be a party.

75
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,740
 You don't have anything going on, it'll be fine.

76
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:43,580
 We'll go.

77
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,800
 And I didn't understand that there was a certain process

78
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,340
 and I had received bad advice as it relates

79
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,620
 to kind of etiquette and the rules

80
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,700
 of bringing a date to a wedding.

81
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,580
 I don't know how many bridezillas I created

82
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,580
 from my decisions and how much I cost

83
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,260
 different fathers of the groom who were like,

84
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,820
 who the heck does this guy think he is?

85
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,120
 He's bringing three people to our wedding?

86
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,000
 What in the world?

87
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,580
 And my point in that story is that in following

88
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:11,760
 that bad advice, there were consequences

89
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,940
 that ended up costing others.

90
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:17,460
 That I followed bad advice and it led me to act

91
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:20,260
 in a certain way as it related to the wedding invitation

92
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:24,140
 and those actions for sure had consequences for sure

93
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,580
 at weddings where it's like $75 a head

94
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,020
 and I'm like, somebody's paying for this.

95
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:28,840
 It's gonna be great.

96
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,780
 It's ending up costing someone because of my decisions.

97
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:34,380
 All because of bad advice I'd received.

98
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,220
 And the reason I start there is because tonight,

99
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,160
 we're gonna talk about a topic that I think

100
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:42,200
 if there's any topic that touches all of us

101
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,560
 across the board, it's this one.

102
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,300
 It's a topic we're all interested in

103
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:49,180
 and it's also a topic that every one of us

104
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:52,700
 has received bad advice in.

105
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,340
 And it's the topic of relationships.

106
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,180
 As we continue the series on adulting

107
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,260
 and what it looks like to step into having

108
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:02,940
 adult or mature, non-childish relationships,

109
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:05,900
 all of us as we've grown up have received some bad advice

110
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:09,100
 from different mediums of culture

111
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,660
 or just different voices in our life

112
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:13,580
 who have given us some really, really bad advice.

113
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:14,940
 That unlike a wedding where it's just,

114
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:17,980
 oh, it costs some other random guy we don't know $75.

115
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:22,660
 If we follow the bad advice from the world around us

116
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,420
 as it relates to dating, the consequences

117
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:26,320
 are more costly to us and more costly

118
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,260
 to all those in our path.

119
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:33,260
 And really have a potential to create catastrophic pain

120
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,660
 in your life and in my life.

121
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:35,940
 So we're gonna explore what some of those

122
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,460
 bad advice topics are.

123
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,420
 You and I have received bad advice from mediums,

124
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,740
 honestly, that don't even seem that bad.

125
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,680
 Probably if you're like me and you were a child

126
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,360
 in the 90s, from very early on, you grew up

127
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,940
 hearing bad advice or given a picture

128
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,760
 that didn't always include good advice.

129
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,640
 You were given a picture of what a relationship,

130
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,800
 dating, all that stuff looked like,

131
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,400
 whether it was in TV through Corey and Topanga

132
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,040
 or Zach Morris and Kelly Kapowski

133
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,840
 to Ross and Rachel and Crazy Joey

134
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,160
 or the movies that we watched with The Notebook

135
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,640
 and How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days

136
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,560
 or Titanic Off the Edge of the Boat

137
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,780
 or whatever it was, we were given this picture

138
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,480
 of what love and dating and relationships

139
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,580
 were supposed to look like and we were also

140
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:13,960
 given some really bad advice.

141
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,120
 Or the songs that you and I grew up listening to.

142
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,040
 Not only the days of Hanson marked our childhood

143
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,080
 but also that of NSYNC and of Usher and Boys II Men

144
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,900
 and all these different expressions

145
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,560
 that sent a clear message about dating,

146
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,340
 about romance, about relationships,

147
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:33,280
 many of them with a message that was full

148
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,320
 of horrible advice.

149
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,480
 And so what does it look like to leave

150
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,340
 the ways of childhood behind and become adult

151
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,180
 as a relationship?

152
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,880
 It starts with removing the bad advice

153
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,880
 that you and I have received from the world around us

154
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,280
 and aligning ourselves with what God's word

155
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,160
 has to say as it relates to those bad advice.

156
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,400
 So we're gonna look at seven pieces of bad advice.

157
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,800
 This is gonna be an unusual night.

158
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,520
 Normally, we'll just take one passage of scripture,

159
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,760
 we'll break it down and talk through it.

160
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,440
 Tonight, we're gonna look at seven different

161
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,960
 pieces of advice that really, I think all of us

162
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,260
 at some point have heard the message

163
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:06,360
 of these bad pieces of advice

164
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,720
 and what God's word has to say about them.

165
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,300
 So here we go, we're gonna dive in

166
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,100
 and let me say one last thing.

167
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:16,700
 I think it's clear that the advice that we've received

168
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,580
 from the world around us is not helping, it's hurting.

169
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:24,880
 The marriage rate is in decline like never before.

170
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,440
 A few years ago, a couple decades ago,

171
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:32,700
 seven out of 10 of you were married by this point

172
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,180
 in their 20s.

173
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:37,180
 Today, two out of 10 will marry in their 20s.

174
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:41,880
 Marriage is declined as people less and less trust

175
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,960
 even the institution of marriage.

176
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,640
 You know, today, this came up from Business Insider

177
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,560
 in May of 2014.

178
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,000
 You will spend, the average person will spend

179
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,440
 more years single and alone than married.

180
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,320
 For the first time in the history of our nation,

181
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,720
 the average person due to delay in marriage,

182
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,960
 due to divorce, you wait till you're 30,

183
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,900
 you get married and then you divorce 10 years later

184
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,520
 and then you're single for another decade,

185
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,220
 due to delay in marriage, divorce and death,

186
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:09,640
 you and I will spend more years alone than married.

187
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,800
 It's never been that way in the history of our nation

188
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,920
 and it is the current reality we're a part of.

189
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,060
 It's clear there's a problem.

190
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:19,120
 The divorce rate is one out of every two marriages

191
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,960
 ends in divorce.

192
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,160
 It's clear the advice that the world around us

193
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,560
 has given us is not good advice,

194
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,340
 but God has, in the midst of a world that speaks

195
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,320
 such terrible advice, given us clear instructions

196
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,420
 on how you and I can experience the relationship

197
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:34,140
 that I think all of us long for and desire to be a part of

198
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:36,120
 if he brings that person into our life.

199
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,680
 So we're gonna look at seven pieces of bad advice

200
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,880
 or bad ideas that have really been a part

201
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,640
 of all of our upbringing.

202
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:47,060
 The first idea is that appearance trumps all.

203
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,960
 That appearance trumps all.

204
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,520
 The first piece of bad advice is that appearance trumps all.

205
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,360
 We live in a world that says,

206
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:55,720
 hey, the most important thing is physical attraction.

207
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,960
 I think most of us wouldn't say,

208
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,040
 yeah, appearance trumps all.

209
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,860
 I agree with that.

210
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,360
 We would say it in a less shallow way

211
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,560
 so that we feel better about ourselves.

212
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,120
 We're like, look, if I'm not attracted,

213
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,600
 it is a deal breaker, okay?

214
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,440
 Wouldn't we?

215
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,320
 We'd all say, look, I have to be physically attracted

216
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,160
 to someone.

217
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:10,980
 I'm not saying that's right or wrong.

218
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,320
 I'm just saying that that idea of, hey,

219
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,520
 appearance trumps all is connected to that.

220
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,120
 In other words, we're willing to give a little wiggle room

221
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,240
 on anything other than attraction.

222
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,320
 You think about that?

223
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,680
 Like if their character's not great,

224
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,840
 we're like, we're gonna work with them.

225
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,080
 I'm gonna be there and coach them along.

226
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,440
 If they, even if it's like they don't speak English,

227
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,880
 we're like, we'll get Rosetta Stone.

228
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,280
 It's okay, she's a babe.

229
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,760
 Oh man, it's gonna be great.

230
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,960
 She can learn English.

231
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,880
 Salsa, spicy, I love it, ah.

232
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,160
 So wrong.

233
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,800
 That's not in my notes, I apologize.

234
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,320
 We live in a world where the message is,

235
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,280
 hey, appearance trumps all.

236
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,320
 Even Tinder, think about Tinder.

237
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,920
 Tinder is the, Tinder has taken all the other dating

238
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,960
 online apps thing and really it's gone like,

239
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,240
 look, we don't care what you believe, where you work,

240
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,080
 any of that stuff.

241
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,040
 Are you hot or not?

242
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,680
 Because we're gonna go left or right based on that.

243
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:03,000
 It promotes, love at first sight is a myth

244
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,920
 that is connected to appearance trumps all.

245
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:10,800
 Like in other words, no one is ever, hey, I fell in love

246
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,080
 and it wasn't because physically you were beautiful.

247
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,680
 You've never, I wrote this down in my notes,

248
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,960
 I've never heard the story of, hey, here's how I met her.

249
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,360
 The first time I saw her, she was serving the homeless

250
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,240
 and I was like, wow, I am not at all physically

251
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:26,240
 attracted to you, but I must meet this Mother Teresa

252
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,360
 and see if she would like to mother some Teresas

253
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,240
 of her own.

254
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,320
 (audience laughing)

255
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,860
 It's never happened.

256
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,860
 It's all connected to appearance.

257
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,760
 That's the only thing, love at first sight is really,

258
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,960
 hey, I thought she was hot or I thought he was hot

259
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,360
 and that's what I mean by that.

260
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,700
 That is a myth.

261
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,160
 Appearance trumps all and here's the reality.

262
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,720
 Appearance, oh my gosh.

263
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,700
 That also was not really in my notes, okay.

264
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:54,720
 Appearance is a depreciating asset.

265
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,560
 It is one of the few things that if you bank

266
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,280
 and put all your stock and date someone

267
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,680
 because of the way that they look,

268
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,000
 it is one of the few things that is for sure leaving.

269
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,160
 Ever think about that?

270
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,440
 Like gravity is gonna win that fight with all of us.

271
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,440
 It is you putting all your stock in something

272
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,820
 that for sure is gonna depreciate.

273
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:16,040
 This idea of why it's such bad advice to put all

274
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,000
 of your stock in appearance or appearance trumping all

275
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,280
 is really nothing new.

276
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,480
 There was a guy in the Bible whose name was King Lemuel.

277
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,840
 He was a king in Israel's history and he wrote out

278
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,280
 some words that his mom had given him.

279
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,400
 This king inside of the Bible,

280
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,080
 we're gonna look at his proverb that he writes here

281
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,840
 in a second but it's basically a proverb

282
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,360
 where his mom said, "Hey, King Lemuel, I want you to sit down

283
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,200
 "I got some advice.

284
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,880
 "You're gonna look for a lady someday and I want you

285
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,160
 "to make sure that you do not get led astray

286
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:42,020
 "by a salty, spicy girl but you look for someone

287
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:44,480
 "who has a certain characteristic in their life.

288
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,920
 "That you're not led away by just beauty

289
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,120
 "or their external appearance."

290
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,140
 And he writes down and writes, this is some of the words

291
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:50,980
 that my mom passed on to me.

292
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:53,840
 This is what it says, Proverbs 31 in verse one.

293
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,440
 "The sayings of King Lemuel."

294
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,000
 An inspired utterance his mother taught him.

295
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,140
 He'd go to verse 10.

296
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:06,480
 "A wife of noble character who can find.

297
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,200
 "She is worth far more than rubies."

298
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,880
 In other words, he writes out this song and says,

299
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,120
 "Oh, this is what my mom taught me.

300
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,540
 "I am to look, when I look around and I try to find

301
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,340
 "a potential spouse, a potential mate that I'm gonna live

302
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:20,000
 "this life with, what I'm to look for and what is most

303
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,680
 "valuable in a person has nothing to do

304
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,060
 "with their external appearance or their physical

305
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,660
 "characteristics but with their character.

306
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,140
 "My mama told me I'm to look after someone

307
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:32,060
 "that doesn't just have physical characteristics

308
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,640
 "that I like and she looks a certain way

309
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,200
 "or he looks a certain way, but it is character

310
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,480
 "over physical characteristics that matters most."

311
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:43,280
 That in other words, long before Justin Bieber came along

312
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:47,000
 and gave us the love yourself, it was King Lemuel's mama

313
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,880
 who said, "If you ain't got character,

314
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:53,040
 "my mama don't like you and she likes everyone."

315
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,240
 (audience laughing)

316
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,560
 Straight from his mama, King Lemuel said,

317
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,940
 "Look for, hey, baby boy, I want you to look for a girl

318
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:03,160
 "who has character, if you're a girl or a guy,

319
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,740
 "the rule applies for all of us.

320
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,900
 "That is you look for a spouse, physical appearance

321
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,220
 "is one of the few things that is for sure fleeting

322
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:11,440
 "and is going to be out of here.

323
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,680
 "Look for physical characteristics, not character."

324
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,720
 All right, second bad idea, second bad idea is,

325
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,760
 hey, in dating someone, you want to leave

326
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,580
 a little bit of mystery, right?

327
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:21,880
 You want to create a little confusion,

328
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:22,960
 you want to leave them wanting more,

329
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,200
 you got to play the game.

330
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,040
 And you want to make sure if they text you,

331
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,240
 you don't text back a little bit,

332
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,320
 you wait at least twice as long before you text back

333
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,300
 to show them who's boss.

334
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,520
 I'm gonna drive to see right here.

335
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:35,780
 You play the game that you leave a little mystery,

336
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:38,160
 create a little confusion, leave them wondering,

337
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,720
 leave them wanting.

338
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:43,960
 This is horrible advice, especially for Christ followers.

339
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,240
 And it's advice that honestly, you cannot live out

340
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,480
 some of the commands in scripture if you follow,

341
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,920
 particularly for the guys in the room

342
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,080
 and also for the girls in the room,

343
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,560
 if you are all about playing games.

344
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,520
 Here's what 1 Corinthians 13 says as it relates

345
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:01,120
 to why we are to put aside this innate,

346
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,480
 whatever it is inside of us that's like,

347
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,320
 I'm just gonna play the game.

348
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,840
 Maybe it's a desire for control,

349
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,460
 or maybe it's fear of rejection,

350
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,360
 or I don't know what it is,

351
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,200
 but it's definitely not loving,

352
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:16,280
 and it's self-seeking or selfish.

353
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,880
 In 1 Corinthians 13, that most famous description

354
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,600
 of what is love, what does it look like

355
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,360
 to care and love someone, it lays out that if you

356
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,200
 at any point act in a self-seeking way,

357
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,840
 you can be sure you're not acting in love.

358
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:32,000
 It says this about love in verse five of chapter 13

359
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,920
 of 1 Corinthians.

360
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,200
 Love does not dishonor others.

361
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,480
 It is not self-seeking.

362
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,080
 It is not easily angered and it keeps no record of wrongs,

363
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,640
 that love is not self-seeking.

364
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:46,040
 Whatever self-focused desire, I'm gonna play the game,

365
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:50,100
 I'm gonna keep 'em wound around my finger, is not loving.

366
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:53,240
 And as Christ followers, you and I are to not leave

367
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,720
 a little mystery or create confusion.

368
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,700
 In fact, for especially the guys in the room,

369
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,920
 one of the key characteristics of what leadership is

370
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,720
 is you remove confusion at any point.

371
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,420
 One of the more loving and less self-seeking things

372
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:09,200
 that you could do is say, I'm going to remove confusion

373
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,920
 in this relationship at every point along the way.

374
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,500
 There will be no friendationships.

375
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,000
 You're never gonna be wondering what's going on with me,

376
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,840
 what's going on with her.

377
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,480
 From beginning to end, I'm going to remove confusion.

378
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,480
 When I ask you on a date, it won't be like,

379
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,400
 hey, you wanna hang out?

380
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:24,760
 I got this, you know, pass to Six Flags, you wanna come?

381
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,780
 I don't know where that date came from,

382
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:26,920
 but it won't be that.

383
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,880
 It will be, I would like to take you on a date.

384
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,860
 I'm gonna look you in the eye.

385
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:32,160
 I'm not gonna text you or use a medium

386
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,960
 that I could ask someone out and include an emoji.

387
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,780
 Think about that.

388
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:36,960
 That's probably not the best context

389
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,800
 in which you ask someone out.

390
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,880
 I'm gonna look you in the eye.

391
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,720
 I'm gonna call you.

392
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,560
 I'm gonna have a conversation.

393
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,860
 I would like to take you out on a date.

394
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:44,000
 I'm gonna remove any confusion of what this is

395
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,920
 along the way.

396
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:47,860
 As we date, I'm going to remove any confusion

397
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,880
 of where you stand and where I stand

398
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,200
 and where this is headed.

399
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,680
 I'm gonna remove any confusion from that relationship

400
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,080
 because that is most loving.

401
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,840
 And yes, it will be less like, oh, it's mysterious,

402
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,740
 and I kinda like mysterious.

403
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:05,080
 Mysterious now turns into shady later, I promise you.

404
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,040
 You do not want mysterious.

405
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:07,960
 What you want is someone,

406
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,800
 especially if you're a lady looking for a guy

407
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,400
 who will remove confusion from beginning to end.

408
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,540
 When the relationship comes to an end,

409
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,680
 they're gonna sit down and say,

410
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,200
 "I think this relationship should end."

411
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,240
 Guy and girl.

412
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,420
 And girls, you have a responsibility as well

413
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,880
 to remove confusion.

414
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,140
 If you don't wanna go on a date,

415
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,000
 you say, "I don't wanna go on a date."

416
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,480
 You don't just be like, "Oh, plans keep coming up."

417
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,960
 And you say yes originally,

418
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,120
 and then you just keep canceling.

419
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:31,960
 You say no.

420
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:35,600
 You remove confusion because love is not self-seeking.

421
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,920
 It is other-focused.

422
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,040
 I don't know why I wrote this,

423
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,600
 but for followers of Christ,

424
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,900
 it is don't hate the player, hate the game.

425
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,640
 It is don't date the player, and don't play games

426
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:50,400
 for all of us in the room who love Jesus and know him.

427
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,680
 Third piece of bad advice

428
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,480
 is that you and I are to search for the best.

429
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,800
 I don't think anyone thinks of it this way,

430
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,440
 but this is a relatively new idea

431
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,260
 that I think has really permeated all of our thinking.

432
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:04,800
 We live in a world where the internet has changed the game

433
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,520
 and it's changed decision-making.

434
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,600
 Here's what I mean.

435
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,600
 Everything that I do,

436
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,160
 I'm constantly searching for the best experience

437
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,920
 or the best product or the best purchase or whatever it is.

438
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,880
 When I go to a restaurant, I go to Yelp.

439
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,000
 I'm like, "Best Mexican food, place in town, filter.

440
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,080
 "Which one's number one?"

441
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,220
 When I get to the restaurant, I look at best appetizers.

442
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:23,040
 I look at which one of me read the tips,

443
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,240
 and I look for the best.

444
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,800
 I'm not gonna settle for second best.

445
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,780
 I want the best.

446
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:27,760
 When I go to Amazon,

447
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,320
 I spend eight hours researching a coffee grinder

448
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,120
 versus old days of just going to,

449
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:36,240
 I don't know where they sell coffee grinders.

450
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,640
 And Bed, Bath, and Beyond, wherever they sell them.

451
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,840
 And I spend hours and hours researching

452
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,400
 because I want the best.

453
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:48,040
 TripAdvisor, I'm not gonna settle for any mediocre hotel.

454
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:48,880
 I want the best.

455
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,680
 Rotten Tomatoes, we live in a world that constantly,

456
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:54,280
 the internet has not only given us the opportunity

457
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,400
 to experience the best,

458
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,800
 it produces the idea that the best is possible.

459
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,560
 And so of course, this has bled into the way

460
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,720
 that many of us, I would say most of us,

461
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,520
 think about dating.

462
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,560
 Like we are constantly looking for the best out there.

463
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,280
 I'm not a quitter, I'm an American.

464
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,660
 I wanna find the best person for me in the entire world.

465
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,580
 That's what I'm gonna do.

466
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:17,080
 I'm gonna search out and find the best.

467
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,880
 Here's why that is a bad idea.

468
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:24,320
 You will never find the best person for you.

469
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,280
 I mean, it is literally impossible.

470
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,340
 What do I mean by that?

471
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:29,720
 If you took all the people just in our country,

472
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,880
 if you're like, I'm gonna find the best person

473
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,640
 in the world for me, you will not find them.

474
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,800
 It would take you more years than you have.

475
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,900
 If you took just the people in America,

476
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,220
 give or take a couple years on your side

477
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,840
 of the opposite gender,

478
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,600
 and you lined all of them up for a speed dating,

479
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,660
 and you went through all of them to determine,

480
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,480
 'cause the only way to know if something's the best

481
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,080
 is to go through all of them,

482
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,760
 and you went through each one for one minute a piece,

483
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,880
 you would spend 167 years looking through

484
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,020
 and working through, is this the best person?

485
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,500
 It is literally impossible.

486
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,700
 You'll never get there.

487
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,440
 That's why some of you are,

488
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,440
 I don't know if I should even say that.

489
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,280
 That's why some people out there end up waiting

490
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,840
 until they're 45 still looking for the best,

491
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,880
 and all the options pass them by.

492
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,480
 If you search for the best out there,

493
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,660
 you will never find it.

494
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,960
 But God has given us a solution

495
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,460
 that we are not called to look for the best option possible,

496
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:21,100
 but to look for God's best.

497
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,960
 That is your best chance,

498
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,420
 or best advice as it relates to this point.

499
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,560
 You are to look for God's best.

500
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,460
 What is God's best?

501
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:31,400
 Is that you would look for someone who loves Christ

502
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:35,440
 and is committed to him more than he's committed to you

503
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,320
 and your dating relationship.

504
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,160
 If you find that person, pursue them and marry them.

505
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,760
 That is the best that you're gonna get.

506
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,980
 And the other one will never happen.

507
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,440
 It is literally impossible.

508
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,720
 If you just go and take the mentality,

509
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,840
 I'm gonna search for the best.

510
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,860
 But what is possible is to find what God,

511
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,200
 the creator of the heavens and the earth,

512
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,360
 who designed marriage, who designed you,

513
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,800
 who designed all of life, what he says is best,

514
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,480
 and has asked all of us to trust him.

515
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,280
 Hey, this is what really is best.

516
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:07,400
 And if you try to find man's best, you'll never get there.

517
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,280
 All right, next piece of advice.

518
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,680
 Number four, make sure you are sexually compatible.

519
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,240
 That's a zinger, how about that?

520
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,260
 Make sure that you are sexually compatible.

521
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,100
 You've probably heard this.

522
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,720
 Hey, this is why you wanna try before you buy.

523
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,880
 You wanna make sure you test things out,

524
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,880
 make sure expectations are on the same page.

525
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,320
 Make sure that you guys, you know,

526
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,520
 things work together in that arena.

527
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,580
 That's a big part of marriage.

528
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,720
 You don't wanna go in flying blind.

529
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,380
 Let me remove any question of sexual compatibility.

530
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:39,120
 How do you know if someone's sexually compatible?

531
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,600
 If you are a man and they are a woman,

532
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,720
 you are sexually compatible.

533
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,760
 (audience laughing)

534
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,360
 I mean, I don't mean,

535
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,200
 but I really want you to think about that.

536
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,440
 I don't wanna be crude, but if you have a penis

537
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,080
 and they have a vagina, #adulting message,

538
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,700
 then you are sexually compatible.

539
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,420
 Every girl in this room is sexually compatible

540
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:07,260
 with every guy in this room, it's true.

541
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,380
 And so this idea of like, hey, I need to find sexually,

542
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:11,840
 someone who's sexually compatible is a myth.

543
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,940
 And honestly, it's bad advice.

544
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:13,980
 And here's why it's bad advice.

545
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:16,940
 And man, I want you guys to get this so bad.

546
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,700
 Because that's based on the premise

547
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:22,220
 that you can take sex outside of marriage,

548
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:24,540
 where it was created and intended to be placed

549
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:29,540
 and experienced and not have pain, not have consequences.

550
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,460
 That you can take this action

551
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,940
 outside of the context of marriage

552
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,460
 and it will not create pain and destruction

553
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,800
 inside of your life.

554
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:40,680
 From a culture around this, sex is just physical.

555
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,660
 That's why you should experiment and try it out.

556
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:45,480
 The reality is sex is powerful.

557
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,540
 God created it and made it and designed it

558
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:50,980
 so that it would be placed in the context of marriage.

559
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:53,240
 And the sexually compatible idea is so dangerous

560
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:56,620
 and such bad advice because it takes that idea of sex

561
00:20:56,620 --> 00:21:01,260
 and it places it outside of the context it was created for.

562
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,820
 And it is wreaking havoc all over our land,

563
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:05,860
 all over our country.

564
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:06,900
 Sex is powerful.

565
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:07,900
 There's no question there.

566
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,700
 The apostle Paul says this as it relates to sexual sin

567
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:14,140
 and why it uniquely affects people,

568
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,540
 different than other sins.

569
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:18,220
 Why when people come down front and they're like,

570
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:21,300
 I need to tell you something I've never told anyone before.

571
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,800
 And they pull you aside, I know what's coming next.

572
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,560
 It's always sexual sin.

573
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,280
 It's never like when I was 15,

574
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,840
 I went to this dance with this girl and I got wasted

575
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,240
 and I've just been carrying shame.

576
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,840
 It's always sexual sin because it's powerful.

577
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,440
 The apostle Paul explains why this is

578
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,000
 in 1 Corinthians 6, verse 16 and 18.

579
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,040
 It says this.

580
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,840
 He's writing to this group of men

581
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:45,340
 who were going to have sex with prostitutes.

582
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:47,440
 And it'd be like men in our culture who's like,

583
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,480
 hey, I have a high sex drive.

584
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,120
 I gotta look at porn and masturbate.

585
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,820
 He's writing to them who are going to have sex

586
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:52,860
 with prostitutes 'cause they're like,

587
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:53,780
 I have a high sex drive.

588
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,060
 And he's going, that is crazy.

589
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:57,700
 You are doing something damaging to yourself uniquely.

590
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,020
 He says this, verse 16.

591
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:01,340
 "Don't you realize when a man joins himself

592
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:05,160
 "with a prostitute, he becomes one body with her.

593
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:08,340
 "For the scriptures say the two are united

594
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:12,380
 "or glued into one when they have sex.

595
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:15,300
 "Run from sexual sin," verse 18.

596
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:19,760
 No other sin so clearly affects the body as this one does.

597
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:24,880
 No, for sexual immorality is a sin against your own body.

598
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,600
 Sexual sin in a unique category, Paul says,

599
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,960
 is like no other sin.

600
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,480
 And when you take it outside of marriage

601
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,600
 and you just play around with this thing,

602
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,000
 you're playing with fire and you're going to get hurt.

603
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,440
 It was created and it's this powerful gift

604
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,000
 from God who is very pro-sex.

605
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,200
 He is all about sex.

606
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,040
 There wasn't sex, God made sex.

607
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,000
 Think about that.

608
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,540
 To say God is anti-sex or a prude

609
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:49,500
 is like saying that Steve Jobs,

610
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,300
 who made the iPhone, was anti-iPhone.

611
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,400
 That is lunacy, that's crazy.

612
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,980
 God is very pro-sex.

613
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:56,460
 And because he's also pro-you

614
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,020
 and knows how sex works best,

615
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:01,380
 he said, "I design this to be something

616
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,680
 "that is experienced in the marriage context

617
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,900
 "where permanently two people are joined together,

618
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:10,100
 "where there's no fear of it being ripped apart,

619
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,920
 "but permanently it's this bonding agent

620
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,020
 "that I've given to man.

621
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,580
 "And if you take it outside of marriage,

622
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:16,260
 "it will always bring pain.

623
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,860
 "It is like fire."

624
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:20,820
 Like we've said before, a fireplace.

625
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:22,780
 I love fire in the fireplace.

626
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:24,420
 It's awesome, crackling wood.

627
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:25,540
 It's great.

628
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:27,620
 Inside of that context,

629
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:31,880
 fire ravaging through your house is not great.

630
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:35,400
 In the same way, sex inside of marriage

631
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,500
 is the context for which it was created and is great.

632
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,860
 Sex outside of that is like a fire

633
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:41,780
 moving through the home.

634
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:45,380
 It is just dangerous, will only create more damage.

635
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:47,420
 And God who loves you and me

636
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:51,300
 has given that gift to be for that specific context.

637
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:53,900
 He's not angry at you, but it's powerful.

638
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,020
 And your own experience has seen this.

639
00:23:56,020 --> 00:24:01,020
 And the pain that you look back on sexual experiences

640
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:02,700
 with different people, with different partners,

641
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:05,300
 that first person, why is it that sticks with you?

642
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,060
 'Cause sex is powerful.

643
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,020
 And God has placed it.

644
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:10,380
 Sexual compatibility is a lie

645
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:14,300
 that will lead you down a painful path of destruction.

646
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,100
 All right, moving on.

647
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:15,940
 Next one.

648
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:19,540
 My past defines me.

649
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:22,700
 Another bad idea of dating advice,

650
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,380
 that my past defines me.

651
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:28,260
 In other words, my past disqualifies me from God's best.

652
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:30,820
 I have done sexual sin.

653
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:32,620
 I've done things that in my past,

654
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:35,860
 and they disqualify me from God's best.

655
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,620
 There are, I know people in this room

656
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:44,460
 who think, man, I have done too much.

657
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:47,460
 A godly man or a godly woman could never love me.

658
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:52,020
 Like I'm used up, I'm used goods.

659
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:54,780
 A godly man, I mean, that just doesn't work.

660
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:55,900
 All this stuff you guys talk about,

661
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,940
 of course that's nice, but you don't know what I've done.

662
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:59,740
 And so because of what I've done,

663
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:01,860
 a godly guy who actually lives by all this,

664
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:03,180
 he's not gonna want a girl like me.

665
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:05,220
 Or a godly girl who lives by this,

666
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:07,860
 she's not gonna want a guy like me.

667
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,100
 And that is a lie.

668
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,460
 This one is personal for me.

669
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:15,140
 I have a sister who I have had long conversations with,

670
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:17,180
 who is a believer in Christ,

671
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:20,420
 but has made decisions, she's a single mother of two.

672
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:22,300
 And as we even discuss about the porch,

673
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:26,020
 she would say, hey, those guys are not going to like me.

674
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:28,820
 They're not gonna wanna date a girl like me.

675
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,940
 And I tell her what I would say to you if you're there,

676
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:32,820
 you have fallen for a lie.

677
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:36,760
 A godly man will see you like Christ sees you,

678
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,220
 which is not condemned.

679
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:42,500
 How did Christ see women who had sexual sin in their past,

680
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,700
 or men who had sexual sin in their past?

681
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:48,180
 The clearest picture we have in scripture is in John 8,

682
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:51,960
 and one of my favorite stories of Jesus in the entire Bible,

683
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:55,140
 where Jesus is teaching on the temple,

684
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:57,900
 and all of a sudden this woman who had a sexual past

685
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,460
 is thrown in front of him.

686
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:03,780
 He was in a sexual past of like five minutes ago,

687
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:07,260
 had done sexual acts that you would think would condemn her.

688
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,940
 In fact, she's thrown in front of him,

689
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:11,300
 and these Pharisees who dragged her there

690
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:14,420
 begin to say, Jesus, the law says about this woman

691
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:18,620
 who we just caught having sex with another man's wife,

692
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:21,280
 or with another wife's husband,

693
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,100
 with a guy who was not her husband.

694
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,220
 (audience laughing)

695
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:25,660
 (laughing)

696
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:26,980
 Woo, okay.

697
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:29,420
 Didn't sleep a lot last night.

698
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:31,980
 All right, the law says about this woman

699
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:34,380
 who had just been caught having sex

700
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,660
 with a man who wasn't her husband.

701
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,020
 They drag her and throw her in front of Jesus.

702
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:39,500
 They said, the law says she should be killed.

703
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:42,940
 They begin calling for the death penalty in this crowd,

704
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:46,260
 and Jesus bends over and begins writing in the dirt,

705
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,720
 and we're not even told what he writes,

706
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,860
 and at some point he pauses and he looks up

707
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:53,780
 to this group of men calling for the death penalty

708
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:56,040
 on this woman who had a sexual past,

709
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:58,900
 and what does the Son of God say?

710
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,060
 Perfect righteousness.

711
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:01,180
 What is he gonna do?

712
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:04,060
 He looks at the crowd and he says,

713
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:08,060
 let the man who has not sinned throw the first stone,

714
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:10,920
 and then he goes back to writing,

715
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:14,540
 and it says, one by one, from the oldest to the youngest,

716
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:17,400
 they all walked away 'til it's just Jesus and the woman,

717
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:21,480
 and he looks at her and he bends over near this woman,

718
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:25,580
 and he says, where are your accusers?

719
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:28,740
 Does no one condemn you?

720
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:33,260
 The perfect Son of God, perfect righteousness,

721
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:38,180
 looks at her, and she responds with, no one, Lord.

722
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:43,060
 They've all left, and he says, neither do I condemn you.

723
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,940
 I do not condone what you have done,

724
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:47,120
 but you are looking at perfect righteousness,

725
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,380
 God in a bod, six foot perfection in sandals,

726
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:54,100
 staring at you, and you are not condemned,

727
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:56,000
 and I don't even know if I should joke like that,

728
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,580
 because I really wanna make sure you hear this.

729
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:59,340
 If that's your story and that's where you are,

730
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:00,780
 and you're going, can God love me?

731
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:03,180
 I look at my sexual past, does God love me?

732
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:05,380
 You can see from the story of that and so many others

733
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:06,520
 that when he looks at you,

734
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:09,140
 though he may not condone your past, he does not condemn it,

735
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:11,000
 and if you find a godly man,

736
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,800
 he will not look at your past and go, I could not marry you.

737
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,300
 That's not a godly man.

738
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:21,180
 A godly man sees like Jesus sees,

739
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:23,300
 and a godly man who says, I wouldn't marry a girl

740
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,580
 who has a past like that, or a godly girl who says,

741
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:27,780
 I wouldn't marry a guy who has a past like that.

742
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:30,500
 That's not a godly girl or a godly guy,

743
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,860
 and they don't see like Christ sees,

744
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:37,540
 and they don't look like Christ looks in that scenario.

745
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:39,920
 That your past does not define you.

746
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,300
 If you're a follower of Jesus,

747
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,180
 Christ has redefined your past,

748
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:47,540
 and through him, he is redefining your future,

749
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:49,180
 and if you follow this bad advice,

750
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:50,660
 it will do what it's done to so many,

751
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:52,340
 and it will push you into relationships,

752
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:54,660
 dating men or dating women,

753
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:56,540
 because you're like, look, a godly guy couldn't,

754
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:57,980
 this is the best I can do,

755
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:01,020
 and then you're gonna have sex with that person,

756
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:02,060
 'cause it's the best you can do,

757
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:03,940
 and to have a relationship with that kind of person,

758
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:05,780
 you gotta just have sex all the time,

759
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:10,100
 and God looks and says, your past does not disqualify you,

760
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:13,220
 and a godly man will see like Christ sees,

761
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:16,260
 and see you like Christ sees, and a godly woman.

762
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,580
 All right, moving on.

763
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:22,420
 Number six, bad idea or bad advice

764
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:24,700
 as it relates to relationships is this,

765
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:27,640
 and they lived happily ever after.

766
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:32,420
 This could end every single romantic comedy,

767
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:34,780
 or every single fairy tale that's ever lived,

768
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:38,260
 and I think why we even laugh at that

769
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:40,460
 is because we know this is not true, right?

770
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:42,220
 Like we know that the myth

771
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:44,060
 that if I marry the right person,

772
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:44,980
 everything will be great,

773
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:47,660
 and we will ride off into the sunset together.

774
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,700
 We just know it's like, that's ludicrous.

775
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,540
 If you marry any person,

776
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:54,160
 you're gonna ride off into the sunset having conflict,

777
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,700
 and having to work through it together.

778
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,740
 That's the reality, that there is no,

779
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:59,860
 and they lived happily ever after,

780
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:03,020
 that it just came easy because they found the right person.

781
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:06,940
 No matter who you marry, you are marrying a sinner,

782
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:08,740
 and it's gonna take work.

783
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,600
 Even in choosing who to marry,

784
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,700
 you're just choosing someone

785
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,340
 you're gonna have conflict with,

786
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:16,620
 choosing someone who you are gonna have to die to yourself,

787
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:20,420
 and decide to do what would best honor and care for them.

788
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:22,380
 That's what marriage is,

789
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:24,160
 that it is no happily ever after.

790
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,100
 In fact, marriage actually promises us,

791
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:27,740
 it's one of the few promises we have about marriage.

792
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:30,020
 Paul in 1 Corinthians 7, he promises,

793
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,440
 look guys, I just wanna hit time out.

794
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,540
 As you move towards marriage,

795
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:33,500
 here's something you need to know.

796
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,460
 It's a promise.

797
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:37,420
 You gonna have trouble, girl and guy.

798
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:39,300
 It's gonna be there, it's promised.

799
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,740
 1 Corinthians 7 says this.

800
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:46,420
 Those who marry will face many troubles in this life,

801
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:48,580
 and I wanna spare you of this.

802
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,940
 One of the pictures it gives for marriage

803
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:53,220
 is not this happily ever after and everything was easy.

804
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:55,620
 It says it's like a refining fire,

805
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:58,040
 which God makes you more holy through.

806
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,180
 Think about that.

807
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,460
 That's the process of marriage.

808
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:03,580
 It's a process by which God just doesn't make you happy,

809
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:05,060
 although it does bring happiness,

810
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:07,260
 but it's about holiness,

811
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:10,560
 and through which God makes you more and more like Christ.

812
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,980
 There is no happily ever after.

813
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,860
 You're choosing and marrying a sinner,

814
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:17,420
 which you will choose to sacrifice for, serve, love,

815
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:19,620
 seek forgiveness from, and submit to,

816
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:21,620
 and they are to do the same with you.

817
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:26,880
 Final bad idea or advice is this, number seven.

818
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,860
 Let your heart lead you.

819
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:32,260
 Listen to what your heart is telling you.

820
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:34,380
 Your heart will direct you and guide you.

821
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:36,260
 How many of us have heard this before,

822
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:38,580
 from either a parent or from a grandparent,

823
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:41,140
 or from a friend, or just from the TV show friends?

824
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:43,020
 Whatever it is, we've all heard this idea

825
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:46,120
 of like let your heart guide and lead you.

826
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:49,660
 I don't know if there's a more destructive piece

827
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:51,060
 of bad advice on this entire list,

828
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:53,460
 maybe sexual sin than that piece right there.

829
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:56,260
 Like our world around us is screaming,

830
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:57,500
 hey, do what feels right.

831
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:58,620
 Do whatever is good for you.

832
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,260
 Look, nobody can tell you what to do.

833
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:01,340
 You do you, girl.

834
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:02,280
 You do you, boy.

835
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,600
 You do whatever is right for you.

836
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,840
 Nobody can tell you what's right and what's wrong.

837
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,100
 Can we all just agree,

838
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:10,580
 the more you and I do whatever we feel like,

839
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:12,020
 whenever I feel like doing it,

840
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:13,680
 with whoever I feel like doing it,

841
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:16,940
 the more pain I create, the more damage is caused,

842
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,760
 and the more empty I feel.

843
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:23,160
 Like is it any wonder when this message

844
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,380
 is everywhere in our world?

845
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:27,940
 Okay, do whatever your heart leads you to do.

846
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:31,780
 Why, things like pornography are out of control.

847
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:33,020
 Divorce, out of control.

848
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:35,000
 Infidelity, out of control.

849
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,060
 Rape is out of control because people doing,

850
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:39,660
 this is kind of what I feel like doing.

851
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:41,300
 I'm gonna do me, out of control.

852
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:43,700
 It's more common to be raped than to be a smoker.

853
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,940
 How tragic is that?

854
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:50,740
 Our debt problem, out of control.

855
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:52,260
 But you and I, if you take the advice of,

856
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,180
 hey, listen to your heart,

857
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,580
 just do whatever your heart leads you to,

858
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:56,540
 here's what the scripture says about your heart.

859
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:59,060
 Your heart, Jeremiah 17, nine says this.

860
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:04,060
 Your heart is deceitful above all things.

861
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:06,620
 In your life, the least thing

862
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:08,700
 that you should trust is your heart.

863
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:12,580
 That in your life, above everything else is your heart.

864
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:14,580
 It has the ability to deceive, to convince you,

865
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:15,660
 yes, this is what you should do.

866
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,940
 Yes, hey, God wants you to be happy, right?

867
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:20,020
 That's the kind of lie that the heart feeds.

868
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:21,580
 And the world around us is screaming,

869
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:25,020
 hey, just follow your heart and it's not working.

870
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:28,620
 And tragically, like here's the dichotomy

871
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:29,860
 that I think is so sad.

872
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:31,900
 Every once in a while, we see examples

873
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,820
 of how this lie is just not working.

874
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:36,820
 And we can all agree, we can all see if we're honest.

875
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,540
 It's not working to just follow your heart,

876
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:39,540
 do whatever feels right.

877
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:42,220
 And every once in a while, you and I get a glimpse

878
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:44,860
 from a culture, from Hollywood,

879
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:46,900
 from different things in our world where we see,

880
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:51,620
 oh my gosh, when you do what you just want to do,

881
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:54,340
 or when everyone does whatever they feel like doing,

882
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:58,780
 someone's going to get hurt and it's going to lead to pain.

883
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:00,340
 And every once in a while, we're able to see

884
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:02,700
 that both the same world that screams out,

885
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,660
 hey, just do whatever you feel like doing

886
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:08,100
 is the same world that's gonna weep with you alongside

887
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:13,100
 when they see how painful the decisions

888
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:17,020
 of people who doing whatever they feel like doing

889
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:20,940
 end up creating in the lives of those nearest to them.

890
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:23,940
 There was a picture of this this past week

891
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:25,420
 that I think was one of the more clear ones

892
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:28,060
 I've seen recently from Kelly Clarkson on American Idol.

893
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:29,980
 If you saw that clip or you saw the news,

894
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:31,700
 you know what I'm talking about, where she basically,

895
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,140
 and we're gonna see a clip of it here in a second,

896
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:35,100
 but basically she writes this song

897
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,820
 and she goes on American Idol, which is,

898
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:37,780
 if you don't know American Idol,

899
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:40,060
 what am I explaining American Idol, seriously?

900
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:42,740
 And she was the winner of the first season.

901
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:45,820
 She's an artist and she came on for the last season,

902
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:47,740
 which is this year, and they brought her on

903
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:49,300
 to sing a song that she'd written.

904
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:53,460
 It's a song she wrote that laid out

905
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:56,940
 how her father had walked out,

906
00:34:56,940 --> 00:35:00,460
 had followed his heart to unfaithfulness

907
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:04,820
 and abandoned his mother, or abandoned her and her mother,

908
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:07,060
 had created all kind of pain in her life

909
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:09,460
 and his decisions, him doing him,

910
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:11,980
 had caused all kinds of pain in her life

911
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:15,180
 and how piece by piece she is learning

912
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:17,980
 to trust a man again through her new husband

913
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:20,660
 or through her husband, that it is possible

914
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,840
 for a man to stay, it is possible for someone

915
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:27,540
 to not just listen to their heart and do what they want,

916
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:30,700
 but to say, I'm going to die to my wants

917
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:33,340
 and put your wants ahead of my own, that it is possible.

918
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:35,780
 Here's the clip that gives us the perfect picture

919
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:36,820

 (audience cheering)

936
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:38,040
 - Here's where I show that.

937
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:41,780
 All that that shows is that the idea

938
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:43,740
 that you and I can just do whatever feels good

939
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:46,080
 at any point and not have consequences,

940
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:49,540
 that it not create pain is insane.

941
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,600
 And in a picture like that and in so many other ones,

942
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,860
 you see it when all of a sudden,

943
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:54,740
 everyone in the world's cultural leaders,

944
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:57,220
 Keith Urban, J-Lo, are all now weeping

945
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,560
 because of the decision someone made

946
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:03,120
 in following whatever felt good for them

947
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,680
 and the pain that it created in someone's life.

948
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:09,360
 And why I think that's so important and so powerful

949
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,200
 as it relates to marriage and dating

950
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,320
 is inside of the context of your dating relationship,

951
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,500
 inside of the context of pursuing a marriage

952
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,360
 where you will be faithful,

953
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,960
 or you are going to stay even when it's hard,

954
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,600
 where you're gonna care, you won't walk away,

955
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,440
 where you are going to self-sacrifice

956
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,400
 and be someone who says,

957
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,160
 "I'm not gonna do what feels good for me.

958
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:31,680
 "I'm gonna lay those things down because I love you."

959
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,860
 Who's gonna teach people to live that way?

960
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:37,280
 Who's gonna teach people to not do whatever they feel like,

961
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,760
 not do what just feels good?

962
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,900
 Who?

963
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,320
 Is it the culture around us?

964
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,400
 Like, who's gonna actually keep that message?

965
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:46,100
 Or who's gonna teach husbands to stay?

966
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:46,940
 Is it Hollywood?

967
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:48,280
 You really think Hollywood's gonna teach?

968
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,760
 Hollywood only screams the message,

969
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,400
 "You do what feels good."

970
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,880
 Is it the government?

971
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:54,960
 I really want you to think about it.

972
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,800
 Who's gonna teach men to be faithful?

973
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,760
 Who's gonna teach husbands to love their wife,

974
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,280
 to lay down their life for her?

975
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,560
 Who's gonna teach wives to do the same for their husband?

976
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,960
 Who's gonna teach men to not give themselves over

977
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:11,440
 to drug addiction or alcohol addiction or workaholism

978
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,120
 or have an affair with the secretary?

979
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,080
 Who's gonna teach it?

980
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,480
 Hollywood?

981
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,720
 The government?

982
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,080
 The government is amazing.

983
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,440
 The government's not gonna teach that.

984
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,240
 They're gonna teach, "Hey, have safe sex,

985
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,280
 "and if you do something illegal,

986
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,500
 "we're gonna put you in jail,

987
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,900
 "a timeout for a little while."

988
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:26,320
 That's what the government's gonna teach.

989
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,920
 Who's gonna teach that message?

990
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:32,240
 Christ.

991
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:36,200
 The perfect example of a spouse who was faithful to the end,

992
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:40,480
 who was committed, "Even when it hurt, I'll die for you."

993
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,520
 The message of the church and why this is so important

994
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:45,920
 is we offer the only solution to Kelly's song of,

995
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:49,080
 "Hey, could there be a man out there who'd be faithful?

996
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,360
 "Could there be a spouse out there,

997
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,940
 "a wife who's gonna love me, who's gonna stay together,

998
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:54,760
 "even when it's hard, even when it's hurt?

999
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,560
 "I'm not gonna go anywhere."

1000
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,760
 We offer that solution.

1001
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,540
 It's not gonna be the government who helps people,

1002
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:01,160
 trains people, teaches people.

1003
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,840
 Die to your selfish desires.

1004
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,640
 It's Christ, the perfect spouse.

1005
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,800
 Jesus calls himself, "I am the groom.

1006
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,080
 "My church is the bride."

1007
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,840
 I'm perfect.

1008
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:13,120
 And if you will follow me and surrender to me,

1009
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,840
 surrender your love life to me,

1010
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,480
 surrender your dating life to me,

1011
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,320
 surrender your life to me.

1012
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:22,040
 Not because I'm angry and I want control of it.

1013
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,280
 I want it to not have control of you.

1014
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,240
 You're gonna hurt yourself.

1015
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,640
 Will you surrender to the God who loves you,

1016
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:31,360
 who wants you to learn and be led by the perfect spouse?

1017
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,760
 Jesus.

1018
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,720
 Who's really gonna teach people that?

1019
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:39,600
 Church of Jesus Christ uniquely even offers

1020
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,920
 that solution to the world,

1021
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,960
 where we are the ones in the midst of a culture saying,

1022
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,360
 "Do whatever you think is right for you."

1023
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,160
 Saying, "Don't do whatever you think is right for you.

1024
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:49,260
 "Do what is right for your wife.

1025
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:51,840
 "Do what is right for your children.

1026
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,940
 "Don't spend your life chasing after one hit

1027
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:54,880
 "to the next, to the next,

1028
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,520
 "to some fling with the secretary."

1029
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:59,360
 It's the church who says,

1030
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,600
 "No, no, no, don't waste your life on those things.

1031
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,080
 "Surrender it to Christ.

1032
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,980
 "He'll lead you in the direction of the relationship

1033
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:07,960
 "that you want, that the world needs to see."

1034
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,160
 And we alone offer that.

1035
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,880
 And Christ has offered that invitation

1036
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,240
 to all of us if we'll accept it.

1037
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:17,120
 Will you just surrender to me, he says.

1038
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,280
 And that's the invitation.

1039
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,460
 And if you will do that,

1040
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:23,640
 that is the best advice that you will ever experience

1041
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,320
 as it relates to your love life,

1042
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:28,880
 your dating life, and your relationship life.

1043
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,080
 And that's the only one that will lead to a place

1044
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:34,920
 where you can actually experience the thing

1045
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,920
 Kelly sings of and wishes for.

1046
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:41,720
 Someone who won't leave, who'll never walk away,

1047
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:44,600
 who doesn't just wanna take but wants to give,

1048
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:49,240
 both in marriage and ultimately in life,

1049
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:51,160
 as you live and respond to your Savior

1050
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:53,240
 and surrender that part to him.

1051
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:56,280
 He wants to change all the parts of you

1052
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,920
 and all the parts of me that aren't like him.

1053
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,200
 And he's given us this invitation.

1054
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,680
 Will you just surrender?

1055
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,040
 I know as I look, I have an 11-week-old son,

1056
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:06,760
 and I come from a legacy of very bad fathers,

1057
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,600
 very bad husbands.

1058
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:11,880
 I have only seen bad examples.

1059
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:15,560
 And I look at my 11-week-old son,

1060
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:19,960
 and I pray, God, please let the legacy

1061
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:23,320
 of bad fathers die with me.

1062
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:28,960
 And please let him see an example of a father

1063
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,200
 or of a husband who loves his wife,

1064
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,800
 who's not going anywhere, who's not abusive.

1065
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:37,480
 And I've never seen that example in person, God,

1066
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,400
 so I need your help.

1067
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,680
 You're my only hope.

1068
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:43,200
 And he's your only hope.

1069
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,960
 He's your future marriage's only hope.

1070
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,360
 He's our world's only hope.

1071
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,120
 And he's a God that if you and I will surrender to him,

1072
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:56,120
 we'll lead you to what you never even hoped was possible.

1073
00:41:56,120 --> 00:42:00,760
 We surrender and step into the best advice

1074
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:01,600
 you'll ever receive.

1075
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:02,440
 Let me pray that we would.

1076
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,360
 Father, thank you.

1077
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:08,760
 You give us the perfect example of a good father,

1078
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:09,840
 that you love us.

1079
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:13,920
 And if we'll just surrender to you, you will lead us

1080
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:17,240
 into the type of relationship with you

1081
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:20,080
 we've always wanted, into the relationship with a spouse.

1082
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,400
 If that's a part of your plan for us,

1083
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,960
 we've always wanted, will you help us?

1084
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,760
 Father, I pray that my son would see that.

1085
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,480
 I pray that the men and women in the room

1086
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:32,280
 who share a story of a painful parenting

1087
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:34,360
 that they experienced growing up,

1088
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:37,080
 that you would reparent them and they would provide

1089
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:39,920
 for their children should you give them them.

1090
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:43,360
 A legacy of what a husband and wife committed

1091
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:45,400
 to one another looks like,

1092
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,840
 which is ultimately a marriage,

1093
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:51,520
 which is ultimately a metaphor for how you love us.

1094
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:55,080
 We worship now you because you loved us first

1095
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,840
 and we respond to you in that love.

1096
00:42:56,840 --> 00:43:02,040
 If you don't have a relationship

1097
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:05,360
 with that God that we just sang to,

1098
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:08,600
 and you can't say that I actually trust you, Lord,

1099
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,720
 with my life, both this life,

1100
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,760
 and I trust you with my eternal life,

1101
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,880
 the best relationship advice that you can get tonight

1102
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:20,040
 has nothing to do with dating or when to get engaged,

1103
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:23,400
 and has everything to do with the only relationship

1104
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:26,600
 that in the end matters, which is Jesus

1105
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:28,920
 and your Lord and Savior and knowing him,

1106
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:32,440
 and stepping into that relationship with the God

1107
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:35,920
 who loves you, who's already reaching out to you,

1108
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:38,640
 and has already proved he loves you

1109
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:41,380
 by dying on a cross for you.

1110
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:44,720
 Will you accept that free gift

1111
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:48,360
 and place all of your trust for this life and the next

1112
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:51,320
 on him and not on you and what you've done?

1113
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:56,000
 Regardless of how good your past is or how bad your past is,

1114
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,840
 if you think that God either could not love you

1115
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:02,040
 because of what you've done,

1116
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:05,360
 or will accept and love you because of what you've done,

1117
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:09,160
 you've put your trust in the wrong person.

1118
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
 And the person that will ultimately let you down,

1119
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,720
 there is only one way the scriptures teach us,

1120
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:19,960
 and it's through Jesus and accepting that free gift,

1121
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,160
 not because of anything I've done,

1122
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:22,400
 but what he did on the cross.

1123
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,560
 It's the best relationship advice that you can get tonight.

1124
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:28,880
 If you're walking through, we know sexual sin,

1125
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:31,040
 and even that discussion brings up all kinds of pain

1126
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,600
 from people's pasts.

1127
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:33,800
 We'll have an entire team down here.

1128
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:36,420
 We'd love to pray with you, come alongside you,

1129
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:38,760
 not because we are any better.

1130
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,800
 Frankly, all of us probably have some form

1131
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,280
 of whatever you've struggled with,

1132
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:44,520
 are struggling with, or have done in your past.

1133
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:46,080
 All of us down here could probably share and be like,

1134
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:46,900
 yeah, me too.

1135
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:49,160
 Let's pray, thank you, Jesus, for grace.

1136
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:54,120
 And we're not gonna be surprised, I promise you.

1137
00:44:54,120 --> 00:45:04,120
