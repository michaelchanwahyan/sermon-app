1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (gentle music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:15,000
 - All right, how we doing Dallas?

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,160
 (audience cheering)

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,680
 Man, he is pumped tonight.

5
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,120
 I love that, I love that.

6
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,560
 Well, welcome everybody,

7
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,300
 Dallas and Fort Worth and streaming online.

8
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:23,240
 My name's Adam Tarnow.

9
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,980
 Excited to be here with you guys tonight.

10
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:26,520
 Start off with a little question.

11
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,800
 How many of you guys like watching those videos

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,120
 or reading those articles about life hacks?

13
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,360
 Any life hack fans out here?

14
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,620
 A few of you guys, life hacks.

15
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,600
 So these are these videos.

16
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,680
 They're super popular on YouTube right now.

17
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:41,000
 In fact, I typed in the other day on YouTube,

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 10 best life hacks, 36.3 million videos popped up.

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,800
 All right, so these are these videos

20
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:52,320
 that show you simple solutions to everyday problems

21
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,160
 that you might have.

22
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,420
 And so some of the popular videos

23
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,240
 that are out there right now

24
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,960
 with some of the highest views on YouTube,

25
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,520
 10 life hacks that every college student should know.

26
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,460
 It's got 30 million views on that

27
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,120
 for our college student friends in the room.

28
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,740
 The number one life hack video out there, ladies,

29
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:08,080
 this is free advice.

30
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,240
 It's called the DIY makeup life hacks.

31
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,760
 54 million views out there on that.

32
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,600
 I like these things.

33
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,420
 I watch these videos.

34
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:16,260
 I don't watch the makeup one,

35
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,660
 but I've watched some of the other ones.

36
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,520
 And I got some pictures too,

37
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,720
 'cause some of these, you'll see these life hacks

38
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,600
 in like in articles or something like that.

39
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,860
 And so here's like one of the first one.

40
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,620
 This is a good example of a life hack

41
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,260
 is if you got a strawberry

42
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:32,140
 and you wanna know how to get that little stem off the top,

43
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:36,040
 because God forbid we ever use a knife for that, right?

44
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,060
 That's way too much work to do that.

45
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:39,600
 So you just stick a straw through there.

46
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,200
 Guys, here's another one that's super helpful for you.

47
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,040
 I don't know you,

48
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,240
 but I'm willing to bet your bathroom is disgusting.

49
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,840
 And so that one right there would help you.

50
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,400
 How many of us like grilled cheese?

51
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,080
 But who wants to get a skillet out, right?

52
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:01,320
 If it's time to do that, just turn your toaster sideways.

53
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,480
 That's genius right there.

54
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,440
 That's gonna be for some of you, unfortunately,

55
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,080
 that's gonna be the most helpful thing you see

56
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,400
 all night tonight is that.

57
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,240
 And you're like, "Porch, I don't know, man.

58
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,480
 "That grilled cheese thing is awesome."

59
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,520
 Here's one of my favorites, just kind of ridiculous.

60
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,680
 One of these, if you look at this one, this guy.

61
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,160
 (congregation laughing)

62
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,440
 So if you just turn your hoodie around the other way,

63
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,960
 it becomes a horse trough for you

64
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,520
 or something like that, right?

65
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,840
 I think there's some porch hoodies in the back.

66
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,480
 You guys wanna Instagram that next week

67
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,480
 or something to make that the gift

68
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,400
 that you give out or so that.

69
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,600
 So anyway, so these life hacks, I mean, we all love them.

70
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,760
 And the reason we love them is because they're helpful,

71
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,560
 because there are little problems

72
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,040
 that we didn't know that we had,

73
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,720
 like how to eat popcorn and type at the same time.

74
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,160
 We didn't know we had that problem,

75
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,120
 but man, it is great to know

76
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,880
 that there is a solution to those problems.

77
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,000
 And so I start with that tonight,

78
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,440
 because what we're gonna do tonight

79
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,720
 is we're actually gonna look at a biblical life hack.

80
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,600
 We're gonna look at a life hack that is in scripture.

81
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,400
 In fact, one scholar would say

82
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,760
 that the verse that we're gonna look at tonight

83
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,800
 in all of the New Testament, this might be, in his opinion,

84
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,400
 the most helpful verse in the entire New Testament.

85
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,160
 There's over 7,900 verses in the New Testament.

86
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,360
 And one scholar would say this one,

87
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,680
 the one that we're gonna look at tonight

88
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,600
 is the most helpful.

89
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,400
 And the reason it's the most helpful

90
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,880
 is because it helps us with the situation

91
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,960
 that we all face every single day.

92
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,760
 And so we may not all face some of those life hacks

93
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,600
 that we see out there.

94
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,480
 That may not be problems that we're facing every day,

95
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,480
 but I promise you this,

96
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,120
 the one that we're gonna talk about tonight

97
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,400
 is a problem that you and I face every single day.

98
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,200
 And I would go so far as to say this too,

99
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,600
 that if we don't get our arms around this issue

100
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,320
 that we're gonna talk about tonight,

101
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,160
 if we don't get our arms around this issue,

102
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,760
 then this could be the thing that is gonna prevent you and I

103
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,880
 from becoming the person that we wanna be.

104
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,840
 This, if we don't get our arms around this,

105
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,160
 this could be the difference between whether or not

106
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,440
 we become the person we wanna become,

107
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,000
 or if we fast forward 20, 30, 40 years,

108
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,600
 we're just a shadow,

109
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,080
 just a shadow of the person that we wanna become today.

110
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:09,120
 And so tonight is going to be an incredibly helpful night

111
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,320
 looking at a life hack that will help us

112
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,320
 in all of these different,

113
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,040
 or specifically in one situation

114
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,480
 that all of us face every single day.

115
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,680
 And that situation is this,

116
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,480
 the situation is temptation.

117
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,120
 And what I mean when I say temptation is this,

118
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,600
 it's all these little decisions

119
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,280
 that you and I have to make every day

120
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,520
 as to whether or not we're gonna do something

121
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,640
 that is going to please God or not please God.

122
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,880
 It's all these decisions we have to make every day

123
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,440
 to sin or not to sin,

124
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,800
 making decisions every day,

125
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,120
 we're faced with a multiple times a day,

126
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,640
 these decisions to do what God says is best,

127
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,920
 or go our own way and do something that we think is best.

128
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,480
 And so every single one of us in the room tonight,

129
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:52,800
 we all face temptation and we face it multiple times a day.

130
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,520
 And so what we're gonna see tonight

131
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,280
 is we're gonna see a hack.

132
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,880
 We're gonna see a way that we can handle this

133
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,440
 so that we can get our arms around this.

134
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,720
 What is a way that we should think about temptation

135
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,760
 that is gonna be incredibly helpful for us?

136
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,960
 And so tonight too, I know in a room this size

137
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,880
 that not everybody in here tonight

138
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,680
 would probably claim to be a follower of Jesus Christ

139
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,440
 or call themselves a Christian.

140
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,800
 And so if you're in the room tonight

141
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,600
 and that's not you, you wouldn't call yourself a Christian,

142
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,880
 you wouldn't call yourself a follower of Jesus.

143
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,720
 You're just trying to figure out who Jesus is

144
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,360
 or you're trying to figure out who God is.

145
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,920
 And you're just here because a friend invited you

146
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,440
 or you're here because a coworker invited you.

147
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,280
 I just wanna let you know

148
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,840
 that a lot of what I'm gonna talk about tonight,

149
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,000
 I'm actually not gonna be talking to you.

150
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,640
 I'm actually gonna be talking to Christians.

151
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,400
 And so tonight what you get to do

152
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,120
 is I think you're still gonna learn something,

153
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:41,960
 but what you get to do

154
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,360
 is you get to watch all the Christians squirm, right?

155
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,400
 So you can just sit there

156
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,560
 and watch them and I think if you listen,

157
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,760
 you're gonna learn a couple of things

158
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,040
 and there may be some stuff that's in there that's helpful.

159
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,160
 But tonight we're primarily

160
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,560
 going to be talking to Christians

161
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,080
 because the letter that we're gonna read from

162
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,000
 was written to Christians.

163
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 It was written to Christians

164
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,440
 in a specific situation that they were facing.

165
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,280
 So if you got your Bibles,

166
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,600
 let's open up to 1 Corinthians 10.

167
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,160
 That's where we're gonna be tonight.

168
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,920
 It's just gonna be one verse that we'll be in tonight,

169
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,080
 but it's got three sentences

170
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,640
 and there's a lot packed in there.

171
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,920
 And so it's gonna be worth it for us

172
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,360
 just to kind of camp out

173
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,720
 in this one verse tonight.

174
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,280
 And so 1 Corinthians 10,

175
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,800
 specifically we're gonna look at verse 13.

176
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,200
 And so let me just set up the context a little bit

177
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,040
 for this verse.

178
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,840
 So Paul, the apostle Paul,

179
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,120
 this guy, the apostle Paul,

180
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,280
 he had planted this church

181
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,320
 or helped start this church

182
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,640
 in this ancient city of Corinth.

183
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,760
 And then he was out planting other churches.

184
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,320
 And as he was out planting other churches,

185
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,760
 he heard some news

186
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,040
 about some things that were going on

187
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,720
 in this church in Corinth.

188
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,120
 And so Paul wanted to address some things that he had heard.

189
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,600
 He wanted to answer some questions.

190
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,120
 And so he did what you did in the first century

191
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,480
 when you wanted to communicate with somebody

192
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,760
 and you weren't in the same town,

193
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,840
 he wrote a letter.

194
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,960
 And so this is his first letter

195
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,560
 that he wrote to the church in Corinth.

196
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,240
 We call it 1 Corinthians.

197
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,880
 That's the way it is in our New Testament.

198
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,320
 And so here's what was going on.

199
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,680
 There were a lot of things going on

200
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,000
 in that particular city

201
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,080
 and that church was dealing with.

202
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,320
 But the situation right now

203
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,320
 or one of the situations that we know

204
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,400
 that they were dealing with is this,

205
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,560
 is that the church in Corinth

206
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,840
 had started to get a little bit arrogant.

207
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,880
 They had started to become a little bit lax.

208
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,480
 They had started to become a little bit lax

209
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,760
 in their relationship with sin.

210
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,840
 They started to think that maybe sin

211
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,040
 wasn't a big deal to them

212
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:22,000
 or sin just wasn't a big deal in general.

213
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,240
 And so their attitudes and their relationship with sin

214
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,240
 had started to kind of wane a little bit.

215
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,360
 And Paul caught wind of this.

216
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,200
 And he, in chapter 10,

217
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,480
 as he's writing about a whole bunch of things

218
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,200
 and he gets to chapter 10 and he's reminding them,

219
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,000
 hey, don't be arrogant.

220
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,840
 Don't be arrogant.

221
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,960
 Don't think that you can just automatically stand in sin

222
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,680
 or have this very lax attitude towards sin.

223
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,000
 And then what he does in chapter 10 is he goes back

224
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,840
 and he shares stories from their Old Testament,

225
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,920
 from our Old Testament about the Israelites.

226
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,200
 And he shares stories with them and say,

227
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:57,200
 hey, remember they too one time were lax and arrogant

228
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,400
 in their relationship with sin.

229
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,800
 And we remember what God did to them.

230
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,280
 And we remember the judgment that was there.

231
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,680
 And we remember the destruction

232
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,920
 that their sin brought into them.

233
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,280
 And we remember that God,

234
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,080
 God didn't want them to become arrogant

235
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,160
 or be lax in their relationship with sin.

236
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,440
 And that those stories are preserved as a warning for you

237
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,000
 and preserved as a warning for us.

238
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,080
 And so he was encouraging them to not be arrogant.

239
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,960
 And that's where we get to this verse.

240
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,240
 So after he is saying, hey, remember,

241
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,600
 remember God, he's gonna deal with this.

242
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,560
 Don't be arrogant.

243
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,600
 Don't be lax in your relationship with sin.

244
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,400
 And here's what he says in verse 13.

245
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,200
 He reminds them this,

246
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,520
 that no temptation has overtaken you

247
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,520
 except what is common to mankind.

248
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,360
 And God is faithful.

249
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,040
 He will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear.

250
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,640
 But when you are tempted,

251
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:52,640
 he will also provide a way out so that you can endure it.

252
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,520
 And so the first point I wanna make tonight

253
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,560
 from this verse is this,

254
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,200
 it's in this first part of this verse,

255
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,440
 that no temptation has overtaken you

256
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,160
 except what's common to mankind.

257
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,420
 And so the first point is that temptation is unavoidable.

258
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:09,400
 For every single one of us, temptation is unavoidable.

259
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,200
 So what this means for our life is this guys,

260
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,860
 it means that every single day,

261
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,600
 every single day when we wake up,

262
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,720
 every single one of us,

263
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,760
 we are on the very edge of doing something

264
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,720
 that is gonna bring about a tremendous amount of destruction

265
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,560
 into our life.

266
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,320
 Every single one of us, every day,

267
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,840
 we are at the edge of almost ruining our life all the time.

268
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,840
 It's unavoidable.

269
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,580
 Temptation, these decisions that we have

270
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,920
 to either go our way or trust God

271
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,440
 to do what we think is right

272
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,720
 or do what we know that God wants us to do,

273
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,400
 those situations and those choices,

274
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,080
 we have to make those every day.

275
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,920
 And every day, our heart is gonna be tempted

276
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,380
 to go our own way, to turn our back on God.

277
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:53,440
 And that temptation is unavoidable.

278
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,360
 And so what that means for you and I is this,

279
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,180
 is that every day we are one click away,

280
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,980
 one click away from bringing ruin

281
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,480
 and destruction into our life.

282
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,800
 Every single day, you and I,

283
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,520
 we are one decision away from doing something

284
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,320
 that we're gonna regret for a long time.

285
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,840
 Every single one of us, every day,

286
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,560
 we're one financial transaction away

287
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,840
 from bringing destruction.

288
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,640
 We're one choice away from bringing destruction.

289
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,600
 We're one text message away, one phone call away,

290
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,040
 one email away.

291
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,380
 Every day, we're at this very edge

292
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:30,680
 of bringing ruin and destruction into our life.

293
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:34,240
 And it's always going to be this way.

294
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,680
 It's unavoidable.

295
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,800
 There is no temptation that's overtaken us

296
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,080
 except what is common to man.

297
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,640
 And so what this means is this,

298
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,580
 like we have this battle,

299
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,840
 this battle that's raging every day.

300
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,780
 And what's discouraging to so many of us

301
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:48,740
 so many times is this,

302
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:51,320
 is that even if we made a good choice today,

303
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,880
 that doesn't guarantee

304
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,040
 and mean that we're gonna make a good choice tomorrow.

305
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:59,720
 And the opposite of that is also true, which is hopeful.

306
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,580
 That even if we made a poor choice today,

307
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,600
 that doesn't mean that we're destined

308
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,560
 to make a poor choice tomorrow.

309
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,440
 So here's the way that this is kind of invading my life.

310
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,960
 So when I was in high school,

311
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,720
 I was a senior in high school.

312
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,440
 I was playing baseball at the time.

313
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,920
 That was kind of the sport I played

314
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,960
 there at the end of baseball

315
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,040
 or at the end of my high school time.

316
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,580
 And so I did what a lot of 18 year olds did

317
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,340
 when they played baseball at the time,

318
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,480
 is that when I was not playing

319
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,960
 and I was sitting on the bench,

320
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:29,560
 I had a friend that introduced me to tobacco,

321
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,360
 to smokeless tobacco, to dip or snuff,

322
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,200
 whatever you guys call it.

323
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:36,080
 Specifically, it was the Royal Blue can of Skull Mints.

324
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,040
 And I put that into my mouth.

325
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,240
 And I know some of you guys have tried that before

326
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,680
 and you have horror stories about how it made you throw up.

327
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,760
 And so you never, ever wanted to try

328
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,400
 smokeless tobacco ever again.

329
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,580
 That was not my story.

330
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:50,480
 I put it in my mouth and I fell in love.

331
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,960
 I was like, this, this is amazing.

332
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,200
 This makes me feel good.

333
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,040
 My spit turns all these different colors.

334
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,200
 I feel like a man.

335
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,680
 Like this is awesome.

336
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,700
 And so I fell in love with it.

337
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,280
 So all throughout my senior year

338
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,280
 and then all throughout my four years of college,

339
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,200
 one of my favorite things to do in college

340
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,040
 was to dip tobacco.

341
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,560
 And so I would go to lunch.

342
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,200
 I always did my classes in the morning.

343
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,380
 I'd go to lunch and I'd have my afternoons off.

344
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,320
 And I would like, right after lunch,

345
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,640
 I'd go up to my dorm room.

346
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,760
 I'd put a big old thing, a dip right there in my lip.

347
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,920
 And I played video games for hours

348
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,720
 because I was a man, right?

349
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,340
 And it felt so powerful.

350
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:33,100
 And I loved every moment of it.

351
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,340
 Well, then I become a Christian

352
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,580
 and then I start to learn that,

353
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:39,140
 hey, this stuff actually like maybe causes cancer.

354
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:41,540
 I have some friends that start to have some mouth surgery

355
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,940
 because they were dipping tobacco.

356
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,180
 And I'm like, okay, I'm starting to learn

357
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:47,020
 about how God has given me the gift of health

358
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,260
 and I need to steward this body.

359
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:51,260
 And so I make a decision that I'm not gonna dip tobacco.

360
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:53,020
 And so I can stand up here today

361
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,500
 and I can tell you, I haven't dipped tobacco

362
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,340
 for over 20 years.

363
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:58,440
 I have not done that for over 20 years.

364
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,440
 Hey, before, hey, listen to the rest of the story.

365
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,280
 It's not impressive.

366
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,800
 Okay, so, but here's the deal.

367
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,160
 So it's been 20 years, 20 years.

368
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,240
 But just the other day after a basketball game,

369
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,920
 I go to QT to buy my kids a Slurpee.

370
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,560
 And I'm sitting there and I'm paying for these Slurpees

371
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,120
 and I see my harlot back there, right?

372
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,880
 I see Skull Mint.

373
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,380
 And guys, I'm like in a heartbeat.

374
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:26,760
 I would love, I would love nothing more

375
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,800
 to put you in my mouth and play video games right now.

376
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,640
 Right?

377
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,160
 What's crazy to me, and guess what?

378
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,800
 It wasn't just a couple of weeks ago.

379
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,640
 Every time over the past 20 years

380
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:40,080
 that I walk into QT or 7-Eleven or Walmart

381
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:43,340
 or Walgreens or CVS, any place that sells

382
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:46,420
 this amazing tobacco, any place I walk into,

383
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:48,120
 my heart starts to leap and I go,

384
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,000
 man, I would love to have that again.

385
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,640
 It's been 20 years.

386
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,860
 I so bad just wanna go, you know what?

387
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,100
 That battle's done.

388
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,260
 I got a lot of other things that I'm battling in life.

389
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:02,500
 I so bad, I wish I could sit here and tell you

390
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,220
 that my addiction to nicotine was something in the past,

391
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,940
 but it's not something in the past.

392
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:09,420
 Every day I'm at the edge.

393
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,500
 Every day I'm at the edge

394
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,300
 of giving into that temptation again.

395
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:16,540
 And that's just one of like dozens and dozens

396
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,580
 of things in my life.

397
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:21,020
 Every day I'm at the edge of giving in

398
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,540
 or this battle with lust.

399
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:25,500
 Every day I'm at the edge with my battle with greed.

400
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,380
 Every day I have to make all these choices

401
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,980
 on am I gonna love people or am I gonna be selfish?

402
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:33,460
 Every day is a battle of am I gonna be joyful

403
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:34,540
 or am I gonna be depressed?

404
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,980
 Every day is a battle with,

405
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:38,500
 am I gonna just listen to these thoughts

406
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,960
 that get stuck in my head and be anxious about the future

407
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,340
 or am I gonna trust the Lord?

408
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:47,340
 Every single day is a battle because sin is unavoidable.

409
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:52,340
 But the other thing that we get out of this first part

410
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:54,980
 of this is that not only is every day a battle,

411
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:57,900
 but what we need to remember is that nobody is unique.

412
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:00,780
 Nobody's unique.

413
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:04,740
 Not only to every single one of us are we facing this,

414
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:07,420
 these temptation and these choices every day,

415
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,300
 we're not unique in that battle.

416
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:12,700
 I know for me and my shame, when I've made poor choices,

417
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,340
 when I've been selfish, when I've been greedy,

418
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:18,160
 when I've been lustful, when I've made those choices,

419
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,980
 I wanna wake up the next day or I wanna,

420
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,460
 the feeling that I have a few minutes

421
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:23,980
 after I've made that bad choice in my depravity,

422
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,700
 in my darkness, I just think I'm alone.

423
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,900
 I think I'm the only person who struggles.

424
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,060
 I wanna hide that sin.

425
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:31,220
 I don't wanna go tell somebody about that sin

426
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,840
 because I believe that the temptations

427
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,760
 that I face are unique.

428
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:39,820
 And what Paul's reminding us of here

429
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,560
 is that nobody's unique.

430
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:46,000
 There's no such thing as being terminally unique.

431
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,180
 Nobody is unique.

432
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,180
 So I don't know what your temptation is,

433
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:53,900
 what choices you face every day.

434
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,260
 I don't know if it has to do with sex or anxiety

435
00:15:56,260 --> 00:16:01,180
 or depression or body image or lust or alcohol or greed

436
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:03,780
 or selfishness or lying or people pleasing.

437
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:05,020
 I don't know what it is.

438
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,700
 It could be some things on that list.

439
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,520
 Could be everything on that list.

440
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:12,500
 What I wanna remind you of is you're not alone.

441
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:16,000
 You're not the only person who battled those things today.

442
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,660
 There not only were people in the state that battled it,

443
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,940
 there were people in California that battled that today,

444
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,180
 people in Georgia that battled that today,

445
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:27,380
 people in Indiana that battled that today.

446
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,720
 There were people down in Mexico that battled that today,

447
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,020
 people down in Brazil that battled that today.

448
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:35,660
 There were our friends over in China that battled that today.

449
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:38,300
 And not only around the world today

450
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,420
 were there people that battled

451
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:42,320
 and struggled with those temptations,

452
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,480
 there were people back in 1980 that struggled with that,

453
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,920
 people back in 1970 that struggled with that,

454
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,020
 people back in 1880 that struggled with that

455
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:52,000
 and so on and so on and so on.

456
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,720
 Nobody is unique.

457
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,580
 Temptation is unavoidable.

458
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:01,120
 It is a battle that we face every single day

459
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,140
 and we all struggle with it.

460
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:05,420
 So you're not alone.

461
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,100
 You're not alone.

462
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,700
 Even the person sitting next to you

463
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:11,380
 had the exact same struggles you did.

464
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:14,360
 So I don't, again, I don't know,

465
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,800
 those of you that are here tonight,

466
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,140
 maybe it's your first time.

467
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,640
 Or you're here tonight exploring God.

468
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,800
 I don't know what your friends told you

469
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,100
 to get you to come into this room.

470
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,560
 I don't know if it's your first time here tonight.

471
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,260
 I don't know what you think about what's going on in here

472
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,480
 and how loudly we sing.

473
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,180
 I don't know if for you that's the first time

474
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:34,340
 you've ever heard sober people sing that loudly.

475
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:37,160
 And you're just looking around

476
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,980
 and you're just trying to figure out who these people are

477
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:42,460
 that are your age, seem to kind of be just like you,

478
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,160
 but maybe you're sitting there going,

479
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,720
 oh, these people seem really happy.

480
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,880
 I don't know why they're happy.

481
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,400
 I don't know why there's a lot of side hugging

482
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,760
 going on right now.

483
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,920
 I don't know.

484
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,720
 Everybody just seems to have it put together

485
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,880
 and maybe you're starting to feel a little bit of shame.

486
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,280
 Like, I don't know if I fit here.

487
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,600
 I think everybody in this room is just good.

488
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,800
 Let me just remind you of something,

489
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,040
 that who you have in this room right now,

490
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,080
 this room is not full of good people.

491
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:09,280
 We don't sit here and we don't raise our hands

492
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,640
 and sing about this amazing name of Jesus

493
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,460
 and have these smiles on our faces

494
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,800
 and hug and love one another.

495
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,720
 We do not do that because we've never made bad choices.

496
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,840
 We make bad choices all the time.

497
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,800
 The reason we can come in here and sing

498
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,480
 and the reason we can laugh and the reason we can smile

499
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,200
 and the reason we can love one another

500
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,480
 is not because we're good.

501
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,480
 The reason we can do that is because we have a savior

502
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,320
 who is good.

503
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,320
 You are not surrounded by good people.

504
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,680
 In fact, like take this opportunity,

505
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,480
 make sure your wallet is still there.

506
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,160
 Ladies, if you wanna check your purses,

507
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,440
 make sure they're still there

508
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,740
 'cause there are some criminals in this room, right?

509
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:47,840
 Some bad people who are in this room.

510
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,360
 But get this, get this.

511
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,960
 We sing not because we're good.

512
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,240
 This is the porch, it is not a museum for awesome people.

513
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,280
 This is a hospital full of sick people

514
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:01,280
 who have found the healer and their savior, Jesus Christ.

515
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,600
 This is a room full of people

516
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,400
 who understand that they're sinners.

517
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,120
 But sometimes they make those choices

518
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,160
 and they choose poorly

519
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,720
 and they're not just mistakes, they're sins.

520
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,900
 But the reason we can sing is not because we're good.

521
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:16,080
 The reason we can sing is because our savior is good.

522
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,300
 The reason we can sing is because we're forgiven.

523
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,600
 We're forgiven and we know that we have hope

524
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,960
 in the midst of temptation.

525
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,240
 And so nobody, nobody ever faces temptation

526
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,840
 or temptation is unavoidable for all of us.

527
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,040
 Let's move on, let's look at the next one.

528
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,640
 So he says, "No temptation has overtaken you

529
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,560
 except what is common to man."

530
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,800
 And then here's where the second part of the verse,

531
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,560
 "And God is faithful.

532
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:42,840
 He will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear."

533
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,180
 And so the second point that I wanna make tonight

534
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:46,160
 out of this passage is this,

535
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,760
 is that no temptation is unbearable.

536
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,160
 No temptation is unbearable.

537
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,520
 I don't know what this is gonna be like to you,

538
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,400
 but this is amazing to me to think about this,

539
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,400
 to think about the implications of this truth.

540
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,760
 I mean, that means that any choice that you and I face

541
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:05,120
 in these choices, none of them are an automatic failure.

542
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,640
 Any choice that we face and we face every day,

543
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,000
 this temptation that we face,

544
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,720
 none of those situations are so unbearable

545
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:16,680
 that the cards were stacked against us that we have to sin.

546
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:22,400
 None of these choices that we make are automatic failures.

547
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,560
 And so here's the way this is kind of invading

548
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,000
 the Tarno household right now.

549
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,120
 I mean, this is a very real conversation

550
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,200
 that we're having in my house right now.

551
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,840
 In fact, as early as Sunday night, last night, even today,

552
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:33,960
 again, we were talking about it.

553
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,920
 And so I've got an eight-year-old and a kindergartner,

554
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,720
 my eight-year-old named Jake,

555
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,880
 they both go to the school in the neighborhood.

556
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,960
 We live up in Richardson.

557
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:45,720
 And so the second grade year, Jake, the second grader,

558
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:49,020
 we are in this phase of shepherding and parenting right now

559
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:51,080
 where Jake is starting to come home

560
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,680
 and repeating certain words

561
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,960
 that he has been hearing at school, okay?

562
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,880
 And so over the past two or three weeks,

563
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,560
 it seems like every day there's a new word.

564
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,480
 He comes home, "Hey, dad, hey, dad, what's the H word?

565
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,360
 "Hey, dad, hey, dad, what's the B word?

566
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,640
 "Hey, dad, what's the A word?

567
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,940
 "Hey, dad, I heard the S word, what's the S word?

568
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:09,440
 "Hey, dad, what's the F word?

569
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,220
 "All right, you know.

570
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,480
 "Hey, dad, what's the R word?

571
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,780
 "R, I think somebody's lying to you there.

572
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,520
 "I don't think there is an R word," right?

573
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,480
 So all these words are coming up

574
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,060
 and he's learning all of these things

575
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:23,460
 and we're trying to talk him through all of this.

576
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:26,920
 And so here's what my son has been doing

577
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:31,140
 is he knows that he himself should not say these things.

578
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:32,300
 He knows it's a heart issue,

579
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,760
 it indicates what's going on in his heart,

580
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,240
 we're trying to talk to him through all that.

581
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,040
 But what he has had fun doing lately

582
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:40,380
 is trying to get other people to say these words.

583
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:43,180
 So he'll do things like this,

584
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,880
 he'll go to his friends and kind of be like,

585
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,420
 hey, what rhymes with bell but starts with H?

586
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:52,080
 And he's trying to, and then if his friends say the word,

587
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,380
 he goes and tells on them.

588
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:58,800
 So bad, right?

589
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:02,500
 He's grounded right now because he did that this weekend.

590
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:07,500
 And so this weekend, we were playing Scrabble Jr.,

591
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,760
 playing Scrabble Jr.

592
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,340
 I think you guys can see where this is going.

593
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:14,980
 And I'm watching him over across the table

594
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:19,140
 and I noticed he's got three tiles turned upside down.

595
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,380
 And then he's got four tiles that he's trying to work with.

596
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:23,880
 And he keeps asking, "Who has a K?

597
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,320
 "Who has a K?"

598
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,620
 And I'm like, oh, he's just trying to spell duck

599
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:28,180
 right there on the board.

600
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,180
 That's an actual word in Scrabble Jr., look it up.

601
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:33,100
 And so finally, like towards the end,

602
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,600
 he pulls, he goes, "Yes, I got a K."

603
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,800
 And he turned over that tile, those four,

604
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,200
 and he looks at his brother and he goes,

605
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,300
 "Joshua, turn these over."

606
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:47,300
 And I'm like, no, no, no, Joshua, do not turn those over.

607
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:50,540
 Do not do that right now, don't.

608
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:53,040
 And I mean, like, it's just his mind, he's got these words.

609
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,720
 I mean, last night, right before he went to bed,

610
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,040
 he was like, "Dad, did you know,

611
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,820
 "we've got some friends with the last name Schmidt."

612
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:01,720
 He's like, "Do you know that if you take the word Schmidt,

613
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,120
 "if you take the M out, it's the S word."

614
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,920
 And I'm like, son, I've been alive for almost 42 years,

615
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,460
 and I've never thought of that.

616
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,860
 [congregation laughing]

617
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:13,100
 But technically, you're right.

618
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,140
 If you take that M out, it's the S word.

619
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,600
 Don't say that, okay?

620
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:21,500
 And so we're talking to him about this,

621
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,140
 and we're trying to let him see that,

622
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:25,040
 hey, if you get your friends to say it,

623
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,440
 and all these words, and trying to talk to him.

624
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,640
 And here's the part that I think we can all identify with.

625
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,680
 I was telling him Sunday night,

626
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,240
 I'm like, Jake, when you lead your friends

627
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,220
 to say those words, that's just as bad

628
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:38,640
 and just as destructive as saying it.

629
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,060
 And he just looked at me, and he just goes,

630
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:42,020
 I can't help it.

631
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:44,320
 These words are just in my mind,

632
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,160
 and I just have to say them.

633
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:50,460
 And there's a part of me that's like, I get that.

634
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:54,500
 I think if we're honest, all of us would say we get that.

635
00:23:55,900 --> 00:24:00,160
 That's the way it feels so often with these choices

636
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,000
 that we're facing every single day.

637
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,640
 And this is the way that so many of us approach temptation.

638
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,940
 We just feel like we're gonna fail.

639
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:09,240
 Like I can't help it.

640
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,780
 These ideas are just in my mind.

641
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,440
 The only thing I know how to do

642
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,440
 is to give in to these impulses.

643
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:17,620
 And so I'm just like, I've always struggled with lust.

644
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:19,320
 I'm always gonna struggle with it.

645
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:22,460
 You know, Adam, I can't go 10 days

646
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:26,360
 without looking at pornography, let alone 10 years.

647
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,460
 This is just who I am.

648
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,920
 This is just what I'm gonna struggle with.

649
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,760
 You know what, Adam?

650
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:34,060
 I've been struggling with anxiety since I was nine.

651
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:36,600
 It's just a part of who I am.

652
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,860
 It's just a part of who I am.

653
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:40,200
 And I would just say,

654
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,840
 that's not what scripture tells us.

655
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:47,680
 God is faithful.

656
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:52,240
 He's faithful, and he will not let you,

657
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,780
 not let me, not let Jake, not let Joshua,

658
00:24:55,780 --> 00:25:00,460
 not let anybody be tempted beyond what they can bear.

659
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:04,000
 Some of us have seen these commercials for pickup trucks,

660
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,220
 seen commercials for pickup trucks.

661
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:06,560
 Pickup trucks have these classes.

662
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,800
 There's a one ton, a two ton, a three ton pickup truck.

663
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,440
 And what that means, a one ton pickup truck

664
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,900
 means that that truck was designed

665
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:15,480
 to have a payload or a towing capacity of one ton,

666
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,080
 meaning you can put one ton of materials in that truck

667
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,720
 and that truck will be able to function normally and safely.

668
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,380
 But if you put two tons in a one ton truck,

669
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:26,280
 it won't be able to function normally.

670
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:29,660
 And so basically what Paul is telling us

671
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:32,760
 is that we're kind of similar to pickup trucks.

672
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,020
 God knows if we're a one ton, a two ton,

673
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:36,100
 or a three ton pickup truck,

674
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:38,800
 he knows how much you and I can bear

675
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,660
 and still function within his will

676
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,600
 and still make the right choices.

677
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,600
 And so what Jake is doing when I tell him,

678
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,540
 "No, no, no, listen, you're not defeated.

679
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:51,180
 You're not defeated.

680
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:52,500
 God is faithful.

681
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,080
 Jake, he will not let you be tempted

682
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,340
 beyond what you can bear."

683
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,840
 What Jake is learning as a little eight year old

684
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,580
 is what a lot of us in this room have learned.

685
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:01,320
 He's learning to exercise a muscle

686
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:04,520
 that he's gonna have to use for the rest of his life.

687
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:07,920
 And that muscle is resisting temptation.

688
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,320
 And understanding that you're not overwhelmed with this.

689
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,820
 It's not, you're not just guaranteed to lose.

690
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:18,160
 He's faithful.

691
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,740
 He's there, it's not unbearable.

692
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:23,640
 And so this is comforting to us as we face our choices.

693
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,000
 But it's also sobering guys,

694
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,940
 because here's what this means.

695
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:30,320
 This means that none of us,

696
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,020
 none of us can ever pass the blame.

697
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:35,820
 You can't pass the blame to anyone.

698
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:41,620
 If you're not forced to sin, if it's not unbearable,

699
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:43,460
 if temptation is not unbearable,

700
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:44,960
 then what that means is that you and I,

701
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,360
 we can't blame the culture.

702
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:49,100
 We can't blame our friends.

703
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,620
 We can't blame our parents.

704
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:54,100
 We can't blame the way that people dress.

705
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:55,860
 We can't blame the way that people act.

706
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:58,140
 We can't blame our friends that are just,

707
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:00,000
 that's the way they are and this is what we do.

708
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,540
 You cannot blame anybody for your choices.

709
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:06,540
 What that means for you and I

710
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:09,380
 is that every time we choose to do something

711
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:11,480
 that's contrary to God's best for our life,

712
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,520
 that's our choice.

713
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,660
 That's our choice.

714
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:17,680
 We weren't forced to do anything.

715
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,620
 So temptation is unavoidable for all of us,

716
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:22,320
 but no temptation is unbearable for any of us.

717
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,760
 It's not unbearable.

718
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,760
 And let's look at this last point that he makes here.

719
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,060
 But when you are tempted,

720
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:29,160
 so no temptation's overtaking you

721
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,400
 except what's common to man.

722
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,840
 God is faithful.

723
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,100
 He not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear.

724
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,440
 And in this last part of verse 13,

725
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:37,300
 he says this, but when you are tempted,

726
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:39,800
 not if, when.

727
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:43,040
 But when you are tempted,

728
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:46,280
 and look at this, this is the life hack.

729
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:49,420
 He will also provide a way out

730
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:52,060
 so that you can endure.

731
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:56,500
 So we see that temptation is unavoidable

732
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,720
 and that no temptation is unbearable.

733
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,800
 And the third point I wanna make

734
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,160
 from this passage tonight is this,

735
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,000
 is that no temptation is unescapable.

736
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,940
 You're never stuck.

737
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:08,280
 You're never stuck.

738
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,740
 Whatever situation you're facing,

739
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:12,840
 he has given us an amazing promise.

740
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,580
 He's given us an amazing promise.

741
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,520
 And this is what is so helpful for us

742
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,640
 is that whatever temptation we're facing,

743
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,880
 whatever choice that we're facing,

744
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,720
 there is always a way out

745
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,780
 so that we can choose the right path.

746
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:26,020
 There's always a way out

747
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,960
 so that we can choose following him.

748
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:31,660
 We're never, ever, ever stuck.

749
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:33,400
 We're never stuck.

750
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,000
 So let me illustrate it this way.

751
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,760
 Let's say you're sitting in here tonight

752
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:39,100
 and you know that the temptation that you face

753
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:41,840
 or the destructiveness that can come into your life

754
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,300
 a lot of times, let's say you're sitting here tonight,

755
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,400
 it's a Tuesday night,

756
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,700
 and you know that the temptation

757
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,840
 that you struggle with is alcohol.

758
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,180
 Abusing alcohol, giving into that,

759
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:52,520
 you like the way it makes you feel,

760
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,680
 like the way it makes you act,

761
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,940
 but if you really think about it,

762
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:59,160
 alcohol has really been a source of robbing you of life.

763
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,320
 It's brought a lot of shame.

764
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,560
 You've made some choices.

765
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,620
 You've said some things.

766
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:04,220
 You've done some things that you regret.

767
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,860
 You know that your relationship with alcohol

768
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:08,300
 is not healthy right now and you wanna change it.

769
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:09,860
 This is not who you wanna become.

770
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:11,940
 It's something that you wanna change,

771
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:13,400
 but you're struggling.

772
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,640
 So let's say tonight you're hearing this

773
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,840
 and you're going, great.

774
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,040
 I've got this renewed.

775
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:20,140
 I'm gonna fight this temptation against alcohol.

776
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:21,380
 I'm gonna do this differently.

777
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:23,980
 And so Tuesday night, you go home, you're all excited.

778
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:25,620
 Tomorrow, Wednesday, you're still excited.

779
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:26,780
 Thursday, you're still excited.

780
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:28,380
 Friday, you're like, that's it.

781
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:29,620
 This is gonna be a different weekend.

782
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:31,780
 I'm not gonna go to work on Monday feeling bad.

783
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:33,820
 I'm not gonna wake up Sunday regretting what's happening.

784
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:35,460
 I'm not gonna wake up Saturday regretting.

785
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:37,020
 I have a new relationship with alcohol.

786
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:40,200
 So the phone rings on a Friday night and it's your friends.

787
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,540
 It's the same thing.

788
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:43,660
 They're getting ready to do the same thing

789
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:44,940
 that Friday night that they do every Friday night

790
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:46,440
 that you always do with them on Friday night

791
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,900
 is, hey, we're going out to the bars.

792
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,900
 We're gonna go hit two, three, maybe four of them.

793
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,280
 We want you to come along.

794
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,040
 And you're sitting there and you're going, I don't know.

795
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,540
 Like that's gonna be hard, but all right.

796
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:57,280
 No temptation sees me except what's common.

797
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,240
 None of it's unbearable.

798
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,680
 There's always a way out.

799
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,120
 I wanna be with my friends.

800
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,260
 I got nothing else to do on Friday night, so I'm gonna go.

801
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,920
 So you go over there, you meet your friends

802
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,380
 at the first bar.

803
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:08,300
 They sit down, they start ordering drinks.

804
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:12,360
 You are tempted by it, but you order a Dr. Pepper.

805
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,640
 You start drinking the Dr. Pepper.

806
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,860
 It's a lot of fun.

807
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:15,900
 Everybody's excited.

808
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:16,740
 You're in a good mood.

809
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:17,580
 Everybody's laughing.

810
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:18,700
 You're talking about your week.

811
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:21,480
 You're making fun of the Oscars for that whole snafu.

812
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,380
 It's just everybody's light.

813
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:23,840
 You're having a good time, all right?

814
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,980
 So you go through, your friends have two or three drinks.

815
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:28,240
 They're like, all right, we wanna go to the second bar.

816
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,120
 Let's go to the second bar.

817
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,660
 And you're like, well, I made it through the first bar.

818
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,020
 I bet I can make it through the second bar.

819
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:34,420
 And plus I'm having fun hanging out with them.

820
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:37,300
 So now you go the second bar with them.

821
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,520
 They order another round of drinks.

822
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,800
 They won, another round goes down, another round goes down.

823
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,340
 And now, now it's not really as much fun anymore.

824
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,840
 Now they're just getting loud.

825
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,560
 They're getting bold.

826
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,840
 They're talking about what a fool their boss is

827
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,640
 and what they would do if they ran the company

828
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,160
 and whatever business they're gonna start.

829
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:55,020
 So there's a lot of boldness that's starting to come out.

830
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:58,440
 But you just, you keep pounding Dr. Peppers.

831
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,320
 You're feeling good.

832
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,320
 You're like, all right, this is different.

833
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,560
 They get bored with the second bar.

834
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,880
 They're like, we're going to a third bar.

835
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,440
 And you're looking at your watch and you're just like,

836
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,560
 well, I've had 17 Dr. Peppers.

837
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,480
 I'm not sleeping.

838
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:14,120
 These are my friends.

839
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,260
 All right, let's go to the third bar.

840
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:17,320
 So now you go to the third bar, they order more drinks.

841
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,920
 You get another Dr. Pepper.

842
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:22,240
 Now their tune changes a little bit.

843
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,600
 You know, they were happy and then they were bold

844
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,820
 and now they're sad.

845
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:29,200
 They're getting sentimental.

846
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,400
 They're telling you, I love you.

847
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,120
 You're like always my best.

848
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:35,360
 Two of your friends are crying, you know.

849
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:40,200
 One is calling the guy that she's broken up with nine times

850
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,320
 and you know, it was my fault and all that kind of stuff.

851
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:48,160
 But you're still drinking Dr. Peppers.

852
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:52,960
 They want to go to the fourth bar.

853
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,600
 Like, hey, I've been doing fine.

854
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,600
 This is good.

855
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,360
 So you go to the fourth bar.

856
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,800
 They order more drinks.

857
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:04,320
 So they were happy and then they were bold.

858
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,620
 And they were sad and emotional.

859
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:09,000
 At the fourth bar, something happens

860
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,560
 because now they're just angry.

861
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:14,280
 They're angry and now they're angry with you.

862
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:18,920
 They realize that you've been drinking Dr. Peppers all night

863
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,440
 and they're not okay with that.

864
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,440
 They start asking you questions.

865
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,280
 Why are you drinking Dr. Pepper?

866
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,000
 You better than us?

867
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,600
 Are you better than us?

868
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,880
 Like, this is what we do, right?

869
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,720
 We're friends.

870
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,540
 This is what we do.

871
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:32,260
 We go out and we drink and we do this.

872
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:34,000
 And now you're drinking Dr. Pepper.

873
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,520
 Like, why are you messing with what we got?

874
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,080
 So now they're starting to get angry

875
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,280
 and then they get you cornered

876
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,520
 'cause you're sitting in a booth

877
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,080
 and you're over there in the corner

878
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,520
 and they've got you cornered.

879
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:46,640
 And you're wondering, oh no, I don't know.

880
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,560
 I haven't tried.

881
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,200
 I don't know what's gonna happen right now

882
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,400
 because then what happens is they order a pitcher

883
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,920
 and they put it right in front of you.

884
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,360
 Pitcher a beer right in front of you.

885
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,680
 They get a clean glass.

886
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,000
 They set it right in front of you

887
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,120
 and all of them are looking at you and they go, drink.

888
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,800
 You're drinking that.

889
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,040
 You're drinking that.

890
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:07,360
 You're not getting out of this booth until you drink that.

891
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,800
 And it looks like a hopeless situation.

892
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,720
 But God is faithful

893
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:17,560
 and he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear.

894
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:20,560
 And when you are tempted, he will provide a way out.

895
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,360
 There's a way out of that situation.

896
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:25,080
 And the way out of it is to do this.

897
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,960
 You take that glass and you take that pitcher

898
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,520
 and you pour some beer in that glass.

899
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:32,200
 And you say, guys, let's have a toast.

900
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,520
 And you raise that glass and you say,

901
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:36,920
 let's toast to a great night 'cause I'm about to go home.

902
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:40,720
 And you take that glass of beer and you turn

903
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:45,360
 and you throw it as hard as you can against that wall.

904
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:48,160
 And I mean, I want like, there's beer going everywhere

905
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,760
 and there's glass going everywhere.

906
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,440
 And you take that pitcher

907
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,960
 and you smash that against the wall

908
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,720
 because guess what happens when you do that?

909
00:33:55,720 --> 00:34:00,040
 The bouncer's gonna come over and he's gonna rescue you.

910
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:03,480
 And he's gonna take you and throw you out.

911
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:11,600
 And you're gonna call Uber and you're gonna go home.

912
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:14,440
 And you won.

913
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:19,840
 Now let's be honest.

914
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:22,640
 That's a way out.

915
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:29,600
 But that's like a really tiny, tiny door to go through.

916
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:34,960
 There were other ways out that night, right?

917
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,920
 There was a little bit bigger door

918
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,800
 before you walked into the fourth bar.

919
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,800
 The door was a little bit bigger

920
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,640
 before you walked into the third one.

921
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:47,160
 It was a little bit bigger

922
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,600
 before you walked into the second one.

923
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,080
 It was pretty big size

924
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,120
 before you walked into the first bar with them.

925
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:54,680
 But I'm telling you what, the door, the way out,

926
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,320
 the door that was just massive

927
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,680
 that you could just drive a Mack truck through.

928
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:03,200
 The biggest door was when they called you.

929
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,800
 And they said, we're going out

930
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:09,240
 and we're gonna do the exact same thing we always do.

931
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,640
 That was the big door.

932
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:14,280
 And so some of you may be sitting there going,

933
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,120
 so what, Adam, are you telling me

934
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:17,400
 that I shouldn't go to the bars anymore?

935
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,680
 I don't know, maybe.

936
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:21,720
 If your relationship with alcohol is unhealthy,

937
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,440
 if it's never just one drink for you

938
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,920
 and it's a source of shame and guilt in your life

939
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,280
 and you have a bad relationship with it,

940
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,120
 then yeah, guess what?

941
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,880
 You probably shouldn't go to the bars anymore.

942
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,080
 That's probably gonna be something

943
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,600
 that's getting in the way of you becoming the person

944
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,680
 that you wanna become.

945
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,800
 Well, Adam, so if you're telling me

946
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,720
 not to go to the bars anymore,

947
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,640
 you're telling me I need new friends?

948
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,000
 Probably, maybe.

949
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,040
 'Cause if those friends think

950
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,920
 that's the only thing you have in common

951
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,160
 and they don't care that you wanna break free

952
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,040
 from being enslaved to that,

953
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:51,920
 and they don't see that

954
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:52,760
 and they just think that,

955
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,480
 oh, they're loving you by being around you

956
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:58,240
 and they don't see or want what's best for you,

957
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,080
 then guess what?

958
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:02,040
 You probably need some new friends.

959
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,040
 So they're going, so what?

960
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,000
 It's like following Jesus, I just gotta,

961
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,160
 like he's gonna start messing

962
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:10,560
 with all this stuff in my life?

963
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,760
 Yeah, yes.

964
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:18,920
 But here's the deal is I'm willing to bet

965
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:21,200
 he's gonna mess with all the stuff

966
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,160
 that you want changed in your life.

967
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,320
 It's all that stuff that you know

968
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,440
 is in the way of you becoming the person

969
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,720
 that it is that you wanna become.

970
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,800
 It's that stuff that you feel enslaved by.

971
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,440
 When you're alone, when you're alone

972
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,520
 and you're looking at yourself in the mirror,

973
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,440
 you know he's gonna mess with all the stuff

974
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:41,120
 that you want out of your life anyway.

975
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,760
 You may be sitting there going,

976
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,280
 Adam, that's nobody's story, nobody does that.

977
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,120
 Really?

978
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,400
 It's mine.

979
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,320
 It's my story.

980
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,080
 I didn't follow Jesus for years

981
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:57,800
 and I wish it was because I had this intellectual objection

982
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,360
 to whether or not he was really rose from the dead

983
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,160
 or if the Bible could be trusted

984
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,840
 or something that sounded intellectual or good like that.

985
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,320
 No, no, no.

986
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,080
 The reason I didn't follow Jesus for years

987
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,440
 after somebody shared the gospel with me

988
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:13,640
 is because I just wanted friends, social reasons.

989
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,360
 I was just afraid.

990
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:18,360
 I couldn't imagine what life with him,

991
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,960
 the cost seemed too great.

992
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,080
 But what's amazing is I know my story.

993
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,880
 I'm not alone.

994
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:28,600
 I know there are hundreds, if not over a thousand,

995
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,800
 very similar stories.

996
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:33,760
 And we all have the exact same message, which is this.

997
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,680
 Is that the cost?

998
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,440
 Yes, is there a cost of following Jesus?

999
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,000
 Yes, there's a cost of following Jesus.

1000
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,520
 But it is infinitely less expensive

1001
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:45,160
 than the cost of not following Jesus.

1002
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:50,000
 So temptation is unavoidable.

1003
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,000
 No temptation is unbearable

1004
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,240
 and no temptation is unescapable.

1005
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,320
 He will always provide a way out.

1006
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,560
 So it's just, my ask tonight is simple.

1007
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:04,280
 If you're in the room tonight

1008
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:07,260
 and you are one of those who claim

1009
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:10,300
 to be a follower of Jesus, the life hack,

1010
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:11,140
 the life hack is this.

1011
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:14,580
 The life hack is to start looking for the big doors.

1012
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:19,400
 Wake up tomorrow morning

1013
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,080
 and just go, all right, Lord,

1014
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,800
 I know today I'm gonna face choices.

1015
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,640
 I know today there's gonna be temptations.

1016
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:29,160
 I know today my heart is gonna wanna go

1017
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,520
 in a direction that is contrary to your best.

1018
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:35,260
 But I just wanna remind myself of the truth, Lord,

1019
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:37,360
 that nothing will overtake me today

1020
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,720
 except what's common to man.

1021
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,960
 The battle is out there and I'm not unique.

1022
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,920
 And I know that no matter what I face today,

1023
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,240
 you are faithful.

1024
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,080
 You are faithful

1025
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,520
 and I will not be tempted beyond what I can bear.

1026
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,020
 And Lord, I know that no matter what,

1027
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:56,360
 when I'm tempted, that you are gonna find

1028
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,560
 or provide a way out.

1029
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:00,640
 And so Lord, help me see the big doors

1030
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,560
 'cause Lord, I'm done making a living

1031
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:06,040
 climbing through small doors

1032
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,600
 and climbing through small windows.

1033
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:10,640
 I've got scars and pain and that's just, that's hard.

1034
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,440
 I don't wanna do that anymore, Lord.

1035
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,360
 I wanna go through the big doors

1036
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,480
 and so you help me tonight.

1037
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,620
 And so if you're following Jesus,

1038
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:18,800
 that's my ask for you tonight,

1039
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,520
 my encouragement, my challenge for you tonight

1040
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,880
 is to start looking for the big doors.

1041
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:22,920
 And if you're in the room tonight

1042
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,840
 and you would not claim to be a follower of Jesus,

1043
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,960
 then my ask is a little different.

1044
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,080
 My ask for you is this,

1045
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:31,040
 is to consider walking through the door.

1046
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,680
 And that door is Jesus.

1047
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:37,320
 So Jesus in John chapter nine,

1048
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,040
 or excuse me, chapter 10, verses nine and 10,

1049
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:39,880
 this is what he says.

1050
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:42,080
 He says, "I'm the gate, I'm the door.

1051
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:47,520
 I'm the gate, whoever enters through me will be saved.

1052
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,240
 They will come in and they will go out

1053
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,240
 and they will find pasture.

1054
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:55,220
 The thief comes only to kill, steal and destroy,

1055
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:58,680
 but I have come that you may have life

1056
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:01,040
 and have it to the full."

1057
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,920
 So if you're in the room tonight

1058
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:05,040
 and you're thinking about who Jesus is

1059
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,240
 and contemplating who God is,

1060
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,700
 I just wanna be a friend and I just wanna tell you

1061
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:10,400
 that you have done things like we have all done things

1062
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,120
 that are contrary to God's best for our life.

1063
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:15,040
 And these decisions, these attitudes,

1064
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,560
 these actions or these thoughts,

1065
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,480
 these things that we've done,

1066
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,940
 they're not just mistakes.

1067
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:23,120
 They're not just learning experiences.

1068
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,080
 Scripture would say they're called sin

1069
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:28,200
 and they carry an eternal consequence,

1070
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:31,640
 meaning we are separated from God eternally.

1071
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:34,900
 And there's no amount of good behavior

1072
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:37,200
 that we could ever do to bridge that gap

1073
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,540
 and bring that relationship back between us and God.

1074
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:41,860
 We are stuck and we need a rescuer.

1075
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:44,720
 And that rescuer is Jesus.

1076
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,240
 Jesus says he's the door.

1077
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:49,600
 If you want to be in a relationship with God,

1078
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,720
 you've gotta walk through him.

1079
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,240
 You've gotta trust him.

1080
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,280
 You've gotta recognize that you are a sinner

1081
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:57,120
 in need of a savior and that savior is Jesus Christ.

1082
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:00,800
 And all you do is you just receive the gift,

1083
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,820
 the gift that Jesus offers, which is salvation,

1084
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,720
 the forgiveness of your sins.

1085
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,800
 You just receive that gift

1086
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,720
 and you just walk through the door.

1087
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,840
 You just say, "Lord, I'm a sinner.

1088
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,980
 I'm in need of a savior.

1089
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:12,540
 I recognize I've done things

1090
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:14,160
 that have separated me from you.

1091
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,080
 And I believe that you love me so much

1092
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:21,160
 that you sent Jesus to take the punishment for my sins,

1093
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,720
 to take the payment for my sins.

1094
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,580
 And I wanna trust in you."

1095
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:27,800
 And there's a cost.

1096
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,400
 There's a cost to following him.

1097
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:32,700
 But it just looks so minuscule

1098
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:35,660
 compared to the cost of not following him.

1099
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:38,180
 Come and know this Jesus.

1100
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:39,980
 Let's pray.

1101
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:41,520
 God, we just thank you for your word.

1102
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:44,280
 (pages rustling)

1103
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:47,920
 We thank you that you love us, Lord.

1104
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:50,120
 We thank you that you haven't left us alone.

1105
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:55,440
 We thank you God that even though you know

1106
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,760
 that we are so prone to just wander

1107
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,800
 and we wanna go so many different directions

1108
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,840
 and we wanna choose things

1109
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,560
 that we know are not gonna bring us life,

1110
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,840
 but you, you are faithful.

1111
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:08,240
 And so we just declare that tonight, Lord,

1112
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,280
 that you're faithful.

1113
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,640
 And we praise you God in your grace and mercy

1114
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:15,640
 that you will not let us be tempted beyond what we can bear.

1115
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:19,560
 Yeah, we praise you that no matter what situation

1116
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:22,120
 in life we face, you provide a way out.

1117
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,940
 And so I ask for my brothers and sisters

1118
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:25,600
 and myself in this room tonight,

1119
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:30,000
 God, I ask that you will help us to see those big doors,

1120
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,200
 that we will stop just trying to walk up to the edge

1121
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,480
 and see how far we can make it.

1122
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,600
 We've got scars, Lord.

1123
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:36,720
 We know that doesn't work.

1124
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,400
 And so we need your grace and your mercy

1125
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,640
 to help us walk through the big doors.

1126
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,000
 And my friends in the room tonight, Lord,

1127
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,120
 that don't know you, I pray they'll walk through the door

1128
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,480
 and they'll come to know you, Jesus.

1129
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:50,320
 And so I pray, Lord, that you will open their eyes.

1130
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,520
 And we ask this in the name of Christ.

1131
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,520
 Thank you.
