[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420]   (bell rings)
[00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:09.880]   - Rebecca Leal, Port Stories, set free.
[00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.760]   - I grew up in a Christian home with parents
[00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.200]   who professed to be believers,
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.200]   all the while witnessing unhealthy conflict
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.080]   and abuse in my home.
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.720]   As a child, this made me feel scared,
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.600]   like I was always walking on eggshells,
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.740]   and that I really couldn't trust my parents.
[00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.440]   As a young kid, we went to church,
[00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.900]   and so I did believe that God,
[00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.960]   I did believe in God for my salvation and my eternity,
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.120]   but because I felt like I was always working really hard
[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.460]   to get my parents' love and affection,
[00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.080]   that led me to believe that God didn't love me enough, too.
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.480]   That underlying belief really stuck with me
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.280]   through high school and well into college.
[00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.440]   After college, I decided to get braces,
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.280]   and I met my orthodontist tech,
[00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.520]   and she and I really hit it off in conversation,
[00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.600]   and she mentioned there was this place on Tuesdays
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.480]   called The Porch, and that I should go check it out.
[00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.420]   At the time, I was a different member of a church
[00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.000]   and wasn't really fully committed.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.360]   So, a few months went by, and her and I
[00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.880]   just kept having conversations.
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.560]   I decided to commit and attend,
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.960]   and I don't remember specifically what that night was about
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.560]   other than I remember seeing and hearing
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.240]   what a real abiding faith looked like
[00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.960]   and hearing that the gospel was real
[00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.100]   and that God loved me enough to send Jesus to die for me.
[00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.880]   I remember going home that night,
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.280]   really kind of sitting in the faith
[00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.120]   that I professed to believe,
[00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.960]   and choosing to kind of make a different way
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.320]   and understanding that I couldn't work hard enough
[00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.640]   for God to love me.
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.980]   So, through that, I jumped all in through membership
[00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.760]   and into community, now get the opportunity
[00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.400]   to serve in different capacities
[00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.840]   and at The Porch on Tuesdays,
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.000]   and I get to share with people
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.700]   just how much God loves them too.
[00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.280]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.860]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.440]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.940]   (music fades)
