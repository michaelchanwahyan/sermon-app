[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   [Music]
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   All right, let's go.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   Hey, welcome friends in the room, friends up in the loft and
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   in stage 2 and 4 in El Paso, Cedar Rapids, Boise, Idaho.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   And as we are wrapping up, as JD said, the last course of 2020.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   Which is so bittersweet.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   What a year.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   We kicked off this year and started a series called Roaring 20s.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   Where there was lots of anticipation and excitement.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   It had been a minute since we had been in the 20s.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   Specifically it had been 100 years.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   And we talked about the last time as a country we were in the 20s.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   And we went through, man, the last time as 20s, it was called the Roaring 20s.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   And the Roots was around and sliced bread was invented.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   Prohibition was a thing.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   Women's suffrage, holla at your girl.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   Got passed.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   And just what so much has changed.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   And as I was praying through and starting to think about tonight, I
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   thought I would just start by doing a similar thing.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   Not for the last 100 years but for the last 11 months.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   Because who would have thought a year ago the world that we live in
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   and the way things would look would have gone through so much change
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   and challenges and hardships.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   In the last 12 months, we saw the year kick off with the Australian
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   brush fires, which people thought would be one of the biggest defining
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   things of 2020.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   And oh, how wrong they were.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   And shortly after that, Prince Harry, Meghan Markle decided to quit the
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   royal family.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   Who knew that was even a thing?
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   You can just deuce his grandma and we're out of here.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   Then the impeachment of the president and his acquittal in January.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   And then tragically Kobe Bryant and his daughter on a helicopter crash.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   And then not long after that, COVID-19 was introduced and
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   transformed everything.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   Phrases like shelter in place.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   Mask mandate.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   Flatten the curve.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   And then what?
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   To things that we're all very familiar with.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   Hundreds of thousands of people would lose their life and millions of
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   people would lose their livelihood and their jobs and their homes,
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   their ability to provide.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   The Black Lives Matter protest after the tragic killings of George Floyd,
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, Jacob Blake.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   And the waves of protests and riots that happened after that.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Chadwick Boseman's also tragic death, the Black Panther actor,
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   after a four-year battle with cancer.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Supreme Court Justice, after serving for decades in
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   the Supreme Court, passed away at age 87.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   And then the most crazy divided election in our lifetime.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   Maybe ever.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   All of which 2020 would hold.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   And not only held those things, but think about the things in terms of
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   practical life, the challenges that you,
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   the people that our country, that individuals have walked through.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Where things like going to see grandma has become a thing that comes with
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   significant risk to it.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Graduation parties were done away with.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Sports were done away with.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   Weddings that never took place or if they did it was very small ceremonies.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   Birthday parties that didn't happen.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   So much of what was normal all stripped away.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   This has been a year that has been full of trials.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   Where people, a larger number of young adults under 30 live with their
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   parents today than the highest number in our history,
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   which was during the Great Depression.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   52% of young adults under 30 today live back with their parents.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   A sharp increase from where it was a year ago in the 30s.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   The number of people who have gone back on the medication or just the
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   antidepressants and mental health challenges that have erupted.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   I mean, people have been walking through trials.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   And if that wasn't enough, there's also been increased temptation
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   because whenever you have to live at home, you're staying at home.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   You're all by yourself.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   You live in isolation.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   You're cut off from what is normal.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   The temptation to cope or to look for something to make life a little bit
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   take the edge off only increases.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   So what I want to talk about tonight as we wrap up the year is something that
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   I could not think of a more timely passage than just praying through how
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   to end this year.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   And that is a passage in James chapter 1 where the apostle James walks
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   through how to handle trials and temptations.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   He walks through what is the truth about trials.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   What is the truth about temptations.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   Because whatever trials are behind you, the truth about living in this world
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   is there's going to be plenty of trials in front of you.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   There's also going to be plenty of temptations that are just a part of
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   living in a world with a broken sin nature or broken self-destructive
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   desires in your own self and living in this world that we're in.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   Like JD just said, who knows what and when things will exactly get back to
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   normal and even when they do, the trials that come from living in a
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   world that is not the way it was intended originally to be are going to be there.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   So we're going to learn from James on the truth about trials, truth about
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   temptation and ultimately the truth about God to hold on to in the midst of that.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   So we're going to be in James chapter 1.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   Here's what we got to know about James.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   James, you probably didn't hear this growing up in Sunday school.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   James was the little brother of Jesus.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   Jesus had at least two younger brothers, a guy named James, a guy named Jude.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   Think about that.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   However good your firstborn sibling was, it pales in comparison to living in a
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   shadow of Jesus.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   Think about it.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   You're sitting at the dinner table, little James, nine years old, first
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   century, sitting at the dinner table, mom telling him, why can't you be more
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   like Jesus?
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   I'm him, I'm going, why can't you be more like Jesus, mom?
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   He's the son of God.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   What am I supposed to do?
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   But James went through life and didn't just grow up in the shadow of his
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   little brother.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   Eventually or at some point he found himself going, everybody else thinks
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   that this guy is the son of God and I don't believe it.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   Jesus' own brothers, his family didn't believe he was the son of God, which
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   honestly makes sense.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   And it's really one of the reasons why James is such a compelling argument for
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   the resurrection and the reasons that we have to believe.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   Here's what I mean.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   Who has siblings in the room?
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   Anybody have siblings?
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   Younger siblings?
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   Older siblings?
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   What would it take for you to believe that your sister is the daughter of God?
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   Or your brother is the daughter of God?
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   I mean, I'm going to be even further.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   I'm not even going to touch that with a 10-foot pole.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   Or your brother is the son of God.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   I mean, think about it.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   No matter how good or how kind or how perfect everything was to Jesus.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   If he's your brother or sibling and you are like, dude, we grew up
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   together, went on family vacations.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   I know all the things.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   Definitely not the son of God.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   That's where James was at.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   Until one day he saw his brother crucified for a crime he didn't commit.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   And they got together and they buried Jesus, this guy with these massive
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   followings.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   And James didn't believe it.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   He just thought he's a teacher and he's kind of out there.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   And as they went to the funeral and they're burying Jesus, his brother,
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   sealed away in a tomb.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   And three days later James sees his sibling Jesus alive, walking around,
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   after being killed and buried in the ground for three days.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   And everything changed for James.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   He went from saying, man, I'm telling you, it's just my brother too.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   That is my Messiah.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   He said, one, the Savior of the earth.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   And James came to believe in Jesus.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   And he writes a letter to Christians spread out throughout the Roman Empire,
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   which is basically where all Christianity took off and took place and was
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   birthed.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   And he writes this letter.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   And it's been preserved and we have it and we call it the Book of James.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   And it's a book of James instructions to Christians everywhere,
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   trying to figure out how to live out their faith.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   And he launches immediately into a subject that's so timely for us.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   Because he goes real quick, hey, my name is James, let's talk about trials.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   And he jumps right in.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   And what he has to say is so profoundly relevant, I think God is going to
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   speak and God is going to give us not just handholds for where we are today,
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   but for the Christmas break, for where you're headed to in terms of
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   temptation back at your home, for where we're headed to just in general as we
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   walk through trials.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   So we're going to be in James chapter one.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   I'm going to start in verse one and we'll dive right in.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   "James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ to the 12 tribes
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   scattered among the nations.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   Greetings.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   many kinds."
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   He doesn't waste any words, jumps right in.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   Because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   Or your translation may say endurance or patience, the ability to keep going.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   "Let perseverance finish its work so that you may be mature and complete,
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   not lacking in anything."
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   James launches in and says, hey, I want you to consider it pure joy whenever
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   you face trials of various kinds.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   The first thing I want to talk about is the truth about trials.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   On the surface you read that and like, James, how can you say that?
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   That's so insensitive that you wouldn't even say I should consider it joy or an
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   opportunity to have joy when I walk through trials, when I walk through
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   heartbreak and the relationship doesn't work out, when I find out my mom has
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   cancer, when I find out that I have an autoimmune disease, I'm going to have to
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   be on medication for the rest of my life about, when a pandemic strikes and I
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   lose my job.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   Joy?
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   Really, James?
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   How can you say that?
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   Because James is going to give us or he's given us the truth about trials.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   One of the things that he lays out is it's not if you face trials.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   It's when you face trials.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   That's why I love the Bible.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   It's so unbelievably honest.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   In other words, there's a lot of preachers or people out there who are like, Luke,
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   you follow Jesus and nothing will form against you that will ever stand.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   It's going to be great.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   Everything is going to work out.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   Life is going to be, I'm believing for you 2021 or I'm believing for you 2020.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   And then things like 2020 happened.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   And they were promising things to people who have faith in Jesus that God
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   never promised.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   Like if you follow Jesus, everything is going to be easy.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   The Bible doesn't teach that.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   James launches immediately and says, hey, you're going to have hard things
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   come your way.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   But if you let them, they can be an opportunity.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   Well, because you know the purpose of those things, you can have joy in the
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   midst of those.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   So the truth about trials is they're something that God will use to move us
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   towards stronger faith.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   Why can we have joy?
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   Because James says in the midst of a trial, in the midst of a challenge,
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   things are not going the way you want them to, something happens.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   And here's what he says in the verse.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   They are the testing of your faith.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   Because verse 3, I don't know if they put it back up there.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   Put verse 3 back up.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   They are the testing of your faith.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   Let me really quick leave it up there.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   The word faith in this context, a lot of people are not sure what faith
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   means or ambiguously throw it out there.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   Faith, what James is saying in this context is confidence in God.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   That's what the word would be synonymous with.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   Your ability or confidence that God is who he says he is.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   He's going to do what he said he would do.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   He's going to do everything he promised.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   And he's accomplished everything he has said in his word.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   That's what faith is in this context.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   Hey, every time you walk through a trial, it is putting to the test your
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   confidence in God.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   Your confidence that God is good, he's in control, he's got a plan for my
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   life, what he says in his word about this life being a vapor is true.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   He made me on purpose.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   He made me uniquely.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   All the things that I say I believe.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   When I walk through a trial, James says, when life, man, just feels like
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   you're getting kicked every day, punched in the face, metaphorically speaking.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   When you walk through those things, it is putting to the test and revealing
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   to you what you really believe.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   Not what you say you believe.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   Not what you may be pretending to believe.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   Not even what you were told as a child, this is what you should believe.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   But what you actually believe.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   It puts to the test your confidence in God.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   James says, hey, it's going to reveal where and what you actually believe
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   about God.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   Why could that be a good thing?
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   The word they use for test is the same word in alchemy or alchemist, big
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   word, people who work with metals and gold and diamonds and try to test
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   what is.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   Is this fool's gold or real gold?
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   What do they do to find out if it's real gold or fool's gold?
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   They put it to a test and determine the strength of the metal and
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   determine if it's real.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   And they're doing what they're like.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   They're putting to the test what you actually believe.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   Why would that be a blessing?
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   Why would that be a good thing?
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   Which says next in the verse, verse 4, which you can put back up.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   Let this testing makes perseverance continue or finish its work so that you
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   may be mature or you may grow and be complete, not lacking in anything.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   In other words, as you walk through those trials, what you're going to
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   do next is it's going to reveal what you actually believe and it's going
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   to give you the opportunity to grow in your confidence in God.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   When you walk through that breakup and you decide despite the fact that
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   this is not what I would have chose, I'm going to trust you, God.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   I'm not going to do what everybody in my life is telling me to do, which
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   is man, just get back on Tinder or get back with that old girl.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   I'm going to actually follow what you tell me to in the Bible.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   And as you do, your confidence, you're going to grow and you're going to
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   mature in your faith.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   God will allow us to move through and to face challenges and trials.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   To grow and mature and strengthen our faith.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   My daughter is two years old.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   She loves going to playgrounds, playing in like the tree fort that we have
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   here in Watermark at the Dallas campus.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   And every now and then we'll go up to that tree fort, especially during
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   COVID when it's all locked down and nowhere to go.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   One of the few perks of working at this place.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   Nobody there.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   We go up there and play on the tree fort, playground.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   And she would go and have bridges you could run across and we would run
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   across and she would play.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   And there's one bridge that's not made out of wood, it's made out of
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   rope nets that are cross braided together.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   And you walk across and it's another form of a bridge.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   Because she's two, she doesn't get I can't fall through this and
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   she would go out on the middle of this bridge and panic and go ballistic
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   and be screaming for her father to pick her up and get her off this net.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   As her dad, here's the weird thing about parenting.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   There's times where you have to let them learn on their own.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   That net is not going to fall.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   You're going to be just fine.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   Come on, baby girl, keep going.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   You got this.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   And she doesn't want to.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   And she's not sure that it can hold her.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   But as her dad, I'm going, I know it can hold you.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   Keep moving.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   In the same way, in moments of trial, God will allow us to go through
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   trials that we wouldn't choose but that he will use to show us that he
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   is enough.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   That every trial in our life, James would say, is an opportunity for you
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   to grow in your confidence.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   Everything you say you believe, it's going to be exposed and you'll find
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   out what you actually believe.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   And in those moments, if you choose to trust God and you keep walking,
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   you're going to find just like that rope is more than strong enough,
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   he is more than strong enough to hold you, to get you through it.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   And James says, that's why you and I can have pure joy.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   The other blessing, and this is a huge encouragement, I think,
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   this past year, because everybody's been through trials.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   Everyone's been through a lot of trials.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   If you made it out without facing one, man,
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   we need to have you teach next week.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   We'll extend the porch next week.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   I think one gift that is given to us is that as those trials have come,
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   we get to discover, oh, man, these are some areas of my life and my
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   faith where I don't actually believe God is who he says he is.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   We've all been confronted with how the chaos and uncertainty and just
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   challenges of life exposes some of the places where we may not really
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   believe God is who he says he is.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   And in that test, we discover where we are.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   It's like this, there's two types of exercise tests.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   When you go and, you know, you enroll in Orangetheory or CrossFit or
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   Bar Method or whatever other fitness class you're out there.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   You go in, and the first day they're going to have you do a fitness test.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   What's a fitness test for?
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   It's to basically show you how out of shape you are.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   And they have you do this test and they go through it and have you do
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   all the tests.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   And it's for the point of discovering where you are so that you can get to
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   where you want to be.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   And I'm like, this is where I'm at.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   If I want to get to a fitness goal, I got to know where I'm actually at in
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   order for me to get there.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   And this year has been a chance where God through the trials and testing
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   has given us the ability to discover, man, this I really don't trust him
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   with my singleness.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   I really don't believe his way for sex is good or is right.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   And I really don't think pornography is that big of a deal.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   I really don't think it's that big of a deal to smoke marijuana every once
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   in a while.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   I really don't think it's that important to date the type of person God
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   says that all of us in the midst of trials, in the midst of the things that
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   we turn to, in the midst of the decisions that maybe are a byproduct of
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   being in the midst of what we are.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   We discover where we are.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   And here's what I want you to know.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   We're going to get to this in a second.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   Wherever you are, the best encouragement I would give you is be honest.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   Just be honest with where you are.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   I'm going, hey, you know what?
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   I really don't believe God is as good as he says he is.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   I really don't believe I should date the way that he says I should date.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   I really don't believe sex outside of marriage is that big of a deal.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   The best thing, if you want to move to the direction of actually growing in
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   your character, growing in your faith, you've got to acknowledge where you
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   are now.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   And James says, if you want to grow and you want to mature, it begins with
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   knowing, hey, what do I actually believe?
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   What actually do I think?
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   What am I learning about myself in the midst of -- I know for me, man, I do
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   not like being controlled.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   People tell me to wear a mask.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   I don't want to wear a mask just because you told me to wear a mask.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   There's something that's broken inside of me where I realize, hey, when
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   people tell me what to do, I just want to turn into a street fighter and be
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   like, I'm going to tell you what to do.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   And that is not okay.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   And an area where I need to have God, man, take ground.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   There's pride.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   There's confidence.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   And I don't want to be that man.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   I don't know what it is for you.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   One of the encouragements I would give you is take an honest evaluation.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   Where are you?
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   What do you actually believe?
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   What do you actually need God to take ground?
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   Second thing he says, or he walks us through, it's not just trials in life.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   But it's testing -- excuse me, temptation.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   When he lays out after covering trials and this is what it looks like to walk
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   through that, he says this, verse 13 of James chapter 1.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   When tempted, no one should say God is tempting me.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   So he begins to talk about temptation.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   He says any time temptation comes, cross one thing out, God never tempts
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   people.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   So it's not God.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   For God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does he tempt anyone.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   But he is tempted when they are dragged away by their own evil desire and enticed.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   Then after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   And sin, when it is fully grown, gives birth to death.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   So James begins to unpack temptation.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   The Greek words for trial and temptation are like crazy close.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   In the Greek there's a little bit of play on words.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   But don't get distracted by that.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   James is unpacking temptation and gives us the truth about temptation.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   I think a lot of us when we think of temptation, people use language, I was
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   on my way over here and this guy cut in front of me, not today Satan.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   You're not going to have your way with me devil.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   And we're quick to point out that temptation comes from out there.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   And James says, no, no, no.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   There's plenty of temptation that comes from in here.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   He doesn't mention the devil.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   He says here's how temptation works.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   He walks through and says it happens on the inside.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   The truth about temptation is it comes from within.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   And that we fight it with the truth.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   I'll cover that in a second.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   The Bible says it comes from within.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   What do I mean by that?
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   The Bible says this makes so much sense.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   If you're not a Jesus follower, I don't know how you make sense of this.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   What the Bible teaches, the reason why temptation comes from within, we
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   have a sin nature.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   What is a sin nature?
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   It's a nature that comes from within.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   I don't have to work to sin.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   It comes very easy.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   Nobody has ever said the phrase, man, you know what?
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   2021 is going to be my year.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   I'm going to lust more than ever.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   I'm going to be angry more than ever.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   Really working on upping my selfishness game.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   I find myself being the selfless guy.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   I need to work on being more selfish.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   No one has ever done that.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   Why?
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   Think about that.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   Why is it so easy for you to be a jerk?
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   Why is it so easy for you to be anxious and so self-focused and so
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   self-obsessed?
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   Why?
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   That's what I mean by apart from the Bible, how do you explain that?
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   Why can't we all in neutral be like, yeah, I'm just so happy all the time.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   Life is great.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   Why is that not possible?
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   Why don't I have to work at lusting after other people?
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   It just comes naturally.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   The Bible says it's because you have a sin nature.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   That's key to understanding.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   If you're going to fight temptation, you have to understand where it's
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   coming from.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   It's not from Satan, it's from within.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   One of the key ways it comes from is not from Satan, it's from within.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   He uses an analogy, he uses two analogies really.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   The first is a fishing.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   Lured and enticed and dragged away.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   Any fishermen in here?
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   Anybody fish?
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   Good.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   Two of you.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   One of you.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   Great.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   Awesome.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   2021 or 2020 took fishing away from people too.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   This is how temptation works.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   You're fishing, you begin to go, man, that doesn't seem that bad.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   I'm interested in that.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   Just like a fish seeing bait.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   And all of a sudden you're going closer, closer, closer.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   And you're lured and hooked.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   It's pretty important to know about temptation.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   The way that temptation works is it always disguises itself as
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   something appealing.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   It says by your own desires.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   This is how temptation works.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   It appeals to the things you want, things you desire.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   In other words, temptation, when it comes, if you were to put it in
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   your mouth, it would be like a fish.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   It's like a fish in a pond.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   In other words, temptation, when it comes, if you were to put it in a
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   food analogy, so to speak, temptation doesn't disguise itself as kale salad.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   Walking around, look at me, no salad, just salt and pepper.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   Delicious.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   That never happens.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   Temptation is going to come much more, if you will, to use an analogy or
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   metaphor.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   Like this hostess cake that you scarfed down when you were in second grade.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   Where it just pops up and you're going to be more tempted.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   It's going to come in the form of something, man, that is appealing to me.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   In fact, who wouldn't want to be tempted?
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   It's going to come in the form of something, man, that is appealing to me.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   In fact, who wants -- all right.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   Okay.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   And intercepted.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   That's harsh.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   Okay.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   All right.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   Nope.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   Okay.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   All right.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   Dump them out.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   Last four.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   Wow, man, you guys got to eat, dude.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   Hey, if you have this on, you don't have to eat.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   If you have this on, you don't have to wear a mask.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   All right.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   In other words, temptation, when it shows up, and this is so huge.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   Because a lot of us are going to think, oh, man, if temptation is there, I
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   would totally see it and I would know it.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   And he says, no, no, that's the thing with temptation.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   You don't even realize you're beginning to be pulled in.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   You're walking past it.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   And all of a sudden you're hungry and you're sitting there.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   You're like, hey, despite the fact that everybody else is eating one of
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   these hostess things, I don't need it.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   It's not for me.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   I don't want that.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   It's not that good.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   And slowly by slowly, just begin to go, man, that -- it's just like --
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   maybe just like a little bit of icing here.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   I mean, I've already tried it, so I might have a little bit more.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   I mean, look, who even agreed that this was going to be the standard that I
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   would hold myself to?
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   And slowly by slowly, in and in, James says, eventually, you're hooked.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   You're hooked.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   Yeah, be careful when you're eating yours.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   [Laughter]
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   And it doesn't seem that way in the moment.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   This is going to be really hard to get rid of for the rest of this talk.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   But you don't even see it and you're just going, man, it's just a little bit
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   or it's not that big of a deal.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   It doesn't really matter.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   And pretty soon at the end of every temptation, he says, you're lured,
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   enticed, hooked.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   This is why first time, you know, you smoke a cigarette, it's like a huge buzz.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   It's like, oh, man, wow, that's awesome.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   Second time, it's not nearly as much.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   Third time, fourth time, or vaping or e-cigs or whatever you want to call it,
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   it's kind of the same thing.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   Eventually you get to the place where you're like, I can't even be normal
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   without a cigarette.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   Like I can't even -- I can't even focus.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   James is like, lured, enticed, hooked.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   That's why you find yourself at home and you came home and roommate is not there
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   and you're walking around and you're like, oh, man, we're supposed to go to dinner.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   We're going a little bit.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   There's nobody here.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   And, oh, man, I got my phone.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   You know, I can't leave yet even though I know I probably shouldn't be here.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   Like I struggle with, you know, pornography and I'm all alone.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   I just had a hard day.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   And when I have a hard day, I'm tempted to turn to porn, honestly,
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   because it kind of like lets me numb.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   But I'm supposed to go to dinner.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   I got to charge my phone, so I'm going to hang a little bit longer.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   I charge my phone and I got to switch the laundry out.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   Maybe I'll just sit while I'm waiting.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   I'm checking Instagram.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   And there's a bikini pic.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   And step by step, and I'm back into porn.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   That's why the dating relationship where it's like, hey, we're not going all the way.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   We don't actually have sex.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   And we just kind of like -- we just love each other.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   I mean, it would be wrong if we weren't sexually attracted to each other, right?
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   We're going to get married or pretty much married in God's eyes.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   Cross boundary, cross boundary, cross boundary.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   Now we're sleeping together.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   And we can't even make it work without sex in the relationship.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   And James would say, took a little bite, took a little bite, and hooked.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   He says it's the way temptation works every time.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   And you've got to know, it's not going to come like some, oh, I clearly see it luring me in right now.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   He says that's the challenge.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   You can't see the hook.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   You just see what's on the outside.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   You just see the thing that's appealing to you.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   But every time that you and I walk down the path of sin, he uses another illustration of what comes forward.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   And it's such a, like, sobering, like, oh, man, you went from fishing to that?
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   Or he says this in verse 14.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   In verse 15.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   After saying they're lured by their own desire, you can throw it back up there, Alex.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   Verse 15.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   Then after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   In other words, after that desire, and you're like, oh, man, I want that, I want that, I want that.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   It brings forth and has conception.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   He uses pregnancy language.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   After that conception takes place, that sin, when it's full grown, it gives birth to something too.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   And it gives birth to death.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   It's eerily similar to him describing what maybe you've known, people have walked through or you're familiar with, which is a miscarriage.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   That moment where there's a pregnancy and you're excited and it seems like there's life there.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   And then what's brought forward is not alive.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   It's dead.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   That's what I mean by it's, like, jarring, sobering.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   James says that's what sin is like.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   It's like, oh, this is going to be awesome.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   There's life here.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   And then there's shame.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   Disappointment.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   That's why, man, I live with a party, go over the weekend.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   It's going to be amazing.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   He says every time afterwards where you think there's life and then afterwards comes death, the hangover.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   He says every time sin takes place, there's a hook and it brings and eventually destroys relationships, brings death.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   This is why the high -- and you hear about it, people who have affairs outside of their marriage.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   Feels like every other week someone comes out and having an affair.
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   You know what they weren't experiencing in the moment they were having an affair?
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   Death.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   They were thinking, oh, man, this is so terrible, I want to keep doing this.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   They were thinking, man, despite the fact I know this is wrong, probably not right, feels like there's life here.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   And then you see them on camera, see the children crying, see the family ruined.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   And it brought forth death.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   And James says that's what temptation -- you've got to understand the truth about temptation.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   If you follow it, that's where it leads.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   So how do we fight temptation?
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   The Bible is very clear, and I've got to move really quickly on this.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   The way that we fight temptation is with the truth.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   And that feels like a really easy thing to say.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   But over and over and over again it says the way that you and I battle or we live out our Christian faith,
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   we don't live according to our sin nature.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   We live according to our God nature, the new spirit life.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   Those may be words you're not familiar with, you're back in church, but let me explain it as clearly as I can.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   We begin to think, we begin to learn how God says we should think about stuff.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   How do we do that? In God's Word.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   In other words, the Bible over and over and over, we don't have time to go through it,
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   says how do you live out your faith?
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   How do you live out the new life?
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   How do you fight temptation? With the truth.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   Jesus attempted three times, Matthew chapter 4.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   He's out in the wilderness, devil comes up.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   Gives them these three temptations, pretty crazy story.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   Every time Jesus responds with what?
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   The Word of God.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   Says man, that temptation, that appeals to me.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   Here's what God's Word says.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   The Bible says the way that you and I live out the new life is by beginning to transform the way that we think.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   By living, knowing, reading God's Word.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   Psalm 119, David writes, "How can a young man stay on the path of purity?"
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   And he means purity sexually, but he also means just like the path of pure life.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   "By living according to your Word."
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   Hello.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   "I seek you with all of my heart. Do not let me stray from your commands.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   I have hidden your Word in my heart." David's speaking.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   I've hidden God's Word, I've taken your Word, and I hid it in there, and I read it, and I hold on to it,
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   and I try to live by it, that I might not sin against you.
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   In order for you to live by God's Word, in order for you to,
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   "Hey, I'm not going to fall for those temptations. I'm going to begin to transform my life."
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   You have to know God's Word, because you can't live with it if you don't know it.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   In order for you to know it, you have to read it, spend time in it.
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   Tonight, we're going to give anybody who wants one a Bible.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   We've got thousands of them out there. They're NET, they're great Bibles.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   And this break, if you don't have a Bible, that's a gift to you.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   Even if you have one, you want a new one, gift to you.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   And this break is a great opportunity for you to begin to go,
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   "I am going to spend time every day with God and His Word."
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   Let me challenge you. If you've never done that before, here we go.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   Ready for this? I dare you, for 31 days, that's December, read a proverb a day.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   There's 31 of them. You can do one every day.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   If you miss one, you know, pick it up the next day, and you're still marching through.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   That means I open up Proverbs 1, that's what I do December 1st.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   Proverbs 2, December 2nd.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   Some of you guys are like, "I'm not a 101, I'm a 201 level."
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   You can do that and walk through the book of John.
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   And if you're like, "Man, extra credit."
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   Challenge me. All the Gospels before the porch returns.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   Spend time. That's not that much.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   People with good grades can do it tonight. All of them.
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   And spend time reading, studying, applying.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   And as you cross through something that intersects with--
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   Because most people-- Here's the deal.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   It's not that the Bible-- The problem with most people, when it comes to the Bible,
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   and like, "I don't really like to read it."
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   It isn't that the Bible contradicts itself, because it doesn't.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   It's that it contradicts them.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   So every time that happens, I want you to circle it, and write it out, and go,
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   "Yeah, this is not what I think in neutral, or not how I normally live."
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   And you begin to go, "God, help me to live out your word.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   Help me to apply the truth."
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   Because behind every attractive lie or temptation is a lie.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   And the way that we fight that is in that moment, knowing this is the truth.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   I can go down this path. I can look at pornography.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   I can have an affair. I can get wasted again.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   But that is not just a moment.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   That is a path that I'm stepping on.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   And I begin to go through in my mind, what is the truth, where he calls me,
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   to live according to his word, to not set my eyes on anything pure, Job 31 says,
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   to be sober-minded in all things, and I begin to rehearse and live out the truth.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   So if you don't have a Bible, you can go do that.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   Others of you, here's what I want to do as it relates to truth.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   This is going to be an acronym. HOPE is really helpful and really profound.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   And honestly, if you do the next three minutes worth of stuff, your entire break,
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   your future may change, for that I'm about to do.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   Because the way that we experience freedom from temptation is the truth.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   One of the challenges that we have is drilling the truth into our hearts
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   and ripping out the lies.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   So what I want to do is give an acronym of the word truth.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   And you know what truth?
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   Truth is a choice that you have a decision to apply and live out.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   So what does it start with? It starts with you.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   Anytime you or anytime you experience an ungodly behavior in your life,
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   maybe, and this could be, man, I just like, when I think about my singleness,
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   I begin to freak out and I panic and get on 18 dating apps,
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   and I honestly make up various fake identities, and I'm like,
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   "Oh, do whatever you want. Whatever that is for you."
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   Or maybe you're like, "I just get angry when I'm driving in traffic,
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   and I punch my steering wheel," or "I'm addicted to pornography,"
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   or "Me and my girlfriend, we messed up again.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   I want to walk through whatever the ungodly behavior is behind everything."
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   So you just write that out. You fill in the blank.
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   This is the ungodly behavior.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   Beyond most, or not most, all ungodly behavior, there's a trigger.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   There's something that triggered you to go there.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   That's the T. The trigger, a triggers.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   There's one thing, many things, could be dozens of things that could be behind it.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   And beneath that, there is a rooted belief.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   I'm going to explain all of this.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   Man, this is like life transforming for me.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   There's rooted beliefs that are informing what leads to the behavior that's here.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   There's rooted beliefs.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   Wrong beliefs.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   Could be wrong beliefs about God.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   Could be unrealistic expectations about the world.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   Could be just irrational beliefs.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   This is where I have to expose what is driving or informing the ungodly behaviors in my life.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   And then the truth in God's Word.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   I've got to replace, that's the next T, the truth with the roots.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   I've got to take out God's Word.
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   Here's what it'd actually say, and I'll walk through a couple of examples to give you.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   And then H, which is helpful future response.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   What's a helpful future response as I think about this?
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   In other words, hey, I want to change this behavior.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   Every time that I get panicked, I turn to something that I don't want to turn to.
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   Every time that I get overwhelmed at work, I turn to pornography.
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   Every time that I get stressed, I do a booty call.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   Every time, whatever it is for you, I don't want to do this anymore.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   I want to actually grow.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   If you're in the room and you're like, actually, I'd like to change, this is for you.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   If you're in the room and you're like, actually, I'd like to get worse, not for you.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   Turn out the next five minutes.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   But here, for those who do.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   So let's say you struggle with road rage.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   Driving down the road, somebody cuts you off in traffic, you're like, oh, no, I didn't.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   Boom, punch in the steering wheel, punch in your console, and you're like,
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   I can't even say any sort of acronym that would do anything.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   Words come out, and you're like, I can't believe it.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   And you're flying by, giving them the bird, and you're like, what's messed up with you?
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   And then you've got the fish on the back of your car and everything else.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   Anyways, you've got the ungodly behavior, and you're like, man, why did that happen?
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   Well, you would say, well, what triggered me is a guy cut me off in front of me on the way there.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   Maybe, maybe that's one of them.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   That's probably one of them.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   Seems like it's one of them.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   Could be some other things.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   Maybe you had a stressful call, stressful email, something related to your boss,
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   that you're like, he's just such a jerk.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   That also triggered you.
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   You're disappointed with whatever's going on in life.
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   There could be several triggers.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   Most people stop there.
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   And they go, you know what would make my hand stop bleeding from punching things
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   whenever someone cuts me off?
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   If people would learn how to drive, that's what would make me stop bleeding.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   Nope.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   In fact, to focus on the triggers, whether it's anxiety, things that make you feel that way,
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   it's really kind of a useless thing because you live in a messed up world.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   You're going to reduce triggers sometimes, but you can just take Ubers everywhere, I guess,
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   but it's not realistic.
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   You've got to focus on the root beliefs.
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   What are the root beliefs that are underneath that?
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   Maybe it's just wrong beliefs about, like, hey, God, you promised me an easy life.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   People shouldn't be cutting me off as I'm driving.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   He didn't promise you that.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   He said in this world you're going to have trouble.
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   Maybe it's just an irrational, unrealistic expectation that everybody should learn how to drive,
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   the speed limit, and watch where they're going.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   That's irrational.
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   You don't do that.
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   There's something where you got exposed and go, man, that is off.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   Ultimately, maybe it's just selfishness, that you're just like, you're really selfish,
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   and you want your way and you don't want anyone else to do the things that bother you,
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   and you're selfish.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   So then you take those and you begin to go, and God says do nothing out of selfish ambition.
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   God says this life is not about me.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   God says in this world you're going to have trouble.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   People are going to cut you off.
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   They're going to end up driving straight into you.
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   You're not promised anything.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   I need to begin to rehearse and go through all of those truths,
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   correspondence with the root beliefs that are there.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   Then I walk through.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   This is the most helpful pregame of all time.
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   This is kind of afterwards, your hand's bleeding there, and you're like,
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   oh, I need to think of a better response to this.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   I go through a helpful future response.
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   By pregame, I mean like I'm thinking, not like pregame,
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   but like I'm pregame on what next time I'm going to do when that happens again.
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   They're going to cut me off.
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   You know what I'm going to do?
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   I'm going to go -- I'm going to change lanes.
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   There you go.
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   Problem solved.
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   I'm going to hearse God that you tell me the anger of man is not accomplished
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   with the righteousness of God.
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   I'm going to walk through scriptures where you tell me to be slow, to be angry.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   You know what, I'm going to pray for that person.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   They're going to cut me off, and I'm going to be tempted to be like --
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   I'm going to pray for them.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   And you're walking through, anticipating, this is what I'm going to do.
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   Maybe for you, you would say, man, I just struggle with anxiety,
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   and I just get overwhelmed with anxiety about singleness.
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   I find myself in an ungodly or unwanted emotion.
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   You know what triggered it?
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   Pulled out my friend on Instagram, just got engaged.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   Now I'm overwhelmed.
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   I'm going to be alone.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   Another one bites the dust, and here I am headed to be cat lady.
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   I just feel a spiral.
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   Maybe that's part of it.
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   Maybe the other trigger is you just got broken up with.
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   You just got out of a relationship.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   You just got out in, like, years.
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   So when you see that, you begin to spiral and spiral and spiral.
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   And you may think, man, I just need to get rid of Instagram,
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   or, like, I need to get friends that are not --
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   that's the most, like, squirrel thing ever.
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   What you need to do is focus on the root beliefs that are beneath that.
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   Maybe your belief is, like, hey, God, if I follow you, husband,
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   if I follow you, wife should be brought into my life,
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   and you're not giving me that.
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   He never promised that.
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   Maybe for you it's the idea that you bought the lie or the wrong belief.
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   A life where I don't get married is not a life worth living.
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   That's a lie.
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   Jesus had the most abundant, fulfilled, perfect life of all time, never married.
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   And you bought a lie.
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   I don't know what it is for you.
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   But you've got to dig to that root belief.
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   And then you go, what's the truth from God's word?
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   The truth from God's word is no matter if I never get married, Jesus is enough.
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   And that relationship has the ability to satisfy any person in any heart
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   and allow me to walk through any hardship that I face.
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   The idea that life is not worth living, I'm going to replace it with the lie.
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   God, your word tells me this life is a vapor.
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   It's not about me.
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   And what I'm going to experience for all of eternity pales in comparison to focusing here.
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   And then I'm going to walk through a helpful future response.
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   Next time I see that, see the Instagram pic, I'm just going to say, God, will you help me right now?
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   Because I feel a little bit discouraged.
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   Will you help me to find my hope in you?
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   I'm going to trust in you.
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   And then I'm going to go comment and say, heart, heart, heart, love this.
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   So excited for you and Steve.
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   And I'm walking through.
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   Some of you truly, like this exercise, you need to spend the next 30 days,
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   you need to do this.
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:51.000]   You have an addiction or honestly just some like really dysfunction.
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   You need to begin to go, God, will you search me and know me and help me walk through this?
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   That's why some of you, honestly, you shouldn't date right now
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   because there's so many triggers and so many bad, toxic, messed up beliefs that are underneath
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   that the reason you get in a relationship, you're like, yes, I'm trying to follow God and he's a great guy.
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   And all of a sudden, boom, three days in, we're sleeping together
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   and something triggers that ungodly behavior.
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   And it's like, I feel like I've learned my whole life, wrong beliefs,
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   that in order to be loved, I need to give sex.
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   And I got the impression he may not love me, so I go and give him sex.
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   Like you shouldn't be dating right now because you need to root out those beliefs
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   with the truth from God's word before you're ready to date and move forward.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   But the way that we fight temptation is with the truth.
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   He lands and ends, and I'm about to land the plane,
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   with I think one of the most helpful reminders of all of them.
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   So last section we'll go through.
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   Do not be deceived, brothers and sisters. I love this.
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   I want you to think about the last 11 months.
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   I want you to think about just life.
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:07.000]   And James would write to you what he wrote to these people,
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   facing trial and temptation.
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   Don't be deceived.
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:19.000]   Don't let anyone trick you. Don't fall for the lie.
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   What lie, James?
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   Every good and perfect gift is from above,
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   coming down from the father of heavenly lights. I love that.
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   Heavenly lights is just a word for the stars.
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:35.000]   Who does not change like shifting shadows.
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:39.000]   He chose to give us birth through the word of truth.
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   That's the gospel.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   That we might be a kind of first fruits of all that he created.
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   James goes in, and I love this, and he ends with,
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   "Hey, hold on to the truth about God."
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   As you walk through trials, you walk through temptations,
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   you've got to hold on to the truth about who your God is.
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   The truth about your God, He is good.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   He's not far. He's in control.
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   Every good thing in this life, every good thing imaginable,
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   comes from Him, and He only gives good things.
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   And he walks through and he points those things out.
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   Don't buy the lies of temptation.
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   That there could be anything good that is disconnected from God.
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   That's where He's coming.
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   That our God only gives good things.
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   And I'm going to explain how He can say that, how we can know that,
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   and how we can even believe that.
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   My son is five years old, and a couple nights ago,
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   we were watching this movie, it was "Arthur Christmas,"
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   which I had never seen before.
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   Not recommending, not opposing, but we were watching it.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   And in the movie, it's a Christmas show,
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   and it's about Santa Claus and Santa coming.
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:43.000]   At some point, Santa is in the house, and it's kind of a --
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   don't get distracted by it, but Santa's walking around,
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:49.000]   he's got the elves, and it's like a 20th century version of Santa.
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   So he's suited up, lots of technology.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   The house is in, the boy wakes up, and Santa's in the bedroom.
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   And Santa's afraid he's going to get found, so he dives on the floor,
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   and he is laying at the foot of the bed, hiding from the little boy.
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   It's an average scene, not really much to talk about, unless you're five.
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   And your greatest fear in life is something hiding underneath your bed,
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   or at the foot of your bed.
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.000]   So he begins to play through this tape in his mind.
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   I go upstairs, I put him down to bed.
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   I don't know, he's playing that tape, and I read him a story, bedtime prayers.
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   "Goodnight, son. Love you."
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   Why was Santa at the foot of the bed?
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   Santa was at the foot of the bed.
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:30.000]   No, Santa's not. He doesn't come into kids' bedrooms.
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   "Santa underneath my bed, Dad.
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   I don't want him in my bed, Dad."
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   And he's walking through, and he's terrified.
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.000]   I'm trying to explain Santa.
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   Normally, like a one-year-old is terrified of Santa, but a five-year-old, like,
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:45.000]   "Dad, Santa's going to break into our house?
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   That doesn't feel safe, Dad."
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.000]   And I'm trying to explain, like, "No, no, no, no,"
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   because he's still trying to get even Santa Claus,
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   and story for another time.
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   But as it relates to that, I'm going, "No, no, no, Santa,
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   he only comes down the chimney.
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   There's a secret about Santa I'll tell you someday,
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.000]   but Santa, he just brings good gifts.
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   He just brings good things.
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   You don't have to be afraid. He's not going to stop by your room.
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   Please don't let him stop by my room, Dad."
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   He only brings good things.
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:18.000]   What happened was he got this wrong impression of what Santa was like,
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   though Santa was real anyways.
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   But he saw this wrong version of it, and he held on to that.
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.000]   And he couldn't wrap his mind around, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:30.000]   no, Santa, he only--he brings good things.
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:35.000]   Like, Santa, he's jolly, he's great, got the reindeer."
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   He held on to a wrong version of him.
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:42.000]   Couldn't see that, "No, no, no, he brings good things in your life."
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   And James says to his audience, and he would say to you when he says to me,
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:49.000]   "Hold on to the right version of your God.
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   Don't interpret God through the lens of your circumstances.
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   Interpret your circumstances through the lens of who your God is.
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:56.000]   Your God is good.
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:59.000]   Every good thing in this life, every good thing that has ever existed,
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:03.000]   it comes from one place, from one source, and that is God.
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   He's not only good, he's great, the Father of lights."
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   What does that mean? It's the Father of the stars.
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:11.000]   James points out he's the God of the cosmos, he's the God of all that is,
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   he's the God of existence, he's not just good, he is great.
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:17.000]   And in the face of temptation, you've got to hold on.
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:20.000]   In the face of trials, you've got to hold on, because what do we all question?
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:25.000]   In the midst of trials, we question, "Where are you, God?
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:28.000]   How long are you going to let this happen?
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:32.000]   Don't you--do you even care what I'm walking through?"
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:37.000]   And we begin to question, "Are you really good?"
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:40.000]   James says, "No, no, no, don't get a wrong version of who your God is.
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:41.000]   He's good."
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:46.000]   And then he lays out the most beautiful verse and powerful truth--you've got to hold on to it,
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:51.000]   but to wrap it up--of how James would say, "Here's how I know he's good.
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:55.000]   Here's how you can know he's good."
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:48:02.000]   Because it was him who chose us--verse 18, put it back up there, Alex--
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:05.000]   he chose to give us birth.
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:07.000]   That's talking about new life.
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:09.000]   He's talking to Christians. He's saying, "This is what God did for you.
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.000]   You didn't do this. I didn't do this for you.
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.000]   And your mama didn't do this for you.
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   God chose to give us birth through the word of truth."
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:19.000]   That's the gospel.
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:24.000]   That's the message that Jesus, God, came into this world to die for you and for me, for sinners everywhere.
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:26.000]   You don't earn your way to God.
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:29.000]   He extended an invitation where he paid for your sins.
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   He says, "Everyone's welcome. I paid for your sin.
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   I paid for everything messed up you've ever done.
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:36.000]   And if you will trust not in how good you are, how many times you've been to church,
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   or allow whatever bad things you've done to make you think I don't love you,
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:44.000]   if you'll trust in what I did on the cross for you, paying for your sin, and rising from the dead,
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:46.000]   you will have eternal life.
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:48.000]   You will be born again."
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:52.000]   And James says, "You didn't choose that.
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:54.000]   When you walk through trials, you remember who your God is.
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:57.000]   You didn't work your way into a relationship with him,
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:59.000]   which means you can't work your way or send your way out of it.
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:01.000]   It was God who chose to give you a new birth.
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:04.000]   It was God who started all of this.
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:08.000]   He's the one who gave his life, who started this work in you.
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:10.000]   He's not going to let you go."
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:13.000]   He says, "None who are in my hand will ever be able to escape it."
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:15.000]   So when you walk through trials, when you walk through temptations,
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:18.000]   when you feel down and out, you remember who your God is.
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:20.000]   He's the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:23.000]   There's no shifting or shadows in the midst of him.
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   He's the Father of lights who's in control, and he loves you.
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:30.000]   And James says, "When you're tempted to believe he's not good,
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:36.000]   his way's not good, hold on to the truth about your God."
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:38.000]   That's the third idea.
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:42.000]   Just like you didn't choose to be born from your parents,
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:45.000]   no one who is a follower of Jesus chose that.
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.000]   God allowed that to happen.
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:48.000]   Just like I've got two kids.
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:51.000]   Neither one of them played any role in coming into existence.
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:53.000]   Mama, Daddy played that role.
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:55.000]   They didn't choose it.
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   They just got brought along, and James says, "He chose."
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:00.000]   That's the message of the Bible.
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:02.000]   He chose.
[00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:05.000]   Every Christian, every person, they don't get credit for it.
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:12.000]   This is why it's such unbelievably good news that you cannot escape, outrun.
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:15.000]   Work yourself out of a relationship with God if you've trusted in him,
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:18.000]   and you can hold on to that hope no matter what 2021 has,
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:20.000]   no matter what the rest of this year has.
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:25.000]   And James says, "Hold on to the truth about your God."
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:28.000]   No matter what you face and what you walk through,
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:32.000]   what he has done, what he will do, he is good.
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:35.000]   How do I know he proved it, James would say,
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:38.000]   when he gave his life for you, for me,
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:43.000]   for anyone who was simply accepted on the cross?
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:50.000]   Let me pray.
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:52.000]   I want to do something that we don't often do here,
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:58.000]   but I want to invite you to close your eyes.
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:03.000]   I know every single week there are hundreds of young adults who join us
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:07.000]   that are here for the first time, many of whom have never had a place
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:09.000]   or a moment where they put their faith in Jesus,
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:13.000]   and they've trusted in what Jesus did on the cross.
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:17.000]   And it would be such a miss, and I've just felt this burden from the Lord.
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:20.000]   There are some in this room who tonight,
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:24.000]   you feel God calling you into a relationship with him,
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:28.000]   inviting you to step out of the darkness of your life,
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:33.000]   out of the pain, out of whatever it is, and into his forgiveness,
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:38.000]   that you can experience at a soul level,
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:41.000]   beginning to be healed, forgiven,
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:45.000]   and what Jesus would say, completely righteous.
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:48.000]   No matter what you did today, what you do tomorrow,
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:51.000]   or 20 years from now, you will be in a moment forgiven,
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:53.000]   and it only happens one way,
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:57.000]   by receiving the free gift that Jesus gave us on the cross.
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:59.000]   And I would hate to end 2020 without giving you a chance
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:02.000]   for the most significant, important decision you're going to make
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:06.000]   for the rest of your life, for you to make,
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:10.000]   which is to put your faith in Christ.
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:13.000]   The invitation that God has given to just say, "Man, I'm a sinner.
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:18.000]   "I acknowledge I don't deserve to have a relationship
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:22.000]   "with the perfect, holy God.
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:26.000]   "But if what is written in the Bible and the gospel is true,
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:31.000]   "that you made a way for me to have that relationship
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:32.000]   "by giving your life for me,
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:34.000]   "I just want to accept that free gift by faith.
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:37.000]   "I'm putting my trust, not in me, but in Jesus."
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:39.000]   And if you're in that place, I want to invite you right now,
[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:41.000]   if you just raise your hand, everybody's eyes are closed,
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:43.000]   wherever you're at, and I want to lead you just in a prayer.
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:44.000]   And you're going to make the most important,
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:46.000]   significant decision you're going to make
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:48.000]   for the rest of your life.
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:54.000]   Wherever you are, raise a hand.
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:55.000]   If you're ready to say, "Man, I'm going all in.
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:58.000]   "I'm ready to accept God's grace, His forgiveness.
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:00.000]   "It was for me.
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:04.000]   "It was for me to see you down here, over here."
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:07.000]   I want to make the most important decision
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:15.000]   I'm going to make right here.
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:18.000]   Anyone else?
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:23.000]   We're here.
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:28.000]   Those who are raised hands, we just, I'm going to pray,
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:29.000]   and you just, wherever you're at, quietly,
[00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:31.000]   you can pray after me.
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:33.000]   The prayer to unsave you, the prayer is a reflection
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:36.000]   of the faith that you are expressing at heart level.
[00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:38.000]   There's no magic words.
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:41.000]   It's putting your trust in Jesus.
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:43.000]   Just wherever you're at, quietly, to yourself,
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:45.000]   as loud as you want.
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:49.000]   Father, I know I'm a sinner.
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:52.000]   I know that I don't deserve to have a relationship
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:59.000]   with a holy, perfect God.
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:04.000]   But I'm putting my trust in what you did
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:08.000]   through sending your son, Jesus,
[00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:11.000]   to die the death I deserved
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:15.000]   after living a life of perfection I couldn't live,
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:18.000]   and he did that for me.
[00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:21.000]   And I'm putting all of my faith, all of my trust,
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:24.000]   all of my hopes of eternity
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:29.000]   on no one other than Jesus
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:33.000]   and His death and His resurrection.
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:37.000]   I thank you that because He rose again,
[00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:40.000]   I will rise,
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:44.000]   and I will live forever with you in eternity.
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:50.000]   Take my life, use it,
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:53.000]   and make me more like your son,
[00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:59.000]   my Savior, Jesus.
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:02.000]   In His name we pray, amen.
