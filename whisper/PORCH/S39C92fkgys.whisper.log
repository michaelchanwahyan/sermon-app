[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:28.720]   - Alright, let's go, welcome friends to the room.
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:29.840]   (cheering)
[00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.600]   Friends in, get excited, El Paso, Fort Worth,
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.040]   Phoenix, Austin, Northwest Arkansas, Houston, Texas,
[00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.480]   Tulsa, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, wherever you're listening
[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.760]   to or wherever you are at listening in,
[00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.200]   we are excited to continue this series on mood.
[00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.900]   So I'm gonna start with a way that is particularly relevant
[00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.760]   to the people in Dallas inside of this room.
[00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.240]   So if you are listening at a later date or in from afar,
[00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.640]   just bear with us because we have had an eventful past
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.240]   couple days in Dallas, Texas.
[00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.360]   And if anything has been learned, in my opinion,
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.760]   it is that we as a city are not ready for the apocalypse.
[00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:11.600]   (laughing)
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.600]   Because it has been unreal how confronted
[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.640]   with how dependent we are, how unprepared we are,
[00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.600]   how no one knows how to stop at a four-way stop.
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.680]   (laughing)
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.560]   How much you use energy, I mean, like, what a reminder
[00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.680]   because everyone, if your power has been out,
[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.920]   anyone's power been out recently?
[00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.400]   Anyone wake up this morning, their power's been out?
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.900]   The rest of you guys just, man, escaped the storm.
[00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.240]   But for those of us who have been, it's been like,
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.920]   dude, you are so aware when something like that happens
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.920]   of how dependent you are on electricity.
[00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.360]   It's like we're all out in our car charging our phone
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.480]   like a bunch of addicts.
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.560]   It's like ridiculous.
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:56.240]   And you're never confronted more with just how,
[00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.480]   you know, self-service, 'cause even once you charge it,
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:59.900]   you lost service with people
[00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.280]   and how important a microwave is,
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.040]   or how just unable most people are to drive,
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.080]   and how gas stations, of course, being out of gas,
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.160]   and just everything you're kind of confronted with
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.100]   in a moment of how challenging it is,
[00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.580]   or would be if there ever was an apocalyptic situation,
[00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.200]   if you will.
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.600]   And yet, the reason I start there is because
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.720]   in the last few days, it's been such a reminder
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.680]   of how many things that in my life I take for granted,
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.120]   things that I just get so used to having,
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.400]   and the one good thing about having them all stripped away
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.040]   in a moment is that you're reminded how thankful you are
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.080]   for those things, how thankful you are
[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.840]   for just normal energy, how grateful you are
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.360]   that air conditioning is around, holler at your boy,
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.320]   how grateful you are for just modern things
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.320]   that every day we take for granted.
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.760]   And so tonight, we're gonna talk about a subject
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:52.940]   related to this mood series,
[00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.860]   and it's an emotion and a mood
[00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.600]   that really has a lot to do with that idea
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.360]   of just being grateful, and it's that, grateful.
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.320]   And gratefulness, here's what I know about the room.
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.080]   Nobody walked in tonight and said,
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.960]   "You know what my biggest felt need is in here?
[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.320]   "I need to hear a message on gratefulness."
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.160]   People came into the room,
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.840]   and they wanna know about how to handle money,
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.200]   dating, anxiety, maybe depression is something
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.540]   you're walking through, challenging times, hardship,
[00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.360]   but gratefulness, and that doesn't even feel like relevant.
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.360]   I feel like I'm a pretty grateful person in general,
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.560]   like I got this, you know, I say thank you
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.280]   whenever somebody does something nice for me,
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.720]   I'm grateful, let's move on.
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.720]   And yet the truth is that just like it was exposed
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:33.780]   by not having those things,
[00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.200]   we're reminded of how much we take things for granted,
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.520]   how often I fail to just drive through and be like,
[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.400]   "Man, thank you, Lord, that these lights work.
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.440]   "Thank you, Lord, that electricity's flowing."
[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.400]   In the same way, often, most of us live lives
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.120]   that are anything except marked by grateful and gratefulness.
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.400]   And yet the tragedy there is that gratefulness,
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.160]   as we're gonna explore and study from God's Word,
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.720]   is not just a command in the Bible.
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.360]   In other words, you cannot follow Jesus
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.000]   if you do not regularly practice gratefulness,
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.780]   regularly express gratefulness.
[00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.000]   Gratefulness is one of those things that's really like,
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.220]   we said, really of shame, it can be a gateway
[00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.440]   to all kinds of positive things inside of your life.
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:13.960]   Gratefulness leads to being generosity,
[00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:14.800]   it leads to encouragement,
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.080]   it leads to stronger relationships,
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.920]   as we're gonna talk about in a second.
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.720]   And gratefulness is not just something
[00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.040]   that the church or Christians have
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.320]   a corner on the market on.
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.560]   Secular studies have shown, here's what's crazy,
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.880]   that if you are grateful, if you will just include
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.200]   a habit of expressing things that you're thankful for
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.880]   in life, it will transform your life.
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.160]   There was one study done, or actually,
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.040]   it was a number of studies that concluded
[00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.880]   that if you will, for five minutes a week,
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.220]   do a daily gratitude journal, for five minutes a day,
[00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:43.640]   basically write out things you're thankful for,
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:47.040]   it will increase your long-term well-being
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.580]   by the same amount as doubling your income.
[00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.420]   Let me read that again.
[00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:54.180]   If you will practice for five minutes a day,
[00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:55.940]   studies show, in a secular sense,
[00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.700]   like non-Christian, non-related to any church stuff,
[00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.180]   if people will just practice, here,
[00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:01.620]   I'm writing out the things that I'm thankful for today,
[00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:02.500]   I'm thankful for these clothes,
[00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.340]   I'm thankful for something to eat,
[00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.740]   I'm thankful for a friend, I'm thankful for a roommate,
[00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.780]   I'm thankful for a car, if you will just do that
[00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.900]   for five minutes a day, even people outside of the church
[00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.060]   would say, it will transform your life
[00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:12.660]   as much as doubling your income.
[00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:17.360]   Here's what I know, if you make $45,000 in the room,
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.820]   and tonight I was like, hey, I'm gonna give you
[00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.740]   90 grand going forward, my guess is most of us
[00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.700]   are leaving happy, if that's your place.
[00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:26.380]   And that's exactly what these studies would say,
[00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.620]   and what God's word would say is that it's not just
[00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.280]   something that'll increase and improve your life,
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.140]   it is a command from him, and it's a command
[00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:35.740]   that works for our good every time,
[00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:37.800]   as even people outside of the church
[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.560]   are showing and professing.
[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.960]   Thanklessness, on the other hand,
[00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.300]   is one of the marks of someone who does not know God.
[00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:45.860]   In Romans chapter one, it says that,
[00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.260]   although they knew God, they did not honor Him
[00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.380]   as God nor give thanks to Him.
[00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:52.580]   And so as believers, we are called to have lives
[00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:53.740]   that are marked by gratefulness.
[00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:55.820]   So tonight, we're gonna talk about what it looks like,
[00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:58.340]   three components, biblically, of gratefulness.
[00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.620]   We've been in this series called Mood, what is Mood?
[00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:01.900]   If you're joining us for the first time,
[00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:03.540]   all the messages are on the PORCH app,
[00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:05.420]   or on the podcast, you can go check those out,
[00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:07.960]   but Mood is a look at human emotions
[00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.000]   from a biblical perspective.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.920]   A lot of people think that emotions are bad,
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.700]   why do I have those, I shouldn't have them at all,
[00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:15.460]   and a lot of people think emotions are everything,
[00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.140]   and so what does the Bible actually say
[00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:18.460]   as it relates to human emotions,
[00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:20.300]   what role should they play in our life?
[00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.460]   And we've said that emotion is a gift
[00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:25.100]   that God has given to the human race,
[00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:28.800]   and it's a gift particularly given in order to move us,
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.520]   that's what emotion, even the word emotion
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.660]   comes from a Latin word, mover, to move,
[00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:36.240]   and God gave the human race the gift of emotions
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.060]   to move us in a particular direction,
[00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.660]   to move us in the direction of Him
[00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:43.380]   and in the direction of His will.
[00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:45.260]   And so tonight, as it relates to gratefulness,
[00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:50.260]   Jesus is gonna say in a very clear way
[00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:51.580]   that the emotion of gratefulness
[00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:53.380]   should move you to a certain action.
[00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:54.660]   So we're gonna be in Luke chapter 17,
[00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:57.300]   if you take notes, you can just call this one grateful,
[00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:58.940]   and we will be in Luke chapter 17,
[00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:01.080]   we're gonna look at an interaction Jesus has
[00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:03.780]   with 10 gentlemen, 10 gentlemen,
[00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:05.240]   and we will pick it up there and explore
[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.900]   what He has to say about the subject of gratefulness.
[00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:12.980]   Starting verse 11 of chapter 17.
[00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:15.220]   Should be on the screens if you don't have,
[00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:17.660]   a Bible, in addition to the fact
[00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:18.480]   if you don't have a Bible,
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:19.480]   we've got some in the Welcome Center,
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:21.280]   that's our gift to you, you can get one tonight.
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:22.280]   Let me start in 11.
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:27.180]   Now on His way to Jerusalem, Jesus,
[00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:28.940]   Jesus traveled along the border
[00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:31.800]   between Samaria and Galilee.
[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:33.420]   As He was going into a village,
[00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:36.420]   10 men who had leprosy met Him,
[00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:39.060]   and they stood at a distance and they cried out,
[00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:40.460]   or they called out in a loud voice,
[00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.220]   "Jesus, Master, have pity on us."
[00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:43.900]   All right, let me stop.
[00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:45.360]   Most likely, nobody in this room
[00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:47.340]   has ever had leprosy before.
[00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:49.180]   It's not the best of diseases to contract.
[00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:50.380]   Here's what's going on with leprosy.
[00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:53.260]   It would be a disease that plagued the ancient world.
[00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:54.980]   It's a disease that really modern science
[00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:57.320]   and modern medicine has pretty much eradicated from our world
[00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:59.340]   but at this time, there wasn't a solution for it,
[00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:00.740]   there was no medicine, there was no cure.
[00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:02.220]   It would show up on your body one day
[00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:03.420]   and it was on your skin,
[00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:05.380]   and your skin would begin to erode.
[00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:07.060]   It would begin to make you lose sensation
[00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:10.420]   on all of your skin, your nose, your ears,
[00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:12.460]   things would begin to fall apart
[00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:13.800]   and it would spread all throughout your skin.
[00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:14.940]   It was highly contagious.
[00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:15.780]   So here's what happened.
[00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:17.960]   If you were a leper, you were immediately kicked out of town.
[00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:19.900]   The day you showed up or the day that you realized,
[00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:21.400]   "There's something growing on my skin,"
[00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:22.900]   was the worst day of your life
[00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:24.300]   because it would be the last moment
[00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:25.500]   you would ever hug your children,
[00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:27.740]   you would ever sleep next to your wife or your husband,
[00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:29.980]   it'd be the last moment you could be around society,
[00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:31.540]   you couldn't go to church anymore,
[00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:32.380]   you were a leper.
[00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:34.940]   Everywhere that you went, you had to yell out in advance,
[00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:37.000]   "Unclean, unclean," so that people knew,
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.900]   "Do not get near this person to not spread the disease."
[00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:42.060]   So this was a group of 10 men
[00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:43.460]   who had been living together 'cause it's like,
[00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:45.060]   "Hey, I'm not exactly gonna get
[00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:46.840]   "into the Jerusalem apartment complex,
[00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:48.280]   "so I've gotta hang out with some other boys
[00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:49.820]   "who've got the same disease as me."
[00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:51.360]   And so they all kind of united
[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:53.660]   and together they formed some little like colony,
[00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:57.420]   a leper colony outside in between Samaria and Galilee.
[00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:59.700]   And they sat there, cut off from their family,
[00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:01.440]   cut off from friends.
[00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:04.260]   And one day they hear about this man, Jesus,
[00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:05.100]   who's been showing up
[00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:06.460]   and apparently he's been doing miracles
[00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:08.020]   and doing things that have been impacting,
[00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:10.460]   changing lives, giving sight to blind people.
[00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:13.800]   And then one day Jesus walks in front of them
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:15.780]   and so the 10 of them get together and they cry out,
[00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:18.960]   "Jesus, have mercy or have pity on us."
[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:22.740]   And Jesus says, when he saw them,
[00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:26.620]   he said, "Go and show yourselves to the priests."
[00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:30.220]   The priests were the people who would allow,
[00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:34.540]   if you were a leper and somehow miraculously it went away,
[00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:36.180]   you'd have to go show yourself to the priest
[00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:38.420]   basically to get permission to go back in.
[00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:40.300]   In other words, to enter into society,
[00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:41.540]   if you were like, "Man, I think I've been healed
[00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:42.740]   "of leprosy," or whatever's going on,
[00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:44.180]   you'd go show yourself to a priest
[00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:45.580]   and the priest would have to do the inspection
[00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:47.860]   and be like, "Come into church and we gotta inspect
[00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:49.620]   "to make sure the leprosy is gone."
[00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:50.700]   And that's what they were doing.
[00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:52.340]   So Jesus says, "Hey, go show yourself."
[00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:53.620]   As though like, "Hey, you're gonna be healed
[00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:55.780]   "on the way that you walk to that priest."
[00:09:55.780 --> 00:10:01.280]   And as they went, they were cleansed.
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:03.380]   So they cried out to Jesus.
[00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:05.420]   Jesus says, "Go show yourself to the priest.
[00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:07.140]   "I'm answering your prayer."
[00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:08.500]   And they turn around, they start walking
[00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:09.660]   towards the city of Jerusalem.
[00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:12.180]   They haven't been there since they got kicked out.
[00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:15.140]   And as they're walking, their body begins to change
[00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:17.700]   and everything transforms.
[00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:19.600]   And they were healed of their leprosy.
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:25.220]   One of them, verse 15, when he saw that he was healed,
[00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:29.500]   he came back praising God in a loud voice
[00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:32.260]   and he threw himself at Jesus's feet and he thanked him.
[00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.720]   And he was a Samaritan.
[00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:40.100]   Jesus asked, "We're not all 10 cleansed?
[00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:42.200]   "Where are the other nine?
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:44.100]   "Has no one returned to give praise to God
[00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:45.300]   "except this foreigner?"
[00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:47.760]   And then he said to him, "Rise and go.
[00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:50.500]   "Your faith has made you well."
[00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:51.660]   We're gonna come back to that last line.
[00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:54.060]   But Jesus points that despite 10 being healed,
[00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:55.620]   only one of them comes back.
[00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:57.020]   Only one had the response.
[00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:58.820]   In other words, Jesus says, "This is the right
[00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:03.100]   "and appropriate response that is to be had."
[00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:04.020]   The first thing I wanna talk about
[00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:05.180]   as it relates to gratefulness,
[00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:08.560]   it's just this idea that gratefulness has this power to it
[00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:11.960]   and particularly has a power to strengthen relationships.
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:13.380]   Gratefulness, when it marks somebody's life,
[00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:16.100]   just like it marked this leper's life in that moment,
[00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:17.860]   has the power to strengthen relationships.
[00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:20.900]   Its presence in your relationships or in your life
[00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:22.300]   is gonna be something that is a part
[00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:24.260]   of strengthening your relationships with God
[00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.140]   and strengthening your relationships with others.
[00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:28.060]   This guy gives us an indication or a look
[00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:30.500]   at what that looks like with God.
[00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:34.340]   All 10 lepers had some interaction with Jesus
[00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:36.540]   and they had some experience and exposure to him,
[00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:40.980]   but all of them had only a skin-deep relationship
[00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:42.100]   that he healed the outside.
[00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:46.300]   But this man, he comes back and he expresses a praise
[00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:48.820]   and a thankfulness to God.
[00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:52.780]   And Jesus says something to him that he very rarely repeats
[00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:54.780]   all throughout the New Testament.
[00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:56.500]   Your faith has saved you.
[00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:59.860]   Lots of times he says to different men and women,
[00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:01.740]   different things, "Hey, let the dead bury the dead.
[00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:02.580]   "Leave your father behind."
[00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:03.420]   Do all these things.
[00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:04.260]   But he comes to this man and he says,
[00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:05.420]   "Hey, your faith has saved you.
[00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:07.860]   "That made you well is the same word for saved."
[00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:12.100]   That this man, because of his perspective on who Jesus was,
[00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:14.060]   his thankfulness and him moving in the direction
[00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:15.940]   of expressing that gratefulness,
[00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:17.960]   experienced a relationship with Jesus
[00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:19.580]   different from the other nine.
[00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:22.820]   Gratefulness always strengthens relationships
[00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:25.380]   and you having gratefulness in your life
[00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:28.300]   is a part of the criteria that will strengthen
[00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:30.460]   your relationship with God
[00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:34.840]   or the absence of gratefulness will lead to a weakening
[00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:35.940]   of your relationship with God.
[00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:37.740]   A weakening of your faith would be another way of saying it
[00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:40.140]   and a strengthening of your relationship
[00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:42.260]   with other people in your life.
[00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.580]   How does being thankful to God
[00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:46.700]   strengthen your relationship with him?
[00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:48.180]   Well, here's how.
[00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:49.300]   Anytime that I'm thankful to God,
[00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:50.360]   anytime that I'm like, "Lord, hey,
[00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:51.200]   "I just wanna thank you for this day.
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:53.440]   "I wanna thank you for the fact that I'm alive
[00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:55.500]   "and another day was given me that I wasn't promised.
[00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:57.180]   "I woke up this morning, a lot of people didn't.
[00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:58.300]   "I've got legs that I can walk.
[00:12:58.300 --> 00:12:59.140]   "Thank you, God."
[00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:01.220]   Whenever I just begin to assume, "God, thank you.
[00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:03.100]   "Everything in my life is a gift."
[00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:05.560]   It's a reflection of a humility
[00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:07.100]   that I don't see anything that I have
[00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:08.140]   as something that I earned.
[00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:11.020]   You know, I really deserve this and I worked really hard,
[00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:12.060]   but everything's been a gift.
[00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:14.840]   As 1 Corinthians 4, chapter four, verse seven says that,
[00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:17.140]   "What do you have that you did not receive?"
[00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:18.440]   Let me just read it.
[00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:20.900]   "What do you have that God hasn't given you?
[00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:22.660]   "And if everything you have is from God,
[00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:24.420]   "why do you boast as though it were not a gift?"
[00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:26.880]   One of the things that thankfulness
[00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:27.880]   in a relationship with God,
[00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:30.240]   expressing thanks towards God regularly does
[00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:36.180]   is it fights against pride and it fuels praise in my life.
[00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:37.680]   In other words, everything inside of my life
[00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:39.280]   where I'm tempted to,
[00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:40.600]   "Hey, I worked really hard on that project."
[00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:41.440]   Maybe it's for you.
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:42.980]   You're like, "Hey, you know, I worked really hard.
[00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:44.920]   "I got a promotion, I got a raise, and I deserved it.
[00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:46.540]   "I earned it, I worked really hard.
[00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:47.800]   "I stayed after hours.
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:51.340]   "I gave all that I, you know, of my effort to that project
[00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:52.840]   "and I feel like I earned it."
[00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:56.520]   That's a posture that fuels pride.
[00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:58.120]   Versus a posture of God.
[00:13:58.120 --> 00:13:59.960]   "Hey, you're the one who gave me this job.
[00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:02.400]   "You're the reason that I got an education in the first place.
[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:04.460]   "You gave me a mind that works.
[00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:06.300]   "You allowed my body to get up and have the strength
[00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:08.240]   "to work later hours."
[00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:09.680]   All of a sudden, what is an opportunity
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:11.220]   for me to be tempted to have pride
[00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:13.560]   becomes an opportunity to turn towards praise in God.
[00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:15.260]   One of the ways that thankfulness strengthens
[00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:16.820]   your relationship is in vocalizing,
[00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:17.920]   "God, thank you.
[00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:20.860]   "Thank you for a car that even though it's broken down,
[00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:23.000]   "I have a car.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.900]   "Thank you for another night to just come and worship you.
[00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:26.600]   "How many people in our world would love
[00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:28.260]   "to have the freedom to get to do that?"
[00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.560]   It keeps me in a place of humility.
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:35.760]   And instead of fueling pride, it fuels praise to God.
[00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:39.580]   As we're told in 1 Peter chapter five,
[00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:43.740]   "Pride will keep you in the opposition of God."
[00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:45.560]   In other words, if you see yourself as,
[00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:49.700]   "Hey, what I have, I earned and I deserve, that is pride."
[00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:51.820]   And that will hinder your relationship with God.
[00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:53.380]   It says, "He gives grace to the humble,
[00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:54.500]   "but he opposes the proud."
[00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:55.820]   In other words, you're the opposition
[00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:57.500]   or in the opposition of God.
[00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:59.120]   So of course it's gonna hinder your relationship
[00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:01.160]   versus a thankfulness that,
[00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:03.680]   "God, everything that I have is because of you.
[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:05.940]   "I don't deserve any of this.
[00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:07.420]   "And I'm gonna turn everything in my life
[00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:09.340]   "as a chance to just thank you
[00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:11.320]   "and point it all back to you."
[00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:12.420]   Which fuels the praise.
[00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:15.140]   It not only strengthens your relationship with God,
[00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:17.100]   it's a chance to strengthen your relationship
[00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:18.840]   with other people.
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:21.000]   When someone does something for you
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.380]   or when you do something for someone else
[00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:25.580]   and they don't thank you, we all notice it.
[00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:27.460]   When I go out of my way, I'm planning a party
[00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:31.020]   or I go out of my way to provide for my team
[00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:33.580]   or to do something for my wife and nothing is said,
[00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:36.020]   I'm going, "Okay, huh, when is that gonna happen here?"
[00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:41.020]   It creates this disruption in our relationship
[00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:43.440]   where I'm like, "Does she think she's entitled to this?
[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:44.280]   "Does she deserve it?
[00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:45.860]   "Did she even realize what I did there?"
[00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:47.640]   And all of a sudden, what was an opportunity
[00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:49.460]   for us to move closer to one another,
[00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:51.060]   together intimacy becomes an opportunity
[00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:53.020]   where insecurity, entitlement,
[00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:54.260]   questioning begins to breathe in.
[00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:56.100]   If you wanna have stronger relationships,
[00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:59.140]   a stronger dating relationship, say thank you.
[00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:01.340]   Whatever amount that you think is the amount
[00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:03.780]   of saying thank you, multiply it times 10.
[00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:05.980]   Say thank you, say thank you at your boss.
[00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:09.020]   If you wanna excel more in your organization, say thank you.
[00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:10.940]   Even to people that you work with that you're like,
[00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:12.280]   "Well, I don't really have to say thank you to them.
[00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:13.120]   "They get a paycheck."
[00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:15.160]   Say thank you.
[00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:17.340]   If you wanna be more attractive overnight,
[00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:18.700]   if you got hit with the ugly stick
[00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:20.420]   and you're wondering how can I look more attractive
[00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:22.780]   tomorrow, guys, this is for you, this is free.
[00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:24.320]   Be someone who is grateful.
[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:26.900]   Be someone who is thankful that,
[00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:28.180]   "Hey, I don't deserve any of this."
[00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:30.280]   Thank you for giving your time.
[00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:31.380]   Thank you.
[00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:33.540]   And you're not entitled to anything.
[00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:34.940]   You're entitled to hell.
[00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:36.260]   That's what the Bible says.
[00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:39.260]   So everything else sprinkles on top,
[00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.140]   the fact that I'm not going to hell.
[00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:43.180]   And so I can be thankful for anything and everything.
[00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:45.980]   And the Bible says that God commands it.
[00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:48.620]   First Thessalonians chapter five verse 17 says,
[00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:50.700]   "Give thanks in every situation,
[00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:53.180]   "in everything that you experience.
[00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:55.440]   "And thankfulness will strengthen your relationship
[00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:57.140]   "with your roommate."
[00:16:57.140 --> 00:16:57.980]   Say thank you.
[00:16:57.980 --> 00:16:58.900]   If they pay the bills every month
[00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:01.740]   and you Venmo them afterwards, say thank you.
[00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:04.180]   Use everything, amen, yes, amen.
[00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:06.820]   And pay them if you told them where you were going to.
[00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:10.500]   But if you wanna have stronger relationships,
[00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:12.440]   be more of God's man and God's woman,
[00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:15.460]   have the type of relationships that are for one another,
[00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:17.740]   saying thank you is a path towards that
[00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:19.260]   because it always, anytime thankfulness
[00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:21.820]   or gratefulness is present, it strengthens relationship.
[00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:23.440]   And the absence is true.
[00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:24.820]   Anytime that it's not there,
[00:17:24.820 --> 00:17:27.940]   it erodes or has the potential to erode relationships.
[00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:29.660]   I remember not long ago,
[00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:31.060]   I had a friend who was getting married
[00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:33.540]   and I found out what hotel him and his wife
[00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:35.320]   were gonna stay in the night that they got married.
[00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:37.180]   So we got married and then we're gonna go to this hotel.
[00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:38.100]   So I called the hotel.
[00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:39.380]   Sometimes I'll do this for friends
[00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:40.340]   and I'll just ask the hotel,
[00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:42.900]   "Hey, can you upgrade their room?
[00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:44.520]   "And can you put in their room
[00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:47.740]   "some chocolate-covered strawberries and some champagne,
[00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:49.600]   "or if that offends you, some grape juice,
[00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:52.260]   "and whatever the hotel kind of offers."
[00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:54.700]   And sometimes they'll do it for free, sometimes they won't.
[00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:55.880]   This time they didn't and I was like,
[00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:57.100]   "It's all right, I'll cover it."
[00:17:57.100 --> 00:17:59.100]   And it'll just be kind of a wedding gift
[00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:02.140]   and gave him this whole setup.
[00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:05.300]   And I never heard from him.
[00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:07.160]   And so I gave like the chocolate-covered strawberries
[00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:08.180]   and the champagne, I'm like, "Oh, that's great.
[00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:09.620]   "They're gonna go on their honeymoon, fine.
[00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:11.540]   "I'm sure it'll be great."
[00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:13.540]   And I'm not doing it for the thanks, no big deal.
[00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:14.720]   But hopefully they got it.
[00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:17.260]   And you begin to wonder, I wonder if they even got it.
[00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:19.200]   Maybe they sent it to the wrong room.
[00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:21.820]   And I began to question,
[00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:23.420]   maybe they're allergic to strawberries
[00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:24.660]   and I just ruined their entire wedding
[00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:27.060]   or entire honeymoon they're about to be a part of.
[00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:28.840]   Maybe they were offended
[00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:30.940]   that the pastor sent the grape juice.
[00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:34.380]   And maybe they, I don't know.
[00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:37.940]   And then I remember seeing him that next time
[00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:39.660]   and I remember thinking,
[00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:41.100]   I don't even know how to ask about this
[00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:42.420]   'cause I wanna make sure that they did,
[00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:45.740]   I don't wanna be like, "Well, how was the hotel room, huh?"
[00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:47.500]   (audience laughing)
[00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:48.620]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:50.540]   They're like, "No, I'm asking about
[00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:55.740]   "the chocolate-covered strawberries, very literally."
[00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:59.980]   And so like to this day, I've never ever brought it up.
[00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:02.100]   And Jerry, if you're listening, you know who you are.
[00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:04.980]   And that's not true.
[00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:06.380]   It's not Jerry, that's a made-up name.
[00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:09.140]   But one thing, this opportunity,
[00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:10.900]   this opportunity that would have been something
[00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:14.380]   that's like, man, thank you, a strengthening of relationship
[00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:16.940]   all of a sudden leads to hesitation in,
[00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:20.540]   I'm not sure that either I should have given that gift
[00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:22.300]   or I should in the future give that gift.
[00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:23.140]   Think about that.
[00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:23.960]   What could have been something
[00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:24.980]   that strengthens relationships,
[00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:27.020]   strengthens, sets a precedent for doing it in the future,
[00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:28.540]   all of a sudden it becomes a chance of,
[00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:29.940]   I'm not even sure that that was worth it
[00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:32.140]   or that it even got delivered.
[00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:34.780]   That an opportunity to express appreciation
[00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:38.340]   led to hesitation for future things
[00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:39.940]   or future times that I would do it,
[00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:41.620]   which really leads into the second idea.
[00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:43.380]   And this is so huge, and I hope you're listening,
[00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:44.540]   especially for our generation.
[00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:46.460]   The second component from this story that we see
[00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:49.180]   is that gratefulness not expressed
[00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:51.980]   is gratefulness not experienced.
[00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:54.500]   Gratefulness not expressed is gratefulness not experienced.
[00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:55.700]   Pretty simple on the face,
[00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:57.500]   but let's talk about it for a second.
[00:19:57.500 --> 00:19:59.980]   What was different about this one leper?
[00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:03.940]   Was it that he felt grateful?
[00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:07.380]   My guess is that all the other nine felt grateful.
[00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:08.220]   I mean, think about it.
[00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:09.700]   'Cause you've been living in a leper colony
[00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:12.540]   with nine other dudes, your face has fallen off,
[00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:14.940]   and one day this guy shows up and everything changes.
[00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:16.060]   You're healed, you're back to normal.
[00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:17.680]   You can go home, you can hug your kids,
[00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:19.340]   you can sleep in bed again with everybody,
[00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:23.100]   you can enter back into society, you can go to church again.
[00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:25.240]   What was the best day of your life?
[00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:30.100]   That day, that day you met that man who saved you,
[00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:31.740]   who changed you, who healed you.
[00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:34.700]   My guess is that all of them felt grateful,
[00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:38.040]   but only one of them expressed gratefulness.
[00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:41.840]   And this is so true, it's so profoundly true.
[00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:43.400]   And I need you to hear me because most of you are like,
[00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:44.240]   "Oh yeah, I get that."
[00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:45.080]   You don't get it.
[00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:48.400]   Because if you did, it would transform the way
[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:49.640]   that you interact the number of times
[00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:51.640]   you're constantly saying, "I'm thankful,"
[00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:53.000]   or "Thank you for doing that."
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.880]   Gratitude, any time you were thankful
[00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:56.360]   and you do not express it.
[00:20:56.360 --> 00:21:01.720]   Gratitude not expressed is not experienced
[00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:03.300]   by the other person.
[00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:06.040]   If anything, often gratitude not expressed,
[00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:07.720]   just like in that scenario with like the champagne
[00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:09.920]   and chocolate scrubbed strawberries,
[00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:12.680]   gratitude not expressed is not just experienced
[00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:16.680]   as confusion, it can be experienced as rejection
[00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:18.380]   or they're entitled.
[00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:21.160]   It's not just the absence of some like nice,
[00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:23.880]   oh, positive thank you on top.
[00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:26.880]   It becomes a, man, I don't even think they cared about that.
[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:30.920]   That gratitude always shows up and it always speaks up.
[00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:33.900]   True gratitude should move you to action.
[00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:35.560]   So anytime you were thankful, it's an opportunity
[00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:37.380]   that God is trying to get ahold of you to say,
[00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:40.440]   "Thank you," to move you in the direction of thanking God,
[00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:41.920]   move you in the direction of thanking
[00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:43.280]   other people around you.
[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:45.600]   Gratitude that is felt is worthless
[00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:47.240]   unless it moves you to do something,
[00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:50.120]   whether that is praise God or thank people
[00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:51.960]   that God has put inside of your life.
[00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:56.280]   I wrote in my notes that gratitude that's not expressed
[00:21:56.280 --> 00:22:00.200]   is experienced as either rejection or entitlement
[00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:02.880]   on behalf of the person who fails to express it.
[00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:08.280]   The other interesting thing about gratefulness
[00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:11.000]   is that the more grateful you are,
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.780]   the more you express gratefulness,
[00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:15.440]   it's like that part of your heart continues to grow.
[00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:18.200]   In other words, the people who are most likely
[00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:20.280]   to express thank you to other people around you,
[00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:21.560]   it's like the more that you express it,
[00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:24.580]   the more that aspect grows inside of your heart.
[00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:25.600]   The more that you find yourself going,
[00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:26.560]   "God, thank you for another day.
[00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:28.920]   "Thank you that even though my car is broken down,
[00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:29.960]   "I have a car.
[00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:30.960]   "Thank you that I have friends.
[00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:33.120]   "Thank you that Uber and Lyft exist.
[00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:34.660]   "Thank you that I've got people in my life
[00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:35.720]   "that can come pick me up.
[00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:36.600]   "Thank you that I have a job."
[00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:38.080]   The more that you see,
[00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:39.800]   or the more that you express gratefulness,
[00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:42.600]   the more that attribute grows inside of your heart,
[00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:44.140]   the easier it is to express.
[00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:46.840]   And the flip side is also true.
[00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:51.320]   The more that you complain, the easier it is to complain.
[00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:53.520]   Like as I was thinking through it,
[00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:56.120]   the illustration that I was thinking through was this.
[00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:57.720]   In life, everyone has heard,
[00:22:57.720 --> 00:22:59.720]   or probably most of us have heard the old adage of,
[00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:04.080]   "Hey, is the glass half empty or is the glass half full?"
[00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:05.360]   Anyone heard this before?
[00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:08.760]   I'm gonna answer one time definitively for everybody
[00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:10.840]   if it's half empty or half full.
[00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:12.800]   Because it doesn't have anything to do with your wiring,
[00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:14.800]   it doesn't have anything to do with how you were raised,
[00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:16.560]   or how you grew up, or how you see the world.
[00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:19.440]   It has everything to do with one simple thing.
[00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:24.440]   Is the glass being emptied, or is it being filled?
[00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:27.700]   In other words, is this half empty or is it half full?
[00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:30.520]   Well, as it's emptying out, it would be half empty,
[00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:32.360]   versus as this is being filled up,
[00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:33.620]   it's gonna be half full.
[00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:35.080]   Everyone following me?
[00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:36.120]   Does this make sense?
[00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:37.480]   You guys like, "What is going on over here
[00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:38.720]   "with the water running?"
[00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:39.920]   (audience laughing)
[00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:41.440]   Does everyone, hey, I'm not moving on
[00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:44.360]   'til every head in here gets it, okay?
[00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:45.640]   And I see you, okay?
[00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:46.560]   Hey, here's the deal.
[00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:48.320]   In other words, is it half empty or half full?
[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:49.160]   Well, it depends.
[00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:51.480]   If it's emptying, then it's half empty.
[00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:53.320]   If it's filling up, then it would be half full.
[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:54.920]   It depends on what is going in it
[00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:56.400]   or what is coming out of it.
[00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:57.520]   Does that make sense?
[00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:00.020]   How does this have anything to do with gratefulness?
[00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:05.000]   Some of us inside of the room are master complainers.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.080]   We have mastered the ability to complain about anything.
[00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:11.800]   And when I say anything, I mean anything.
[00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:13.480]   And so you're able to drive down the road,
[00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:14.440]   and instead of being thankful that,
[00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:16.320]   man, this road is great, and I can't believe it,
[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:17.960]   I live in a country like this, and this is amazing,
[00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:19.800]   you're like, "Oh, my goodness,
[00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:23.780]   "can everyone just drive the speed limit, please?
[00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:25.160]   "What are you doing?"
[00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:27.760]   And you get here, and you park in the car,
[00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:28.920]   and you're not like, "Wow, this is like,
[00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:31.180]   "it's an amazing gathering on a Tuesday night
[00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:34.980]   "that I get to come to, and it's totally free,
[00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:37.480]   "and I get to hang out and be around friends."
[00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:40.160]   You show up, and you're like, "Ah, the parking!
[00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:41.880]   "What is wrong with this church?
[00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:44.400]   "This is ridiculous, where is the golf cart?
[00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:47.400]   "One golf cart for 4,000 people?
[00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:48.880]   "Is this a joke?"
[00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:51.840]   I mean, you've mastered the ability
[00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:53.760]   to complain about anything.
[00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:56.320]   I mean, people will complain about the weather,
[00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:58.600]   and I hear the same thing during different seasons
[00:24:58.600 --> 00:24:59.700]   from the same person, where it's like,
[00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:03.000]   "Ah, summer, it's gonna be so hot."
[00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:05.780]   And then winter comes around, and it's like,
[00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:09.160]   "Ah, oh, I just hate the cold, I can't stand the cold."
[00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:11.360]   It's like, up and down, nothing's gonna please you.
[00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:13.900]   And you say, "I just wish we lived in San Diego,
[00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:15.200]   "it'd be 72 year round."
[00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:17.400]   You know what you would do if you lived in San Diego?
[00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:18.440]   Man, now I'm just going.
[00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:20.200]   Okay, if you lived in San Diego,
[00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:22.800]   you wouldn't be happy with 72, you'd be like,
[00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:24.640]   "Ah, I wish we had seasons.
[00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:27.260]   "That's gotta be great to have seasons."
[00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:28.880]   Because you have mastered the ability
[00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:30.000]   to complain about anything.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.640]   It is an art, and many of us have conquered it.
[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:33.880]   And it's something that you can,
[00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:35.800]   just like you can complain about anything,
[00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:38.560]   there is a way to experience praising or thanking God,
[00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:40.760]   being grateful about anything.
[00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:42.840]   And the reason why this illustration is relevant
[00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:44.840]   is just like in that scenario of complaining.
[00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:46.720]   How do you know if your life is half empty or half full?
[00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:48.940]   If you complain, every time you and I complain,
[00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:50.680]   it's something where it's just sucking the life out,
[00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:51.600]   sucking the life out.
[00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:53.440]   Oh, this is so terrible.
[00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:55.080]   I can't believe my job, I showed up,
[00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:56.840]   and they're like, "Oh, we got new health insurance,
[00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:58.000]   "you gotta fill these forms out."
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:59.040]   Can you believe that?
[00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:02.680]   I'm so, you have health insurance, that's amazing.
[00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:04.840]   You show up in the food trucks, you're like,
[00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:06.560]   "No, the slider food trucks aren't here tonight,
[00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:09.320]   "unbelievable, I'm going home, this is ridiculous.
[00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:12.280]   "I'm supposed to eat at the piggy pork thing over here?"
[00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:15.440]   I mean, it's true.
[00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:17.880]   Where you can complain, and you're draining your life
[00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:18.700]   every time that you do it.
[00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:19.840]   Then the flip side is also true.
[00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:21.240]   Here's what's crazy.
[00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:22.160]   It's like you can live a life,
[00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:24.080]   you can be someone who's not getting complained
[00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:26.240]   and drained all the time,
[00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:29.680]   but by being grateful, you will gain all the time.
[00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:30.720]   In other words, you're gonna come in,
[00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:31.720]   you're gonna be driving along the road,
[00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:33.600]   you're gonna be like, "Man, I'm sitting in traffic.
[00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:38.120]   "Gosh, Lord, thank you that there are people all around me."
[00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:40.280]   Which means there are lots of people who need Jesus.
[00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:41.960]   There's a lot of men and women inside of this city,
[00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:43.320]   and I thank you that there's a chance
[00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:44.980]   that I get to be a part of connecting them
[00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:45.820]   to the body of Christ.
[00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:47.640]   "Thank you that there are food trucks.
[00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:49.940]   "Slider's not here, so I get to try something new.
[00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:52.120]   "God, I'm filling it up."
[00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:54.000]   "Thank you that somebody else called the food trucks."
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.320]   I don't even know how to call the food truck,
[00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:56.360]   but somebody called 'em,
[00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:57.540]   and they got 'em here to be a part of it.
[00:26:57.540 --> 00:26:59.300]   "Thank you that at work I have health insurance.
[00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:00.460]   "Thank you that the weather's hot,
[00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:02.320]   "'cause it reminds me to be thankful for AC,
[00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:03.260]   "and it's cold outside.
[00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:04.600]   "I get to be thankful for the heat."
[00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:06.140]   That no matter what life throws at you,
[00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:08.660]   you're able to say, "Man, I am thankful,
[00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:11.220]   "and my life isn't drained from it,
[00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:13.060]   "and it gains, and it adds to it."
[00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:18.080]   Study after study shows what the Bible says,
[00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:20.720]   which is that if you want to have joy in your life,
[00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:22.680]   express gratitude.
[00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:24.920]   In other words, it's not happy, joyful people
[00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:25.780]   that are thankful.
[00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:27.600]   Thankful people are joyful,
[00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:29.060]   and they're able to see,
[00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:31.380]   in the midst of whatever life throws at them,
[00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:32.220]   man, God is at work.
[00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:35.960]   I can choose to be thankful, or don't,
[00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:36.960]   and you complain,
[00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:38.740]   and your life will always be half empty.
[00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:39.580]   Things will always be,
[00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:42.400]   "Ah, man, I'm so depressed about this."
[00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:43.800]   And you're gonna get around other people
[00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:44.640]   who will like feed into it,
[00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:46.300]   and they're like, "Yeah, the sliders.
[00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:47.140]   "I can't believe that.
[00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:47.960]   "That was terrible."
[00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:50.240]   And you're just gonna continue to drain your life,
[00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:51.900]   and it's funny, and I'm joking,
[00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:54.500]   but I couldn't be more serious.
[00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:56.660]   Think about how often you complain,
[00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:59.080]   and it is sucking the life out of you,
[00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:00.700]   and God who's there commanded,
[00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:03.360]   in Philippians chapter two, verse 14,
[00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:06.600]   "Do everything without grumbling or complaining."
[00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:08.920]   It's the same word there.
[00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:12.120]   That you were to do everything in life
[00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:14.240]   without ever complaining,
[00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:15.920]   which is like everything, Paul,
[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:17.100]   that feels a little aggressive.
[00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:18.240]   What about when the power's out?
[00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:19.880]   Everything in life,
[00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:23.600]   Paul would say, without complaining.
[00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:26.700]   And he would say, in 1 Thessalonians,
[00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:28.460]   what we read earlier,
[00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:30.420]   "Give thanks in every circumstance,
[00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:33.120]   "for this is God's will for you."
[00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:33.960]   What is God's will?
[00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:34.800]   That is crazy.
[00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:36.160]   That was so convicting to me,
[00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:38.240]   as candidly somebody who just was so frustrated
[00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:40.640]   by all the different things for the past two days.
[00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:43.080]   I wonder about God's will for my life,
[00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:43.920]   and where does he want me,
[00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:46.940]   and what's the future hold for us?
[00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:48.320]   And then you read verses like this,
[00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:49.840]   and it's like, oh, this is God's will.
[00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:52.360]   Be thankful in every circumstance.
[00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:56.460]   That he doesn't say be thankful for every circumstance,
[00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:59.660]   but he says, hey, you can choose to be thankful
[00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:01.740]   in every circumstance,
[00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:03.180]   in the midst of whatever you're walking through.
[00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:04.840]   If you are a follower of Jesus,
[00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:07.220]   in the midst of whatever you're walking through,
[00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:08.040]   you can be thankful,
[00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:10.180]   knowing that God's promised to work everything
[00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:11.380]   together for your good.
[00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:14.220]   That whatever you're facing,
[00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:15.500]   he's more than enough to get you through.
[00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:17.300]   There's a list of things that you can,
[00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:18.780]   in the midst of whatever you're walking through,
[00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:19.620]   whatever you're facing,
[00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:20.940]   you can be thankful, Paul would say,
[00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:21.780]   in your command.
[00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:22.600]   So here's what we're gonna do.
[00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:24.460]   We're gonna practice this really quick.
[00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:25.960]   Everyone take out their phone.
[00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:29.260]   On your phone, hopefully you have text messaging,
[00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:30.820]   hopefully it works.
[00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:32.220]   We're gonna right now take a chance.
[00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:33.620]   I want everyone to text someone
[00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:35.300]   and say thank you for something.
[00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:37.220]   We're just gonna do it right now.
[00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:38.500]   We're all gonna try it together.
[00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:40.060]   Some of you maybe have never done this before,
[00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:41.300]   so let me try it,
[00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:42.860]   and let me get your head start on it.
[00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:44.380]   I'm gonna give you the first three words,
[00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:46.020]   and you got it from there.
[00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:47.760]   Thank you for.
[00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:49.700]   Thank you for.
[00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:51.800]   Don't text the person right next to you.
[00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:54.040]   Just turn to them and say thank you for.
[00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:58.700]   And if you get text message from somebody right next to you,
[00:29:58.700 --> 00:29:59.980]   I need you to raise your hand,
[00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:01.740]   'cause we're putting their head under the bucket.
[00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:05.260]   And we're all gonna, I mean it, right now.
[00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:06.860]   Here, I'm gonna do it right now.
[00:30:06.860 --> 00:30:11.440]   (gentle music)
[00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:14.440]   (audience laughing)
[00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:17.020]   (gentle music)
[00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:20.020]   (audience laughing)
[00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:46.720]   I didn't mind.
[00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:49.040]   This shouldn't take too much longer.
[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:53.240]   Unless you're that novel person.
[00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:56.840]   We all have that person in our life.
[00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:59.640]   All right, that's it.
[00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:01.160]   All right, hey, now here's the next thing.
[00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:07.160]   I wanna give a chance to do that and express to God.
[00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:09.320]   There are a billion things we should be thankful for
[00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:10.160]   that we take for granted.
[00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:11.160]   So right now, let's just pray,
[00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:12.320]   and wherever you're at right now,
[00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:14.320]   just pray thank you God for X.
[00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:17.820]   (congregation murmuring)
[00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:41.240]   Amen.
[00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:45.480]   If you're here tonight, you're here for the first time,
[00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:48.400]   we do this every week, and no, that's not true.
[00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:51.720]   But the point of that practice is just to begin,
[00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:53.640]   like if you and I will begin to take those steps,
[00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:55.440]   gratefulness is like this contagious thing.
[00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:57.800]   It grows and grows and grows inside of your heart.
[00:31:57.800 --> 00:31:59.960]   And the opposite is true.
[00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:03.800]   Discontentment, complaining, envy, those things will grow,
[00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:05.600]   and you can combat them.
[00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:07.240]   There's a lot of positive moods
[00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:08.720]   and a lot of negative moods.
[00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:10.040]   Gratefulness is one of those moods
[00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:13.200]   that can pull you out of some of the negative moods.
[00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:14.640]   God created it that way.
[00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:17.480]   He created you to praise and to thank people,
[00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:19.520]   to praise Him and thank others,
[00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:21.360]   live in that relationship with Him
[00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:23.320]   and relationship with others.
[00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:26.640]   The final component of having a gratefulness mark your life
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:29.400]   is really looking at the origin
[00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:30.360]   of where gratefulness comes from.
[00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:33.120]   It's this gratefulness flows from the right perspective.
[00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:35.480]   I mentioned this earlier,
[00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:39.100]   but what did Jesus do for this man
[00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:40.840]   that He didn't do for the other nine?
[00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:44.840]   Like we said earlier, He looks at him and He says,
[00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:47.760]   "Hey, your faith has made you well."
[00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:49.220]   What a weird sentence.
[00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:52.000]   What are you saying there, Jesus?
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.240]   Your faith has made you well?
[00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:55.320]   Well, what about the other nine?
[00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:56.880]   Did their faith make them well?
[00:32:56.880 --> 00:33:00.960]   Clearly, there's something different that happened here.
[00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:03.200]   Like we said, in a moment of clarity,
[00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:05.600]   this man had the right perspective on who Jesus was,
[00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:07.840]   and it says he threw himself at Jesus' feet
[00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:09.860]   and he began to praise God.
[00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:12.440]   He saw this man as the Savior that he was,
[00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:13.660]   that he had the right perspective
[00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:15.500]   and it fueled a gratefulness in his life.
[00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:17.860]   If you're gonna have not a momentary,
[00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:20.580]   a fleeting kind of thank you, Lord, for this day
[00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:23.360]   and for this food and bless us, amen,
[00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:24.520]   but if you're gonna have a gratefulness
[00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:25.960]   that really marks your life continually,
[00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:28.380]   no matter what you face in every circumstance,
[00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:30.540]   it's gonna flow from the right perspective.
[00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:33.320]   What is the right perspective?
[00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:35.180]   It's a perspective that comes
[00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:37.600]   from having the right perspective
[00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:39.340]   or way that you see Jesus
[00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:40.580]   and the way that you see this life,
[00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:42.080]   the way that you see eternity.
[00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:44.260]   I'll explain what I mean,
[00:33:44.260 --> 00:33:45.860]   but let me give you an example of a guy
[00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:47.380]   who had the right perspective.
[00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:50.620]   The way that he saw our world
[00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:52.720]   because of who he saw Jesus was
[00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:54.740]   and who Jesus was to him transformed the way
[00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:55.980]   that he thought about his time,
[00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:57.740]   about his life, about his stuff.
[00:33:57.740 --> 00:33:58.700]   It's a guy named Matthew Henry.
[00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:02.340]   He was a famous theologian from the 1600s,
[00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:03.300]   lived in England.
[00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:05.420]   He was basically a well-known celebrity,
[00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:08.520]   think Billy Graham of the 1600s in England.
[00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:09.860]   And he's walking home one day
[00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:11.120]   and he just finished work.
[00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:12.500]   And on his way home from work,
[00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:14.300]   he gets robbed by a bunch of people.
[00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:18.260]   And they take everything that he has.
[00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:20.540]   And he goes home and he journals out
[00:34:20.540 --> 00:34:22.140]   and begins to thank God.
[00:34:22.140 --> 00:34:25.380]   And you're like, what are you thanking God for
[00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:27.020]   after you just got robbed
[00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:28.780]   and they took all of your money?
[00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:29.780]   Here's what he says.
[00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:35.340]   I thank you God that I've never been robbed before.
[00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:38.180]   Thank you that although they took my wallet,
[00:34:38.180 --> 00:34:39.540]   they didn't take my life.
[00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:43.560]   Thank you that although they took all that I had,
[00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:45.220]   all that I had was not very much.
[00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:49.220]   Thank you that it was I who was robbed
[00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:51.920]   and not I who did the robbing.
[00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:56.580]   Matthew Henry's right perspective allowed him
[00:34:56.580 --> 00:34:57.700]   even in the midst of getting robbed,
[00:34:57.700 --> 00:34:59.820]   hey, I can name four things right off the bat
[00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:00.880]   I'm thankful for.
[00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:03.180]   How crazy is that?
[00:35:03.180 --> 00:35:06.460]   Well, it's only crazy if you don't see it
[00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:07.740]   through the perspective that Matthew Henry
[00:35:07.740 --> 00:35:08.900]   saw it through.
[00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:11.780]   The perspective that, hey, Jesus is the savior of my life,
[00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:13.260]   which means everything that I've ever done
[00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:15.500]   inside of this life has been paid for on the cross.
[00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:18.700]   He took my place so that I wouldn't have to go to hell.
[00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:20.860]   And so now I get to spend whatever time I have left
[00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:23.700]   on this earth trying to make him as famous as possible
[00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:25.940]   and reach as many lost people as possible
[00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:26.940]   for the name of Jesus
[00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:29.240]   so that they don't have to go to hell either.
[00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:31.540]   That right perspective, I mean, think about the power
[00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:35.060]   of just the fact that if you're a Christian,
[00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:36.500]   you don't have to go to hell.
[00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:39.560]   I mean, that should be enough.
[00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:41.640]   It's crazy to even, I'm embarrassed to even be like,
[00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:43.780]   that should be enough as though like we even need
[00:35:43.780 --> 00:35:46.080]   to be reminded of that, but I know I do.
[00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:48.960]   Like if God never did another thing for the rest of my life,
[00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:50.640]   that should be enough that I don't have to go to hell
[00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:52.580]   forever and ever and ever and ever.
[00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:55.460]   I mean, think about it.
[00:35:55.460 --> 00:35:57.500]   Like if you're a Christian in the room,
[00:35:57.500 --> 00:36:00.060]   I want you to think about something with me.
[00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:04.680]   Imagine you didn't know Jesus and it's true.
[00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:07.780]   There's a hell and anyone who's not put their faith
[00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:09.940]   in Jesus and what he did on the cross
[00:36:09.940 --> 00:36:11.400]   as the payment for their sin.
[00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:16.020]   And he rose from the dead showing that payment cleared,
[00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:18.420]   the check cleared, the credit card went through.
[00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:22.660]   That's what Jesus showed whenever he rose from the dead.
[00:36:22.660 --> 00:36:25.060]   There's a hell and anyone who doesn't have a relationship
[00:36:25.060 --> 00:36:27.160]   with him is going there and think about it.
[00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:28.680]   Think about where you would be
[00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:29.720]   if you didn't have the relationship.
[00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:31.040]   Think about hell.
[00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:33.520]   I know that's a bizarre thing to think about.
[00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:37.680]   Spending eternity away from the living God,
[00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:41.840]   having no relationships around you in eternal torment.
[00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:45.120]   And maybe it's been so long you were a kid
[00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:45.960]   when you got saved.
[00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:46.920]   Think about that.
[00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:48.760]   That's what you deserve.
[00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:49.600]   That's what I deserve.
[00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:54.600]   It's what every person who's alive on this planet deserves.
[00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:58.000]   By sinning against a perfect holy God
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:01.160]   and choosing to be their own God.
[00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:03.880]   And apart from God, stepping into your life
[00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:05.360]   and dropping the veil from your eyes
[00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:06.760]   and allowing you to see Jesus.
[00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:08.320]   'Cause if you are a follower of Jesus,
[00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:10.520]   it's not 'cause you chose him, he chose you.
[00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:14.420]   And so you can clap at that.
[00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:17.600]   But here, think about that.
[00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:21.200]   How could we not be the most grateful people on the planet?
[00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:23.920]   I mean, if you don't ever get married,
[00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:24.740]   if you're out there and you're like,
[00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:27.040]   oh man, I'm still single, I'm just so frustrated by that
[00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:27.880]   and it's draining your life.
[00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:29.440]   The God who's there has saved you.
[00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:30.260]   If you are a Christian,
[00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:31.760]   you're not gonna spend eternity apart from him.
[00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:34.840]   Everything else is just sprinkles on top.
[00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:37.320]   And the God who's there is saying,
[00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:38.840]   this is the right perspective to have.
[00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:39.840]   And if you don't have it,
[00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:40.960]   in the moments that I don't have it,
[00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:42.120]   or if I don't have it,
[00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:45.360]   I'm living less than in line
[00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:46.660]   with the will of God for my life.
[00:37:46.660 --> 00:37:48.840]   This life is a vapor, the scripture says.
[00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:50.680]   Whatever expectations, whatever frustrations,
[00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:51.800]   whatever things in your life
[00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:53.600]   that you're just so upset about and you complain about,
[00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:54.600]   and we all have them.
[00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:56.500]   God would say, when you could see it
[00:37:56.500 --> 00:37:59.000]   from an eternal right perspective,
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.400]   those things will fade away.
[00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:02.400]   And the moment you begin to see it,
[00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:03.480]   like Matthew, Henry saw it,
[00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:06.000]   like Jesus calls us to see it
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:10.560]   with a right perspective, it fuels gratefulness.
[00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:12.080]   Everything I have is a gift.
[00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:13.960]   I get another day, what?
[00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:16.600]   I get another chance to have relationships with friends.
[00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:18.440]   Yeah, I'm single, but that means I'm still alive
[00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:20.160]   and I still got time to mingle and I'm gonna be here
[00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:22.200]   and I'm gonna have relationships maybe around me,
[00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:23.320]   maybe there's still hope.
[00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:26.120]   Everything I have, there's a chance I can turn it around.
[00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:27.040]   There's a chance that I can see
[00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:28.440]   that God's in the work of all of it.
[00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:30.880]   Even the worst of circumstances, scripture says,
[00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:31.720]   he has promised.
[00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:33.360]   If you are a believer, listen to me very closely
[00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:34.840]   'cause some of you that are listening right now,
[00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:36.360]   wherever you're at, you're listening online,
[00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:37.480]   or you're listening in this room,
[00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:42.120]   you are wondering how can God make cancer make sense?
[00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:43.440]   How can God make the most painful
[00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:45.860]   of circumstances make sense?
[00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:47.960]   And I'm not gonna pretend like I know all the answers
[00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:49.560]   and know everything that you're walking through
[00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:50.380]   and could give you like,
[00:38:50.380 --> 00:38:51.640]   well, here's exactly what's going on there
[00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:52.960]   'cause I don't know.
[00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:56.160]   But I know that he has promised
[00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:59.040]   that everything that you face, everything you experience,
[00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:01.800]   I will use for your good.
[00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:03.040]   And you're gonna have a chance.
[00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:04.840]   Someday, you're gonna stand before God
[00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:06.160]   and you're gonna stand in front of him
[00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:08.000]   and you're gonna get to see how everything
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.520]   that was so broken in this world,
[00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:12.160]   he was using to bring together for good.
[00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:13.880]   So in the midst of the worst circumstances,
[00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:17.760]   we can thank God and say, thank you, God,
[00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:19.400]   that even though this is not what I would choose,
[00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:20.880]   it's not what I would want,
[00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:22.720]   you are gonna use it for good.
[00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:25.440]   And though I can't see it now, I'll see it someday.
[00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:27.880]   And I'm gonna trust you until then.
[00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:29.240]   Will you help me thank you?
[00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:33.900]   Help me to see it clearly, see you clearly.
[00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:39.200]   See the gifts that are all around me that I do not deserve.
[00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:43.600]   If you're in the room and you have never trusted in Jesus,
[00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:44.720]   here's what you need to know.
[00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:47.000]   No amount of thankfulness that you express
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:49.160]   is gonna change your life in the most important way
[00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:50.080]   that is possible.
[00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:52.560]   Every expression of thanks, you can apply them,
[00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:53.920]   it'll probably make your life better,
[00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:56.040]   but you're still going to hell.
[00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:57.760]   And the God who's there is crazy about you.
[00:39:57.760 --> 00:40:00.000]   He loves you, he gave his life for you.
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.520]   He gave his life for anyone
[00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:03.640]   who would simply receive the free gift.
[00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:05.000]   How do you become a Christian?
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:06.040]   How do you have eternal life?
[00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:08.160]   Let me make it really clear in case you've been tuning out
[00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:09.000]   and counting these wood things,
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:10.040]   like how do they get those up there?
[00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:12.320]   In case you're not zoning in, take it right here.
[00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:17.320]   You put your faith or your trust in Jesus' work on the cross.
[00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:20.960]   You died in my place, you rose in my place.
[00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:23.160]   You gave your life so that I didn't have to give my life
[00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:24.280]   for all of eternity.
[00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:25.920]   You gave your eternal life, Jesus,
[00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:28.920]   so I don't have to give all of my eternity away
[00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:29.800]   apart from you.
[00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:31.280]   And I'm not gonna trust, listen to me,
[00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:32.520]   listen, listen, listen.
[00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:35.260]   I will not trust in how good of a person I am.
[00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:36.400]   The Bible does not say,
[00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:38.800]   "Whosoever behaves shall not perish,
[00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:39.800]   "but have eternal life."
[00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:42.240]   It says, "Whosoever believes,"
[00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:43.920]   whoever trusts in Jesus,
[00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:46.680]   whoever says, "I'm not getting into heaven
[00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:48.800]   "because I went to church enough."
[00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:50.920]   That's a lie.
[00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:54.720]   Whoever says, "I am only gonna be granted access
[00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:59.140]   "with the one God who's there because of Jesus,
[00:40:59.140 --> 00:41:01.560]   "because he opened the door, he called himself the door,
[00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:03.500]   "he died in my place,
[00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:05.020]   "and I have so much to be thankful for
[00:41:05.020 --> 00:41:07.160]   "'cause I don't deserve it, I didn't earn it,
[00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:08.580]   "and yet Jesus stepped in
[00:41:08.580 --> 00:41:10.240]   "and he allowed me to have eternal life."
[00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:11.240]   That's what it means to be a Christian.
[00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:12.960]   If you're in the room, maybe you're walking,
[00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:14.820]   you haven't walked in your faith for a while,
[00:41:14.820 --> 00:41:16.520]   maybe it's first time back in church or ever,
[00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:19.720]   if you have never accepted that free gift,
[00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:20.880]   you're not a Christian.
[00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:24.040]   And I don't know how to encourage you
[00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:25.640]   to be grateful in this life
[00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:28.000]   'cause this world is as good
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:29.600]   as it's ever gonna get for you.
[00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:34.640]   And then off to eternity forever and ever and ever,
[00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:37.760]   apart from the one true God who's crazy in love with you.
[00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:39.320]   You look at your life like I look at mine
[00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:41.720]   and you're like, "Gosh, could anyone love me?"
[00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:44.500]   And the God who's there is crazy in love with you.
[00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:47.680]   And the lie that you're gonna be tempted every day
[00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:50.600]   to believe and have been tempted every day to believe
[00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:52.760]   is that he doesn't love you.
[00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:54.800]   And he's already proven emphatically that he does
[00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:56.500]   by giving his life on your behalf.
[00:41:56.500 --> 00:41:59.380]   And it's the moment that you say,
[00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:01.040]   "Man, it's not good people in heaven,
[00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:03.840]   "bad people in hell, forgiven people go to heaven."
[00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:05.220]   And the only way to get that is by saying,
[00:42:05.220 --> 00:42:08.900]   "Jesus, your payment was enough.
[00:42:08.900 --> 00:42:11.460]   "You paid for everything I did, I don't deserve it.
[00:42:11.460 --> 00:42:14.940]   "You paid for it, and I'm so grateful."
[00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:18.120]   Let me pray.
[00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:22.040]   Father, I pray that anyone in this room
[00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:27.180]   who's never had a moment of faith
[00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:29.040]   where they accepted that free gift right now
[00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:32.840]   where they're sitting, would accept the free gift
[00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:36.400]   that you offered when you gave your life on their behalf.
[00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:38.300]   And that payment was more than enough,
[00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:43.160]   and it went through and the curse broke.
[00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:47.560]   And since that moment, everything has begun to change.
[00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:51.800]   Many of us have begun to change,
[00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:56.320]   and our world as it is will change.
[00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:59.520]   I pray that right now, anyone who's never,
[00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:01.960]   currently is trusting in how good of a person they are,
[00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:04.800]   or they think you wouldn't love them
[00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:07.080]   because of how bad of a person they've been,
[00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:09.200]   your spirit would do what only it can do,
[00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:10.860]   convince them that that is a lie.
[00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:13.120]   And you've already paid the way,
[00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:14.800]   you've opened the door for anyone
[00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:17.640]   who will simply walk through it, and we are grateful, God.
[00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:20.880]   At the end of the day, we are unworthy servants,
[00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:22.640]   we are unworthy of the gift that you've offered.
[00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:24.460]   So right now, Lord, as we sing this song,
[00:43:24.460 --> 00:43:28.640]   would you, in our hearts, in my heart, start with me first.
[00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:31.080]   Kindle a gratefulness that continually
[00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:34.780]   sees every moment I have is just a gift, God.
[00:43:34.780 --> 00:43:38.540]   Everything in front of me is a gift that I didn't earn,
[00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:40.320]   and I don't deserve.
[00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:41.960]   We worship you in song now, amen.
[00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:44.460]   (eerie music)
