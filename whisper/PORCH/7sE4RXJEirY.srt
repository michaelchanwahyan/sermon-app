1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 [Heartbeat]

2
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 [Heartbeat]

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 I am so excited to be in the Psalms with you tonight.

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 We are covering an idea that frankly changed my life.

5
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 And so I'm going to tell you more about that before we dive in.

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 Let me just read this Psalm to you or recite it to you.

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 And so it's Psalm 23.

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 "The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not be in want.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 He makes me lie down in green pastures.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 He leads me beside quiet waters. He restores my soul.

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 He guides me in paths of righteousness for His name's sake.

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 I will not fear, for you are with me.

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 Your rod and your staff, they comfort me.

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies.

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 You anoint my head with oil. My cup overflows.

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 Surely goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life.

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever."

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 Let me pray.

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 God, we never needed a truth as much as this one.

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 And in the same way that 13 years ago as I sat in the back of a church hungover,

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 and you used this reality to come into my life and turn it upside down.

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 Would you reach into the hearts, please, God, of young adults this evening?

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 And would you reveal to us our pride?

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 Would you reveal to us our sin nature?

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 Would you reveal to us our desperation for a Savior?

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 That we might live the rest of our days in dependence on you,

28
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 our good shepherd.

29
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 In Jesus' name, amen.

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 Amen, amen, amen. It's great to be with you guys this evening.

31
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 I'm super pumped, as I said, to be in this psalm.

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 Did everyone have a good Halloween?

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 You can shout for Halloween in church.

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 I know in some places you're like, "Oh, can I say, yeah? Can I do anything?

35
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 What do I do? No, it's evil."

36
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 Yeah, Halloween, man.

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 I forgot how big of a deal this is to kids.

38
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 So as a father of three and now that we're in our home,

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 I mean, this is a huge deal to kids.

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 Do you remember this?

41
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 I mean, do you remember going, it's like you're collecting things,

42
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 and then you have this collection and you're proud of it.

43
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 And I don't know if you remember, but you like pour it out and you look at it.

44
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 You're like, "Wow, I've never even heard of this one."

45
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 And then you start to sort them.

46
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 You're like, "What is bit-o-honey?"

47
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 And then it's like, "Here's the chocolate and the Skittles and the fruity."

48
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 And so anyways, it's just like this.

49
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 And when you're that old, it's like, "This is everything I own right here,

50
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 and they gave it to me free."

51
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 And so I just forgot what a big deal this is to kids.

52
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 And so I don't know, have you guys seen Jimmy Kimmel's bit?

53
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 Yes.

54
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 Oh, some of you are shaking your head.

55
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 Okay, we'll pray for you.

56
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 No, you know what?

57
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 Let's do this instead.

58
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 How about we just show it to you?

59
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 Watch this.

60
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 Love it.

61
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 You gotta love it.

62
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 Hey, let me just say this.

63
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 It matters to them.

64
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 And so now we have perspective, so we can look back on that,

65
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 and we'd be like, "Man, those kids are silly.

66
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 It ruined my life."

67
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 You know, how silly for them.

68
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 But think about what this would be like for you today.

69
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 It's like I come up to you, and I'm like, "Hey, I spent all your money."

70
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 And you're like, "What money?"

71
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 And I'm like, "Every dollar you've ever earned and saved, it's gone.

72
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 I spent it."

73
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 Like, we're going to have issues, right?

74
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 Or somebody comes up to you, and they're like, "Hey, I took your girlfriend."

75
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 She's like, "Oh, that's the one that got gassed."

76
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 She's like, "Ugh!"

77
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 Or, "Hey, I took your job.

78
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 It's gone. It's mine."

79
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 Like, these are the things that matter to us today, and so we look back then,

80
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 and we're like, "Oh, that's so silly. Their candy was so important to them."

81
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 But what if these things that are so important to us today are just as silly,

82
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 and we just can't see it because we're right in the thick of it,

83
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 just like the kid with the candy?

84
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 And the problem for some of us is, as we hear about a God who controls everything,

85
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 we're in this series called Exhale, and last week we looked at Psalm 46,

86
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 and we talked about how God controls everything.

87
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 And some of you, tonight, you live in fear that He's going to take things from you,

88
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 that He's withholding good from you,

89
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 that He's going to come in with His sovereignty and His might,

90
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 and He's going to get you with some IRS tax audit,

91
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 or some things that are coming.

92
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 You're just going through life waiting for something bad to happen to you

93
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 that God's going to rip you off.

94
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 And so tonight, we're in Psalm 23, looking at the reality,

95
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 defining the reality that God is a good shepherd who doesn't want to keep good from you.

96
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 He wants to pour good to you.

97
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 He wants to give you good things.

98
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 He's not trying to withhold good from you.

99
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 He's giving it to you.

100
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 He doesn't want to rip you off.

101
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 He's looking to set you free.

102
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 He's a good God.

103
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 Because here's the truth.

104
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 If He controls everything, you know, we talked about how He breaks the bow and bends the spear

105
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 and melts the shields, and it's like, "Wow, He's so big and sovereign."

106
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 But if He doesn't love you, it doesn't matter, right?

107
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 If He doesn't love you, then that big, sovereign view of God's control doesn't help me walk with Him.

108
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 He just feels big and distant and far.

109
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 And so some of you are here tonight, and you're thinking,

110
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 "Man, God's trying to withhold good from me.

111
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 When He says, 'Hey, wait till I'm married,' yeah,

112
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 He just wants to give me a bunch of rules to follow.

113
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 He wants me to be generous with others.

114
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 He doesn't want me to get drunk.

115
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 Yeah, He's just trying to keep me from the party, this God."

116
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 He's not.

117
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 He's trying to give you life abundantly.

118
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 Abundantly.

119
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 And so we're asking questions this evening, like,

120
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 "How do we know that God will guide us toward what is good for us?

121
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 How do we know He will guard us from what is harmful?

122
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 And how do we know He will keep His promises of everlasting life to us?"

123
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 And so tonight, as we dive in this psalm, looking at God, the Good Shepherd,

124
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 I'm going to expound the reality to you that changed my life,

125
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 that God used to change my life.

126
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 And so this psalm was written by the shepherd king, David,

127
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 the greatest human king that has ever lived.

128
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 And he started out in the humble beginnings of being a shepherd.

129
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 This is the most quoted psalm, the most famous psalm from the Old Testament.

130
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 Some scholars and great, amazing, brilliant theologians would say

131
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 this is the greatest psalm or the most famous psalm ever sung.

132
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 Because this is a psalm.

133
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 Psalms are a psalm.

134
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 And so this is featured in movies like "Jarhead," "True Grit," "Titanic,"

135
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 "Book of Eli," "Dangerous Minds"--remember that one?--

136
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 "Elephant Man," "Deep Blue Sea," and even in an episode of "Lost."

137
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 It's been in songs by U2, Kanye West, and my favorite, Coolio.

138
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 [laughter]

139
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 "As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I take a--"

140
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 Yeah, you guys know, man.

141
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 All right.

142
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 You left me hanging out there for a second.

143
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 That's cool.

144
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 Told you that wasn't going to work.

145
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 So last week we looked at how Obama read Psalm 46 on the 10-year anniversary of 9/11.

146
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 On 9/11, President Bush quoted Psalm 23.

147
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 When we're looking for peace as a nation--and I love this psalm.

148
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 I love this psalm.

149
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 And then I read a book.

150
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 It's Philip Keller's "A Shepherd's Look at Psalm 23,"

151
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 and it made this psalm come alive for me.

152
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 Philip Keller was a sheepherder, or a shepherd for short, and also a pastor.

153
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 He was a shepherd as a vocation.

154
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 He cared for sheep.

155
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 And as he wrote a commentary on this psalm, it came alive to me.

156
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 It came alive to me.

157
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 And so I know a little bit about raising sheep, the resident sheep-raising expert in the room.

158
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 In fact, I have a picture here.

159
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 There you go.

160
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 That's me, Quero, Texas.

161
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 That's a sheep, and that's my real hair.

162
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 [laughter]

163
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 And there I was, blue ribbon, okay?

164
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 And so I spent some time with sheep so that I can expound on this psalm with you this evening.

165
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 Let's go.

166
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 We're going to look at how God is my guide to life, how he is my guardian from evil,

167
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 and how he gives me everlasting goodness.

168
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 Verse 1.

169
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 "The Lord is my shepherd.

170
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 I shall not be in want."

171
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 And so this is a familiar occupation of David.

172
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 If he owned a gym, he'd be like, "The Lord is my trainer."

173
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 If he worked at a hospital, he'd be like, "The Lord is my doctor."

174
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 If he was a teacher, he'd be like, "The Lord is my professor."

175
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 Or a student, "The Lord is my teacher."

176
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 But because he's a shepherd, he's like, "Hey, I know how I care for the sheep.

177
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 I know the care that I give to these animals."

178
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 So God, Yehovah, creator of the heavens and the earth, is my shepherd.

179
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 He cares for me.

180
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 He cares for me.

181
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 He looks after me.

182
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 And so who is God to you?

183
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 Is he a strong tower?

184
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 Is he a mighty fortress?

185
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 Is he just the creator?

186
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 Is he sovereign and in control?

187
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 Or is he the one who cares for you?

188
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 He makes me lie down in green pastures.

189
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 And so Philip Keller paints this picture of how sheep travel through this psalm.

190
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 They start in the spring and winter months in the lowlands or the grasslands.

191
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 And then they travel through the valley up into the tablelands during the summer.

192
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 In the warm months, they go to the top in the tablelands.

193
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 In the winter, they're in the lowlands.

194
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 And they travel through the valley of the shadow of death to get to the tablelands.

195
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 And so here we have a picture of the grasslands behind me.

196
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 And this is going to change as we make this journey together through this psalm.

197
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 He makes me lie down in green pastures.

198
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 Philip Keller says there's four things necessary for sheep to lie down.

199
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 He says, one, they must be free from fear or free from external attacks.

200
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 That if they even sense that a dog is coming near them or near them, if they smell a dog, they will not lie down.

201
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 He says they have to be free from conflict or internal attacks.

202
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 Okay, so if there's somebody in your community group that is constantly raising conflict,

203
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 that they're constantly attacking you or they're having questions,

204
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 or if you're at odds with someone in your life, you just can't lie down, you can't rest.

205
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 He says they have to be free from pests, bugs, and flies.

206
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 And he likens this to the worries and the bothers in our life that spin around in our mind.

207
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 Then when we lie down, we can't find rest because we just continue to play the tape and continue to think.

208
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 And he says they have to be free from hunger.

209
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 Fourth, they have to be free from hunger. Their appetite must be satisfied.

210
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 And so some of you will go through life, you have what the world calls drive,

211
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 and what the scripture calls something that will never be satisfied.

212
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 You go through life constantly wanting more.

213
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 You think I'm just going to climb to the top and you just wear yourself out on this hamster wheel

214
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 because you don't know how to get off.

215
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 He says their appetite must be satisfied.

216
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 Because the greatest idol to a sheep is green grass.

217
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 In fact, sheep will reach their neck through a fence to get to green grass.

218
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 They will actually strangle themselves trying to get to that green grass.

219
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 And some of you will strangle yourselves trying to satisfy some insatiable appetite that you have.

220
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 And so what are you reaching for that is keeping you up at night?

221
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 And you know right now with a sober mind that God would give it to you if he knew it was best for you.

222
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 He leads me, my shepherd leads me beside quiet waters. He restores my soul.

223
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 And so the second idol in a sheep's life would be water.

224
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 They need these two things for life, food and water.

225
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 But the problem with sheep is what they drink from is the cesspools of their hoof prints.

226
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 And so their hoof prints make these holes in the mud that fill up with water when it rains.

227
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 And they defecate and urinate in there.

228
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 They go to the bathroom and it becomes gross and contaminated.

229
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 But they drink from there. You want to know why?

230
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 Because sheep are afraid of water.

231
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 Specifically raging water or rushing water is terrifying to them.

232
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 So still water or quiet water is appealing.

233
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 That's what the shepherd leads them to.

234
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 At first I was like, "Really? Sheep are afraid of water?"

235
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 And then I began to think about it.

236
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 I mean, they are living sponges, these sheep.

237
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 I mean, they pretty much have like 30 Abercrombie sweaters wrapped around them, right?

238
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 And if they fall into the water, it's a lead weight.

239
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 They've got these little drumsticks for legs.

240
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 Of course they're afraid of water.

241
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 And so the shepherd knows what they need and he leads them to that which can give them life.

242
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 And he's saying to us, "Stop drinking from the wells that will kill you.

243
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 Drink from an everlasting well."

244
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 He guides me, my shepherd. He guides me in paths of righteousness.

245
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 Why? For his name's sake.

246
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 He delights in blessing you for one reason.

247
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 So that others would know him.

248
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 He loves to give you good things for his glory.

249
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 So that people see you and say, "Oh, that's the person who follows God.

250
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 She trusts God. He trusts God.

251
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 And he gives good to her. He gives good to him."

252
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 It's the greatest apologetic of all time.

253
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 Someone going through life trusting God, being blessed by him.

254
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 And that blessing at times looks like not being afraid

255
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 or trusting in times of conflict, in times of challenges.

256
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 But he's done it. We constantly want to take credit for what he's done.

257
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 My little girl, when she was little, Presley, when she was little,

258
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 she would do this thing where she just goes, "I did it all by myself."

259
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 And so what that would look like, she'd be like, "Daddy, can you help me on the monkey bars?"

260
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 And so I would go and I would hold her with all my strength up.

261
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 And I would carry her through the monkey bars so her hands would hit them.

262
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 She'd get to the other end and she'd go, "Mommy, look at me. I did it all by myself."

263
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 And I was like, "No, you didn't. I did it all by myself.

264
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 You didn't even really help very much."

265
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 And so some of us, this is what our relationship with God looks like.

266
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 Is we actually do something good.

267
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 Maybe you're here and you're like, "Man, I haven't really done anything wrong.

268
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 I drink it. Sex. Not me."

269
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 And you're like, "Yeah, because I'm good."

270
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 No, you're not. He did that in your life.

271
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 He guides you in paths of righteousness for His namesake.

272
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 That's His grace in your life.

273
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 And you're like, "Here, look, I did it all by myself."

274
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 You're just as silly as Presley on the monkey bars.

275
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 He comes to you and he's like, "Hey, come out of the bar. Come out of the club.

276
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 There's not life there. You're drinking yourself to death.

277
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 Sick of hangovers yet? Come out. Come on. Hey, there's life here. Come on. Come on."

278
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 And then we go, "Okay, really, God? Okay."

279
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 And then, "Look, I did it all by myself."

280
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 He's like, "Hey, stop sleeping around. There's not going to be life there.

281
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 How many pregnancy scares are you going to have to go through to figure out there's not life there?

282
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 Come on. Come on."

283
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 And then He's like, "Oh, wait. I did it all by myself."

284
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 No, you didn't.

285
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 God did that.

286
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 And so what if I die? What's next?

287
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 Where is this all going?

288
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 Will I ever get married?

289
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 What if I'm not good at whatever it is I'm going to have to do next?

290
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 These are the worries of this world, right?

291
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 And so what I'm telling you from this psalm is that God is your guide to abundant life.

292
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 That's my first point. God is your guide to abundant life.

293
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 You don't want to go anywhere that the Lord is not leading you.

294
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 Let me say that again in case you missed it.

295
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 You don't want to go anywhere in this world, in this lifetime.

296
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 You don't want to go anywhere that the Lord is not leading you.

297
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 That He's not saying, "Hey, come on this way."

298
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 This is where life is.

299
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 And so how many of us find worries by going on paths that cause anxiety?

300
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 We have pride, thinking that we have to do it all ourselves.

301
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 This causes anxiety in our lives.

302
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 Or thinking that you actually can do it by yourself and that you don't need a shepherd.

303
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 And this causes anxiety in your life.

304
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 Going out and getting drunk on a regular basis.

305
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 Living to escape and flee from accountability.

306
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 "Oh man, I called you last night. I was drunk."

307
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 Like that's the cover all, "Oh, you were drunk. Well, that's okay if you were drunk."

308
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 Does that not cause anxieties in our life?

309
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 Promiscuity or giving the physical so that we would feel wanted causes anxiety.

310
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 Debt, spending money that we don't have causes anxiety.

311
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 Pornography, continuing to say, "Well, I'm struggling with pornography."

312
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 No, you're not struggling. You're giving in to pornography. You're not struggling.

313
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 You're carrying that path with you in your pocket so that you can access it whenever you want.

314
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 Let me ask you a question. How long are you going to struggle with pornography?

315
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 Because if you look backwards, it's been since the fifth grade.

316
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 You're going to be 50 still struggling with pornography?

317
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 Leads to anxiety.

318
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 The body image being so focused on you.

319
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 Self-obsession in general.

320
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 Needing the approval of others. "What do they think of me?"

321
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 "What do they think of me?" Walking around, "They must be talking about me."

322
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 "I've got to be liked." "Is this dress okay for them?" "Are these jeans okay?"

323
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 "Is this okay?" "Is this what's going to give me the job?"

324
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 And just a critical spirit in general.

325
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 Can you think of anything that's more a greater rejection of God

326
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 than to go through the abundant life that he gave us and just not be grateful.

327
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 Just be critical of everything. You're the person that constantly points out the holes

328
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 but never steps in the gaps.

329
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 All of these things lead to great anxieties.

330
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 They're not paths that God is leading you to.

331
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 And so there is peace, great peace in the will of God.

332
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 And so what does transformation look like for you tonight?

333
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 It looks like, "Hey God, I'm not going anywhere you're not taking me."

334
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 "If you're not taking me there, I'm not going there."

335
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 "If you don't want me to go there, then I'm simply not going there."

336
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 And it begs the question this evening, do we trust that he is not only in control

337
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 but he desires to give us good things to guide us in good paths.

338
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 The kids did alright trick-or-treating.

339
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 They got their loot.

340
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 They were really excited about it.

341
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 We had to put this kind of two-limit candy bar per day on them.

342
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 And so Weston, my three-year-old, wakes up early that morning, Sunday morning.

343
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 And he just goes straight to his candy jar and he grabs this little bite-sized,

344
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 this little mini take five.

345
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 And it's a candy bar evidently.

346
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 And he's just gripping it in his hand. He comes and brings it to me.

347
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 I'm still in bed. He's like, "Daddy, can I eat it?"

348
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 I'm like, "No, not for breakfast, son. Hold on."

349
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 And I was just like, "Wait for it."

350
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 And so he just carries it with him through the day, gripped in his hand like this.

351
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 I mean, it's all sweaty, palm, nasty, melted chocolate.

352
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 And so he's like all day, "Daddy, can I eat it? Daddy, can I eat it?"

353
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 And so finally, after lunch, I was like, "Alright, buddy. Listen. I want you to hear me.

354
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 I want you to give me your candy bar."

355
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 I mean, it's squished like a Tootsie Roll by this point.

356
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 And I'm like, "I want you to give it to me."

357
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 And he's like, "No, Daddy. You told me I could have it. You told me I could have two per day."

358
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 I'm like, "Son, I know, but I want you to trust me. Do you trust me? I want you to give it to me."

359
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 And he's like, "No, Daddy, I can't. Can I eat it? Can I eat it?"

360
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 I'm like, "Hey, buddy, you can eat it, but I'm asking you, would you give it to me?"

361
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 And he's like, "No, Daddy." And he just opens it up, takes a bite.

362
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 And he doesn't like pretzels.

363
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 And so I think what happened, he took a bite, tasted the pretzel, and he's like, "Okay, you can have it."

364
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 And as soon as he gave it to me, I picked him up, and I took him in the pantry.

365
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 See, what you may not know about me is I love candy.

366
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 Like, I am a sucker for candy. I love chocolate.

367
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 I'm a sucker for any kind of candy that doesn't have fruit in it is good candy to me, because that's like a salad.

368
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 And so I take him, I lift him up, and I've got this top shelf in our pantry.

369
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 And I mean, I go all out, man. I mean, I stock up.

370
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 I mean, there's run-of-the-mill Hershey's bar in there, and then there's the fine-dining chocolate you can only buy at a certain place.

371
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 I mean, there's Skittles. There's a bag of Dum Dums. He likes lollipops. That's up there.

372
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 There's the big--I get the movie-sized candy that you can buy every now and then at the grocery store.

373
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 They have the big bin right there, the five for five dollars. I'll store up on that.

374
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 That's up there. Dots. All of the big M&Ms, the big peanut M&Ms.

375
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 I've got a bag up there of chocolate-covered peanut butter M&Ms, which are like the gold in my book.

376
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 That's where it's at. And then anything Reese's.

377
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 And so I take him. He's in the pantry. He's looking down. He's seeing the water bottles are at the bottom.

378
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 I lift him up. He doesn't know what to do with himself. He had no idea his daddy was that rich.

379
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 And I'm like, "Buddy, take your pick, since you trusted me with your little melted, bite-sized take five.

380
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 When I asked you for it, you were so confused. Why would you take that from me?"

381
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 "It's because I wanted to give you something better."

382
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 And so some of you are here, and you're like, "Well, God just wants to take from me."

383
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 You don't trust that he wants to give you something better than what you think you want.

384
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 That he's a good shepherd. He has an abundant of riches at his disposal.

385
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 He can give you anything, even greater and more than you can imagine.

386
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 Verse 4. "Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will not fear, or I will fear no evil, for you are with me."

387
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 And so we've transitioned now from the grasslands to the valley of the shadow of death.

388
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 Sheep, every single year, would make this trek from the winter months in the grassland,

389
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 through the valley in the spring, up to the summer months.

390
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 Up to the summer months in the table lands.

391
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 And so now we're in the valley of the shadow of death.

392
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 And so here's what's going on in the valley. This is when the sheep come closest to their predators.

393
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 The predators live in the hillside. And so as they walk along the hills, the cougars, they're right there.

394
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 When I say cougars, I don't mean moms from Frisco. I mean cougars, okay?

395
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 Some of you were thinking it. I had to address the issue, okay?

396
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 I'm talking about real live teeth, eat you alive. Cougars, they're right there.

397
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 Wolves, they're right there, okay? This is what's going on right here.

398
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 And so the sheep, they're walking down the valley of the shadow of death.

399
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 And not only do they come the closest to these animals, these predators that want to kill them,

400
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 but they come the closest to the raging waters, closest to the cliffs.

401
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 There's death all around them if they do not stay close to the shepherd.

402
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 Ironically, in the valley, the sheep is also closest to the shepherd.

403
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 As they walk this narrow path, the shepherd is right there with them, protecting them every step of the way.

404
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 They have to stay close to the shepherd.

405
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 And so I love what's going on in this. I don't know if you caught it.

406
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 He switches from "the Lord is my, the Lord, he" to "you."

407
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 He changes. He changes from who he's talking about God to talking to God.

408
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, you are with me.

409
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 I will not fear because you, God, you are with me. Now he's talking to him.

410
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 Your rod, back in the scripture, your rod and your staff, they comfort me.

411
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 A shepherd uses two tools. One is a rod. A rod is basically like a baseball bat.

412
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 It's used for one thing, killing.

413
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 Anything that would attack that sheep, that shepherd goes like a baseball bat to the face on a wolf or a cougar or whatever it is to kill it, to protect.

414
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 The other is the staff. The staff is what Little Bo Peep carried.

415
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 It's the little shepherd crook with a curve on it. It's used for correcting.

416
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 Tenderly, to guide the sheep, he'll put that staff on the sheep's shoulder and say, "Hey, I want you to go right."

417
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 On the sheep's shoulder, say, "Hey, I want you to go left."

418
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 If a sheep falls into a ravine, he goes and uses that hook to lift them out of that ravine.

419
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 So one is used for protecting and the other is used for correcting.

420
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 You know, Jesus says, "Who, if they lost one sheep, would not leave the 99 and go after the one?"

421
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 You're the one. You're the one. He will leave the 99 and go after you.

422
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 He loves you that much. "I will leave the flock and I will find you in that pit that you fell into.

423
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 I will not desert you because a shepherd that loses sheep is not a good shepherd.

424
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 I will risk it all to find you, to pull you out of that pit."

425
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 God, our guide, he has everything that he needs to protect us from evil and to lead us not into temptation.

426
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 And so you're here and you're like, "But the world is so messed up. There's so much wrong.

427
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 What if something terrible happens to me?" My second point this evening is that God guards you from evil.

428
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 God guards you from evil.

429
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 And so when danger is near, you stay close to the shepherd.

430
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 Last week in Psalm 46, we talked about how the fish go deep, deep, deep into the ocean when there's a storm.

431
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 They go to a place where the storm is not bothering them.

432
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 We talked about how we go deep, deep into our relationship with God whenever there's a storm in our life.

433
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 And likewise, here you go and you lean into the shepherd. You go close to the shepherd.

434
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 And this is work, y'all. There's no cruise control in Christianity.

435
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 There's not where you get to a place where you're like, "Hey, I know God and now I'm cool and I can just kind of shift into overdrive or autopilot."

436
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 There's no autopilot in Christianity.

437
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 Every day you have to pursue God so that he's familiar to you.

438
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 When trouble comes, you're not like, you know, like pulling the parachute or some lifeline.

439
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 Like, "Hey God, I know we don't know each other very much, but I think I'm pregnant."

440
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 Of course you think you are. We haven't been walking together.

441
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 "Hey God, I know we don't know each other very much. I know I haven't talked to you in a while, but there's this really scary situation at work."

442
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 Hey.

443
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 And so we use him like a lifeline. He's like, "No, I want to be familiar to you."

444
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 Every day. That's a fine time to go to God if you haven't gone to him any other time, but it's a miserable time to go to God in reality.

445
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 Because he's available to you every single day. The Good Shepherd is right there wanting a relationship with you.

446
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 This weekend, I took Presley to gymnastics.

447
00:27:53,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 She goes to gymnastics on Saturday. And so after gymnastics, they had this haunted house up.

448
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 And so I'm sitting there waiting on her to be done. And she just kind of runs up to me.

449
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 She's like, "Daddy, I went in the haunted house." And I was like, "Cool."

450
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 And I was like, "Was it scary?" She's like, "I don't know." And I was like, "Why do you not know? Have you went in?"

451
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 She's like, "I ran out."

452
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 And I was like, "Why did you run out?" She's like, "I was too scared."

453
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 And I was like, "Let's go back in. You can go back in. You can check it out."

454
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 And she's like, "No, I can't." I mean, she was like, "There's no way. I'm not going in there."

455
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 And I was like, "Hey, come on. I'll go with you."

456
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 She's like, "Okay."

457
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 It's interesting, right? She's terrified. Like, "There's no way. You're not going to make me go in there."

458
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 I'll go with you. "Okay, if you'll go, let's go."

459
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 Nothing changed in that haunted house. Like, this time we go, and she was fine.

460
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 We walked through. I mean, it's a gymnastics haunted house, you know, not a house of horrors or anything.

461
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 And so we go through there, and we come out. And she's like, "Oh, that was so much fun."

462
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 The only thing that changed is who she was with.

463
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 Now, I don't know if you would have walked up to her and said, "Hey, Presley, I'll go with you."

464
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 She'd be like, "No, I'm not going." Because y'all don't have a relationship.

465
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 But she trusts me. We have a relationship.

466
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 I mean, she's the one. When I told Weston, I said, "Hey, give me your candy."

467
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 Like, "Presley knows that game." She's like, "Daddy, you can have all my candy."

468
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 You know? I've been there before with her. She trusts me.

469
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 She knows I desire to give her good things. She's been with me longer, not three years, but eight years.

470
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 And there in the haunted house, where I like, "Listen, God is there. He wants a relationship with you."

471
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 When you have that relationship with God, there is a sense inside of you that I can endure all things.

472
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 There's nothing that this life can throw at me that's going to bring me down.

473
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 God is with me. God, the creator of the heavens and the earth, the one who breaks the bows and bends the spears,

474
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 that's my shepherd. That's the one who cares for me.

475
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 The one who spoke this creation into existence. He cares for me, man. He's got my back.

476
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 My front, my underneath, my everything. He's with me.

477
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 People tell me, young adults tell me all the time, "Man, I was in this terrible thing. I was in this wreck, or this thing happened."

478
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 But I felt God's presence. And I had God's peace.

479
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 He says, verse 5, "You," back to talking to God, "You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies."

480
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 You, God, you prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies.

481
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 And so now we went through the valley of the shadow of death to the table lands.

482
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 We're up in the table lands. And so what does it mean that you prepare a table for me?

483
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 Some people think, some commentaries on this Psalm say it transitions from shepherd to host, but I'm with Philip Keller on this one.

484
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 I think he's still talking about shepherds and sheep.

485
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 He says, "You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies."

486
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 In the table lands, what he means by prepare a table is in the table lands, there's plenty of grass to eat, but now you are free from predators.

487
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 The predators can't attack you because you're back in the field guarded by the shepherd.

488
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 But there's these things called their white camas.

489
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 And it's this white flower that sheep would love to eat, but it's deadly poisonous.

490
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 If they eat it, they will die.

491
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 And so the shepherd has to go through there and work toil to pull all of the poisonous weeds out.

492
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 You prepare a table before me.

493
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 And in the table lands, there's the top of the hills where the cougars and the wolves live in the crevices of those hills.

494
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 And they're watching on as sheep, their prey, feast in the presence of their shepherd, protected in the presence of their shepherd.

495
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 Philip Keller talks about how he knows of cougars that have killed 200 sheep in one night, 200 sheep dead.

496
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 But he's never seen a cougar.

497
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 He said they will not come in the presence of the shepherd.

498
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 They will never attack in the presence of the shepherd.

499
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 I want you to think about the humility that David has right here.

500
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 Because he's not just saying, now this has got to hit home for you here, Dallas and Fort Worth and wherever you're listening.

501
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 He's not just calling God the shepherd.

502
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 He's calling himself a sheep.

503
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 Now sheep are the single most vulnerable animals ever to live.

504
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 One expert says they're the only animal without a defense mechanism.

505
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 And I was like, really?

506
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 What about rabbits?

507
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 No, rabbits run fast.

508
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 What about cats?

509
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 They got claws.

510
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 What about rats?

511
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 They bite.

512
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 You know what sheep do when they're attacked?

513
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 They freeze.

514
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 That's what they do.

515
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 That's their defense mechanism.

516
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 They stand still and they're devoured.

517
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 Cougars will play with sheep like a ball of yarn before they eat them.

518
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 Sheep must have a shepherd for life.

519
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 And they must trust that shepherd.

520
00:32:49,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 But here in the table lands, the predators watch on as the sheep feast.

521
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
 So our shepherd never sleeps.

522
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 He's prepared a place for us in eternity.

523
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 He says this, "You anoint my head with oil.

524
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 My cup overflows."

525
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 And so now in the table lands, in the herd, the greatest predator to the sheep is what is known as pestilence, flies.

526
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 The diseases that they would get from bugs.

527
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 And so these little flies buzz around their head.

528
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 And this is going to be gross, but I'm telling you, you're learning about sheep tonight.

529
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 And so in the moist membrane of the sheep's nose, the flies will lay eggs.

530
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 And those eggs will hatch to larvae.

531
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 And the larvae or the little worm will crawl up a sheep's nose and get in its head.

532
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 And a sheep will be so bothered by this that they will run and they will butt their head against a tree, hurting themselves and even killing themselves, trying to get rid of the bothers in their head.

533
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 And the solution is a loving shepherd coming to them, anointing their head with oil that keeps the flies away.

534
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,000
 You ever have something in your head that you can't get out of there?

535
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 And you're so bothered, you feel like you're beating your head against the wall.

536
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 I can't transition. I can't stop thinking about this conversation that I had at work.

537
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 I can't believe my boss said that. Why don't they ever trust me to do those sorts of things?

538
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 Why do they always trust her? And why did he say, and I can't believe he broke up with me for that reason.

539
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 This is crazy. And I'm just beating my head against the wall.

540
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 And God comes and says, Hey, I've given you everything that you need to have peace.

541
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 Everything that you need to have peace is found in me.

542
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 Your cup overflows.

543
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 God has gone to great lengths to rid your lives of the worries of this world, promising you another world.

544
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 He says, Hey, what are your greatest worries compared to a billion years from now? Eternity with me forever and ever in heaven.

545
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 He writes verse six, surely goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life.

546
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 Not a temporary goodness, but an everlasting goodness.

547
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 Have you ever had goodness? You ever had a good time?

548
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,000
 And I mean, I'm not talking church answers here. You ever go on a spring break? Good.

549
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 Man, that was a great time. Those moments you go club and it's like, man, I'm just, I'm just going to let my guard down.

550
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,000
 And so for some of you, that was this weekend. Others of you, that was that one time in college.

551
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 But there's just that moment where you're like, Hey, I'm just going to let my guard down. I'm just going to go for it tonight.

552
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 I'm going to live like there are no rules. And you, you're having a great time. And man, that was a great time.

553
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
 Some of you are addicted to that great time. You can't stop having that great time.

554
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,000
 And then you have those moments afterwards, like, man, do we even know each other? Like, who are you? And how did we get here?

555
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 And I just like, I don't even remember. Did we go there? I can't believe we went there. What happened?

556
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 That's temporary goodness. What a joke, man. You're wasting your life.

557
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 God says in my presence are riches forever. Goodness forever. Ever lasting goodness.

558
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:01,000
 And so this and I would dwell in the house of the Lord forever.

559
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:06,000
 This is the realization that our shepherd is good, that we don't want to be cared for by anyone else.

560
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:11,000
 That God is our shepherd and he's so good. And God gives us eternal life with him.

561
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:16,000
 That we can be with him forever and ever and ever and ever.

562
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 This this Sunday, as we left church, the girls were talking to my two girls and their little girls.

563
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,000
 And they were talking to Weston. I think they talked about evangelism and Sunday are here at church rather.

564
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:30,000
 And so they're like Weston, you know, my three year old, they're like, do you want to go to heaven?

565
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:36,000
 And he's like, no. And and you know, of course, they're real concerned for their brother's salvation.

566
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:43,000
 And so they're like, no, nobody. You do want to go to heaven. It's like Disney World, you know, and they're like, there's like lots of candy there and all these things.

567
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,000
 And I've never seen him respond like this. But he like he's like, no, I don't. I don't.

568
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,000
 I guess you do. No, I don't want to go to heaven. I don't want to go.

569
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:57,000
 And he starts crying is really sad. Everybody was all concerned. And I just said, hey, everybody, calm down.

570
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:04,000
 Everybody calm down. I said, Weston, man, I know you three, you don't you don't know how great heaven is.

571
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:12,000
 And it's not like Disney and it's not like lots of candy. I said, but but God, who is good, he lives there.

572
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:21,000
 And I just said and I said this, I want you to think about this. I said, Weston, if you knew how amazing heaven was,

573
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:29,000
 you would live every moment of your life trying to get there. Longing for it.

574
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:37,000
 And I just heard this voice saying, then you don't know how amazing heaven is, JP.

575
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:45,000
 You must have lost sight of how amazing it is because you don't do that.

576
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:54,000
 And you get distracted by work and by conflict and trying to make money and living in Dallas and wondering what others think of you.

577
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:05,000
 And stupid, stupid, stupid things like how many people liked your Instagram photo or how many Twitter followers you have, how pathetic.

578
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:12,000
 JP, you clearly don't understand how amazing my kingdom is.

579
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:18,000
 So my third and final point is God gives you everlasting goodness.

580
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:23,000
 God offers you an everlasting satisfaction, not a temporary one.

581
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:33,000
 And so if you know that he's in control and that he gives good to those who follow him, you can stop wearing yourself out, trying to get ahead of the game.

582
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:40,000
 You can exhale because your shepherd is good. You can stop. You can rest. You can lie down in green pastures.

583
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:47,000
 You can rest beside quiet waters. You can stop feeling like everything is up to you because it's not. He's in control.

584
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:54,000
 He's God and he loves you. He's crazy about you. You specifically you.

585
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:02,000
 And he wants to give you good things. He's a good God that desires to give you good things.

586
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:07,000
 I just want to show you something. You know, David, he was a shepherd.

587
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
 But he was also in first Samuel 16. He was anointed as king.

588
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
 And so the prophet Samuel comes up and it's this real Cinderella story.

589
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:18,000
 They're like, hey, you know, one of your sons is is going to be king. It must be Elieb. He's the big one.

590
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,000
 No, it's not him. And he kind of works through these sons and he gets to David was the boy.

591
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:28,000
 He's just a boy. He's a shepherd. And he goes up to David and he anoints his head with oil.

592
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,000
 As a sign that he is going to be king, he's going to sit on the throne.

593
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:42,000
 And he's the he was the greatest human king that ever lived, but his greatest moments that that are memorialized forever in the scripture, like this song.

594
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:49,000
 I mean, we're reading it thousands of years later. No one's going to be singing a song, you know, 4000 years from now.

595
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:55,000
 OK, no one. Right. But here we are looking at the writings of David.

596
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:01,000
 Who was king. But who was shepherd. And so Samuel says you're going to be king.

597
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:06,000
 And you know what he does. You know what he does.

598
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:13,000
 He goes back to being a shepherd. I don't got to be king today when God wants to make me king, he'll put me in the throne.

599
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:21,000
 Until then, I'll protect the sheep. You know what he does. King Saul King, the one who was king, says, hey, I want you to come here and I want you to play the harp for me.

600
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:26,000
 He's basically Saul's iPod. And there he is playing the harp for the king.

601
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:31,000
 I don't know if he's in the palace thinking, hey, man, this is my palace. Like, let me pick out the doors. Let me pick out the floors.

602
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:36,000
 No, he's just there playing the harp. I'm going to serve the king until God wants me to be king.

603
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:42,000
 You know what he's Saul's armor bearer. Saul says, hey, you're so good at playing the harp. Why don't you carry my armor for me?

604
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,000
 Sure, man, I'll serve you king. Until the Lord wants to make me king.

605
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,000
 He's not trying to wear himself out to get some. The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want.

606
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:59,000
 He makes me lie down in green pastures. He leads me beside quiet waters. He restores my soul. He guides me in paths of righteousness for his name's sake.

607
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:07,000
 Even though I walk to the valley of the shadow of death, I won't fear for you with me. Your rod and your staff, they protect me.

608
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:13,000
 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil. My cup overflows.

609
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:33,000
 Surely goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life. And I dwell in the house of Yehovah forever and ever and ever.

610
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:41,000
 His greatest moments were marked by him trusting God when his enemy is in a cave sleeping, he doesn't kill him.

611
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:48,000
 When the enemy of God shouts blasphemies against him and an entire army is afraid of him, he kills him with a rock.

612
00:41:48,000 --> 00:42:03,000
 Because the greatest king of all time understood that he was just a sheep pointing to a good shepherd who was a better king.

613
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:14,000
 Jesus is all the evidence that you and I need to know that God is a good shepherd because he laid down his life for us so that we might live forever and ever and ever and ever.

614
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:21,000
 This is captured in John 10 where it says in verse 7, Jesus said again, "Verily, truly, I tell you, I am the gate for the sheep.

615
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:25,000
 All who have come before me, they're thieves and robbers, but the sheep have not listened to them.

616
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,000
 I am the gate. Whoever enters through me, Jesus says, will be saved.

617
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:35,000
 They will come in and go out and find pasture. The thief, he comes to steal, kill and destroy.

618
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,000
 I have come that they might have life and have it to the full.

619
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:52,000
 And have it to the full. And have it not temporarily, not with hangovers and pregnancy scares and not pride and not wondering if you're going to climb your way to the top and have everything you ever thought that you wanted, fame, fortune.

620
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:58,000
 But have abundant life to the full that's only found in Jesus Christ.

621
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:03,000
 And so Jesus is your guide to an abundant life.

622
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:10,000
 Jesus, it's personal. Jesus is your guardian from the evil one.

623
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:18,000
 And Jesus gave his life in order to give you eternity with God.

624
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:23,000
 I just want to tell you that, man, when we were out there trick or treating, my kids weren't very good at it.

625
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:30,000
 I was pretty discouraged. We were patrolling the neighborhood in the golf cart and going up to the houses.

626
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
 And they wanted to go to the friendly old people.

627
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:38,000
 And I'm like, they give you apples and granola bars. Hang with me.

628
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,000
 And there's scary houses with the strobe lights and the smoke machines. They didn't want to go near those.

629
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,000
 I'm like, these are the people that know candy, though. They take Halloween serious.

630
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:53,000
 And so I'm like, hey, I'm your guide here. I'm the candy master. I get this stuff.

631
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
 Follow my lead, OK? And ask them for some for your dad.

632
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:01,000
 And so we're kind of patrolling the neighborhood and we're having a good time.

633
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:05,000
 But I want to show you something. See, my friend Jimmy, he loves Halloween.

634
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
 You may know him. He's been here. He's led worship here at the porch.

635
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:14,000
 And he sees Halloween as an opportunity to show how good and generous his God is.

636
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,000
 And so Jimmy lives in this house that is on the top of a hill.

637
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,000
 And so there's this crazy staircase up into his house.

638
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:25,000
 And so what they do is they start to write on the staircase saying, hey, if you'll just go up there.

639
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:30,000
 And so they put the candy there. There's Kit Kats and Snickers and Reese's.

640
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
 And so there it is. If you see that's what they're kind of writing.

641
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:37,000
 They're just trying to get the folks there. But at the bottom of the staircase is the sign.

642
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:45,000
 And the sign says this, if you make the climb, we have king sized bars because there's not a king as generous as ours.

643
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:52,000
 And so Jimmy and his wife, Kelly, they begin to store up candy all year.

644
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,000
 And so let me show you what's inside of this house.

645
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,000
 Abundant riches forever.

646
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,000
 I mean, he stockpiles candy. He stockpiles it.

647
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
 And everyone knows, hey, that's the good house. That's the house you want to go to.

648
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,000
 Right. He's earned a reputation. You want to make the climb.

649
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,000
 You want to get to the top. And so there they are. Right.

650
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:20,000
 The people line up because when you know that there's good inside, you live your life moving to that destination.

651
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,000
 And others see you moving to that destination and they say, how do you endure the climb?

652
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,000
 And you say, you don't understand how good my shepherd is.

653
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:35,000
 He desires to give me good things, riches at his right hand forever and ever and ever.

654
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
 And so whatever trouble comes my way. Right.

655
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:49,000
 He's protecting me. He's guarding me. And when I don't know the way he's guiding me and he is going to give me goodness forever and ever and ever.

656
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:53,000
 And regardless of the situation, I can trust him.

657
00:45:53,000 --> 00:46:03,000
 And it's the greatest apologetic known to man is a young man or woman who says no matter the trial, no matter the situation, my shepherd is good.

658
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,000
 And I will follow him. I'm going to follow him.

659
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:13,000
 And the greatest heresy that you can live out. Is to deny the goodness of God.

660
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:21,000
 The most rejecting thing that you can say to a God who pours out his loving kindness to you.

661
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:26,000
 Is to say you're not good. Or to live like he's not good.

662
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
 And not trust him.

663
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
 You can trust him.

664
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:38,000
 Let me pray that you would.

665
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:46,000
 Father, thank you for this incredible song that you've preserved through the ages.

666
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,000
 Thank you for your servant David, just a man after your heart.

667
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:58,000
 A man who says I want to love what God loves and I want to stand in opposition to the things that stand in opposition to my God, to my good shepherd.

668
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,000
 Would you help us to be men and women like that, God?

669
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:11,000
 And father, would you just convince even as we sing these words, would you convince in the hearts of my young adult friends that you love them?

670
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,000
 That you're crazy about them?

671
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:23,000
 That you desire good things for them, not to rip them off, but to set them free, to give them an abundant life.

672
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,000
 In the name of Jesus, amen.

673
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:35,000
 I want to say this before we sing, because maybe you're a visitor tonight, maybe you haven't been here and you're like, oh, he's just a pastor, he's a preacher, he's supposed to say that.

674
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:42,000
 Man, I want you to know, man, I have drunk from the poisonous wells.

675
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,000
 I've been hung over more times than I can count.

676
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:52,000
 And not just alcohol, right? I've pursued drugs, sex, when I've woken up next to strangers, who are you, how did I get here?

677
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
 I thought there was life there.

678
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:59,000
 I pursued money, I've lived the life that this city offers.

679
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:07,000
 I've bought things, I've had cars and a penthouse condo, and I don't say that to boast, I say that so you know I'm just not up here naively teaching these things.

680
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:11,000
 I've found life, abundant life in Jesus alone.

681
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:16,000
 I love what someone said last week, they came up to me and said, man, when you first said that, I thought, oh man, you just don't know.

682
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
 And then she just said, you know, I've found life too, since then.

683
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
 In Jesus alone.

684
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
 So maybe you're here and you're like, oh, you just don't know.

685
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
 I'm like, no, you just don't know.

686
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,000
 You don't know my God, you don't know my shepherd.

687
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
 But I hope he changes that tonight.

688
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
 Let's worship him.
