[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:32.560]   >> Let's go.
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.760]   Hey, welcome friends in the room, friends in Fort Worth.
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.080]   How about Kanye starting us out?
[00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.080]   Let's go, man.
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:47.680]   College Dropout was the greatest album Kanye had before Yeezy, before Kim.
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:48.680]   Just good old days.
[00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:54.680]   Hey, anyone fly a lot for their job in here?
[00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.680]   Good, three of you.
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:04.080]   Let's start with a flying story that happened not long ago with our family.
[00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.800]   Basically, when you travel with kids, it's kind of a nightmare, and by kind of,
[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.520]   I mean entirely, especially if you're getting on a plane.
[00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.120]   And the day had come and we had kind of packed everything up, and the reason it's kind of
[00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.600]   a nightmare is, one, because you're that person on the plane with the screaming child, and
[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.480]   two, you're trying to like just do like Frogger, essentially, through the airport with kids
[00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.040]   who are running all over the place.
[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.600]   And so the day had come, we'd packed up all the bags.
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.180]   In addition to one of the challenges is you have like 95 extra things.
[00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.440]   The days of like, hey, I got to carry on, it'll be good, we'll figure it out, are over.
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.840]   So you're packing like a child seat, you're bringing all these different things.
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.160]   And this day had come, we were going on a trip with family, got our kids there, got
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.240]   to the airport, we've got everything kind of locked in, and we had stuffed as much as
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.240]   possible into as few bags as possible, because I think we were flying like Spirit Airlines,
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.040]   which charge you for like breathing.
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:00.080]   They're like, hey, you feel your limit, it's 50 cents from now on, and you're wearing shoes,
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.340]   that's $20 more.
[00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.040]   And so we were trying to like save on in terms of like the bag of stuff.
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.040]   We stuffed everything in there.
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.760]   We get to the airport, we're beginning to go through the check-in process, get the bags
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.840]   checked in, we got the kids, they're kind of running everywhere.
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.080]   Throw the bag up on the scale.
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.000]   I had already weighed the bag at home to make sure, hey, I'm going to be below 50 pounds.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Throw the bag on the scale.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.280]   Somehow in the car, my bag gained three pounds.
[00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.320]   No idea how.
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.240]   Lady looks at me, she's like, this is 53 pounds, you got to do something with three pounds.
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.160]   It's like, oh, come on, lady, we got like kids running all around us, can we just look
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.160]   the other way?
[00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.160]   What's it really going to do?
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.480]   And she goes, no, you need to move things around.
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:32.800]   So we have to take that bag off.
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.960]   Then you have to weigh the other bag to be like, how much margin do we have to work with
[00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:36.960]   here?
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.240]   And so we take that off, we get that bag out, and we realize, man, we don't have a ton of
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.760]   margin to work with.
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.720]   We got to get rid of these three pounds, begin going through.
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.200]   And here's the worst part of this whole situation if you've been to the airport before.
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.440]   No one is ever at the airport with like tons of time to spare, right?
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.200]   No one, unless you're like psychotic, is like, you know I love to spend a good afternoon
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.200]   in the airport.
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.240]   And so I like to get there early, take my time, enjoy the Starbucks.
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.120]   And so you're always like in a hurry, and so they're like, hey, you got to get three
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.120]   pounds up.
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.120]   There's 150 people behind you.
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.040]   She's basically like, hey, you got to get your stuff out of there.
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.360]   You're opening up your bag, your underwear is falling out in front of all these strangers
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.360]   in front of you.
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.360]   And you're like, what weighs three pounds?
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.640]   Does the shoe weigh three pounds?
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.120]   What should I get rid of that's going to weigh three pounds?
[00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.880]   Because I got to get less than that in here.
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.600]   So we're going through that whole process of trying to figure out how to get the weight
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.080]   on the scale because they're saying, hey, that's too much weight.
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.680]   We will not allow that to pass through.
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.320]   You need to make sure that you do something with that.
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.600]   So we're taking out shoes, stuffing them into our backpack, trying to get everything
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.080]   below the weight limit.
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.520]   And the reason I start there is because tonight we're going to talk about a subject that is
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:41.160]   related to the idea that I think when it comes to God and particularly having a relationship
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.800]   with God, there are many people in our world and many Christians, sadly, or people who
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.920]   think that they're Christians, who think that God operates a little bit like the check-in
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.400]   clerk at the airport.
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.720]   That, hey, you're going to bring your baggage in here, but let me make sure you know there
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:56.720]   is a weight limit.
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.120]   And so if you bring too much baggage in, you're on your own.
[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.800]   You're either going to have to carry that onto the airport or you're going to have to
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.800]   pay an additional fee or fine.
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.760]   That if you bring too much baggage in, that God's going to cut you out of that relationship
[00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.640]   or it's going to cost you.
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.880]   And not only that, we often think that as it relates to like our baggage in life, there
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:24.080]   are certain things that weigh certain sins, if you will, that weigh more than other sins.
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.360]   And nobody would articulate it exactly like that, but we often think that, hey, there's
[00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:35.000]   certain sins that if your baggage is just kind of jealousy and gossip and occasional
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.120]   speeding and maybe you had too much to drink at prom, it's not that big of a deal.
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:46.320]   But if it includes adultery, oh man, that's going to put you over the limit.
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:52.720]   If it includes abortion, homosexuality, if it includes any of the more serious, like
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:57.360]   that's just too much weight, you're going to have to either pay more or it's going to
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.960]   cost you and you're going to have to kind of work some of that off or you're not going
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:02.960]   to be allowed in.
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:08.000]   Tragically, Christians often even contribute to this.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.120]   Where there's this idea of whatever reason, a lot of people like think of our sins as
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.800]   though there's like a scale and certain sins weigh more than other sins.
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.000]   And so, you know, pornography or addiction or alcoholism, like that's going to be a really
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.160]   heavy bag.
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.600]   You got to deal with that or you're not getting in.
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:29.240]   But some other sins that are just kind of, you know, the occasional lying you cheated
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.160]   on your algebra test one time, that's not that big of a deal.
[00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:37.240]   And what we're going to talk about tonight and explore and study and discover is that
[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:43.000]   our idea of a scale and this idea that, hey, there's a certain baggage limit and there's
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.300]   a certain type of sin or different sins that really put you over the limit of the reach
[00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.880]   of God is totally false.
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.120]   But the Bible says that God doesn't operate like humans think, that there's kind of this
[00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.920]   scale of sins and this is really intense.
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.080]   And if you do these types of things, you're really far from God and you got to work your
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.080]   way back.
[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.680]   But he doesn't operate like that at all.
[00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:11.320]   And we're going to discover in a story in Luke chapter 19, how Jesus approaches really
[00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:18.120]   sinful people and do so by looking at one of the most notorious sinful people in all
[00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:21.840]   of the New Testament and the interaction that Jesus had with them.
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:26.120]   We're kicking off a series called Jesus Walks where for the next six weeks, we're going
[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:30.760]   to look at certain interactions and exchanges that Jesus, while he was on the planet, he
[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:36.200]   would walk up to different people and he would have an exchange that would totally blow the
[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:41.880]   paradigm of usually the person he was talking to and certainly everyone around him and the
[00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:43.840]   disciples, they were always confused.
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:50.640]   And how Jesus, who came to this planet to correct humanity's perspective on what God
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:54.840]   is like, shows up and he says, "The scale that everyone has is off."
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:58.880]   The way that God sees humanity is not the way that you think God sees humanity.
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:00.440]   So we're going to jump into Luke chapter 19.
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.320]   If you have a Bible, you can flip open there.
[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:06.240]   We're going to look at a very famous man whose name was Zacchaeus.
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:12.640]   Now, if you grew up in church, there's a song that goes along with Zacchaeus.
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:14.320]   Anyone know this song?
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:16.320]   Zacchaeus was a what?
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:20.400]   Oh man, whoever came up with that, dude.
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:23.920]   Hopefully, they're getting royalties because that thing went viral.
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:24.920]   He was a wee little man.
[00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:26.720]   A wee little man was he.
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:30.920]   He sat up in a sycamore tree.
[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:35.200]   Some of you guys haven't been in church in like 10 years, but you have got this one on lock.
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:38.560]   You know it better than Kanye's "Jesus Walk" song.
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:42.840]   Here's the problem with that song, just before we dive in, because that song sanitizes who
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:43.880]   Zacchaeus was.
[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:45.360]   Zacchaeus was not a good guy.
[00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:48.880]   He wasn't a guy that people would be like, "Oh, little Zac, little cutie right there."
[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:54.080]   He wasn't a guy that we today would look at and be like, "Oh man, that guy, I just love
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:56.120]   how Jesus is going after him."
[00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:59.160]   Zacchaeus was a borderline criminal.
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:04.000]   He was a guy that didn't have a good reputation of the day and one of the most notorious sinners
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   of his day.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.480]   And so we're going to dive in and look at Jesus's exchange, and I'll explain more what
[00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:13.520]   I'm talking about here in a second, but we'll start in verse 1 of chapter 19.
[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:16.280]   And if you don't have a Bible, the verses will be on the screen.
[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:18.160]   There's also Bibles in the Welcome Center.
[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:19.160]   That's our gift to you if you'd like one.
[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:22.400]   We'll jump in right here.
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:27.080]   Now Jesus entered Jericho and he made his way through the town.
[00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:30.440]   There was a man there named Zacchaeus.
[00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:35.120]   He was a chief tax collector in the region, and he had become very rich.
[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:36.120]   So here's what happens.
[00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:37.840]   Jesus is on his way to Jerusalem.
[00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:39.360]   That's kind of the timeline.
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:41.000]   He's going to Jerusalem to be crucified.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   That's where we are in the story, if you will.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.440]   And he's walking through, and on the way there, there's a town named Jericho.
[00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:46.920]   Jericho, here's all you got to know.
[00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:49.360]   It is like Beverly Hills in Palestine.
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:51.240]   It is the wealthy.
[00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:52.440]   It's where the wealthy would live.
[00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:54.280]   It was only the richest of the rich.
[00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:55.960]   People got vacation homes there.
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:59.080]   It's like San Diego in that it's 70 degrees year-round.
[00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:02.800]   One of the commentators or historians writes, "Jericho was such a nice place because you
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:05.960]   could wear linens all year-round."
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:06.960]   That's your thing.
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:12.200]   And just the point being that it was a very consistent 70 degrees.
[00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:14.680]   Palm trees are everywhere, so only the elite of the elite.
[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:18.120]   And inside of this town, there's a man named Zacchaeus.
[00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:21.160]   And we're told something that would have made his audience or would have made the original
[00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:23.880]   readers go, "What?"
[00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:26.400]   Zacchaeus was a tax collector.
[00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:28.800]   And not just any tax collector, chief tax collector.
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:29.800]   What does that mean?
[00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:30.800]   Is that like the IRS?
[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:32.120]   Because nobody's big fans of the IRS.
[00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:33.560]   Is that what he's trying to say?
[00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:34.560]   No.
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:36.560]   There's really not exactly a modern equivalent today.
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:42.000]   It would be like the IRS if the IRS was known for cheating and robbing you out of your money.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.200]   Hopefully, they're not.
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:48.520]   And the money that they were using was financing an oppressive army.
[00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:52.720]   And it would only be Jewish men and women who said, "You know what, dude?
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:53.720]   I'm deuces on God.
[00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:55.240]   I really don't believe this whole thing anymore.
[00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:56.960]   I don't believe the Jewish faith.
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:58.240]   I'm out on that.
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:01.280]   And the Roman army is gonna pay me to be a tax collector.
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:04.800]   And I can charge people whatever I want if I'm a tax collector.
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:06.160]   So yeah, I'll do that."
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:07.160]   So he was seen as a traitor.
[00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:11.480]   This would be like a Jewish person in Nazi Germany saying, "You know what?
[00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:14.840]   I'm not really a fan of any of these other people too, so I'll work for you guys."
[00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:18.880]   Zacchaeus was a hated person.
[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:20.680]   And we're not told he was just a tax collector.
[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:25.760]   He was a chief tax collector, that he had not been doing this for a month, a year, 10
[00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:28.080]   years, maybe, 20 years.
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:29.080]   He had worked his way up.
[00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:31.760]   He had tax collectors working for him.
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:34.760]   He was a man who was known for ripping people off.
[00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:36.000]   And he was extremely wealthy.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.120]   So here's what you know about him.
[00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:38.620]   He was hated.
[00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:39.620]   He was feared.
[00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:42.200]   If you jumped into him, he could take anything you have.
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:44.960]   He could tax you above and beyond.
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:47.360]   And he was incredibly rich.
[00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:49.160]   His only friends would have been other tax collectors.
[00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:51.360]   He's the dude who's driving around.
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:52.640]   He's got the Lambo.
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:54.520]   He's got the houses everywhere.
[00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:58.520]   He's wearing the nicest clothes, only eats the best food, has an unreal house.
[00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:02.280]   One person said, "This is the wealthiest person in the New Testament, Zacchaeus."
[00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:05.760]   And I'm pointing all that out because a lot of times we think of Zacchaeus as like, man,
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:07.760]   he's like the prostitute and the marginalizer.
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:11.400]   There's Jesus again going after the guy that, I love that about Jesus.
[00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:15.760]   This would have been like, Jesus, why would you have any interest in this man?
[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:18.980]   He's the guy who took my grandma's retirement savings away.
[00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:21.940]   He's a guy who's ruined lives.
[00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:26.120]   And Jesus comes along and they're about to have an exchange together.
[00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:32.280]   Now he, that's speaking of Zacchaeus, verse three, tried to get a look at Jesus, but he
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:34.080]   was too short to see over the crowd.
[00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:35.700]   So Jesus is walking through.
[00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:41.520]   Now this time Jesus is really famous because we're told earlier, shortly before this, he
[00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:43.940]   had raised the guy from the dead.
[00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:47.720]   And something happens when you raise people from the dead, as I'm sure you know.
[00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:49.940]   Your popularity kind of goes through the roof.
[00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:52.920]   And so everywhere he goes now, there's like crowds following him.
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:55.640]   There's a parade that begins to form as Jesus is walking through.
[00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:57.460]   They've heard this man, Jesus, is coming.
[00:11:57.460 --> 00:11:59.160]   And Zacchaeus is too short, we're told.
[00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:01.560]   He can't really see and he's looking through the crowd.
[00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:03.220]   So here's what he does.
[00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:08.760]   So he ran ahead and he climbed a sycamore fig tree beside the road for Jesus was going
[00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:11.300]   to pass that way.
[00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:20.080]   When Jesus came by, he looked up at Zacchaeus and he called him by name, Zacchaeus.
[00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:22.840]   He said, "Quick, come down.
[00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:25.360]   I must be a guest at your home today."
[00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:31.160]   Zacchaeus quickly calmed down and took Jesus into his house with great excitement and joy.
[00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:34.200]   But the people were displeased.
[00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:39.360]   They said, "He," speaking of Jesus, "has gone to be the guest of a notorious sinner."
[00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:40.360]   They grumbled.
[00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:41.880]   So Jesus, he's going through the parade.
[00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:44.400]   Zacchaeus is kind of getting up, wondering what he's going to look like.
[00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:47.760]   And all of a sudden, he's looking down at the parade, Zacchaeus from the tree, and he
[00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:48.760]   sees this man.
[00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:50.160]   Everyone's gathered around to see Jesus.
[00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:55.280]   And Jesus stops the parade and he looks up in the tree and says, "Zacchaeus, what was
[00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:56.280]   that moment like?
[00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:59.520]   A total stranger shows up from out of town and he knows your name?"
[00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:01.160]   And he says, "Come down.
[00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:03.760]   I'm going to spend my rest of the day with you.
[00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:05.680]   I'm going into your house."
[00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:08.520]   What that basically meant in that time would be like, "Hey, I'm associating with you.
[00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:11.640]   I want to have a relationship with you."
[00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:13.680]   And the crowd reacts like many of us would react.
[00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:15.040]   "What are you doing?
[00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:16.760]   Do you not know who this person is?
[00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:18.760]   Do you not know what home you're going into?
[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:21.600]   Do you not know how he paid for the home you're about to go into?"
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:23.280]   This is Jesus coming through town.
[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:25.360]   He goes into Hugh Hefner's home.
[00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:28.000]   He's the guy they don't want to spend time with in this whole city.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.640]   He doesn't talk to anybody but Zacchaeus.
[00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:36.040]   First idea really we see from this, and really the three points that I'm going to give you
[00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:37.040]   tonight.
[00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:42.800]   My biggest fear is that these are truths that are so tremendously important and yet for
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:46.160]   many of you, they're going to fall on deaf ears because you've heard them but you really
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:47.160]   haven't embraced them.
[00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:51.160]   But the first idea that we see from this interaction of Jesus saying, "Hey, before you do anything
[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:55.920]   right Zacchaeus, I'm coming to be with you."
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:59.760]   It's simply that your sin doesn't keep Christ from seeking you.
[00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:04.520]   Your sin, anyone else's sin, sin in general, is not a barrier for Christ to come and have
[00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:06.880]   a relationship with you.
[00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:09.720]   This was not just a wee little man, this was a wicked little man.
[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:13.000]   And Jesus before anything had been done right in Zacchaeus' life says, "I want to have a
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.520]   relationship with you.
[00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:18.680]   I'm coming in to spend time with you before you get anything right in your life.
[00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:22.600]   You're the one that I want to spend and have a relationship with."
[00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:29.200]   I know there's many of you in the room, you think that there's a barrier between God wanting
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:34.560]   to know you, seeking after you, having a relationship with you because of sin in your past, sin
[00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:38.880]   in your present, that there's a God who's there, that your behavior today or your behavior
[00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:40.800]   in your past is a barrier for him.
[00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:46.800]   But the truth of the Bible is your sin does not keep Christ from seeking after you.
[00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:51.280]   Christ was far more interested in seeking Zacchaeus than Zacchaeus was in seeing him.
[00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:54.680]   And he said, "I'm going into your house today."
[00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:57.880]   Oftentimes it seems like we're so like bent to be like, "Dude, if I'm going to have a
[00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:01.040]   relationship with God, I really need to get things in order in my life."
[00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:04.080]   And it's kind of like this, this past weekend we had a birthday party for my one-year-old
[00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:05.080]   daughter.
[00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:10.200]   It was her birthday and so it was at our house, we planned it all out and we realized like
[00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:12.600]   the day before, "Man, we need to clean this place."
[00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:15.920]   We have family friends coming over, family in our community coming over.
[00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:20.120]   And so for the next like for eight hours straight, I mean, we are cleaning this entire house,
[00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:23.320]   we're putting candles in rooms that have never seen candles before.
[00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:25.960]   My wife is like getting out brownies and baking.
[00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:28.800]   We haven't baked brownies maybe ever in this house.
[00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:29.800]   We're cleaning everything.
[00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:32.280]   It's as though we're like, "Hey, we need to make this place look like no one has ever
[00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:33.280]   lived here before."
[00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:35.440]   So we're cleaning, we're throwing pillows on different stuff.
[00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:39.320]   If it can't be shoved in a closet and it's in the way clutter, it's like just throw it
[00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:40.320]   in the trash.
[00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:41.320]   We need to get this stuff out of here.
[00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:42.320]   There's people coming over here to see us.
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:45.080]   True story, we got a babysitter so that we could clean.
[00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:46.880]   How embarrassing is that?
[00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:50.520]   It was like, man, this is terrible.
[00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:53.640]   And this was our closest friends and family.
[00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:57.800]   It was like the people who are closest to us in the world, we need to pretend that our
[00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:00.240]   life is a lot more in order than possible.
[00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:02.880]   So people are coming over, there's music on, "Let me light this candle.
[00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:04.640]   I'm in an apron just baking over here.
[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:05.640]   Hey, how are you?"
[00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:07.960]   And yeah, this is just like our life.
[00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:09.480]   This is always what it looks like.
[00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:13.600]   And how ridiculous is that?
[00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:17.200]   Because despite being the closest people that we have a relationship with, there's part
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:22.200]   of us that feels like, man, we need to pretend that kind of our life is in order and this
[00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:24.240]   is all great.
[00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:28.080]   And sadly, that is how a lot of people think when it comes to God.
[00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:30.400]   That, hey, you've got to get life in order.
[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:33.720]   If God's going to come have a relationship with you, if you're going to really experience
[00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:36.920]   knowing Jesus, that you first need to clean yourself up.
[00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:38.320]   You need to make sure things are in order.
[00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:42.680]   You need to put things and just kind of keep them in the closet of your past before God
[00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:45.120]   wants to come in and have a relationship with you.
[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:49.360]   The message of Zacchaeus or really this story that we're looking at is before anything had
[00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:53.560]   changed, Jesus said, "I've been seeking after you."
[00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:57.600]   Before anything changes in your life, in your world, Jesus has been seeking after you and
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:00.080]   you don't have to pretend.
[00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:04.240]   Just like you shouldn't have to pretend with family and friends, like, "Hey, this is what's
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:05.240]   going on."
[00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:07.680]   The God who's there knows everything.
[00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:10.760]   And it's crazy that there's still some part of us that feels like I have to pretend.
[00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:12.600]   Like, what do I mean by that?
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:19.400]   I mean, the desire to kind of seem like, you know, "God, I'm worthy of your love," can
[00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:21.080]   manifest itself in all kinds of ways.
[00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:24.160]   Like, some of you, you pray weird because you're trying to impress God.
[00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:25.800]   Have you ever been around someone like this?
[00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:29.040]   Like all of a sudden, they're like, "Hey, I feel like I just need to downshift into
[00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:30.400]   King James Version."
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:32.400]   And they're just beginning to pray.
[00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:36.360]   Or you know, like, the way that you pray is you, it's basically like you're reading the
[00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:37.360]   Declaration of Independence.
[00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:42.440]   It's like, "Our Father, we owe these truths to be self-evident."
[00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:47.320]   And you're like trying to almost be impressive as though that's why God wants to listen or
[00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:48.320]   would listen.
[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:53.120]   Others of you, you feel like you can't come to church after you got wasted on Saturday
[00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:54.120]   night.
[00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:57.440]   You're like, "I got to give a little space, let this thing breathe a little bit.
[00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:03.060]   I feel like I, you know, haven't behaved in a way that God really would want to have anything
[00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:04.060]   to do with me."
[00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:07.600]   Some of you, you're not reading your Bible because you're looking at pornography consistently,
[00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:13.480]   and it just fills you with shame and you continue on the cycle.
[00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:15.240]   Shame can manifest itself in all kinds of ways.
[00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:20.440]   Some of you, maybe you feel like God, if He's there, doesn't want to have anything to do
[00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:24.400]   with you because you're filled on the inside when you're alone and when you're really honest
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:27.080]   with yourself with shame, and it drives you from Him.
[00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:31.760]   And the message of Zacchaeus and the message really of Jesus all throughout the Bible is
[00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:37.280]   that there is no sin that keeps the Savior from seeking to have a relationship, from
[00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:40.200]   seeking to walk in relationship with you.
[00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:42.720]   The truth is God knows everything about your life.
[00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:44.160]   Like there is no pretending, there is no hiding.
[00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:45.400]   He sees all the closets.
[00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:46.760]   He sees within everything.
[00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:49.440]   He knows what you did last summer and four summers ago.
[00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:53.920]   He knows everything broken and messed up, and He says, "I want to come spend time with
[00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:56.760]   you, Zacchaeus, and I want to come spend time with you."
[00:18:56.760 --> 00:19:02.360]   Fill in the blank, that your sin does not keep Christ from seeking after you.
[00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:08.440]   The Bible teaches that it is not, you know, hey, there's some good people and bad people
[00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:12.960]   because there's really another flawed way that I think a lot of us think about ourselves
[00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:15.880]   really and kind of as it relates to God.
[00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:20.480]   And if the first is that flawed idea that I got to clean myself up before God wants
[00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:25.160]   to know me, the second is that, man, I really don't even have that much to clean up.
[00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:29.120]   There's some people that are pretty messed up and they really need to clean up.
[00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:34.040]   It's kind of a lie about this, hey, I'm not really that bad of a person.
[00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:37.320]   That Jesus wants to have a relationship with sinners and I love that and He also wants
[00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:39.880]   to have relationships with me, you know, because I'm a pretty good guy.
[00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:43.920]   And the Bible would say that's crazy.
[00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:44.920]   Humans think like this.
[00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:46.960]   They're like, hey, there's good people and there's bad people.
[00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:48.760]   There's people with a good heart and people with a bad heart.
[00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:51.640]   It's like, you know, good heart, which is me and you, of course, and then there's like
[00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:57.000]   the bad hearts that are like Hitler and Osama bin Laden and ISIS, like those are the bad
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   apples.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.120]   And the Bible doesn't teach that there's some good people and bad people.
[00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:07.440]   It says there's only bad people and one good guy, Jesus, who came to die for all the bad
[00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:10.920]   and broken people in this world.
[00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:14.000]   And so inside of the room, the other lie that you can buy is, hey, I need to clean everything
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.560]   up in my life before God could want me, is that, hey, I deserve for God to want me in
[00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:21.520]   all of my greatness 'cause I'm really not that bad of a person.
[00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:25.200]   And Jesus said, I came for sinners.
[00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:29.900]   The only way you can have a relationship with me is to acknowledge you are a sinner.
[00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:31.760]   You have fallen short of God's standards.
[00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:33.840]   You're not a good person.
[00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:37.760]   Another way of saying it is the gap between you and Hitler is much smaller than the gap
[00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:39.720]   between you and Jesus.
[00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:41.520]   And he's come for sinners.
[00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:44.480]   And let me be abundantly clear, 'cause there's some people in the room that you think, you've
[00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:48.680]   kind of got this like workspace theology to, hey, if I'm good, God will accept me.
[00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:53.160]   If I, you know, pretty much don't steal and murder anybody, like I'll be fine.
[00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:54.520]   And the Bible doesn't teach that.
[00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:58.040]   It teaches everyone is messed up, everyone is sinners, everyone is broken.
[00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:01.440]   And Jesus did not just become and come to be a friend of sinners.
[00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:03.560]   Let me be abundantly clear.
[00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:06.380]   He is only the friend of sinners.
[00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:11.080]   He's only the friend of people who are willing to say, I need a savior.
[00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:14.760]   My life is messed up, no matter how good I think I am, no matter how I stack up to the
[00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:19.760]   person next to me, no matter how bad I think I am and how far I've fallen from the standards
[00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:23.920]   of my parents or my standards of my friends or my own standards, I need a savior.
[00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:29.360]   That is the person who, like Zacchaeus, is a candidate for God's grace.
[00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:32.240]   The crowd, here's the irony, the craziness of the crowd.
[00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:37.400]   They look at Jesus as he goes into the house of Zacchaeus and they go, what?
[00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:42.280]   This guy's gone in to be the home guest of a notorious sinner.
[00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:46.680]   The irony in that is everyone in that crowd was a sinner.
[00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:47.880]   Think about it.
[00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:50.980]   Jesus could have come out of that house and been like, look, all right, Beverly, I know
[00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:53.080]   what you did, had too much drink last night.
[00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:56.920]   You slept with somebody who wasn't your wife and you, I feel like you got a little tipsy
[00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:57.920]   at prom that one time.
[00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:01.720]   He could have come out and pointed out everything wrong and broken in every single person in
[00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:03.600]   that crowd's life, but the crowd couldn't see it.
[00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:07.480]   They saw, like many people today see, hey, there's kind of good people like us and then
[00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:09.920]   there's bad people.
[00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:12.600]   We deserve God's love, but they don't.
[00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:17.360]   You are never more in danger of hell than when you begin to believe things like that.
[00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:20.640]   You're someone who, hey, if God's out there, as long as I'm a pretty good person, he should
[00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:21.640]   accept me.
[00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:27.740]   The Bible says that there is no exceptions, no exceptions to who God will accept, as long
[00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:32.520]   as the acceptance is that trusting in what God did, what Christ did on my behalf.
[00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:33.520]   He paid for it.
[00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:37.960]   Not because I earned it, not because I deserve it, but because he paid for it.
[00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:44.120]   And Zacchaeus went in and he experienced for the very first time a relationship with God
[00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:47.280]   that he'd given up long ago and something happened.
[00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:53.280]   Verse seven, "But the people were displeased and they said, 'He's gone in to be the guest
[00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:54.840]   of a notorious sinner.'
[00:22:54.840 --> 00:23:01.000]   Meanwhile, Zacchaeus stood before the Lord and said, 'I will give half of my wealth to
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   the poor.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:07.400]   And if I have cheated any people on their taxes, I will give them four times as much.'"
[00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:11.280]   There's something that happens between verse seven and eight that we're not given vision
[00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:12.280]   into.
[00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:17.280]   Jesus goes into the house, they share a meal.
[00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:19.880]   We don't know if it was four hours, we don't know if it was an entire day, maybe it was
[00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:22.360]   just an evening.
[00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:29.120]   But they're hanging together and you've got to think, like, what is Zacchaeus thinking?
[00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:36.040]   He's looking into the eyes of probably the most compassionate person he's ever seen and
[00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:38.360]   will ever see.
[00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:42.580]   He's seeing the man that everyone in crowds want to see and they're eating a meal together
[00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:47.840]   and he doesn't feel condemnation and rejection and shame, we're not told any of that.
[00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:49.880]   And something begins to happen inside of that meal.
[00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:55.120]   If I was Zacchaeus, I'd be wondering, does Jesus know what paid for the food that he's
[00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:56.120]   eating right now?
[00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:58.080]   Like, does he know what I've done?
[00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:01.320]   Does he know who I am?
[00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:04.480]   And the answer would be yes.
[00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:10.000]   And throughout the course of that meal, something happened to Zacchaeus and everything began
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   to change.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.800]   It's as though in the midst of the conversation, he wells up, he can't stand it anymore, and
[00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:15.640]   he stands up, he's like, "I've got to make a toast.
[00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:17.560]   I'm changing everything.
[00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:20.480]   Jesus, I'm changing everything.
[00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:23.360]   I'm giving half of everything that I own away to the poor.
[00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:27.180]   If I've cheated anyone, if I've sinned or robbed against anybody, I'm not just going
[00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:31.680]   to pay back what I took from them, I'm going to go back and pay four times what I took
[00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:33.600]   from them originally."
[00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:37.000]   And everything began to change.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.440]   Zacchaeus experienced the love of Christ and it changed him.
[00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:44.800]   The second idea really from this text is that it is love, not laws, that lead to lasting
[00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:45.800]   change.
[00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:50.200]   It's love, not laws, that lead to lasting change.
[00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:54.000]   What drove Zacchaeus was he encountered the love of Jesus and it drove him out of a love
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.200]   in response to that to extravagant ends.
[00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:00.700]   What do I mean by that?
[00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:03.920]   He just said, "I'm going to give half of everything that I owe to the poor, and if I owe anybody
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:07.240]   four times," he's like, "Dude, if I go broke on all this, I don't even care.
[00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:10.500]   So I'm selling the Lambo, I'm getting rid of the camels and the chariots, whatever I
[00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:14.640]   got to, I'm giving it away, Jesus, because you're worth more than all of that."
[00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:16.080]   Think about that.
[00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:18.440]   Half of everything you owe, if your roommate came home tonight and they're like, "Hey,
[00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:21.760]   dude, I met Jesus, I'm giving away half of everything that I've done, can't believe it,"
[00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:22.800]   what would you think?
[00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:26.520]   Some of you don't even tithe, and when you do, you're like, "I feel like I'm doing a
[00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:27.520]   favor to God.
[00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:28.520]   Here's $25."
[00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:35.000]   Zacchaeus says, "Half of everything, I don't even care anymore."
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.480]   Clearly a man who had changed.
[00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:41.360]   Further extravagant was the fact that he said, "I'm going to pay back way beyond what the
[00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:42.680]   law requires."
[00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:45.480]   This was not about what the law says, it was about love.
[00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:49.680]   He had encountered the love of Christ and it changed him and moved him out of a love
[00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:52.520]   for Christ to change.
[00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:53.520]   What do I mean by that?
[00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:58.680]   In the Old Testament, if you cheated somebody, if you stole from somebody, there was a law.
[00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:01.360]   It said this in Leviticus chapter 6, verse 1 through 5.
[00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:06.320]   It says, "If you steal, you have to pay back what you stole plus one-fifth."
[00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:10.600]   So if I stole $100, I pay back $100 plus one-fifth, that's $20.
[00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:12.320]   So that's $120.
[00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:17.400]   Zacchaeus says, "Everybody that I stole $100 from, I'm giving an additional $400 to.
[00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:20.280]   I'm going above and beyond, way beyond what the law being required."
[00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:21.280]   Think about that.
[00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:25.480]   I mean, this would be the equivalent of if you've ever had your car stereo stolen, somebody
[00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:29.880]   showing up at your door and being like, "Hey, sorry, stole the stereo, so here's this and
[00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:30.880]   here's four more."
[00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:33.640]   You'd be like, "What?
[00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:34.640]   Who are you?"
[00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:40.160]   And Zacchaeus, one by one, went to the people he had stolen from because it was not law
[00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:41.160]   that drove.
[00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:44.040]   This is what changes people, man.
[00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:46.560]   What's changed people in the room is not like they've come to church and they've got some
[00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:50.040]   new rules and some code that's led them to be like, "Oh, now I'm going to really try
[00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:51.040]   to be a good person."
[00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:53.040]   That doesn't work.
[00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:54.920]   What changed Zacchaeus was love.
[00:26:54.920 --> 00:27:01.400]   He encountered the love of Christ and it drove him out of a response of love towards Christ
[00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:02.800]   and everything began to change.
[00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:06.440]   Some of you inside of the room, the reason why, like maybe you're here and you came with
[00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:07.840]   a friend and you've like seen their life.
[00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:09.000]   I hear this story all the time.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.720]   Like, "Dude, yeah, a buddy of mine, he's been going to your church and it's like, man, he's
[00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:16.520]   like uber Christian, like all over the top.
[00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:18.640]   He's like there like four nights a week.
[00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:22.160]   He doesn't do any of this stuff we don't, we used to like, you know, go smoke a bowl.
[00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:23.360]   He's not into that anymore."
[00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:25.720]   It's just totally changed.
[00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:27.280]   Why?
[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:29.480]   Is because some new rules that he's found?
[00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:30.480]   No.
[00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:33.720]   He's found and fell in love with a savior and experienced the love of Christ that has made
[00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:35.720]   him go, "I don't care what I have to leave behind.
[00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:37.240]   Everything I'm experiencing here is so much better.
[00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:41.080]   So if no one goes with me, I'm going."
[00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:43.680]   And Zacchaeus said, "Whatever it costs, I don't care.
[00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:44.680]   I'm making a change."
[00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:49.760]   And it was out of an overflow and response to that love that he moved.
[00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:54.960]   Some of you, the reason why like Christians hate sin and the reasons why we fight against
[00:27:54.960 --> 00:28:01.240]   sin is not because we have to in order to have a relationship with God.
[00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:06.020]   It's because we have a relationship with God and we don't want anything to interrupt the
[00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:07.920]   intimacy that we can experience with him.
[00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:09.960]   So it's like, "Man, I'm going to fight against anything.
[00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:16.600]   I'm going to confess sin inside of my life, whether it's anger or lust, masturbation,
[00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:21.200]   pornography, stuff from my past, anything that could inhibit that because Jesus is so
[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:22.200]   much better.
[00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:23.760]   This is how and why people change."
[00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:28.080]   It's not because of just some like, "Here, keep these 12 different rules that you have
[00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:29.080]   to run through."
[00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:34.040]   And Zacchaeus in a moment encounters the love of God and changes.
[00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:36.320]   We've seen love changes people.
[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:37.320]   We've all seen this.
[00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:42.360]   If you've ever seen somebody dating, if you've ever dated before, like you see people like
[00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:47.160]   adopt new habits, new hobbies when they start dating somebody.
[00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:51.640]   Like we've all, maybe you have a guy friend who's like, "Yeah, now I get pedicures.
[00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:52.640]   It's what we do.
[00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:53.640]   And you know, it's cool, man.
[00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:54.640]   I'm into it."
[00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:56.440]   And you're like, "Okay."
[00:28:56.440 --> 00:29:00.360]   And or the girl who's like, "Yes, I love the cowboys."
[00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:02.720]   And it's because she started dating some guy with the cowboys.
[00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:05.840]   And you're like, "Can you name a cowboy?"
[00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:08.560]   And you're like, "Dirk Nowinski."
[00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:13.240]   And like, "I don't think, I think you're just into this because he's into this."
[00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:14.440]   Like when people fall in love, they change.
[00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:18.760]   The best one of all time is particularly around guys and ladies.
[00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:20.600]   You may never even see this, but this is what happens.
[00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:23.720]   Let me tell you what happens every time a guy calls you.
[00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:26.440]   If he's hanging out with these buddies, dude, this is gold.
[00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:28.520]   I'm going to try to be short here.
[00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:31.280]   He's hanging out, it happens to all of us, myself included, hanging out with your buddies.
[00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:34.720]   You're like, "Yeah, dude, I cannot believe, you know, Dak, that happened.
[00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:36.400]   Oh my gosh, some massive words."
[00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:39.440]   And then you'll call and it's like, "Hey, give me a sec.
[00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:40.440]   Oh, hi.
[00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:41.440]   Yeah.
[00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:42.440]   Oh no."
[00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:45.460]   It's to the point where it changes them so much.
[00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:46.840]   We always walk away.
[00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:48.280]   We're like, "We're going to give you guys a second."
[00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:50.360]   And it happens every single time you walk over there.
[00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:51.360]   You're like, "No, I love you.
[00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:52.360]   No, you hang up.
[00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:53.360]   No, you hang up.
[00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:54.360]   No, you."
[00:29:54.360 --> 00:30:00.120]   And it's like, he goes from all of a sudden thug life to Romeo because love changes people.
[00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:01.120]   Dude, that is true.
[00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:02.120]   It happens every time.
[00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:04.280]   Guys, you know what I'm talking about.
[00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:06.440]   Because love changes people.
[00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:08.720]   It leads to different behavior and different actions.
[00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:11.760]   It far exceeds anything the law could do.
[00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:14.680]   Just like in that dating relationship, like if somebody just told you, "Hey, I want you
[00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:16.280]   to like that girl.
[00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:17.280]   Here's the rules.
[00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:20.200]   When you talk on the phone, you got to talk like, you know, you're back in seventh grade,
[00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:22.320]   pre-puberty, and that's what you have to do."
[00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:26.240]   People would not do it if they didn't actually have a desire, a love, and affection for that
[00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:27.240]   girl in the same way.
[00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:29.960]   This is why, and this is how Christians live the Christian faith and Christian life.
[00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:31.320]   This is why people change.
[00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:35.040]   This is why people begin to make decisions more in line with that because they're like,
[00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:38.920]   "Dude, I just want more of Jesus."
[00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:40.880]   And I begin to experience it in such a royal way.
[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:42.680]   I just want more and more of that.
[00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:45.040]   Zacchaeus experienced it and everything changed.
[00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:49.280]   It's love, not law that leads to lasting change.
[00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:54.600]   Jude, the brother of Jesus.
[00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:56.600]   Jude has one book in the Bible.
[00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:57.600]   It's only one chapter long.
[00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:00.040]   It's a very short Bible or a very short book.
[00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:06.200]   And in that chapter, he says something about the way that the Christian life is lived.
[00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:08.680]   Here's a guy who actually, Jesus' baby brother, you may not know that.
[00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:12.200]   There's two guys in the Bible who wrote books in the New Testament, scholars would say,
[00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:15.240]   are the brothers of Jesus, Jude and James.
[00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:19.640]   And Jude writes in the 21st verse, he says, "Here's what I want you to do.
[00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:26.120]   Keep yourselves in God's love as you wait for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to
[00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:27.600]   bring you to eternal life."
[00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:29.240]   What do I do, Jude?
[00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:30.360]   We're waiting on God.
[00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:32.200]   We're trying to make sure that we live out the Christian life.
[00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:34.080]   How do I spend the rest of my life?
[00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:35.880]   Keep yourselves in the love of God.
[00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:39.520]   Think about that sentence from the little brother of Jesus who says, "Hey, hey, let
[00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:41.200]   me give you a secret.
[00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:43.640]   Keep yourselves in God's love for you."
[00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:45.960]   You want to be someone who actually experiences change in your life.
[00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:47.280]   You want to live out the Christian life.
[00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:51.200]   It won't come by bootstrap obedience, by trying harder, and anyone who tells you it
[00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:54.480]   will is lying to you.
[00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:59.800]   It comes by experiencing God's love, understanding how God sees you, that despite the fact that
[00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:06.520]   you did not earn it, you don't deserve it, that God loved and sought and seeks you.
[00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:09.160]   Wherever you're at right now, whatever you're going through, whatever you did today, that
[00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:11.720]   there's a God who's crazy in love with you.
[00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:16.240]   And Jude says, "Hey, here's what I want you to do while you wait.
[00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:18.920]   Church for all of eternity until Jesus comes back."
[00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:20.760]   Or for how many thousand years?
[00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:25.040]   Keep yourselves in God's love.
[00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:27.240]   And then you know what happens?
[00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:28.920]   You'll love because he loved you.
[00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:31.800]   That's what 1 John chapter 4 says.
[00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:35.320]   That it ends up overflowing inside of your life.
[00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:38.360]   Some of you, more than anything else, I hope you hear that.
[00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:43.280]   That you would think and operate as someone who sees themselves, that your identity is
[00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:44.320]   so wrapped.
[00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:49.960]   Jesus loves me, the God of the universe, the God who created the stars and breathed all
[00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:58.760]   things into existence, loves me to the point where he would die on a cross for me, for
[00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:07.880]   you, despite everything messed up in your life.
[00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:11.440]   Zacchaeus experienced that love and it changed him.
[00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:15.720]   Verse 9 says this, about to close.
[00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:19.920]   And Jesus responded, "Dude, I love this.
[00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:25.080]   Salvation has come to this home today.
[00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:28.880]   For this man has shown himself to be a true son of Abraham.
[00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:37.000]   For the son of man came to seek and to save those who are lost.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.280]   That salvation has come to this house."
[00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:43.960]   He's a child of Abraham basically means like, hey, he's a true child of the faith.
[00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:46.500]   He's one of the descendants of Abraham, the father of faith.
[00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:48.360]   He's one of those followers.
[00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:50.480]   He's a true follower.
[00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:54.320]   But he experienced a conversion with Jesus in that moment.
[00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:58.200]   And the reason I said I love it is what does he say?
[00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:00.160]   Salvation came to this person's house.
[00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:09.440]   He personifies salvation, which is so interesting because who came to Zacchaeus' house?
[00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:12.520]   Jesus.
[00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:16.080]   The third thing we see from the story, and this is so huge for so many of you who grew
[00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:19.640]   up in backgrounds and denominational faiths that don't teach this, what we just see in
[00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:25.760]   this passage, salvation begins and is about a person, not a process.
[00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:28.080]   Salvation comes with a person, not a process.
[00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:29.840]   Salvation comes with a person named Jesus.
[00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:32.000]   It has a name, Jesus.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   It is not a process.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.040]   It doesn't take place over you keeping sacraments over your life.
[00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:38.800]   The Bible teaches the message of Jesus.
[00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:43.840]   Hey, salvation showed up at this guy's house because that salvation is me.
[00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:47.360]   Salvation begins and is experienced and is about a person.
[00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:52.520]   It's about you knowing Jesus, not about you keeping a process over your life.
[00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:58.240]   Salvation is about a person, not about you doing confessional, getting baptized, keeping
[00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:01.800]   a certain number of sacraments, praying a certain number of times a day.
[00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:06.000]   It begins and has always been about a person.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.200]   And Zacchaeus encounters in a moment of faith a person.
[00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:12.480]   And in doing so, he encountered salvation.
[00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:13.480]   Everything changed.
[00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:18.840]   His past changed, his current day changed, and he changed.
[00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:24.640]   Christianity to keep going along those lines we've already said, begins to take place and
[00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:31.440]   the process only takes place after the person in that relationship with Christ has started.
[00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:35.640]   And you enter into this unending, unbreakable covenant with Jesus.
[00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:36.640]   And then the process takes place.
[00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:41.040]   But the Bible says that's his responsibility, not yours.
[00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:44.480]   He's the one who's faithful to continue the good work that he started in you, Philippians
[00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:46.840]   chapter one verse six says.
[00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:50.200]   And it is that relationship, that new covenant that brings about change.
[00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:51.520]   It's not dissimilar to this.
[00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:56.400]   Like when I got married, there was a new covenant relationship I entered into, a new person
[00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:59.440]   in my world and a new way, and everything changed.
[00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:00.840]   What do I mean by that?
[00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:02.520]   Practically lots of things changed.
[00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:08.000]   I went from eating TV dinners and sleeping on a futon, and all of a sudden, it's like
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:14.280]   we have three meals a day, we have pillows, pillows, we got pillows everywhere.
[00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:18.200]   Anybody needs a pillow tonight, I got you, and then some.
[00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:22.600]   I used to be in a flag football league, men.
[00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:28.480]   Now I am a member of the Arboretum, and everything changes.
[00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:32.320]   Where you go changes, what you eat changes, what you do change, how you spend your time,
[00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:33.880]   because there's a new person, a new covenant.
[00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:37.040]   That's what Christianity says happens with somebody who's encountered Jesus.
[00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:41.200]   This is why some of you, you've come to know and trust in Jesus, and it's hard for you
[00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:42.200]   to go back.
[00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:44.320]   You know why that is?
[00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:47.240]   You find yourself, you want to go back to the club or go back to the bar and hang on
[00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:50.240]   Friday night, and it's like you can't even be who you used to be anymore.
[00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:51.240]   You can't even do it.
[00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:56.400]   You go to try to pick up a girl, and you're like, "Hey, girl, you have a Bible, and you
[00:36:56.400 --> 00:37:00.760]   can't even do it, because you have stepped into this relationship, and it has begun to
[00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:01.760]   change you."
[00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:04.440]   The God who's there is saying, "Man, I've got a hold on you.
[00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:08.800]   I am entering into a relationship with you, because this is about a person, not a process.
[00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:11.520]   For the rest of your days, I'm going to finish that work."
[00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:13.760]   That's why some of you are like, "Dude, I can't even do it anymore.
[00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:17.520]   I can't even do it with the same enjoyment that I used to be able to."
[00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:20.840]   Because Jesus has gotten a hold of your life.
[00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:24.040]   Some of you, this is why Christianity, you would say, never worked, because you thought
[00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:26.560]   it was about a process.
[00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:32.280]   Christianity is about being in a relationship with a person, and that is how change begins
[00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:33.280]   to come.
[00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:37.920]   The thing that's figured out in addition to that is something I've never really noticed
[00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:41.280]   before, and I was trying to explain this to someone earlier, and so hopefully this comes
[00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:43.480]   out clear.
[00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:49.320]   It says that Jesus came to seek and to save those who are lost.
[00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:51.680]   When I read that verse, I've always focused on, like, "Man, he came to save.
[00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:56.200]   That's what Jesus came to save, lost people."
[00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:58.360]   It tells us something about the heart of God.
[00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:00.280]   He came not just to save lost people.
[00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:02.820]   That is a very big part, and that is clearly a part.
[00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:07.040]   Kind of a two-part system, or two-part thing of why he said he came, but he came to seek.
[00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:10.840]   There's not a person on the planet that God has not been, since the moment they breathe
[00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:12.520]   their first breath, seeking.
[00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:16.480]   He's all about seeking lost people, which is everyone.
[00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:21.600]   As bad as Zacchaeus sought to know Jesus, Jesus was far more interested in knowing him.
[00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:22.600]   What do I mean by that?
[00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:23.600]   Think about it.
[00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:27.000]   Zacchaeus said, "Man, I'm willing to climb up and do whatever I have to in order to see
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   Jesus."
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:31.300]   Zacchaeus said, "I'm willing to do whatever it takes, including die, in order to save
[00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:32.300]   Zacchaeus."
[00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:35.660]   Zacchaeus was willing to climb up a tree to see Jesus.
[00:38:35.660 --> 00:38:39.580]   Jesus was willing to die on a tree to save Zacchaeus.
[00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:42.220]   Zacchaeus said, "I'll give half of my money to the poor."
[00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:45.660]   Jesus said, "I'll give all of my life for you, Zacchaeus."
[00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:49.220]   Whatever you think, whatever link to which you think, "Man, I'm interested in knowing
[00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:51.180]   God," he is far more interested in knowing you.
[00:38:51.180 --> 00:38:57.780]   He is far more interested and far more seeking of you, because that's the heart of God.
[00:38:57.780 --> 00:38:58.780]   That's what he is.
[00:38:58.780 --> 00:39:04.220]   No matter how far people run and no matter if they run until they die, God is seeking
[00:39:04.220 --> 00:39:07.380]   after lost people to know him.
[00:39:07.380 --> 00:39:12.220]   He's seeking after, or he did seek after Hitler every day that he was alive.
[00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:13.380]   Seeking after every member of ISIS.
[00:39:13.380 --> 00:39:17.980]   He's seeking after every political person, depending on which side you fall, who seems
[00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:18.980]   like the enemy.
[00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:24.780]   I'll tell you what God's first and biggest concern with Joe Biden and Donald Trump is,
[00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:25.780]   Jesus.
[00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:31.580]   His biggest concern with you is the same concern that he had with Zacchaeus, is that you would
[00:39:31.580 --> 00:39:32.580]   know him.
[00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:38.860]   He's doing everything that he can to let you know that.
[00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:47.140]   The truth and the irony in that whole bag and weight situation is a funny thing, man.
[00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:50.780]   You take the bag out, and I've been told there's weight limits on the plane, so you can only
[00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:53.220]   bring certain amounts.
[00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:57.300]   They stack them in there, and they account for each person to weigh a certain amount.
[00:39:57.300 --> 00:40:02.260]   The reason I say it's ironic is it's still coming on the plane.
[00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:05.700]   I'm taking it out of that bag, and it's going in my backpack, and it's still going on the
[00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:06.700]   plane.
[00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:07.700]   Everyone knows that, right?
[00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:09.580]   We all good there?
[00:40:09.580 --> 00:40:12.500]   It's a little bit like, "Yeah, okay, I'll hold the socks.
[00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:19.300]   I guess I'll do that if that's going to really make this thing go down in the Pacific Ocean."
[00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:20.300]   It's still coming on.
[00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:23.460]   They may say there's a weight limit, and you can't get past here with that, or that's too
[00:40:23.460 --> 00:40:24.460]   much weight.
[00:40:24.460 --> 00:40:28.140]   You're going to have to carry that yourself, because we can't afford it.
[00:40:28.140 --> 00:40:29.140]   We can't hang in.
[00:40:29.140 --> 00:40:33.300]   We can't put that down there, not that weight.
[00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:37.060]   That is so unlike what Jesus says he is all about.
[00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:39.540]   In fact, he says the opposite.
[00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:40.900]   I'm going to close here.
[00:40:40.900 --> 00:40:41.900]   I'm laying on the plane.
[00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:43.740]   We're about to finish.
[00:40:43.740 --> 00:40:46.060]   He says the opposite is true.
[00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:49.580]   He says that it's not that, "Hey, you know, I'm going to carry most of it, but if there's
[00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:51.140]   any overages, then you're on your own.
[00:40:51.140 --> 00:40:52.580]   You've got to carry that onto the plane."
[00:40:52.580 --> 00:40:56.300]   He says, "I carry all of it or none of it.
[00:40:56.300 --> 00:41:00.980]   I carry every sin you've ever committed, everything messed up you've ever done, or I carry none
[00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:01.980]   of it."
[00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:05.260]   There's no you carry some and I carry some halfway, and you really work hard, and then
[00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:06.540]   we can have a relationship together.
[00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:11.420]   Jesus says, "I carry all of it or none of it."
[00:41:11.420 --> 00:41:17.140]   If you're going to have a relationship, it's going to involve you saying, "God, I surrender
[00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:18.140]   everything.
[00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:21.860]   You paid for every sin I've ever committed in my past, everything I've ever done in my
[00:41:21.860 --> 00:41:23.420]   present, everything I'm going to do in my future.
[00:41:23.420 --> 00:41:25.580]   You paid for all of it, God.
[00:41:25.580 --> 00:41:27.820]   I don't have to wonder anymore if I'm going to have eternal life.
[00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:28.820]   You paid for everything."
[00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:31.620]   That's what the message of Jesus says.
[00:41:31.620 --> 00:41:35.700]   It's not whosoever achieves can have eternal life.
[00:41:35.700 --> 00:41:38.580]   It's whosoever receives.
[00:41:38.580 --> 00:41:41.820]   Jesus has eternal life.
[00:41:41.820 --> 00:41:44.900]   The Bible says in Romans chapter five, verses six, seven, and eight, this.
[00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:49.260]   This is so huge, and so I'm going to land right here, because it's so applicable to
[00:41:49.260 --> 00:41:53.340]   all of us.
[00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:57.980]   Paul says, and he's writing this letter, and he says, "Let me tell you about what God did
[00:41:57.980 --> 00:42:02.780]   and when he did it for you.
[00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:06.260]   You see, at just the right time."
[00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:10.660]   What is the right time, Paul?
[00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:18.540]   When we were still powerless, when we couldn't obey God, we didn't want to obey God, we had
[00:42:18.540 --> 00:42:22.900]   nothing to offer but sin to God.
[00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:28.780]   Christ died for the ungodly.
[00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:32.100]   Very rarely will somebody die for a righteous person.
[00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:37.180]   So he begins to go into an analogy, "Though some for a good person might possibly dare
[00:42:37.180 --> 00:42:38.180]   to die."
[00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:43.540]   In other words, like, hey, most people won't die for somebody great, though every once
[00:42:43.540 --> 00:42:48.100]   in a while somebody dives on a grenade for a brother in the army, or somebody does something
[00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:52.620]   valiant and heroic.
[00:42:52.620 --> 00:42:56.180]   But God shows his love in this.
[00:42:56.180 --> 00:43:02.740]   While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.
[00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:06.620]   The message of the Bible, the message of Zacchaeus is that all of us are like Zacchaeus.
[00:43:06.620 --> 00:43:07.620]   You are like Zacchaeus.
[00:43:07.620 --> 00:43:10.620]   You bring nothing to the table, and while you were powerless, the God of the universe
[00:43:10.620 --> 00:43:12.460]   said, "You know what time it is?
[00:43:12.460 --> 00:43:15.580]   It's the right time.
[00:43:15.580 --> 00:43:19.820]   When they can do nothing, they don't care about me, they're an enemy of God."
[00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:23.940]   God comes out and he says, "You know what I'm gonna do for my enemies?
[00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:26.260]   Die for them."
[00:43:26.260 --> 00:43:29.540]   There is no love like this that anyone has ever heard of, ever expressed.
[00:43:29.540 --> 00:43:31.140]   There's no other religion in all of the world.
[00:43:31.140 --> 00:43:32.140]   Let me land it right here.
[00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:35.700]   There's no other belief system that includes anything like the love that Paul just described
[00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:36.700]   here.
[00:43:36.700 --> 00:43:39.660]   The love that the page of the Bible expresses, and the love that Jesus demonstrated perfectly
[00:43:39.660 --> 00:43:40.660]   on the cross.
[00:43:40.660 --> 00:43:44.700]   There is no expression of Allah is love and he will die for his enemies.
[00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:48.980]   There's no other belief system in the world that says God is a God who goes out and dies
[00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:49.980]   for his enemies.
[00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:52.220]   Who says, "Hey, let's come to the battle line.
[00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:53.220]   Here's what we're gonna do.
[00:43:53.220 --> 00:43:54.500]   There's a war taking place.
[00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:55.500]   Here's the truth.
[00:43:55.500 --> 00:43:56.500]   I will die for all of you."
[00:43:56.500 --> 00:44:01.100]   There's no love the world has ever seen like that.
[00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:06.220]   And that the Bible says, and could it be true that the God who's there is a God who says,
[00:44:06.220 --> 00:44:09.300]   "You know what I do for those who can do nothing for me?
[00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:15.740]   I'm so in love with them that I will lay down my life for my enemies, let alone my friends
[00:44:15.740 --> 00:44:17.020]   or let alone some good people.
[00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:23.100]   For those who reject, who will always reject me, I still die for them."
[00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:26.420]   The God who's there has died for sinners like you, sinners like Zacchaeus, and sinners like
[00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:28.460]   me.
[00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:32.380]   Before anything was done, before you could do anything for him.
[00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:37.380]   Now my biggest fear is there are a lot of you in the room, candidly, you think you bring
[00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:41.380]   something and you have something to offer God.
[00:44:41.380 --> 00:44:44.540]   You're gonna do like, "Hey, you guys take that much luggage and I'm gonna carry on a
[00:44:44.540 --> 00:44:48.100]   little bit and I'm gonna do my part 'cause it makes me feel better and I feel like that'll
[00:44:48.100 --> 00:44:49.220]   keep me in relationship."
[00:44:49.220 --> 00:44:51.980]   And you have bought a lie.
[00:44:51.980 --> 00:44:55.460]   The message of the gospel is before you do anything right, before you could do anything
[00:44:55.460 --> 00:45:03.420]   right in order to have a relationship and be right with God, it takes you saying, "Man,
[00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:07.540]   I'm too broken and undeserving.
[00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:11.500]   I've fallen short of God's standard and I'm receiving.
[00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:14.180]   I'm not seeking to achieve anymore.
[00:45:14.180 --> 00:45:16.500]   I'm receiving what God did on my behalf."
[00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:18.780]   Jesus didn't come to give you what you deserve.
[00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:22.300]   He came to give you what he deserves.
[00:45:22.300 --> 00:45:26.620]   The message of Zacchaeus, the message of the New Testament, the message of the gospel and
[00:45:26.620 --> 00:45:33.180]   the God who's there is that you can have what he deserves, what Christ alone deserves.
[00:45:33.180 --> 00:45:37.540]   If you will just accept it by faith, "You paid for my sin.
[00:45:37.540 --> 00:45:38.700]   You died on the cross.
[00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:39.700]   You rose from the dead.
[00:45:39.700 --> 00:45:41.340]   You showed the check cleared.
[00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:42.900]   It was more than enough.
[00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:46.900]   And I'm not gonna believe and put my faith in what I do, how good I am, what I haven't
[00:45:46.900 --> 00:45:48.820]   done or what I did do.
[00:45:48.820 --> 00:45:51.900]   I'm not gonna let what I have done keep me out.
[00:45:51.900 --> 00:45:54.460]   I'm trusting in Jesus."
[00:45:54.460 --> 00:45:59.980]   And when you do, you, like Zacchaeus, become a child of Abraham, a child of faith, the
[00:45:59.980 --> 00:46:10.500]   one Jesus came in, like those of us who believe, to seek and to save.
[00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:16.900]   Let me pray.
[00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:29.620]   Father, I pray for any man or woman in this room who's never put their faith in what you
[00:46:29.620 --> 00:46:31.200]   did on the cross.
[00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:33.380]   You paid for their sin.
[00:46:33.380 --> 00:46:34.380]   You died in their place.
[00:46:34.380 --> 00:46:39.140]   You offer eternal life and you offer abundant life now.
[00:46:39.140 --> 00:46:43.460]   Tonight would be the moment that they would step off the ledge of trusting in themselves
[00:46:43.460 --> 00:46:49.580]   and step into a relationship with the God who's been reaching out in their direction
[00:46:49.580 --> 00:46:51.700]   all of their life.
[00:46:51.700 --> 00:46:55.380]   They wouldn't allow what they've done, their sins, how embarrassed they are, the shame,
[00:46:55.380 --> 00:46:59.280]   the guilt, all of those things that they feel like make them unworthy of having a relationship
[00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:05.180]   with God do anything other than drive them to you, the God who said, "I paid for all
[00:47:05.180 --> 00:47:08.380]   of it while they were still powerless, while they were still weak.
[00:47:08.380 --> 00:47:10.460]   I demonstrate my love.
[00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:14.900]   And yet while they were sinners, I died because I love them."
[00:47:14.900 --> 00:47:22.300]   Tonight would men and women receive that free gift?
[00:47:22.300 --> 00:47:25.140]   Would you help the parts in our hearts that still feel like we need to clean ourselves
[00:47:25.140 --> 00:47:32.420]   up and run from you in shame to be overtaken by the truths that we see in the New Testament?
[00:47:32.420 --> 00:47:38.060]   You are God who runs towards us and calls us to walk with you and experience life and
[00:47:38.060 --> 00:47:39.060]   freedom.
[00:47:39.060 --> 00:47:41.620]   May that message penetrate deeper into our hearts.
[00:47:41.620 --> 00:47:43.180]   Start with me, God.
[00:47:43.180 --> 00:47:45.180]   We worship you in song.
[00:47:45.180 --> 00:47:45.680]   Amen.
[00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:55.680]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
