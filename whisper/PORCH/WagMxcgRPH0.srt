00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 [Music]

2
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 >> Ports, how we doing? Let's go.

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 Put your hands together. It's Tuesday night.

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 It's so good to be back with you.

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 Thanks so much for trusting us with your Tuesday, genuinely.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 I don't know where you're coming from, but we love that you would be here with us.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 And we want to make the most of this time together.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 I think God has something for us.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 I believe that every week, but as we've stepped into this week,

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 as I started to prep what we're talking about tonight,

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 I think God very specifically wants to engage you.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 And I think he wants to engage not only the people in this room,

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 but I think he wants to engage some friends that are joining with us around the nation.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 Porch Live Tulsa, Porch Live Midland, special shout out to you guys,

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 as well as to all of our Porch Live locations.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 Can we give it up for them, please? Yes.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 Hey, love that y'all tracked with us. Thanks so much for being here.

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 Well, it wasn't long after college and my first job that I found myself itching for the next thing.

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 Anybody been in that place where you're on the hills of your first job

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 and you're thinking about what's next?

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 Like, I don't know about you, but for me, some of you are shaking your heads like,

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 "Yeah, that's me right now. I want that right now."

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 For me at that time, I was itching.

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 Like I was so eager to get out there and prove to myself just how much I had to offer.

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 Like I wanted to show people like, "Hey, I actually do have what it takes to make a difference in the world."

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 I wanted to do something fulfilling, something that actually made an impact.

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 And so what I did is I found myself moving towards an evaluation of what was next.

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 And as I did, like all of these thoughts of what God might do started to fill my mind.

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 And it started to sound like the voice of those posters in your grade school classrooms,

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 where it's like, "Hey, the world is your oyster," or "You can do whatever you want.

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 You can be whoever you want to be when you grow up."

32
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 And so I started to believe like, "Yeah, man, like that is true.

33
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 Like I can be whatever I want."

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 And so I started to consider, "God, what would you have me do next?"

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 Like I didn't just want to carve out a nice little life for myself.

36
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 Like I had these great aspirations of like global domination, you know.

37
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 Like I wanted to do something epic.

38
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 I wanted to make the most of the years that I had.

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 And so I started thinking, "Man, it doesn't matter what ladder I climb.

40
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 I just need to find a ladder and climb up that ladder as quickly as possible."

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 And yet here was the issue. I had so many ladders at my disposal.

42
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 Like God had in his kindness, he had given me a variety of different things for me to look at.

43
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 Because at this point in my life, it was all at once.

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 It felt like, "Man, there's so many different opportunities."

45
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 I found myself staring down the barrel of helping my church start a college residency.

46
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 I found myself looking at the opportunity to step into a tech startup, a new job in the marketplace.

47
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 I was dating a girl that was way outside of my league.

48
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 I was a part of a sermon prep team with a pastor that had decided to mentor me.

49
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 I was a part of a ministry that was making a difference in our city.

50
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 And they were all asking me to take another step with them.

51
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 It's everything I wanted.

52
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 And yet it was so overwhelming.

53
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 Like I found myself taken aback by the fact that everything I wanted, like all of this opportunity,

54
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 it was here at my feet. Like it was finally available to me.

55
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 Like I thought the sky was the limit.

56
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 And yet in the midst of all of this, it felt like the sky was falling down all around me.

57
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 Like I had these hopes of like global domination.

58
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 And now it felt like the world was coming after me.

59
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 Anybody resonate with this?

60
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 Like this is a feeling that we find ourselves whenever we see, "Man, there's a lot I want to do."

61
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 And yet I don't know what to say yes and what to say no to.

62
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 So I'll just sensibly say yes to all of it.

63
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 And it starts to sweat you out, you know.

64
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 It starts to get hot because it starts to feel really heavy.

65
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 I don't know if that sounds like your experience.

66
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 And yet what I do know is that according to most research, this is characteristic of our generation.

67
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 That we find ourselves struggling with something we like to call workaholism.

68
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 That got a reaction.

69
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 In 2016, a survey was conducted by Project Time Off.

70
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 Widely regarded as one of the leading analyses in the last decade on the topic of workaholism.

71
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 They surveyed 5,000 young professionals.

72
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 And they found that out of those 5,000 young professionals, people just like you, 43% of them.

73
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 So that would be just less than half of this room.

74
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 Identified as work martyrs.

75
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 That they were sacrificing their well-being on the altar of whatever job they were a part of.

76
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 They identified with these statements.

77
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 No one else in my company can do my job while I'm away.

78
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 I want to show complete dedication to my company and my work.

79
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 I don't want others to think I'm replaceable.

80
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 I feel guilty for using my paid time off.

81
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 43% of people just like you said these statements.

82
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 They agree that this was their reality.

83
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 And if you want a study that's more recent than 2016, in 2020, Forbes found that 66% of young adults suffer from workaholism.

84
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 66%.

85
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 Like the number just increased in the last four years from between one study to the next.

86
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 Forbes identified this as work addiction.

87
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 Which is interesting.

88
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 The fact that they would identify it as that.

89
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 Because that's a pretty strange phenomenon.

90
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 Right?

91
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 That we would say it's work addiction.

92
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 Because considering all other addictions in the world, we don't brag about them.

93
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 Like nobody's walking around and bragging about their drinking problem.

94
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 Nobody's walking around and bragging about what they watched in the secrecy of their home on their computer.

95
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 And yet we do like to walk around and brag about the fact that, yeah, man, I did just pull a 50, 60 hour week last week.

96
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 There's something glamorous.

97
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 There's something sexy about work addiction.

98
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 And yet we know that the effect is pretty consequential.

99
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 But this is who we are.

100
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 In that same study, 70% of people were available and actively working on the weekends.

101
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 70%!

102
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 On the weekends!

103
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 I don't know what you do on your weekends, but I don't like to work.

104
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 I like to take off.

105
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 You know?

106
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 I like to have good boundaries.

107
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 63% claimed to work while sick.

108
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 Which is ironic.

109
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 Because that's what you have sick leave for.

110
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 It's to leave the work behind because you're sick.

111
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 And 32% admitted to working even while on the toilet.

112
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 I don't know what you call that.

113
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 I call that a problem.

114
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 Like put in short, y'all, we're workaholics.

115
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 Like the line between our personal lives and our professional lives has grown dangerously thin.

116
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 To the point that the world is looking at our generation and saying, you're the burnout generation.

117
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 And phrases such as hustle culture, quarter life crisis.

118
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 Yeah, some of you are resonating with these.

119
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 Hustle culture, quarter life crisis, vacation shaming and career fatigue.

120
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 They're more common than ever before.

121
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 Now, some of you, you may hear this.

122
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 And you may hear my story and you may be like, man, Kylan, I hear you.

123
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 I'm not addicted to my job.

124
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 Like I'm not sacrificing myself on the altar of my performance at work.

125
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 I don't care actually what my boss really thinks of me.

126
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 You know?

127
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 I'm freed of that kind of pressure.

128
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 And I would say, even though that is probably true for some of us in the room, the issue is not that we're addicted to our work.

129
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 The issue is that we're addicted to busyness.

130
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 We're addicted to busyness.

131
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 Like we love to fill up our calendars and build out our checklists and line up for ourselves a list of achievements to seek after over the course of a day.

132
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 That's the biggest characteristic of our generation.

133
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 You see, if you look, we're more statistically hurried, anxious, stressed today than we've ever been in human history.

134
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 And it's for a variety of reasons.

135
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 It's not just because I want to succeed at my job.

136
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 It's not simply for that.

137
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 It's because you want to make an impact in the world.

138
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 It's because you want to belong to that group of people.

139
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 It's because you want to have a positive reputation.

140
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 You want to leave a legacy behind you.

141
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 There's a variety of reasons why we hurry ourselves.

142
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 And yet the reality is we do in fact hurry ourselves.

143
00:08:45,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 And in the process of doing that, busying our lives, we find ourselves stressed, anxious, regretful, confused, and empty.

144
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 Why do I bring all of that up to you?

145
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 Because in the sea of everything you feel you need to do, Jesus wants to look at us tonight and say, "Hey, there's one thing you need to do.

146
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 One thing you need to do that is most important of all."

147
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 "Well, what is it?" He tells us in Luke chapter 10.

148
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 So if you have a Bible, grab it. Luke chapter 10.

149
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 This is what we see.

150
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 As we turn to Luke 10, we're going to see that Jesus is interacting with some really good friends of his.

151
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 And for many of us in here, if you grew up in the church, you may be familiar with this story.

152
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 If not, you'll be able to catch up pretty quickly because the story reads fast.

153
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 And yet it is so steeped in depth and detail.

154
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 And so here's what I want to do with you.

155
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 I just want to walk through the story little by little.

156
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 Does that sound okay?

157
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 We'll just take it piece by piece.

158
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 As we go along, I think we'll see the one thing that we need to prioritize above anything and everything else in life.

159
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 This is Luke 10.

160
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 We're going to pick it up in verse 38.

161
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 "Now as they went on their way, Jesus entered a village, and a woman named Martha welcomed him into her house.

162
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 And she had a sister called Mary, who sat at the Lord's feet and listened to his teaching.

163
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 But Martha was distracted with much serving.

164
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 And she went up to him and said, 'Lord, do you not care that my sister has left me to serve alone?

165
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 Tell her then to help me.'

166
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 But the Lord answered her, 'Martha, Martha, you're anxious and troubled about many things, but one thing is necessary.

167
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 There's one thing you need to do most of all.

168
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 Mary has chosen the good portion, which will not be taken from her.'"

169
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 We can't see it from this passage alone, but by the time we catch up to Jesus in this story,

170
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 what you need to know is he's built somewhat of a reputation for himself.

171
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 Like he's gone about the Galilean countryside, and he has performed miracles,

172
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 and he has taught to massive crowds far larger than this.

173
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 And as he's done so, he has demonstrated a kind of authority that has left people in utter amazement.

174
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 And so he shows up, and he's kind of the guy in this moment.

175
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 Like he has a reputation, he's renowned, and Martha knows all of this is the case.

176
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 She understands quite well his status.

177
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 And so she does what he would do.

178
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 Like she rolls out the red carpet and invites him into her home.

179
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 Like what we see is that she welcomes him.

180
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 The word for welcomed here is the technical term for hospitality in the Greek.

181
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 It literally means, if you go and you read it, if you read it in the original language,

182
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 it means to be received under.

183
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 So Brooke, my wife, she's really amazing at hospitality.

184
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 Like she thrives at what Martha is doing here in inviting Jesus into her home

185
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 in the sense that she loves to kick open our doors and not just invite people over to our house,

186
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 but welcome them into our home.

187
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 Are you tracking what the difference is there?

188
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 I'll explain it for you.

189
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 It ends up being a laundry list of to-dos for Kylan,

190
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 because there's a lot we have to do to get ready if people are coming over to our house.

191
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 Like it's not enough to just say, "Hey, we'll cook you dinner. Come on by.

192
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 We'll have some good conversation."

193
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 That's not enough.

194
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 In fact, what I have to do is I have to mow the yard, blow the patio,

195
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 clean the bathrooms, vacuum the house, and clean the gutters.

196
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 No one's looking in the gutters!

197
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 They're not getting up there.

198
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 Why? Why the to-do list?

199
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 Because she wants to receive people under her care.

200
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 She's hospitable.

201
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 She wants to outdo them with honor.

202
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 That's what Martha is doing right here.

203
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 Martha is outdoing Jesus in honor.

204
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 She's welcoming him into her home,

205
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 which tells us something really important about Martha.

206
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 She's made it.

207
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 Like Martha is thriving because she owns her own house.

208
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 Like not only is she a woman in the ancient Near East,

209
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 but she owns a home in the ancient Near East.

210
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 So she's independent.

211
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 Like she's thriving.

212
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 Like she's bought her first house.

213
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 She's having people over.

214
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 She's pulling out the charcuterie board,

215
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 and she's making sure that everybody's needs are taken care of.

216
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 "Hey, what do you want to drink? Do you need a refill?

217
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 Don't worry. I got it for you."

218
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 Like she is on top of it.

219
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 She's the epitome of what we would want to be true of ourself.

220
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 Like she is self-sufficient.

221
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 She's confident in her abilities.

222
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 She's put together, and she's eager to help people.

223
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 And it says in verse 40 that she was serving,

224
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 which seems really right.

225
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 Like she's keeping busy hosting Jesus,

226
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 serving him as best she can.

227
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 She is doing everything for him.

228
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 But here's the issue.

229
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 She's not doing anything with him.

230
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 She's doing everything for Jesus,

231
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 but she's not doing anything with him.

232
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 Why? Why is that the case?

233
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 Because she's distracted.

234
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 That's what it says in verse 40.

235
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 She's distracted.

236
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 And the greater the distraction, the greater the danger.

237
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 The greater the distraction, the greater the danger.

238
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 What do I mean by danger?

239
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 Well, if you just look at the descriptors that come around Martha,

240
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 you see she's in danger.

241
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 Because we see in verse 40 that she's lonely.

242
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 Lord, do you not care that my sister has left me to serve alone?

243
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 But she's not only lonely, it escalates.

244
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 In verse 41, anxiety pops up.

245
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 Martha, Martha, you're anxious.

246
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 But it doesn't just stay there.

247
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 It goes even further.

248
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 It says in verse 41 that she's troubled about many things.

249
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 The Greek for that word troubled,

250
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 it doesn't just mean like, ah, she's slightly bothered.

251
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 It means she's like panicked.

252
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 She's disturbed.

253
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 Now, I want to be really clear what this is not saying.

254
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 This scripture is not saying that it's bad to be busy.

255
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 It's not saying that it's wrong to work.

256
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 Like this is not an endorsement for you to come in from a long day

257
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 and sit down on the couch and let the television just bathe over you.

258
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 You know, like that's not what's being described here.

259
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 This is not articulating a path of least resistance mentality.

260
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 Path of least resistance is never the path of greatest faith.

261
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 So what then is this saying?

262
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 Like the Bible, it's littered with so much scripture that endorses the idea of work.

263
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 Like if you go and you read through the Proverbs,

264
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 what you see in the wisdom literature is that slothfulness is decried over a dozen times.

265
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 It's good to work.

266
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 God designed it.

267
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 But it's not good to be distracted with work.

268
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 It's not good to be obsessed with work.

269
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 Like that's what we need to see because according to scientific research,

270
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 work addiction leads to a rise in divorce, anxiety, insomnia, obesity, and depression.

271
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 Winston Churchill, he was notorious for his work ethic.

272
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 Like notorious for it.

273
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 The guy, he averaged 16-hour work days, seven days a week.

274
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 And he didn't just work really hard.

275
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 He wrote 43 books.

276
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 The idea of writing a book is intimidating to me on its own.

277
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 One, he wrote 43 of them in 72 volumes.

278
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 Yeah, exactly.

279
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 The guy was a workaholic.

280
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 Like he applied himself diligently.

281
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 And yet, if you go and you read the record of his life,

282
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 biographers, they cannot recount his story without detailing in depth the severity of his depression.

283
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 That black dog, as he called it, that haunted him all the days of his life.

284
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 You see, there's a danger in distracting ourselves with work.

285
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 And the really sinister thing is this.

286
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 You can have the best of intentions and you can still be wrong.

287
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 You can have the best of intentions and yet you can still be wrong.

288
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 Like that's what happens to Martha right here.

289
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 Everything she's doing, it appears really good, but it's actually really wrong.

290
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 How so?

291
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 Because she's missing the one thing that's necessary.

292
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 She's missing Jesus.

293
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 And friends, just here at the top of the evening, like this is the case for some of you tonight.

294
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 Like you're not busy with bad.

295
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 Like you're not a heathen.

296
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 You're not out there burning something down.

297
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 Like the cops aren't looking for you right now.

298
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 If they are, just raise a hand and we'll escort you out and help you to find them quite quickly.

299
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 No, like you're not busy doing bad.

300
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 You're busy doing good.

301
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 Like you do want to make a difference in the world.

302
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 Like you want to do something fulfilling that makes an impact in the lives of other people.

303
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 Like you're committed to volunteering on the weekends and you're mentoring that group of guys or girls.

304
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 Or you're serving in your church or you're making sure that you're leading that Bible study faithfully.

305
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 You're showing up to community group and you're not just showing up, you're actually confessing sin.

306
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 You're engaged. You're doing good.

307
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 Like you're volunteering in some organization that you care about.

308
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 You're busy doing good.

309
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 And yet, what we know is that despite all the good you do for God,

310
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 all of it is in vain if you've done none of it with Him.

311
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 You can do all the good in the world and yet if you do none of that good with God,

312
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 all of it's vanity, all of it's useless, all of it's pointless.

313
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 And friend, like what you need to know is that the busier you become, the blurrier God gets.

314
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 Like the more distracted you get with all manner of other things to worry about,

315
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 the harder it is to actually see Him.

316
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 That's why distraction is dangerous.

317
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 It can not only affect your physical well-being, it affects your spiritual well-being.

318
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 So if that's you, listen to me.

319
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 That does not have to be the case.

320
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 And as we walk through the rest of this story, we're going to see how we can get dislodged from that being our reality.

321
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 But Isaiah 26, 3, it helps us where we should start.

322
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 It says, "You keep Him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on you because He trusts in you."

323
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 You keep Him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on you because He trusts in you.

324
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 Like what do you turn to to keep you in perfect peace?

325
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 What do you go to?

326
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 Is it doing?

327
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 Is it busyness?

328
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 Is it something else?

329
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 Is it a creature comfort?

330
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 A hidden habitual pattern?

331
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 What do you do to bring peace to yourself?

332
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 What this scripture is saying, what Isaiah wants us to know is, man,

333
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 God keeps Him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on Him.

334
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 The way to find perfect peace is to focus your mind's eye on God.

335
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 The way to find peace is to trust in Him.

336
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 Why should I trust in Him?

337
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 Because He's God.

338
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 And He controls everything.

339
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 He is sovereign over all.

340
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 Nothing in this world comes to pass without His allowance.

341
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 Like He is greater.

342
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 He is grander.

343
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 He is in control of everything.

344
00:20:53,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 And so whatever it is that's disrupting your peace, I bet He can handle it.

345
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 God is trustworthy.

346
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 So we need to fix our mind on Him.

347
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 Like it is actually possible to work really hard and have peace in life.

348
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 But only after you understand that your posture towards God reflects your

349
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 priority for God.

350
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 Your posture toward God reflects your priority for God.

351
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 Like that's what we find as we look back into this story.

352
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 Like as you look at the setting, what you realize is Martha's house is

353
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 really full.

354
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 It's packed in there.

355
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 Which may surprise you.

356
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 When I read this at first, it didn't feel like it was a full house.

357
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 It felt like it was Jesus and Mary and Martha.

358
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 And yet contextually if you read it, He's shown up with His whole group of disciples.

359
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 They've all rolled in.

360
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 And so His entire posse, they come into her house.

361
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 And the house is packed.

362
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 And yet that escapes us because Luke, he wants us to know.

363
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 There are three people you should focus on.

364
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 And the rest should fade away.

365
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 You should focus on Jesus, Mary, and Martha.

366
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 And the reason you should is because Mary and Martha, they serve as

367
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 contrasting points.

368
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 Like you should look at them in comparison to one another.

369
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 Their postures are virtually opposite.

370
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 Like look at it.

371
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 They're described by two verbs each.

372
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 Martha's posture, she's serving.

373
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 She's speaking.

374
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 Mary's posture, she's sitting.

375
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 She's listening.

376
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 That's opposite.

377
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 Like they could not be more different.

378
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 So let me just put it to you like this.

379
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 Let me explain to you why posture matters when it comes to engaging with

380
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 God and receiving the benefits of meeting with Him.

381
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 Anybody in here like a quality time kind of person?

382
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 Okay.

383
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 Quality time people.

384
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 You tell me which one is more engaging.

385
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 Would you rather have -- is the quality of your time better off with

386
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 someone that is distracted and busy and focusing on all manner of other

387
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 things and multitasking really well?

388
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 Or is it better instead with somebody that's sitting and listening and

389
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 engaging with you?

390
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 What would you say?

391
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 Absolutely.

392
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 Sitting and listening and engaging with me.

393
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 Like multitasking is not the quickest way to actually maximize quality time

394
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 with somebody.

395
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 We should be like Mary.

396
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 Her posture is one that tells us.

397
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 She wants for me.

398
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 She is eager to know me.

399
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 And as a result, our quality of experience together.

400
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 It has so much more potential.

401
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 But Martha, Martha is busy with so many different things.

402
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 Like she's serving.

403
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 Mary is sitting.

404
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 Martha is speaking.

405
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 Mary is listening.

406
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 Martha is preoccupied with many things.

407
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 Mary is prioritized one thing.

408
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 Mary is not distracted like Martha.

409
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 She is devoted to Jesus.

410
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 Charles Spurgeon, he describes this scene like this.

411
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 Talking about Mary.

412
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 She is down there in the place of humility.

413
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 But she is where she can catch each word as it falls.

414
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 And she is there with one purpose.

415
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 She wishes to hear all that Christ has to say.

416
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 And she wishes to hear it close at hand.

417
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 She wants to hear the very tones with which he speaks and the accents with

418
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 which he delivers each precept.

419
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 She loves to look up and see those eyes which have such meaning in them.

420
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 And that blessed countenance which speaks as much as the lips themselves.

421
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 You see, Martha is drowning in the stress of life.

422
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 And Mary is drinking in the words of life.

423
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 And it's because of her posture.

424
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 It's because she's sitting.

425
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 She's listening.

426
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 Like when we see that written, that's in the active voice in perfect tense.

427
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 Which means that she's not only doing it intentionally, she's doing it continually.

428
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 Like she's not just here for this moment, but she's here for every moment she can sit and she can listen.

429
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 And she's not just doing it passively, she's doing it actively.

430
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 She wants to hear every word that Jesus has to say.

431
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 She's doing something really scandalous.

432
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 Which escapes us because we don't read this in the original language.

433
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 And we're not familiar with this context.

434
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 And yet she is doing something that would be characteristically true.

435
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 And only true of disciples.

436
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 She's a Talmud.

437
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 She's sitting at the feet of her teacher, her rabbi.

438
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 And she's committed all of her faculties to observing and listening to him.

439
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 That way she might become like him.

440
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 Why is this so scandalous?

441
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 Because that spot was reserved for men and men only.

442
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 Like she's doing something so inappropriate.

443
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 So what would compel her to do that?

444
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 Because she knows when Jesus is in the room, I've got to get close to him.

445
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 When the word is in the room, I need to hear every word he has to say.

446
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 And what's fascinating is she knows the inappropriateness of it.

447
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 And yet she does not care what people think.

448
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 Like she's willing to embrace the indignity.

449
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 Endure the embarrassment for the simple sake of being close to him.

450
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 In contrast to her, what's Martha doing?

451
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 Martha's doing what is actually appropriate.

452
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 Like she is in a position of domestic service.

453
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 Which was right in the ancient Near East.

454
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 Like she's up and she's working and she's hosting and she's serving.

455
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 Doing everything in her power to take care of her guests.

456
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 She's doing what everyone in that house except for Jesus would consider is right and good.

457
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 She's totally appropriate in her conduct.

458
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 And yet Jesus looks at her and he says, Martha, one thing is necessary.

459
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 And it's what your sister is doing.

460
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 She's chosen a good portion.

461
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 And I'm not going to take it from her.

462
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 What portion are we choosing?

463
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 What portion are you choosing in your life?

464
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 Like where do you think you'll find all the satisfaction and joy and gratification available?

465
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 Is it through doing what the world would say is appropriate?

466
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 Like hey, yeah, you should get up early.

467
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 You should stay late.

468
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 You should grind all day and as hard as possible.

469
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 You should.

470
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 You should give up some of your free time on the weekend so that way you can serve in these other capacities.

471
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 You do need to actually conform yourself so that way you can belong and blend into this group of people.

472
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 You should compromise some of your decision making, some of your morals, some of your integrity.

473
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 That way you can find acceptance.

474
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 Are you doing what's appropriate in the eyes of the world?

475
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 Or are you willing to endure what's inappropriate in the world's eye for the sake of being found right before Jesus and enjoying the good portion?

476
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 What is it for you?

477
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 Like when you look at your life, are you distracted with doing good?

478
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 Or are you devoted to being with him?

479
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 Do you feel what Mary feels?

480
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 That when he's in the room, I drop everything.

481
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 Sure, I should be doing all this other stuff, but I will drop it because I want to sit with him.

482
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 I want to listen to him.

483
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 I want to know everything he has to say.

484
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 What's it for you?

485
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 What we see here in the final scene is that when you've devoted your life to something,

486
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 you can actually devote yourself to the one thing that's really good.

487
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 And what it does is it convinces us that the goal is not completion.

488
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 The goal is connection.

489
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 Like that's the goal of the Christian life.

490
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 The goal of the Christian life is not completion.

491
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 It's connection.

492
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 And the way we know this is because if you look at the story and the detail of it,

493
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 Mary, she's not just sitting with Jesus.

494
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 Like she's sitting with him, which means she wants to know him.

495
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 She wants to hear what he has to say.

496
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 She wants to learn from him.

497
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 But she's also sitting near to Jesus.

498
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 She wants to be connected to him.

499
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 She wants to be close to him.

500
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 That's what the Greek word for sat, perikathizo, in this text means.

501
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 Para means beside and kathizo means to sit.

502
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 Like Mary is sitting right beside him.

503
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 Like she can't get close enough.

504
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 She is as nuzzled up underneath his feet so she can hear every word as possible.

505
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 She's like my golden retriever growing up.

506
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 Like if I went to pet him and I decided to step away,

507
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 he would just inch his way over and find his head underneath my hand.

508
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 Why?

509
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 Because his whole life revolved around me.

510
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 He loved me.

511
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 He couldn't get close enough to me.

512
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 He wanted as much of me as he could get.

513
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 God, I miss that dog.

514
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 That's how Mary is behaving.

515
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 Mary can't get close enough.

516
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 She wants as much of Jesus as she can get.

517
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 She will sit as near to him as possible and forego all things that would distance her

518
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 for the sake of being close to her king.

519
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 You see, she is -- Jesus is the object of her affection.

520
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 And because he is the object of her affection, her goal now becomes connection.

521
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 You know, as I was prepping this talk, I knew, I was like, okay,

522
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 I actually feel like I'm preaching the same talk for the third week in a row in this series.

523
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 And yet that's kind of the point, Porch.

524
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 There's one thing that is most essential in all the world.

525
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 And it's to get as close to God as we can.

526
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 It's to know him.

527
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 And it's to be near to him.

528
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 You see, this is a pervasive issue today.

529
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 We have found ourselves satisfied with an intellectual acquaintance to God.

530
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 As long as I'm intellectually acquainted, I'm good, man.

531
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 As long as I know the details, I'm fine.

532
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 And yet what the Bible is absolutely putting in front of us is saying, hey,

533
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 it's not enough to just be intellectually acquainted.

534
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 You must be intimately acquainted with God.

535
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 You must be intimately acquainted with him.

536
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 This is the whole story of the scripture.

537
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 Like God from the very beginning of the Bible, he has moved his way towards us

538
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 after we distanced ourselves from him.

539
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 Like he has done everything in his power to move in to your neighborhood,

540
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 into your life, because he wants you to be connected to him.

541
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 He's not concerned with you completing all the to-dos.

542
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 He's not concerned with you checking off all of the did-goods.

543
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 Like he wants you instead to be connected to him, to be close to him,

544
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 to be like Mary.

545
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 And yet here's the thing.

546
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 It's so wildly clear from the scripture that the goal is completion.

547
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 But so many of us are like Martha, and we just want to know the to-dos.

548
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 Okay, I get it, man.

549
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 Like I'm supposed to be close to him, but what am I supposed to do to get there?

550
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 What am I supposed to complete?

551
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 What's my checklist?

552
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 What are my marching orders?

553
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 What are the instructions?

554
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 Give me the recipe.

555
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 Like that's what we want.

556
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 Like we just want to know what we're supposed to do.

557
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 And if you're wrestling with that thought tonight, you're missing the point.

558
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 The point is not to just do good to earn the smile of God.

559
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
 That's what Martha does.

560
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:25,000
 No, the point is to recognize you're beautiful.

561
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 You're so good.

562
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 And as I see you, God, in the person of Jesus, it compels me to move into you,

563
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:42,000
 to move close to you, to come nearby.

564
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:47,000
 And yet some of us, we're wrestling tonight because what we resonate with is more the story of Martha

565
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 than the story of Mary.

566
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 Like we hear what Martha says right here.

567
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 We hear her say, "Lord, do you not care that my sister has left me to serve alone?"

568
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 And we register with that.

569
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 We resonate with that.

570
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 "Lord, do you not care?"

571
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 God, don't you care?

572
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 Like look at all that I've done.

573
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 Look at everything that I've done, all the good that I've amassed.

574
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 Like God, I've read my Bible.

575
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 I've prayed three times today.

576
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 I've attended church faithfully for the last month.

577
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 I show up to my community group.

578
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
 Or maybe you're not a believer, but you're in the room.

579
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
 You're like, "God, I volunteer on the weekends.

580
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
 I give my hard-earned money to charity.

581
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
 I care about humanitarian causes."

582
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 I don't know what it is for you, and yet so many of us feel like, "I'm trying, God.

583
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 I'm doing the most.

584
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 I'm giving everything I have."

585
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 And yet, God, despite the fact that I've done so much good, I still feel like you don't care.

586
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 You don't care about me.

587
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:48,000
 Like if you did, God, like I wouldn't be living in this kind of situation.

588
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 I wouldn't be wrestling with this kind of difficulty.

589
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 I wouldn't be facing this kind of hardship, God.

590
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 My parents, they would not have split up.

591
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 I would not have lost my job, God.

592
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 I wouldn't have found that my friends bailed on me because of a conviction I stuck to.

593
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,000
 God, my reputation wouldn't be up in flames because I decided to not compromise,

594
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 but hold fast to you and to your word, God.

595
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,000
 Why? I'm doing good, and yet, God, everything is falling down around me.

596
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 Like, God, I feel cold.

597
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 My faith is faint.

598
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 God, I feel indifferent.

599
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 I'm apathetic.

600
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 Don't you care about me?

601
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 I've done good to you if that's you here tonight.

602
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 He says to you the same thing that he says to Martha.

603
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,000
 He says, "Martha, Martha."

604
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 Like that's not a response that's laced with impatience.

605
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 He's not frustrated with her.

606
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:54,000
 He's not asking her to get over herself, get back on board.

607
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,000
 He's looking at her and he's saying, "Hey, I see you.

608
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:06,000
 I love you, but the difference between you and your sister is she sees me rightly."

609
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:11,000
 What do I mean by that?

610
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:16,000
 Martha's asking a question that Mary already knows the answer to.

611
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 Do you not care?

612
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
 Mary knows he does.

613
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 That's why she's sitting at his feet.

614
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
 Because she knows this is no normal teacher.

615
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
 This is not some ordinary rabbi.

616
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
 Like this isn't just a good miracle-making man.

617
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
 Like that's not who this guy is.

618
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 This guy is the Messiah.

619
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
 He's the son of God.

620
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
 Like he's the Savior sent to seek the lost.

621
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:45,000
 Like he's the one that's come, the hero of heaven, to purchase us out of our sin and take us back home with him again.

622
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
 That's why she's sitting at his feet.

623
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
 That's why she's trying to stay close.

624
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,000
 That's why she's hanging on every word.

625
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
 She knows this man cares about me.

626
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,000
 He wouldn't be sitting here otherwise.

627
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:11,000
 Friend, if you're here and you feel like the Lord doesn't care, Jesus Christ, he is the embodiment, the personification,

628
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:17,000
 the epitome of God's love and care and commitment to you.

629
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:24,000
 He came knowing full well you can do no amount of good to earn the smile of God.

630
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
 To merit heaven's favor.

631
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:31,000
 To unlock those pearly gates and walk in fully accepted.

632
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
 You can't do anything.

633
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,000
 There's no amount of good you can heap up.

634
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:46,000
 Because he loves you, he sent his only son, the one who could do all good,

635
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,000
 fulfill everything we could not apart from him.

636
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:59,000
 That we might be not only known by him, but near to him.

637
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:05,000
 Not just today, not just tomorrow, not just the day after, but for all eternity.

638
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
 This is the gospel.

639
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
 This is the one thing.

640
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
 To know him and to be near to him.

641
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
 Are you all tracking with me?

642
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
 Do you get that?

643
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
 That's good news.

644
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
 That's worthy of us putting our hands together.

645
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:28,000
 And he looks at us and he says, hey, in your frustration, in your striving, in your straining, stop.

646
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
 No more.

647
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
 Sit down.

648
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
 Be still.

649
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
 Don't hurry any longer.

650
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
 Stay a while.

651
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
 Trust me.

652
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
 I am making all things new.

653
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
 And that includes you.

654
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
 I will save you from your sin.

655
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:51,000
 And I will take you to where it is I'm going.

656
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
 If you would only believe in me.

657
00:38:53,000 --> 00:39:02,000
 The reason we know it is because we know like Jesus, he was never endangered by distraction.

658
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,000
 Like the greater the distraction, the greater the danger.

659
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
 Jesus was never once distracted.

660
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,000
 He was fully devoted to you and me.

661
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
 Because he walked through this world.

662
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:28,000
 He endured every kind and all manner of unfitting oppression.

663
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,000
 God of heaven becomes son of man.

664
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
 Heaven's glory is left.

665
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
 Human flesh put on.

666
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:42,000
 In the indignity of that, he endured.

667
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
 Because he was devoted to you and me.

668
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:52,000
 But like he didn't just -- he didn't just remain devoted.

669
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,000
 He understood the importance of posture.

670
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:03,000
 In the sense that he was submitted to God all his life long.

671
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:09,000
 He kept himself under heaven's gaze and within God's will.

672
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:16,000
 Not that we can depart from it, but that he would move forward through it willingly.

673
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:21,000
 And not only did he endure a posture of submission to God in life.

674
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:26,000
 He embraced a posture of submission to God in death.

675
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,000
 He hung himself on a Roman execution rack.

676
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
 Not guilty of anything.

677
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,000
 Having done no wrong whatsoever.

678
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
 And yet he put himself there.

679
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,000
 Because it's where you and I deserve to be instead.

680
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,000
 And in his death he absorbed all the consequence of our sin.

681
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
 Like you know that was your future, right?

682
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
 Apart from Jesus Christ.

683
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:55,000
 Your future is one of eternal separation and condemnation.

684
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:02,000
 Your future, my future, was everlasting and unfettered distance from God.

685
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
 And yet he gave it all to bring us home.

686
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,000
 To put us close.

687
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:13,000
 Because he grasped the necessity of nearness.

688
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,000
 He would do anything to be close by.

689
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:34,000
 He would do whatever it took to draw us in.

690
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:43,000
 My fear with this kind of talk is that some of us would hear it and we would think to ourselves,

691
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
 I know that already.

692
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
 I'm registering, I'm tracking.

693
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:54,000
 Thanks for telling me something I've already heard before.

694
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:00,000
 And yet if that is you, this should not fall deaf upon us.

695
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
 It should fall fresh.

696
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
 It should feel new.

697
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:09,000
 And it should feel just as good as the first time.

698
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:14,000
 If you were a believer in Jesus Christ, like this is what we have staked our eternity on.

699
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
 This is what it's all about.

700
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,000
 Your life is not about your job.

701
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
 It's not about your achievements.

702
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:25,000
 It's not about the differences you'll make in the watching world.

703
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
 It's not about those things.

704
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
 It's not about your reputation.

705
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:32,000
 It's not about your acceptance amongst your coworkers.

706
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,000
 It is about him.

707
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:41,000
 All things will rust, decay, and fade away.

708
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,000
 But he stands forever.

709
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:52,000
 And the people he's come to save, they can live forever with him too.

710
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:59,000
 What good are you trying to do if you know our king?

711
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:08,000
 The only right good is to know him, be near him, and bring others alongside.

712
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,000
 If you're here and you don't know Jesus, and you're hearing this talk,

713
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,000
 and it's like, man, I feel okay.

714
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
 I'm stressed out sometimes.

715
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
 I'm anxious at the office.

716
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
 But who isn't?

717
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
 You know?

718
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
 This is the life of a young adult.

719
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:27,000
 Like you unpacked all those stats for us at the beginning and it told all of us, man, like, yeah, this is hard.

720
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
 But I'm not unnerved by it.

721
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
 I don't see the need for this guy.

722
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:39,000
 Then, friend, this is so honest.

723
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,000
 But I tell it to you because I love you.

724
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:54,000
 The reason you need this is because apart from Jesus, you are under the wrath of God.

725
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,000
 You cannot do good enough on your own.

726
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:03,000
 You cannot measure up to heaven's standard.

727
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:08,000
 And distance is all you'll ever know.

728
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,000
 You need to know, though, that God so loves you that he came to bring you back.

729
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:18,000
 That he would absorb all the consequence of his -- the consequence of our sin.

730
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:23,000
 That we might receive the free gift of eternal life.

731
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:28,000
 Man, I want it for you.

732
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,000
 So what do we do from here?

733
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
 We're going to sing a little bit.

734
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:38,000
 And what we're going to have down front is we're going to have our sidewalk team.

735
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,000
 And they're going to be available to pray with you if you so wish.

736
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,000
 I pray that you would take them up on the offer.

737
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:51,000
 That you wouldn't just sit here tonight and you would contemplate the convictions you feel.

738
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
 But you would take action on them.

739
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:57,000
 You would move in response.

740
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:01,000
 Some of you, it's not conviction you need to respond to.

741
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,000
 Instead, it's simply abiding with Jesus.

742
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
 It's sitting where you are.

743
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
 And it's receiving his goodness.

744
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,000
 Stealing yourself and coming close again.

745
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:19,000
 Whatever it is, though, as we step back into worship, I pray we would respond according to what the spirit is leading in.

746
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,000
 If you're here, he has a plan for you.

747
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
 Let me pray for us.

748
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,000
 God, this is so simple a message.

749
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
 It's not hard.

750
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
 It's not profound.

751
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
 It's not complicated.

752
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
 It's not sophisticated.

753
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:39,000
 And yet, God, it is absolutely urgent.

754
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:47,000
 Every one of us, God, we are here not by heaven's chance but here because you have a purpose in us tonight, God.

755
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:51,000
 You have a reason for bringing us here this evening.

756
00:45:51,000 --> 00:46:04,000
 You have a word, God, for us in this scripture from this message.

757
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:14,000
 I pray, God, that we would have eyes to see before we have feet to follow.

758
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:20,000
 For, God, it is in seeing you that we see everything else rightly as a result.

759
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:26,000
 And as we see all else, God, in the light of your glory and goodness, then it compels we move.

760
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
 Then it compels we take action.

761
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
 Then it compels we take ground.

762
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:44,000
 But, God, let us not move before we first see you.

763
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
 God, have your way.

764
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
 Move amongst us.

765
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:58,000
 Touch us, God, in such a way that it transcends any ability I bring or we as a team, God, have to offer.

766
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,000
 Do it, God, for your glory and for the good you came to give.

767
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
 It's in Christ's name we pray.

768
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
 Amen.
