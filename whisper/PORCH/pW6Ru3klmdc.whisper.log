[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:19.320]   - All right, well, here we go.
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.340]   Welcome everyone that is tuning in from around the country.
[00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:23.520]   We are so excited.
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.660]   Like JD already said, we're kicking off a brand new series.
[00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.580]   I've got some friends that are hanging out with me
[00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.220]   that you'll probably see me interacting with
[00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.400]   as we dive in and kick off this series called Fact Check,
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.920]   which is a look at some of the tough questions
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.320]   facing Christianity and just answering
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.040]   some of the key objections people have
[00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.200]   as it relates to faith.
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.680]   How we doing guys?
[00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.440]   Everyone have a good Easter?
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.540]   Okay, so here, let me bring you guys
[00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.600]   and everyone listening into kind of Easter world
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.780]   for me as just a parent with young kids.
[00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.160]   This past weekend celebrated Easter, you know,
[00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.800]   quarantine style, and my four year old son
[00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.640]   was introduced for the very first time to the Easter bunny.
[00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.580]   Like we probably talked about it, but you know,
[00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:02.920]   the older they get, the more they're like,
[00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.360]   oh yeah, I can kind of remember that now.
[00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.440]   And the Easter bunny, you know,
[00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.120]   there's these different holiday mascots.
[00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.660]   Like you got Santa Claus, you got the leprechaun
[00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.400]   for St. Patrick's day, you got Cupid for Valentine's day.
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.120]   You got, I would put the tooth fairy kind of in that,
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.280]   even though it's not a holiday mascot, if you will.
[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.580]   But of all of them, probably the more interesting
[00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.500]   and humorous to me is the Easter bunny.
[00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.640]   And I was realizing this as I was talking
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.720]   with my four year old who just has questions like,
[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.720]   man, there's a bunny who brings us baskets of toys
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.760]   and he leaves them right where Santa Claus left them
[00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:42.780]   on the fireplace.
[00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:43.620]   How does he carry?
[00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.080]   'Cause he doesn't think bunny, like we all think
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.400]   like bugs bunny or a big bunny that's like a fake bunny.
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.760]   He thinks like an actual rabbit.
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.800]   And he's like bunnies, they can't really lift things
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:51.640]   and carry things.
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.240]   Like how does he carry all that to every kid out there?
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.620]   And like, how big is this bunny?
[00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.020]   That had to be a huge bunny.
[00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.540]   And I'm trying to figure out like,
[00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:00.900]   how would you, how do you answer that question?
[00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.640]   You're like, he's like, he's like your size of your mom
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.340]   because his mom's the Easter bunny.
[00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.600]   And that's about the size that he is.
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:09.860]   And he's asking questions
[00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.320]   that are really understandable questions.
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.500]   Like, why does he bring eggs?
[00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.640]   Like what do bunnies have to do with eggs?
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.980]   They don't lay eggs.
[00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.460]   And it's like, yeah, he brings eggs 'cause yeah,
[00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:23.900]   I don't really know why he brings eggs.
[00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.420]   Like you think about it, it's like a very,
[00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.400]   like so many of the traditions around this are just funny
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.860]   and they're really understandable questions
[00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.220]   that come for him.
[00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:32.300]   And at some point in life,
[00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.140]   if you ever had parents that encouraged you
[00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.740]   to believe in the Easter bunny,
[00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.220]   you get a little bit older and you begin to realize
[00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.120]   that those questions that you had about the bunny
[00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.860]   were really understandable.
[00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.540]   And it seems like you're confronted with the truth
[00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.060]   that, oh, there really isn't an Easter bunny.
[00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.820]   And I never got answers to those questions.
[00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.380]   And it was just some like wishful thinking
[00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.300]   that my parents wanted me to believe
[00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.300]   'cause that would be fun if life really actually
[00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.820]   had an Easter bunny involved in it.
[00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.300]   And the reason I start there is because I think
[00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:01.860]   for a lot of people, as it relates to God
[00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.420]   and Christianity and faith,
[00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.900]   interestingly enough, around the same time
[00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.900]   they're introduced to the Easter bunny,
[00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.660]   a lot of us were introduced to the idea of God.
[00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.380]   And just like the unanswered questions of like,
[00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:14.380]   why does he bring eggs?
[00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:15.340]   How big is he?
[00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.100]   And all these things chip away at my ability
[00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.260]   to believe in the Easter bunny.
[00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.760]   And eventually I'm like, I don't think this is true at all.
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.100]   A lot of our unanswered and understandable questions
[00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.060]   about God that never get great answers from people
[00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.400]   begin to chip away at our ability to believe in God.
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.340]   And just like we're like, I'm abandoning,
[00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.460]   I'm not even sure I can believe in the Easter bunny anymore.
[00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:40.240]   I just have too many questions that don't have good answers.
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.660]   That's the journey a lot of us experienced with God,
[00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.520]   where we find ourselves with really understandable questions
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.100]   that never get answered.
[00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.540]   And it just chips away over time at our ability
[00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.780]   to believe the God we were told about,
[00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.560]   and the Christian God is really true.
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.340]   And so my heart in doing this series and our heart as a team
[00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.420]   is that we would address some of those questions.
[00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:04.820]   'Cause there's a lot of understandable questions
[00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:06.780]   that people wrestle with as it relates to faith
[00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.020]   and as it relates to God,
[00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:10.640]   and as it relates to is Jesus really the only way?
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.180]   That means billions of people
[00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.500]   are not gonna spend eternity with him.
[00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.660]   God is love, and yet he sends people to hell.
[00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.340]   Like, how is that possible?
[00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.500]   The Bible is actually the words of God,
[00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.500]   but it was written by men.
[00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:28.100]   Can we really trust that it's inspired,
[00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.980]   that it hasn't been changed?
[00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:31.180]   And then the topic for tonight,
[00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.820]   which is the question of how can God be good
[00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.820]   in so much bad, brokenness, evil exists around us?
[00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.220]   So that's the question I really wanna launch in tonight
[00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.340]   and this whole series is just an attempt to give answers
[00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:45.860]   to some of those questions
[00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.180]   that many of us have had for a long time.
[00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.660]   Maybe we don't wrestle with it in terms of doubt,
[00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.140]   but we just don't even know how to answer our friends
[00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:56.060]   or family members who see these as objections
[00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.940]   to why they can't put their faith in God
[00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:58.860]   and they can't come to believe it.
[00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:59.980]   So that's our heart behind this series.
[00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:03.520]   And tonight, I wanna jump into probably the biggest objection
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.140]   that people have, or the most commonly mentioned one,
[00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:09.860]   which is that how can God be totally good, totally powerful,
[00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:14.220]   and so much around our world is filled with bad,
[00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:18.120]   tragedy, painful, horrific things?
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.440]   I mean, not just like viruses
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.180]   that end up costing people jobs
[00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.420]   and losing lives and livelihoods and all of that,
[00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:27.100]   but well before this, I mean, you look around
[00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:30.580]   and you see children daily starving to death.
[00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.460]   You see, people walk into school buildings
[00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.020]   and they shoot up their classmates.
[00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.300]   God could stop all of that, right?
[00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:40.580]   I mean, he's God.
[00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:45.100]   You see people who have a child that gets cancer
[00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:48.580]   and they don't win the battle to cancer
[00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.280]   and they bury their five-year-old.
[00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.620]   Where's God in that?
[00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:55.840]   And this is a very understandable question
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.120]   and there are good answers to it.
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.400]   And so for the next really 30 minutes that we have,
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.960]   I wanna launch into really giving you two questions
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.640]   that I wanna talk about as it relates to this idea
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:08.240]   of God is good and bad things happen.
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.080]   That's the fact that I want us to check tonight.
[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.100]   God is good and bad things happen.
[00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:14.880]   And in doing so, I wanna look at two questions
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.520]   and an explanation about how that can be the case.
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.960]   Let me preface one more time before we dive in.
[00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:24.440]   If you are walking through a season of life
[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.800]   where you are in suffering, you're experiencing pain,
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.160]   you're experiencing trial,
[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:32.060]   this is not the message that is gonna solve
[00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:34.340]   all of those things, but it will give you a framework
[00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:36.840]   through which to see some of that pain and experience.
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:40.780]   In other words, this is more addressing at a higher level
[00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:42.120]   how that can be possible,
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:44.160]   that God is good and bad things exist.
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:45.940]   But for me to attempt to say this message
[00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:48.120]   is gonna do away with any pain that you're experiencing
[00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:49.120]   or anything that you're feeling
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:52.400]   and all that you're walking through would be crazy.
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.180]   And at the same time, I do wanna give us some truth
[00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:55.920]   that we can look at that gives us some framework
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.360]   for understanding how that can be a true statement.
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.320]   So I'm gonna give you two questions, one explanation.
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:01.800]   The first question is this,
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.320]   just a high level thing we're gonna visit about.
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:07.320]   Do bad things, and by that I mean bad,
[00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:08.320]   I mean evil, I mean pain,
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:11.340]   I mean anything you need to put in that bucket.
[00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:14.240]   Do bad things prove that God isn't real?
[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:16.420]   You may have family members, you sit down,
[00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:18.520]   Larry King has said on live television
[00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:19.660]   to millions of people, like,
[00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:20.860]   "Hey, here's why I can't believe in God.
[00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:22.380]   "I just look at the world, there's so much chaos,
[00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:23.220]   "there's so much hurt,
[00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:25.260]   "there's so much brokenness all around us.
[00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.980]   "The fact that a God is even out there
[00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:29.240]   "is hard for me to believe
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.600]   "'cause he's certainly not in control if that's going on.
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.900]   "So I'm not even sure God is real."
[00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:38.140]   So do bad things prove that God isn't real?
[00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:40.740]   Here's why I would say no.
[00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:44.280]   First, let's talk a little bit about even bad things,
[00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:45.680]   that idea of us classifying, like,
[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:47.560]   "Oh, those are really messed up,
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:50.560]   "that's wrong, that's an injustice, that's bad."
[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:52.280]   Anything that we put inside of that bucket,
[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:53.680]   'cause I think for most of us,
[00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:55.600]   there's probably things that all of us here,
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:56.440]   those who are listening at home,
[00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:58.600]   I think we'd probably put some things in that bucket
[00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:00.560]   if we could, that we'd at least all agree on.
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:01.840]   Some of those things that I wrote down would be,
[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:04.120]   "Hey, murder, I think the vast majority of people
[00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.280]   "would put murder in that bucket."
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:08.800]   My point is, we may disagree on speeding,
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:10.920]   and some people may be like, "That's such an injustice,"
[00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:12.580]   and other people would be like, "Ah, you know,
[00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:14.740]   "I was in a hurry," or, "I didn't see it, you know,
[00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:15.800]   "and I'm looking the other way,
[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:17.820]   "so I don't feel bad about speeding."
[00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:19.920]   But most of us would put certain things like murder,
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:22.500]   we'd put sexual abuse or rape,
[00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:28.460]   terrorism, adultery, slavery, racism.
[00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:32.020]   Like, I think most of us would put, am I wrong?
[00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:33.800]   Am I wrong or am I not wrong, okay?
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:35.140]   Most of us would put in that bucket,
[00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:37.140]   "Hey, these things are there."
[00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:38.900]   And here, I wanna ask a crazy question
[00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:42.060]   that's gonna be so bizarre if you're tuning in.
[00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:43.500]   Why?
[00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:45.580]   Like, why would you put that in that bucket?
[00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:48.780]   Like, why are they wrong?
[00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:51.800]   And if somebody said, "Hey, look, that's wrong for you.
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:53.900]   "You know, I think murder is okay for me,
[00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:56.740]   "or adultery is okay for me, or hey, slavery is okay for me,
[00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:58.740]   "that's just kinda your opinion."
[00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:03.140]   I think most of us would go, "No, it's wrong, period."
[00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:03.980]   But why?
[00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:07.240]   Why do you have the sense that there are things
[00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:09.340]   that are right and things that are wrong?
[00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:11.980]   Like, injustice is a reality.
[00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:13.100]   If you've ever wrestled with the fact that,
[00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:14.420]   "Man, I just, I can't believe in God
[00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:16.440]   "because there's so much messed up in this world.
[00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:18.020]   "I just can't get over that.
[00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:19.720]   "I don't even know that God's there."
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:20.820]   I just wanna ask you the question
[00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:23.700]   before we even launch to that second part.
[00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:25.900]   What makes you think, or why are you so certain
[00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:30.900]   there's such a thing as right and wrong, as bad and good?
[00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:33.260]   Because the Christian explanation would be
[00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.860]   that that's not an argument against God.
[00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:39.840]   That, if anything, is an argument and evidence for God.
[00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:41.600]   In other words, the Christian explanation is
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:43.880]   the reason why most of us would universally agree,
[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:46.420]   "Hey, those are wrong, period."
[00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:50.040]   There are things that are just straight up evil every time,
[00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:52.480]   no matter who thinks that they're not.
[00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:54.540]   Because we believe that God has given us
[00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:56.680]   kind of a moral standard, a moral law,
[00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:58.780]   that he has put into the human heart.
[00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:01.640]   And that is the reason why, no matter what you believe,
[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:02.800]   people will find themselves thinking,
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:06.280]   "I just think that child abuse, or beating a child,
[00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:07.120]   "is wrong.
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:11.200]   "I think that walking in and strapping an explosive vest
[00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:13.000]   "to yourself and walking into a school
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.880]   "and blowing up people is wrong."
[00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:15.960]   The Christian perspective would be
[00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:17.500]   the reason why you know that it's wrong
[00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:20.120]   in your heart of hearts is because God put it there.
[00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:24.360]   A moral standard was placed by a moral law giver
[00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:25.320]   who gave that moral law,
[00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:27.320]   and God put that and imprinted it on your heart.
[00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:31.440]   Romans chapter two, verses 14 and 15 says, Paul speaking,
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:32.400]   "Hey, when Gentiles,"
[00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:34.680]   that's people who don't know anything about God,
[00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:37.440]   who don't have the law, talking about the Bible,
[00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:40.520]   "by nature do what the law requires.
[00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:43.900]   "They are a law unto themselves,
[00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:45.740]   "even though they don't have the law."
[00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:47.620]   Like in other words, when they live
[00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:51.080]   and they operate in society and they're kind to people,
[00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:53.680]   and they pay their taxes, and they don't kill people,
[00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:55.080]   and they don't commit adultery,
[00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:57.000]   they're showing that there's something written on their heart
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.680]   that goes, "Oh man, that's not okay.
[00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:02.080]   "I don't think I'm supposed to do that."
[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:04.140]   He says, "That's because God put that law on their heart."
[00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:06.260]   They show the requirements of the law
[00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.100]   are written on their hearts,
[00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:12.140]   and their conscience also bears witness,
[00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:13.680]   and their thoughts sometimes accusing them,
[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:15.900]   or even at other times defending them.
[00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:18.440]   Paul says, "Hey, the reason why people have that,"
[00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:19.360]   and there's a sense of like,
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:22.320]   "Man, that's not okay," to certain things,
[00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:26.040]   is because God put that standard onto their heart.
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:28.240]   And let me ask you a question.
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:30.820]   Without God, who is responsible
[00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:36.680]   for deciding what's wrong and what's not?
[00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:39.800]   In other words, it becomes very difficult
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:41.540]   to even say there is such a thing as,
[00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:44.560]   "Hey, that's wrong," or, "That is bad,
[00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:46.260]   "and so I don't believe in you, God."
[00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:49.040]   It's hard to even say, "Hey, that's bad,"
[00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:50.700]   if there is no God,
[00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:55.840]   because anything that you deem as, "Man, that's wrong,"
[00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:57.280]   is just your opinion.
[00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:00.000]   It may be the opinion of millions of people around you,
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.120]   or even society.
[00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:04.320]   It may even be an opinion that evolution developed over time,
[00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:07.560]   but without God, there is no objective standard
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:11.160]   like that's actually wrong, and this is actually right.
[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:12.560]   This is why I say,
[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:15.200]   does bad things happening in our world disprove God?
[00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:18.040]   No, if anything, it is a more evidence,
[00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:20.840]   or it is greater evidence for the fact that there is a God,
[00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:22.100]   and he puts something inside of you
[00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:25.240]   that when bad happens, you go, "This is not right.
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:27.920]   "It's not supposed to be like this."
[00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:31.240]   C.S. Lewis, who is just a brilliant thinker,
[00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:34.960]   maybe one of the most intelligent thinkers and writers
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:37.660]   in all of Christian history, he talked about it.
[00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:38.500]   He was an atheist.
[00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:40.240]   He was an Oxford professor,
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:42.680]   and for most of his life, he was an atheist,
[00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:43.800]   and he writes about how,
[00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:47.220]   "This gnawing fact that I had something inside of me
[00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:49.560]   "that although I saw all the bad in the world,
[00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:52.280]   "I began to go, 'Man, there's so much messed up,'
[00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:55.700]   "and the fact that I recognize it's messed up
[00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:58.820]   "is not a problem for my belief in God,
[00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:01.300]   "but a problem for me to not believe in God."
[00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:04.340]   He says this in "Mere Christianity," just a well-known book.
[00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:05.620]   "My argument against God,"
[00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:07.420]   he's speaking when he was an atheist,
[00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:09.540]   "was that the universe, the world,
[00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:11.540]   "was so cruel and unjust.
[00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:16.880]   "Where did I get this idea of just and unjust?
[00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:19.920]   "What was I comparing this world to
[00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:21.580]   "when I said it was unjust?
[00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:25.940]   "Of course, if I had given up my idea of justice
[00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:29.380]   "by saying it was nothing but my opinion
[00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:33.380]   "that that's unjust, not a universal law,
[00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:39.400]   "but if I did that, my argument against God collapsed too,
[00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:41.620]   "for the argument depended on me saying
[00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:46.500]   "the world was really unjust or messed up."
[00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:49.120]   And he says, "Consequently, consequently,
[00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:51.580]   "atheism turns out to be too simple.
[00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:54.200]   "It was a greater problem for his atheism
[00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:55.400]   "than for his belief in God,
[00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:56.900]   "and it's ultimately what led him
[00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:57.960]   "to become a believer in God."
[00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:58.800]   You guys may not know this,
[00:13:58.800 --> 00:13:59.660]   I'm gonna give a little history lesson
[00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:01.660]   on something that further illustrates
[00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:03.980]   that as a society, we know this is true,
[00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:06.420]   and we've pointed to it at different historical moments.
[00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:08.780]   You guys know what the Nuremberg trials are?
[00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:10.580]   No, okay, all right, history lesson,
[00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:12.740]   everybody thinking cap on, here's what we got.
[00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:14.180]   There's something called World War II,
[00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:15.820]   happened after World War I.
[00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:19.180]   There's a nation in Europe, went a little cray,
[00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:21.460]   a lot crazy, and they tried to take over the world
[00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:23.060]   and did horrific, horrific things.
[00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:24.380]   You guys familiar, following me?
[00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:25.680]   Called the Nazis.
[00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:28.300]   And the Nazis did a number of different things,
[00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:29.900]   took over countries, they tried to exterminate
[00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:32.460]   an entire group of people, I mean, horrific,
[00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:34.580]   some of the greatest atrocities in history
[00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:36.220]   took place under that regime.
[00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:39.760]   The war went over, it was won, the Allies conquered,
[00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:42.260]   and they went and they put the chief leaders
[00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:43.540]   of the Nazis on trial.
[00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:44.380]   Do you guys know this?
[00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:45.460]   Dude, this is crazy.
[00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:46.420]   And so they put the Nuremberg,
[00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:48.460]   or at the Nuremberg trials, they put all the head guys,
[00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:50.100]   like not the little guy who's like, you know,
[00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:51.780]   they're being told to shove people,
[00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:54.420]   like, hey, you guys are the master planners of all of this.
[00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:55.700]   And they began to put them on trial.
[00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:57.260]   And the defense of the Nazis was,
[00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.300]   there's no international law.
[00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:02.700]   We only did what was legal in any area that we conquered.
[00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:06.160]   You can't say that anything that we did was wrong legally,
[00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:08.340]   because at that time, there wasn't any international law
[00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:09.340]   that they could have done to.
[00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:10.580]   It's a pretty brilliant defense,
[00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:14.060]   or it's a defense that you would say, like, you know,
[00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:16.220]   I guess there's some point in that.
[00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:18.220]   And they argued that, hey, we're not accountable here
[00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:20.580]   because we didn't break any laws.
[00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:23.620]   So you can't hold us accountable to anything.
[00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:27.160]   And the prosecution, which was the world,
[00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:29.860]   said in the opening statements and all throughout it,
[00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:34.480]   you have violated the law of God and nature,
[00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:36.440]   and you are held to a higher authority.
[00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:40.500]   There is a higher law to which all mankind is subject,
[00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:42.200]   and on that, we condemn you.
[00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:45.480]   And many of them lost their lives, they were put in prison.
[00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:49.760]   But my point is, even as world, the global presence was like,
[00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:51.480]   hey, no, there isn't an international law that says
[00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:52.960]   you cannot take over someone's property
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:54.980]   and try to exterminate a race.
[00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:56.300]   You're right, Nazis.
[00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:59.280]   But there's a higher law, a higher law of God,
[00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:02.080]   and you have violated that, and by that, they condemn them.
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:05.840]   My point is this, the idea that bad things happen
[00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:08.240]   does not point against the evidence of God.
[00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:10.680]   If anything, it points towards him.
[00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:13.440]   The second question I wanna ask is much more
[00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:15.260]   at the center of tonight's message,
[00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:17.440]   and that is, but does bad things happening
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:19.600]   prove God isn't good?
[00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:24.600]   Like, how do you not stop terrorist acts,
[00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:29.680]   school shootings, viruses from exploding all over?
[00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:31.160]   Like, God, what are you doing?
[00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:34.220]   It's really hard to hold onto the fact
[00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:36.200]   that this world is so messed up,
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:37.980]   so many people lose their life.
[00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:39.240]   Throughout all of history,
[00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:42.580]   such horrific things have happened, and you're totally good?
[00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:44.880]   And you could stop anything and everything that you want
[00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:46.320]   in a moment, and you don't?
[00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:50.320]   Doesn't the fact that so much bad happens
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:51.760]   prove that God is not good?
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:54.920]   And I wanna attempt as best I can
[00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:59.880]   to show you the answer is no, it doesn't prove that.
[00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:01.880]   And stay with me.
[00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:04.800]   Again, this is more almost a thinking cap kind of thing.
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:07.360]   If the question is like, hey, God, if you're really good,
[00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:09.240]   you would, in a moment, you'd get rid of all the evil
[00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:10.920]   out there that there is.
[00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:13.560]   Like, how have you not gotten rid of all the bad
[00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:16.320]   and messed up stuff in our world yet?
[00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:19.360]   And it's a question that many times people ask,
[00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:21.080]   and if you've ever had a conversation with people
[00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:23.320]   who doubt or have objections, they'll bring this up.
[00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:24.920]   And so let me enter into a hypothetical.
[00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:26.840]   Let's say I'm in the conversation with Emma,
[00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:28.920]   we're talking right here, and she brought that up to me.
[00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:31.320]   And I was to ask Emma, okay, great, you're wondering,
[00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:33.800]   hey, why is God, because in a moment,
[00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:36.180]   he could get rid of all the bad things in our world,
[00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:37.720]   why has he not done that yet?
[00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:41.960]   Why is he okay with that, and how can he be good?
[00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:45.200]   Well, let me ask her.
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:47.800]   If she could, in a moment, get rid of all the bad
[00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:51.040]   that was out there by hitting a button,
[00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:52.480]   here's how that was easy button,
[00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:53.920]   and in a moment, you could hit a button
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:58.320]   and all the evil on the entire planet was gone, would you?
[00:17:58.320 --> 00:17:59.800]   And I don't know what the answer she would say is,
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:00.960]   or she just said, sure.
[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:04.320]   Here's why I would think that is a bad idea.
[00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:05.860]   And a lot of us may think, yeah, of course I would,
[00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:08.560]   in a moment, but before you hit that button,
[00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:10.720]   you've got to think about it honestly.
[00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:13.800]   When you say get rid of all the bad out there,
[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:15.680]   what about you?
[00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:17.280]   Have you ever done anything bad?
[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:19.900]   What about everyone that you know and love,
[00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:21.600]   like your mom, your parents,
[00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:23.120]   even before you ever came along,
[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:26.000]   you think they've ever done anything bad in life?
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.540]   You hit that button, you're not just getting rid
[00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:28.360]   of all the bad out there,
[00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:30.160]   you're getting rid of the bad in you.
[00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:32.700]   And so when you think through that lens,
[00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:34.880]   you may go, oh, man, I don't know if I would hit that button
[00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:36.440]   'cause God, in a moment, could.
[00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:40.800]   And just like after hearing that, my guess is,
[00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:43.020]   Emma wouldn't go, yeah, I'd for sure wanna get rid of me
[00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:44.520]   and everyone I love and everything that I care about
[00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:46.600]   in this life with a moment,
[00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:49.660]   because all those have aspects of bad inside of them.
[00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:52.440]   And she has reason because she loves
[00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:53.360]   and cares about those people.
[00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:55.560]   In the same way, the biblical understanding
[00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:57.480]   is that God also has a reason
[00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:01.400]   why today he has not hit the button
[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:03.120]   because he could instantly,
[00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:07.520]   and that reason is you and me
[00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:10.560]   and people coming into a relationship with him.
[00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:15.280]   He allows, in other words, he's a God who is good,
[00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:18.360]   and he allows things that are not good or bad to happen
[00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:23.000]   because in his sovereign control,
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.720]   he brings about, or there's a good
[00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:26.820]   that he wants to bring about.
[00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:29.000]   There's a good reason why he allows bad things
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:29.840]   to happen today.
[00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:31.920]   And ultimately, Peter says, and the Bible teaches,
[00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:34.000]   that good reason is you and me
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.600]   and people coming into a relationship with him.
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:38.080]   One day he will get rid of all of it,
[00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:39.040]   and he will hit that button,
[00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:41.040]   but today he is patient,
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:43.200]   hoping more people to escape,
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:44.560]   not just the bad things in our world,
[00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:47.440]   but a bad eternity apart from him in hell.
[00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:49.120]   Peter, who spent as much time with Jesus
[00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:50.160]   as anyone that we know of,
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:51.560]   one of Jesus' closest friends,
[00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:53.800]   wrote this in 2 Peter 3,
[00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:55.860]   some of his last words that he ever wrote.
[00:19:55.860 --> 00:20:00.280]   "Above all, you must understand that in the last days,
[00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:01.960]   scoffers will come."
[00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:03.840]   Scoffers is like mockers or people who are like,
[00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:05.400]   "Dude, I can't believe you still believe in God.
[00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:07.040]   It's so outdated."
[00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:09.240]   He says, "Those people are gonna come,
[00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:11.380]   and they'll scoff or mock,
[00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:12.940]   and they'll follow their own evil desires,
[00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:13.780]   and they will say,
[00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:16.840]   'Where is the coming of Jesus that he promised?
[00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:18.920]   Since the beginning, or ever since our ancestors died,
[00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:20.400]   everything goes on as it always has
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:21.800]   since the beginning of creation.
[00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:24.600]   You guys are waiting for a Jesus that's not coming back,
[00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:26.260]   and they'll mock,'" he says.
[00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:30.740]   But do not forget this one thing, verse eight.
[00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:35.020]   "With the Lord, a day is like a thousand years,
[00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:37.340]   and a thousand years like a day.
[00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:39.480]   The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise,
[00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:41.420]   as some understand slowness.
[00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:47.220]   Instead, he is patient with you,
[00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:51.620]   with everyone, not wanting anyone to perish,
[00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:54.100]   but everyone to come to repentance
[00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:55.580]   or into a relationship with him."
[00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:57.540]   The Bible teaches that all the bad and brokenness
[00:20:57.540 --> 00:20:59.100]   in our world breaks God's heart way more
[00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:00.780]   than it ever has broken yours.
[00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:04.620]   He sees everything wrong that has ever taken place.
[00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:07.160]   In other words, there's no like messed up action,
[00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:10.340]   or sin, or murder, or death, or abuse.
[00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:13.080]   God sees all of it, and it breaks his heart way more
[00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:15.460]   than it breaks any of our hearts.
[00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:16.780]   But it teaches that he is patient,
[00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:20.420]   and he allows it today, this temporary bad things to exist,
[00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:22.620]   so that as many people as possible
[00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:26.480]   would escape eternal bad things,
[00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:28.100]   or an eternal bad reality.
[00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:30.740]   It's apart from God.
[00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:37.420]   I think the challenge, or another way of saying it would be,
[00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:43.740]   if God was to remove everything bad about this world,
[00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:47.460]   he would have to remove me, and he'd have to remove you.
[00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:50.860]   And Christians believe God, in the form of Jesus,
[00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:53.980]   came into the world, not to remove you, but to forgive you.
[00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:56.340]   And that's why God is waiting,
[00:21:56.340 --> 00:21:59.080]   because he wants as many people as possible
[00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:01.000]   to experience his forgiveness in this life.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.980]   And you can trust that he's a good God,
[00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:06.200]   that even though bad things happen,
[00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:08.480]   has promised, "I only allow them to happen,
[00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:10.780]   "and I bring about good through those things.
[00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:12.740]   "And there's a good reason why I allow,
[00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:16.240]   "or continue to allow anything bad that has happened."
[00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:17.480]   The Bible doesn't promise that you will have
[00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:19.940]   a life free of pain, it promises there will be purpose
[00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:22.120]   connected to the pain for those who know God.
[00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:24.920]   And here's where I get stuck, and where I get caught up.
[00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:27.500]   I assume that anything that is painful in my life,
[00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:30.160]   or anything that's challenging, that I can see,
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:31.820]   I'll be able to see and connect the dots to like,
[00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:34.000]   "Oh, this is what he was teaching me in that moment,"
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.440]   or, "This is what God was up to then,
[00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:36.860]   "and man, he's the best."
[00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:39.040]   I assume that anytime I walk through a challenging time,
[00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:40.740]   I'll be able to connect the dots, and I'll see like,
[00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:43.520]   "Oh, this is why that happened."
[00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:48.180]   And a lot of times, we just can't see it.
[00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:50.420]   It doesn't mean that it's not there,
[00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:54.140]   I just, I'm not smart enough, or I'm not able enough,
[00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:56.360]   wise enough to connect the dots of like,
[00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:58.980]   "Oh, this is what God was doing all along,
[00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:00.700]   "in his plan, and in his will,
[00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:02.660]   "and how he was working things together."
[00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:06.000]   It's like this, I think a lot of times we assume
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.100]   that if it was there, we'd see it.
[00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:09.320]   And the good news right now about our world
[00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:11.700]   is all of us are experiencing a reality
[00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:13.900]   where we're confronted with the fact that there are times
[00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:17.280]   where something is there, even though we can't see it.
[00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:19.500]   And so for me to assume that, "Hey, I can't see anything
[00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:22.060]   "there, so it must not be there," is just wrong.
[00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:22.900]   What do I mean by that?
[00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:24.500]   Like, you guys have Amazon Prime?
[00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:26.760]   Yeah?
[00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:27.980]   Used it?
[00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:28.820]   Yeah, it's amazing.
[00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:31.340]   A little slower lately, but it's all good.
[00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:33.220]   Amazon Prime, so if you got a package today
[00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:35.300]   on your front desk, or front desk,
[00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:36.680]   on your front porch cowl, and it came there,
[00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:39.420]   and it was dropped off, and there was a package there,
[00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:41.380]   and I said, "Hey," I called you, and it's like,
[00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:42.640]   "Hey, dude, I just want you to know,
[00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:45.260]   "there's an elephant on top of the package
[00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:46.780]   "outside of your door."
[00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:48.100]   You'd be like, "What?
[00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:50.360]   "No, bro, I'm telling you, there's an elephant,
[00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:51.640]   "you gotta go look.
[00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:53.100]   "There's an elephant on the package."
[00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:55.580]   This is going somewhere, 'cause it's so weird.
[00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:57.180]   Like a real elephant, like a lion,
[00:23:57.180 --> 00:23:58.940]   like it's like seven feet tall, it's huge,
[00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:00.700]   it's on the package outside of your front door.
[00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:02.940]   You would very easily be able to go to the front door,
[00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:06.700]   open, and see elephant or no elephant.
[00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:08.060]   It wouldn't be like, you'd be like,
[00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:10.200]   "Hey, I went and looked, and you think, like,
[00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:12.540]   "it went under the package, or I just can't see it
[00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:14.020]   "right now," you would know very clearly,
[00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:16.660]   like, "Hey, it's there, or it's not there."
[00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:18.820]   Now, if I called you, and I said,
[00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:22.000]   "Hey, there's coronavirus on the package
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.900]   "that's outside of your front door."
[00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:25.080]   If you called me back, and you were like,
[00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:27.100]   "Hey, I went to the door, and I looked for it,
[00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:28.040]   "and I looked, and I was like,
[00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:29.860]   "is there any corona on top of this?
[00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:31.980]   "No, I think we're good," and you walked in,
[00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:34.420]   it would not be great to conclude
[00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:36.080]   that you were absolutely right.
[00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:37.460]   There still could have been corona there,
[00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:39.140]   whether or not you could have seen it.
[00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:41.460]   In the same way, we often assume that,
[00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:43.700]   "Hey, if there's a purpose, it's gonna be like an elephant,
[00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:46.680]   "I could see it," versus like a virus
[00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:48.980]   that I can't always see that it's there.
[00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:52.940]   And the Bible says that God is so far above any human mind,
[00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:56.060]   and any human wisdom, that we can't always know
[00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:58.760]   what he's doing, how he's at work, we can't always see it.
[00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:01.880]   But that doesn't mean it's not present in your life,
[00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:04.240]   just like the virus is not present on that package,
[00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:05.660]   to use that illustration.
[00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:09.080]   Isaiah chapter 55 says, "As heaven is higher than earth,
[00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:13.440]   "so my ways," God speaking, "are higher than your ways,
[00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:16.600]   "and my thoughts are higher than your thoughts."
[00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:19.760]   I just want you to ask or wrestle with the question,
[00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:24.680]   like, man, why has God not removed all evil and bad today?
[00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:27.800]   'Cause he's going to eventually, and he's promised that.
[00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:29.160]   But if you're wondering, like,
[00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:31.640]   "I just don't know that God can be good and evil still,
[00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:35.040]   "or bad things still be so everywhere around me."
[00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:39.200]   If you could, and you would remove everything bad,
[00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:40.200]   where would you start?
[00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:41.600]   Like, answer that question.
[00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:44.960]   If somebody you know is wrestling with,
[00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:47.720]   man, how is things so bad, and God claims to be good,
[00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:48.960]   I don't know that that can be true.
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:50.280]   Okay, great.
[00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:53.120]   If you could remove stuff bad, where would you start?
[00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:54.400]   Like, would you start with the five-year-old
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:56.460]   who lied one time to his parents?
[00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:57.560]   Like, is he gone?
[00:25:57.560 --> 00:25:59.560]   Or are we just talking about, like, rapists and murderers?
[00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:00.640]   They're all gone.
[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:03.480]   What about the college student who cheated on their exam?
[00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:05.400]   This past semester?
[00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:08.720]   What about the person who had sex before marriage,
[00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:11.360]   or who looked at pornography, or who,
[00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:13.520]   where would you start and draw the line?
[00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:17.640]   The truth is, the only way for God
[00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:20.680]   to get rid of all the bad things in the world
[00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:23.600]   would be to get rid of all of us,
[00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:27.040]   and he didn't come to remove us, he came to forgive us,
[00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:29.180]   and that's what Christians believe.
[00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:36.120]   Finally, I just wanna provide an explanation
[00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:38.200]   to how Christians have always understood,
[00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:40.240]   and how Christians think about
[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:45.240]   how God is good, and yet bad things happen today.
[00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:49.460]   And it happened the way that we understand it,
[00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:52.120]   traces through the origin of even evil in our world.
[00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:55.940]   The Christian teaching and understanding of the Bible
[00:26:55.940 --> 00:26:57.760]   is that God created the world that we're in right now,
[00:26:57.760 --> 00:26:58.600]   and it was perfect.
[00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:00.540]   There was nothing messed up, there was no death,
[00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:02.880]   there was no disease, nobody ever had a funeral,
[00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:05.360]   you never stood next to a loved one who was sick and dying,
[00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:09.420]   you never experienced pain, you never experienced grief,
[00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:11.880]   you never experienced any of the effects of sin
[00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:15.400]   that have entered into our world, it was perfect.
[00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:17.440]   And he put Adam and Eve in that garden,
[00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:20.840]   or the Garden of Eden is where they were originally placed,
[00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:23.800]   and to them he gave something called free will,
[00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:25.200]   he gave the ability to choose.
[00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:26.920]   In other words, God didn't want robots,
[00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:28.080]   he hasn't created robots,
[00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:29.600]   he wanted them to have the ability
[00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:31.600]   to choose to have a relationship with him,
[00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:32.840]   to choose to love him,
[00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:34.500]   and to choose to walk in a relationship,
[00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:35.960]   and so he gave them free will.
[00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:37.220]   And with that free will,
[00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:42.100]   the human race decided to reject God,
[00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:44.260]   and not follow him, and not listen to him,
[00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:47.140]   and not do what he said, and in rejecting God,
[00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:50.220]   they pushed God away, and into that vacancy,
[00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:53.540]   or in that space where they pushed him, sin entered,
[00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:55.440]   and everything broke.
[00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:58.860]   Everything in the natural world broke,
[00:27:58.860 --> 00:27:59.980]   death entered into the world,
[00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:02.780]   and everything became fractured.
[00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:06.040]   You may have wondered, like, man, who invented evil?
[00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:07.520]   It wasn't invented, it was in this moment
[00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:09.880]   where they pushed God away, and in that space,
[00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:13.760]   all of a sudden, evil came in,
[00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:14.880]   because of the absence,
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:18.200]   or the lack of presence directly with God.
[00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:20.160]   In other words, evil is not something that was invented,
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:23.120]   just like darkness is the absence of light,
[00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:25.920]   evil is the absence of good, or God.
[00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:29.880]   As you see, as things get darker,
[00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:31.400]   it's not because, and this is intentional,
[00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:32.500]   they're not just shutting it down over here,
[00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:34.100]   like, hey, guys, it's time to go.
[00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:37.880]   Darkness is the absence of light.
[00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:43.000]   It's not just something that is invented and created there.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.160]   And so that was the story, when they pushed him away,
[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:47.080]   all of a sudden, sin and evil was introduced
[00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:48.400]   into the world, and God's response,
[00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:51.140]   how did God respond to a rebel human race
[00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:52.180]   that ran from him?
[00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:54.560]   Did he decide, in a moment, I'm just going to crush them,
[00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:55.720]   and do away with this?
[00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:56.560]   No.
[00:28:56.560 --> 00:29:01.860]   He began a mission that ultimately would send his son
[00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:04.440]   to die on a cross and be crushed for us.
[00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:08.400]   Rather than crush Adam and Eve and humanity,
[00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:11.520]   he sent his son to be crushed on our behalf.
[00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:13.220]   And now anyone who puts their faith,
[00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:15.320]   or accepts the free gift that God gave on the cross
[00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:18.640]   through Jesus, that I'm not a good enough person
[00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:20.260]   to experience eternal life with God,
[00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:23.280]   you are so good that you came into the world
[00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:26.900]   to be a solution for the bad, broken things around me.
[00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:30.280]   And you provided that solution by giving your life for me.
[00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:33.020]   And you experienced eternal death for me.
[00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:34.520]   And I know I can have a relationship with you,
[00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:38.640]   not because of how good I am, or how bad I'm not,
[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:41.400]   but because of how good you are, so good you gave your life,
[00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:43.760]   and you paid for me to have a way to have eternity
[00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:44.800]   and eternal life with you.
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:46.280]   And one day, the Bible teaches,
[00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:48.960]   he's going to make everything around us new.
[00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:51.580]   There will be no more war, there will be no more disease,
[00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:54.520]   there will be no more death, and he will make a new heavens
[00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:56.800]   and a new earth, and everything remade.
[00:29:56.800 --> 00:30:00.160]   And everyone who trusts in him
[00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:02.400]   will be a part of that new world.
[00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:04.560]   And that is what Christians have believed.
[00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:05.920]   We believe that we're in a world right now
[00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:06.760]   that's not our home,
[00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:08.120]   that's why there's brokenness all around us.
[00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:10.960]   It's never been a contradiction for Christians
[00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:13.120]   to see bad things around us and say,
[00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:15.880]   "Oh man, now I'm not sure that the Bible's teachings apply."
[00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:18.320]   No, Christianity is not in contradiction
[00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:20.680]   to the fact that there's bad things.
[00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:24.060]   It is the solution to the fact that there's bad things
[00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:25.200]   all around us in this world.
[00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:28.600]   I mean, listen, we worship a God who is perfect,
[00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:33.240]   who is so good, and yet the worst thing possible
[00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:34.600]   happened to him.
[00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:37.120]   He was crucified and experienced eternal death.
[00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:38.340]   Think about that.
[00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:40.240]   The idea that good things or bad things
[00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:41.200]   could happen to good people
[00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:43.580]   is not in contradiction to Christianity.
[00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:47.480]   Christianity is a solution for that reality
[00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:49.800]   because the worst thing happened to the best person,
[00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:51.100]   who is Jesus.
[00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:52.240]   It's never been a contradiction.
[00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:53.800]   And Jesus, when he was here, he promised,
[00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:55.240]   "Hey, don't buy the lie that a lot of people
[00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:56.140]   "are gonna tell you maybe,
[00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:57.460]   "that hey, if you just are a good person,
[00:30:57.460 --> 00:30:59.040]   "good things happen to good people.
[00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:00.320]   "Bad things never happen to good people."
[00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:01.960]   He never promised that.
[00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:04.960]   He promised you were gonna have trouble in this life.
[00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:06.260]   It was promised.
[00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:09.760]   In John chapter 16, he's having a conversation
[00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:12.260]   with some of his guys, and here's what he says.
[00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:15.520]   "I've told you these things," Jesus speaking,
[00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:19.360]   "so that in me you may have peace.
[00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:21.540]   "In this world, you will have trouble.
[00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:25.740]   "But take heart, I will overcome the world."
[00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:27.580]   All right, I have overcome the world.
[00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:30.260]   "You're gonna have trouble in this world.
[00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:31.380]   "It's not your ultimate home,
[00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:32.820]   "and Christians have always accepted that."
[00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:35.080]   And here's where it gets really ironic and interesting.
[00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:37.320]   Jesus just promised, "Hey, I just want everyone to know,
[00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:38.800]   "in this life, you're gonna have a lot of trouble.
[00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:39.640]   "It's gonna be hard.
[00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:40.840]   "There's gonna be things that come your way,
[00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:42.220]   "but guarantee it, take it to the bank.
[00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:43.660]   "There's gonna be trouble."
[00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:46.620]   And ironically, Christians, when we hit trouble,
[00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:49.420]   we're like, "See, this is why I can't trust you, huh?"
[00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:50.520]   It would be like this.
[00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:52.800]   If you and I were going deep sea fishing,
[00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:54.760]   and we went on the boat, we're gonna go fishing out there,
[00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:56.940]   and I don't know why we'd be doing that,
[00:31:56.940 --> 00:31:59.240]   but let's say we were, and we're going fishing,
[00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:00.520]   and before we get on the boat, I'm like,
[00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:03.080]   "Hey, Colby, I'm just telling you, bro,
[00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:04.140]   "you're about to get on this boat,
[00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:06.640]   "and it's gonna make you nauseous and really seasick,
[00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:08.280]   "and it's just gonna happen.
[00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:09.840]   "I'm promising you it's gonna happen.
[00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:10.860]   "And so let me just tell you,
[00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:12.320]   "here's the best way to endure
[00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:15.420]   "and handle and face the seasickness, 'cause it's happening."
[00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:16.600]   And you're like, "Oh, man, I don't know.
[00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:17.440]   "Maybe it won't happen."
[00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:18.520]   I'm like, "No, it's happening.
[00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:20.200]   "I guarantee it's gonna happen."
[00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:22.720]   And then we get on the boat, and all of a sudden,
[00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:26.080]   like I said, you become incredibly seasick,
[00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:27.320]   and you were to then go,
[00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:30.960]   "See, this is why I can't trust you.
[00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:34.560]   "After I just told you, you are going to get seasick.
[00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:36.500]   "If you get on that boat, it's gonna happen,
[00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:38.600]   "and let me just help you endure it."
[00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:40.860]   You would be nuts to go, "Hey, man, you told me that,
[00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:42.000]   "and this is why I can't trust you."
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   And ironically, that's what we do in our faith so oftentimes.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.640]   It's not that it's un-understandable
[00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:49.800]   or not understandable that it happens.
[00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:51.680]   It's just not in line with what the Bible teaches.
[00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:54.600]   Jesus promised, "This is not our home,
[00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:56.300]   "and you will experience pain."
[00:32:56.300 --> 00:32:59.960]   Isaiah chapter 43 says, "When you walk through the fire,"
[00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:03.040]   not if you walk through the fire.
[00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:06.120]   But he hasn't promised that life is gonna be easy,
[00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:08.240]   and some of you, candidly,
[00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:11.720]   you have bought a perception of God
[00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:13.900]   that the Bible doesn't teach,
[00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:15.920]   that tonight, maybe the best thing you can do
[00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:20.920]   is say, "Man, I wanna repent and believe in the one true God."
[00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:22.480]   Like the version of God you bought
[00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:24.280]   is that God is like a secret service agent
[00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:25.720]   who's constantly protecting you,
[00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:28.360]   and he's constantly gonna make sure this doesn't happen.
[00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:30.040]   And that's not what the Bible teaches.
[00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:32.020]   It doesn't teach that, man, if you just follow God,
[00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:34.640]   everything will be easy all the time.
[00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:36.400]   And the best thing you could do is say,
[00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:37.860]   "Man, I'm gonna surrender the wrong,
[00:33:37.860 --> 00:33:39.260]   "the version of God that I bought
[00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:41.320]   "that he's like a secret service God
[00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:45.200]   "is just as not true as the Easter bunny is."
[00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:46.280]   But there is a God who is there
[00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:48.240]   who's promised to be the solution
[00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:49.760]   for all the pain and all the brokenness
[00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:52.100]   and all the bad things in this world.
[00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:55.480]   And he went to a cross, and he died for you and for me
[00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:56.920]   in order to be that solution.
[00:33:56.920 --> 00:34:01.840]   And one day, he is coming, and he will make everything new.
[00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:04.140]   In Revelation chapter 21,
[00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:05.440]   some of the last words in the Bible,
[00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:07.400]   it's the last two chapters,
[00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:11.120]   I want you to see what one of the very first actions
[00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:14.420]   that God does when everything is made new.
[00:34:15.420 --> 00:34:18.300]   Revelation chapter 21, verse one.
[00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:22.180]   John, who wrote this book,
[00:34:22.180 --> 00:34:25.580]   is one of Jesus's close friends, like Peter,
[00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:30.260]   begins to talk about the future that's coming for Christians
[00:34:30.260 --> 00:34:33.620]   and this new world that we're headed towards.
[00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:36.540]   And he says this, "Then I saw,"
[00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:39.260]   speaking of this vision that God gave him,
[00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:42.140]   "Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth,
[00:34:42.140 --> 00:34:44.500]   "for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away,"
[00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:47.720]   that's this one, "and there was no longer any sea.
[00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:51.140]   "And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying,
[00:34:51.140 --> 00:34:53.580]   "Look," this throne that's there,
[00:34:53.580 --> 00:34:54.420]   and all of a sudden,
[00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:57.860]   someone on this incredible king's throne begins to speak.
[00:34:57.860 --> 00:35:02.620]   "Look, God's dwelling place is now among the people,
[00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:06.300]   "and he will dwell with them, and they will be his people,
[00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:08.100]   "and God himself will be their God,
[00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:14.020]   "and he will wipe away every tear from their eyes.
[00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:17.280]   "There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain
[00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:20.080]   "for the older order of things has passed away.
[00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:22.540]   "He who is seated on the throne said,
[00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:25.160]   "I am making everything new."
[00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:28.960]   One of the very first actions that we're told in the Bible,
[00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:32.260]   we're told that God is gonna do
[00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:34.700]   in the new earth and new heavens,
[00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:35.740]   is he's gonna reach out
[00:35:35.740 --> 00:35:39.940]   and he's gonna wipe away every tear from every eye.
[00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:42.460]   Think about the intimacy of that action.
[00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:44.580]   Like that's a very intimate action, if you think about it.
[00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:45.980]   Like if, in other words,
[00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:47.380]   if Anthony was over here crying and I was like,
[00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:50.100]   "Hey, just got something right there,"
[00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:51.940]   it would be a total invasion,
[00:35:51.940 --> 00:35:53.860]   especially in quarantine of social distancing,
[00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:55.920]   but also an invasion regardless of the time
[00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:56.780]   of personal space.
[00:35:56.780 --> 00:35:58.500]   Like I don't even honestly do that with my wife
[00:35:58.500 --> 00:35:59.780]   when she's crying, I'm not like,
[00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:01.700]   "Let me get that mascara right there."
[00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:02.820]   It's just a weird thing.
[00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:05.400]   You know what the only person that I do that with?
[00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:06.240]   My kids.
[00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:08.300]   Like it's incredibly intimate.
[00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:09.240]   Like whenever they're crying,
[00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:10.220]   my daughter's crying about something,
[00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:11.060]   my son's crying about something,
[00:36:11.060 --> 00:36:12.980]   I put them on my knee, I kiss their head,
[00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:14.860]   and I wipe away their tears.
[00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:16.300]   It's incredibly intimate.
[00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:19.180]   This is the picture that God paints
[00:36:19.180 --> 00:36:20.700]   of his relationship with every believer.
[00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:22.400]   And there's gonna come a day in the midst of all the pain
[00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:23.460]   that all of you are walking through
[00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:25.220]   and will face for the rest of your life
[00:36:25.220 --> 00:36:26.860]   where he's gonna go.
[00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:28.800]   And so he puts you on his knee
[00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:31.100]   and he wipes away every tear from your eye
[00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:33.780]   like a father or a mother would to their child.
[00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:37.540]   That's how intimate God's first action
[00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:39.620]   towards his people is.
[00:36:39.620 --> 00:36:42.660]   And welcomes into a world where death never exists anymore.
[00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:46.640]   Here's the challenge of this message.
[00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:50.220]   It is not emotionally satisfying.
[00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:52.120]   Like in other words, the idea that,
[00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:53.760]   oh man, well I guess bad things happen
[00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:54.680]   that doesn't disprove God.
[00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:57.360]   And you know, I guess if I was God,
[00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:59.040]   I don't know that I would hit the button to remove evil
[00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:01.080]   and he's going to eventually.
[00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:04.300]   And Christianity, I guess it makes sense
[00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:06.940]   that God is the solution for all the bad things,
[00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:10.020]   but it just doesn't sit right to me
[00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:13.100]   that so much evil is taking place around the world.
[00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:15.140]   That so many girls are sold into sex slavery.
[00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:17.300]   Like how do you reconcile that?
[00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:20.700]   That people are abused domestically by their spouse.
[00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:22.960]   That sickness happens.
[00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:24.440]   Cancer seems random.
[00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:25.660]   Like none of that sits okay.
[00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:29.740]   Like there's no answer that makes me emotionally satisfied.
[00:37:29.740 --> 00:37:31.160]   And here's the truth, and I need you to hear this
[00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:32.780]   'cause some of you have never heard this before.
[00:37:32.780 --> 00:37:34.980]   There is no emotional satisfier,
[00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:37.520]   emotionally satisfying answer to the problem of pain
[00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:39.720]   and evil and brokenness in our world.
[00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:40.840]   It doesn't exist.
[00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:42.240]   And here's why, and this is really important
[00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:43.700]   in case you tuned out.
[00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:46.960]   Because you were made, regardless of what you believe,
[00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:48.240]   regardless of your religion,
[00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:49.580]   regardless of your upbringing,
[00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:51.180]   every person listening right now,
[00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:53.360]   you were made in the image of God.
[00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:55.680]   And there's still enough image of God inside of you,
[00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:57.300]   despite the fact that when sin entered,
[00:37:57.300 --> 00:38:00.900]   it broke the reflection of God inside of us,
[00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:03.200]   but it didn't totally do away with it.
[00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:05.000]   And there's enough image of God inside of you
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:09.280]   that will never be okay with horrific evil taking place.
[00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:10.360]   In other words, there's no sermon.
[00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:11.720]   And sometimes as pastors, we're like,
[00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:12.920]   "Dude, I'm about to give this sermon.
[00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:14.200]   "It's gonna change everyone's life."
[00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:16.240]   And you're gonna hear an answer that you're like,
[00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:17.620]   "Oh, whoa."
[00:38:17.620 --> 00:38:20.160]   And that's something you hope to do.
[00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:23.460]   But emotionally, there is no sermon.
[00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:24.440]   There's no sentence.
[00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:26.000]   There's no clip you can watch on the internet
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:26.840]   that's gonna make you like,
[00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:28.960]   "You know, I really had a problem with domestic abuse.
[00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:32.620]   "And then I saw this and I was like, oh, that's great.
[00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:33.460]   "I'm okay with it now.
[00:38:33.460 --> 00:38:34.840]   "'Cause you know, God's up there."
[00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:36.480]   You're never gonna be okay with that.
[00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:39.080]   There's no emotionally satisfying answer.
[00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:40.260]   'Cause you're made in the image of God
[00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:42.080]   and God is not emotionally satisfied
[00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:44.600]   with all the brokenness in our world.
[00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:45.420]   He hates it.
[00:38:45.420 --> 00:38:46.260]   He grieves over it.
[00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:49.560]   His heart breaks over it more than any of ours do.
[00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:50.800]   And he gave his life.
[00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:53.360]   And in doing so, he shows that.
[00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:56.880]   And he's not okay with all the horrific pain.
[00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:58.520]   And one day he's promised, "I will do away with it.
[00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:01.000]   "And today I wait patiently so that more people
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:04.200]   "for all of eternity will have a relationship with me."
[00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:05.640]   And his heart breaks over it.
[00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:09.400]   We see inside of John's gospel,
[00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:11.800]   this interaction that just shows the incredible tenderness
[00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:15.720]   and emotional compassion of God.
[00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:19.520]   It's from John chapter 11, and I'll summarize it.
[00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:20.820]   We're about to close here.
[00:39:20.820 --> 00:39:23.880]   In John chapter 11, we're told that Jesus
[00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:25.320]   has these like three sibling friends.
[00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:27.800]   Like there's three friends that are all siblings together.
[00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:29.840]   The name is Lazarus, Martha, and Mary.
[00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:31.640]   They're like good buddies with Jesus.
[00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:32.760]   How cool would that be?
[00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:35.360]   Your family is tight with Jesus.
[00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:39.400]   And we're told that one of them, Lazarus, gets really sick.
[00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:42.760]   And the sisters, they send word to Jesus.
[00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:47.540]   They're like, "Hey, Lazarus, the one you love is sick."
[00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:53.640]   Jesus, we're told, eventually shows up at their house.
[00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:54.500]   He comes to them.
[00:39:54.500 --> 00:40:01.260]   And while they're there, he's told that Lazarus died.
[00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:03.640]   He's not alive anymore.
[00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:05.840]   And Jesus goes to the tomb,
[00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:07.100]   and I just wanna read what happens next.
[00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:09.680]   He shows up and he goes to the burial place.
[00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:12.000]   It says this, John chapter 11, verse 34.
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.560]   "Where have you laid him?"
[00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:15.640]   He asked the sisters.
[00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:18.840]   "Where have you put Lazarus?"
[00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:21.680]   30-something, maybe 20-something-year-old kid.
[00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:22.840]   "Where'd you bury him?"
[00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:25.200]   "Come and see, Lord."
[00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:27.760]   And they show up.
[00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:33.120]   Outside the tomb, we see Jesus wept.
[00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:37.220]   Begins crying and weeping.
[00:40:37.220 --> 00:40:41.760]   Jesus, once more deeply moved, he came to the tomb,
[00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:45.080]   and it was a cave with a stone laid across the entrance.
[00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:47.640]   And he said, "Take away the stone."
[00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:48.480]   And Jesus shows up.
[00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:49.300]   He missed the funeral.
[00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:50.580]   He shows up, and they're like,
[00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:52.000]   "Jesus, take away the stone."
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:53.240]   She says, "It's been four days.
[00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:55.080]   "By this time, there's a bad odor."
[00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:59.360]   And Jesus said, "Did I not tell you that if you believe,
[00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:01.160]   "you're gonna see the glory of God?"
[00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:03.700]   So they roll the stone away.
[00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:06.060]   Then Jesus looked up and he said,
[00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:08.960]   "Father, I thank you that you've heard me.
[00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:09.980]   "I know you always hear me,
[00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:11.080]   "but I said this for the benefit
[00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:12.040]   "of the people standing here,
[00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:14.440]   "that they may believe you sent me."
[00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:18.640]   And when they said this, Jesus called out in a loud voice,
[00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:21.400]   "Lazarus, come out!"
[00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:24.240]   And the dead man came out,
[00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:27.520]   and his hands and his feet were wrapped in strips of linen
[00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:28.720]   and cloth around his face.
[00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:31.060]   And Jesus said, "Take the grave clothes off of him
[00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:32.920]   "and let him go."
[00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:35.080]   He comes out and he says, "Take the stone away."
[00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:37.880]   And Lazarus comes out at Jesus' invitation
[00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:39.360]   and looking like a mummy.
[00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:40.680]   He's like, "Take off the clothes,
[00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:43.280]   "or take the linens and all the cloths off of him."
[00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:47.220]   Here's what's so crazy to me about that story.
[00:41:47.220 --> 00:41:50.840]   Why are you weeping?
[00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:53.440]   Jesus, you know all things.
[00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:54.680]   You knew that you were gonna heal him.
[00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:56.440]   You knew exactly what was gonna take place.
[00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:58.040]   You weren't surprised by like, "Oh yeah, whoa,
[00:41:58.040 --> 00:41:59.720]   "I got the ability to raise people from the dead."
[00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:01.240]   You knew everything you were gonna do.
[00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:03.360]   You knew that you were about to raise this person
[00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:04.200]   from the dead.
[00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:06.960]   And you show up and you begin to weep
[00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:09.820]   as you see the pain that death had created
[00:42:09.820 --> 00:42:11.120]   and the people around you.
[00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:14.640]   The reason that he's weeping outside
[00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:16.240]   is because unlike any other person,
[00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:18.320]   Jesus knew more fully what it was like
[00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:20.800]   to experience a world that is free of sin
[00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:21.620]   and death.
[00:42:21.620 --> 00:42:23.360]   He's the only person who's ever known a world
[00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:24.960]   where there wasn't the presence of death.
[00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:27.160]   He's the only person that knows deeper
[00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:28.880]   than anyone will ever understand.
[00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:30.720]   You were not made to die,
[00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:32.640]   or what was not made to experience death.
[00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:36.120]   People were not made to bury their 25-year-old brother.
[00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:38.940]   And he looks at this group and he's heartbroken.
[00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:40.920]   And he knows he's about to raise him from the dead,
[00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:44.800]   but he sees and he knows this was never meant
[00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:45.640]   to be this way.
[00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:48.220]   And the tenderness of Jesus pours out.
[00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:50.200]   Whatever you're walking through,
[00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:51.920]   whatever you think about the God who's there,
[00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:54.920]   he's not distant, he's not uncaring,
[00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:57.520]   he's compassionate in everything that you're facing.
[00:42:57.520 --> 00:43:02.880]   And just like the sisters of Mary and Martha saw,
[00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:05.080]   I mean, how much would that mess with you?
[00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:07.680]   You're just raising from the dead and you are crying
[00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:11.440]   over the pain in our life.
[00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:16.320]   Whatever you're walking through, whatever pain is there,
[00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:18.180]   God is not apathetic to you.
[00:43:19.620 --> 00:43:20.460]   Whatever you think about him,
[00:43:20.460 --> 00:43:22.560]   you cannot conclude that he doesn't care.
[00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:23.600]   He cares.
[00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:24.840]   He's a God who sits out of tombs
[00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:27.200]   that he knows he's about to raise and he cries.
[00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:29.200]   He's a God that cared so much,
[00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:32.000]   he gave his life for you on the cross.
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.600]   He's the solution for everything bad in our world.
[00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:36.440]   And it doesn't emotionally sit right.
[00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:40.560]   Because you're made in the image of that God
[00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:42.880]   who cares deeply when people hurt.
[00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:45.240]   And he cares through whatever
[00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:46.880]   you're walking through right now.
[00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:49.700]   And he was the best person
[00:43:49.700 --> 00:43:53.780]   who experienced the worst thing happening to him,
[00:43:53.780 --> 00:43:57.240]   eternal death, so that you wouldn't have to.
[00:43:57.240 --> 00:43:59.940]   If you're listening right now
[00:43:59.940 --> 00:44:00.860]   and you've never had a moment,
[00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:02.900]   every week we get people that write in and just say,
[00:44:02.900 --> 00:44:05.780]   "I've never put my faith in Christ before, but I believe.
[00:44:05.780 --> 00:44:08.780]   "I'm starting to believe Jesus is who he says he is.
[00:44:08.780 --> 00:44:09.780]   "He's alive.
[00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:14.140]   "And I'm experiencing that change in my life."
[00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:15.900]   I want to invite you to do what so many have done,
[00:44:15.900 --> 00:44:17.540]   which is begin to put your faith in Christ,
[00:44:17.540 --> 00:44:19.220]   begin to ask Jesus,
[00:44:19.220 --> 00:44:21.620]   "I want to have a relationship with God.
[00:44:21.620 --> 00:44:22.700]   "I'm a sinner.
[00:44:22.700 --> 00:44:23.840]   "I'm a bad person.
[00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:27.440]   "I don't deserve to go spend eternity with God.
[00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:29.600]   "But if what you say is true,
[00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:34.060]   "that if I trust in what you did for me on the cross,
[00:44:34.060 --> 00:44:35.660]   "and your burial, and your resurrection,
[00:44:35.660 --> 00:44:38.960]   "then I'll be forgiven forever?
[00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:40.620]   "Then I receive that, and I believe that,
[00:44:40.620 --> 00:44:41.900]   "and I accept that.
[00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:45.160]   "Come be Lord of my life.
[00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:46.220]   "Forgive me, Lord.
[00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:49.440]   "Be my Savior, my God.
[00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:50.520]   "I believe.
[00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:53.380]   "Tonight is your night, wherever you are."
[00:44:53.380 --> 00:44:54.320]   And it's just expressing to God,
[00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:55.260]   "Man, I'm a sinner.
[00:44:55.260 --> 00:44:57.360]   "I don't deserve a relationship with you.
[00:44:57.360 --> 00:44:59.980]   "But I, by faith, accept the free gift
[00:44:59.980 --> 00:45:00.820]   "that you've given me.
[00:45:00.820 --> 00:45:03.000]   "Tonight, you can know that you're gonna experience
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.780]   "a world that will have no bad ever be a part of it.
[00:45:05.780 --> 00:45:09.140]   "No more pain, no more death.
[00:45:09.140 --> 00:45:12.520]   "And you don't have to wonder where you stand with God."
[00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:15.380]   If you are walking through a situation or a scenario,
[00:45:15.380 --> 00:45:16.700]   I just want to pray for the last group
[00:45:16.700 --> 00:45:18.460]   as we transition to a worship song,
[00:45:18.460 --> 00:45:20.820]   have a chance for Q and A.
[00:45:20.820 --> 00:45:23.500]   Those of you who are listening
[00:45:23.500 --> 00:45:25.660]   who are just in a really hard spot,
[00:45:25.660 --> 00:45:28.060]   and you're walking through the reality
[00:45:28.060 --> 00:45:30.420]   that your job is not coming back,
[00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:31.720]   your mom may not make it,
[00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:35.000]   you may have been diagnosed with a sickness
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.360]   or an autoimmune or something in your own life,
[00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:40.780]   you have parents that their marriage is falling apart
[00:45:40.780 --> 00:45:42.780]   or a loved one who maybe has walked away from Christ
[00:45:42.780 --> 00:45:44.380]   or whatever you're experiencing,
[00:45:44.380 --> 00:45:46.540]   maybe it's a cancer that you were praying,
[00:45:46.540 --> 00:45:48.060]   God, please take it away and it's back.
[00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:51.540]   I just want to pray for you and pray over you
[00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:54.740]   as we walk through this and just ask for God
[00:45:54.740 --> 00:45:58.540]   to in a way that I honestly don't even fully know
[00:45:58.540 --> 00:46:03.540]   how to ask for, to raise and heighten your awareness.
[00:46:03.540 --> 00:46:05.020]   He's not far.
[00:46:05.020 --> 00:46:07.260]   He's not apathetic.
[00:46:07.260 --> 00:46:09.200]   He's not angry.
[00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:12.620]   And he loves you and his heart breaks over the pain
[00:46:12.620 --> 00:46:14.320]   in our world and in your life.
[00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:18.460]   And just that he would raise your senses
[00:46:18.460 --> 00:46:20.260]   and your awareness of his nearness to you,
[00:46:20.260 --> 00:46:21.100]   even in this moment.
[00:46:21.100 --> 00:46:23.700]   So let me just pray and we'll transition into worship.
[00:46:23.700 --> 00:46:27.020]   Father, I do pray for anyone
[00:46:27.020 --> 00:46:33.020]   who's currently walking through pain.
[00:46:33.020 --> 00:46:37.020]   Somebody recently died in their life.
[00:46:37.020 --> 00:46:40.980]   The story that they hoped you would write
[00:46:40.980 --> 00:46:43.540]   of the job, a career, a marriage,
[00:46:43.540 --> 00:46:49.820]   their life is not gonna go the way that they hoped it would.
[00:46:49.820 --> 00:46:53.260]   They have people around them that are running from you
[00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:56.100]   and just whatever they're facing and walking through,
[00:46:56.100 --> 00:46:59.180]   God, I do pray that you would supernaturally right now
[00:46:59.180 --> 00:47:01.380]   in this moment, you'd raise their awareness
[00:47:01.380 --> 00:47:02.740]   of your nearness to them.
[00:47:02.740 --> 00:47:06.620]   You would comfort them.
[00:47:06.620 --> 00:47:08.260]   You the God of comfort.
[00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:14.200]   You would enlarge our hope that is not in this world.
[00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:15.480]   It's not in our health.
[00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:17.320]   It's not in a person.
[00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:21.440]   It's in our God and our savior who was so good.
[00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:23.360]   He gave his life for us.
[00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:25.220]   And would you help us God?
[00:47:25.220 --> 00:47:28.280]   Because in the pains of our life,
[00:47:28.280 --> 00:47:32.740]   our emotions can make us question everything
[00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:33.680]   and anything around us.
[00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:35.320]   So help us God, ground us in truth
[00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:37.280]   and ground us in your word, be near to us.
[00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:39.280]   And we know that you are.
[00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:41.760]   And so raise our awareness and our confidence of that
[00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:43.720]   and the truth that you're God,
[00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:45.240]   who one day will do away with all evil.
[00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:47.520]   And today you've allowed it so that more
[00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:48.820]   would come to know you.
[00:47:48.820 --> 00:47:52.040]   We worship you in song, amen.
[00:47:52.040 --> 00:48:02.040]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
