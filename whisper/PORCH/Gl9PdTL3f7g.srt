00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 >> Guys, what did they say though?

9
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 They said Jesus, we're too thankful for words.

10
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 A lot of times.

11
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 Jesus, we're too thankful for words.

12
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 Words are important though.

13
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 Those are friends of ours, Portugalers just like you.

14
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 I recognize some of them as they walk off the stage,

15
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 friends who stumbled into this place.

16
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 Some of them came from Christian backgrounds.

17
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 Some of them were raised in the church.

18
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 Others of them couldn't stop getting high.

19
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 Others of them couldn't stop sleeping with their boyfriends.

20
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 And all of them came to this place and heard a call to get on a plane

21
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 and go overseas, specifically Ethiopia.

22
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 And they did so.

23
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 And the Lord used the trip to grab their hearts and put a song in their hearts.

24
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 That's what the scripture says Jesus does is he put a song in our hearts.

25
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 And so they shared that song with you.

26
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 I'd love to just start by talking about -- they started that way because we're

27
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 talking about reaching the ends of the earth tonight with the gospel as we move

28
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 through the series and wrap up tonight in our Unashamed series.

29
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 And so I'll start with just some kind of strange pictures.

30
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 This first one is particularly strange.

31
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 I'll have to explain.

32
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 This is a pink dolphin of the Amazon.

33
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 And we got to swim with the pink dolphins.

34
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 They are pink because the water is so dark there.

35
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 And they're freshwater dolphin.

36
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 And it was just fun to get in the water with them and get to hang out there on

37
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 the Amazon River near Manaus, Brazil.

38
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 And so this next one, this is a leopard skin.

39
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 Yes, a leopard skin.

40
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 Also in Brazil.

41
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 Someone had just killed it a couple weeks before we got there and wanted to

42
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 share that with us.

43
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 Actually offered us its skull.

44
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 What a prize.

45
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 They said, "Here, go home.

46
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 Go back with this leopard skull."

47
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 And I was like, I remember talking to Tim, like, "How are we going to get this

48
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 thing on the plane?"

49
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 And I think it's illegal.

50
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 And then this next one, this is an alligator that we caught on an alligator

51
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 hunt with one of the missionaries there in Brazil.

52
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 He took us out and we were looking for crocodiles of the Amazon.

53
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 And we didn't want to catch his father, but we did catch him.

54
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 And then now jumping continents, this is Africa.

55
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 Here, this is the Maasai warriors, the Maasai Mara near an area of Kenya in

56
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 the African jungle.

57
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 You always hear about the African Bushmen.

58
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 What happens to the African Bushmen who never hears the gospel?

59
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 This is the African Bushmen right here with his piercings.

60
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 And that's an earring.

61
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 That's quite an earring, actually.

62
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 That is indeed a Maasai warrior.

63
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 And then here, that was his lion club that he had made, and I traded him a

64
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 Swiss army knife for it.

65
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 And he made the trade, and I brought that back.

66
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 I still have it today, keeping me safe.

67
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 This is a mass grave there in Rwanda.

68
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 When over a million people died or nearly a million people died in the

69
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 genocide, the government built this mass grave for them.

70
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 And as we visited that, that was one of the things that we saw.

71
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 And then we also saw this.

72
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 This is the king of the jungle.

73
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 There is no fence between me and him.

74
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 This guy was just out roaming around hunting.

75
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 Probably that.

76
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 That's an elephant.

77
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 Four to be precise.

78
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 And now again, jumping continents now to an island nation of Haiti, one of the

79
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 most beautiful beaches I've ever seen in the world there on the island nation of

80
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 Haiti.

81
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 Also the most beautiful sunsets at our partner, Mission of Hope.

82
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 We got to see that sunset every single night.

83
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 And then there's the Haitian waterfall with me and my port shirt, praising God

84
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 and the glory of his creation on the island nation of Haiti.

85
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 And here's why I show you all of that.

86
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 Because I believe with all my heart that I can compel you tonight to get on a

87
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 plane and to go overseas.

88
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 And I believe with all my heart on the way back, you will thank me that I did

89
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 so.

90
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 You will be very, very glad that you used a week's vacation to do so.

91
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 But I do not want you to get on a plane to see a pink dolphin, a waterfall, a

92
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 sunset, a very beautiful beach, a Maasai warrior, a lion, or anything of the

93
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 like.

94
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 In fact, the most amazing things of all of those trips, if I didn't see any of

95
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 those things, the most beautiful, incredible things of all of those trips

96
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 that I went on were the people and we intentionally left them out apart from

97
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 the Maasai warrior.

98
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 But the most amazing thing, and you must believe me because I would not lie to

99
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 you right up top of the message, the most memorable experiences I had, be it in

100
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 the Amazon, be it in Africa, be it in Haiti or anywhere else I've ever been,

101
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 were the people, God's creation, those he made in his image.

102
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 And the most amazing experience that I had in all of those places, we get to

103
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 tell them this amazing news that they don't have to go to hell.

104
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 That they can be with God forever in his kingdom.

105
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 That God loved them so much that he took all the crazy stuff, the genocide, the

106
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 fact that you killed your brother's wife.

107
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 Jesus died for that and you don't have to go to hell, you can be with him

108
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 forever.

109
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 That's good news.

110
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 And to get to sit on a soccer field after playing a soccer game with a bunch of

111
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 kids and ask them with an EvangelCube, "Do you want to trust in this Jesus?"

112
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 "For your salvation?"

113
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 And for them to say in their broken English or through an interpreter, "Yes, I

114
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 do."

115
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 "Can I do that now?"

116
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 And to know that those people today as we gather in this room, maybe they're

117
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 sleeping, maybe they're not, maybe they're playing soccer, maybe they're eating

118
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 dinner or breakfast.

119
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 But to know that we will be with them again.

120
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 That one day we will be in the fullness of the presence of God and his glory.

121
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 Face to face with them again.

122
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 Remember when we played soccer?

123
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 Remember when you prayed to trust in Jesus?

124
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 Man, that was awesome.

125
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 Now the pink dolphins, that was cool too.

126
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 But when you prayed, when you understood the hope that you have in Christ, man,

127
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 it was amazing.

128
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 And what I can't do, or I'm sorry, what I hope God does in spite of me tonight,

129
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 is not to give you an excitement about jaguars, dolphins, elephants, lions,

130
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 tigers and bears, oh my.

131
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 But to give you a heart for his people all over the world.

132
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 People that if you don't go and see, and if you don't go and share, we won't get

133
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 to see them again.

134
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 Because there are so many people on this planet right now as we gather in this

135
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 room who have not heard the name of Jesus and have not had the opportunity to

136
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 trust him.

137
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 I'm not talking about unsaved people.

138
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 I'm talking about unreached people.

139
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 And there's a difference.

140
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 An unsaved person is someone who has heard the gospel and rejected it.

141
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 An unreached person is someone who won't or who hasn't had the opportunity to

142
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 hear the gospel.

143
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 Do those people exist today?

144
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 Indeed they do.

145
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 There's 4,083 unreached people groups in the world.

146
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 This is groups of people who have not had the opportunity to hear the gospel,

147
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 nor do they have the Bible maybe in their language or available to them.

148
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 There are 2,998,119,000 unreached people living today, alive today, destined for

149
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 hell, having not heard the saving message of Jesus Christ under the condemnation

150
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 of their sin.

151
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 2,670 people groups, or roughly 204 million individuals in the world, have no

152
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 scriptures or audio recordings available in their primary language.

153
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 339 of the 550 people groups in China do not even have Bible portions available

154
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 in their primary language.

155
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 35 of the 78 people groups in Afghanistan do not even have Bible portions

156
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 available in their primary language.

157
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 And I talk a lot about our generation.

158
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 Some have told me that I'm hard on our generation, millennials, Generation Y,

159
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 those born between 1980 and 2000.

160
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 I talk a lot about how it is very, very possible that our nation is lost due to

161
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 us not taking our faith seriously.

162
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 But I want you to know there is really good news in the midst of that, that there

163
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 is a purification of Christianity happening.

164
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 There are people who are nominal believers who are falling off, but there are

165
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 people who are real believers, those indwelled by the Holy Spirit who are

166
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 taking that message and leveraging their life like the apostles did for the sake

167
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 of the spreading of the gospel and the building of his kingdom.

168
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 And plainly put, in layman's terms, those who will live their lives for the sake

169
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 of telling others the story of Jesus Christ so that they can be with him

170
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 forever.

171
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 And that's happening in your generation.

172
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 It is very, very possible that in your generation the entire world is reached

173
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 for the sake of the gospel.

174
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 It was not possible prior to today, but due to the world wide web, a literal

175
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 string of wires that stretches and bonds every single continent on the planet,

176
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 and due to satellite imaging, for the first time we can see any place on the

177
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 planet.

178
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 Not only can you see it, but it sits in your pocket on your phone.

179
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 I can call someone halfway around the world right now and see them.

180
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 For the first time in history, it is very possible that we all see the return of

181
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 Christ at once, and moreover, we can pave a way for him coming by preaching the

182
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 gospel to every nation, as Matthew 24 says, must happen before he returns.

183
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 And so that is what we can do, and that is what I hope we will do, and I hope the

184
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 Lord uses the rest of our evening tonight.

185
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 As we talk about to the ends of the earth, taking this light to the ends of the

186
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 earth, we're in a series called Unashamed.

187
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 Week one, we talked about our Jerusalem.

188
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 These are the places that you go on an everyday basis.

189
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 Your Jerusalem is your Starbucks, your grocery store, the place where you work,

190
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 your school, your neighborhood, your apartment community.

191
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 This is your Jerusalem.

192
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 What is your responsibility to your Jerusalem?

193
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 It is to be a light there, that wherever you are, the Holy Spirit indwells you.

194
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 If you are a Christian, that is, if you've trusted in Jesus Christ, death and

195
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 resurrection for the forgiveness of your sins, then you have the Holy Spirit,

196
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 you're going to be with God forever, and your responsibility is to be a light

197
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 wherever you are, to push back darkness wherever you go.

198
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 Okay?

199
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 Then week two, we talked about our Judea and Samaria.

200
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 This is Dallas, Fort Worth.

201
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 This is DFW, the area that is entrusted to us, that there are those in need around

202
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 us that we should go to and shine a light there.

203
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 There are those who do not have food today, that do not have money today,

204
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 that do not have a place to live today, and moreover, all of those things do not

205
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 have the saving good news of Jesus Christ today in our area that we are

206
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 responsible for, and so we take it to them, and we shine a light in those places.

207
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 Week three, tonight, we're talking about taking the gospel to the ends of the

208
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 earth, specifically the path that we'll walk down is the method of salvation,

209
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 why it's necessary to share it, and then before you leave here this evening,

210
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 how we measure success in missions, how we measure our success as we take this

211
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 saving message to the ends of the earth.

212
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 We're going to be in Paul's letter to the church in Rome, chapter 10, Romans

213
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 chapter 10, so you have the gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, and the New

214
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 Testament, the second half of your Bible.

215
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 Then you have Acts, then you have Romans, if you would turn there, turn to chapter

216
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 10, I'll start in verse 8.

217
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 Paul writes, "What does it say?

218
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 The word is near you, it is in your mouth and in your heart, that is the message,"

219
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 so what is the word?

220
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 "The message concerning faith that we proclaim.

221
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 If you declare with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord,' and believe in your heart that

222
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 God raised him from the dead, you will be saved."

223
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 You might be here, and you might say, "Hey, how am I saved?

224
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 Saved from what?

225
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 Saved from sin, the consequences of sin, saved from hell, saved to God, saved to

226
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 heaven.

227
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 How does it happen?"

228
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 It says right here, plainly in Romans 10, 9, "If you declare with your mouth that

229
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 Jesus Christ is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead,

230
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 then you will be saved, not you might be saved, not you'll probably be saved, you

231
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 will be saved.

232
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 For it is with your mouth that you believe and are justified, and it is with your

233
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess

234
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 your faith and are saved."

235
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 The word "justified" there just means to be declared righteous.

236
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 Here's why that's important, because if you're here and you're a Christian, every

237
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 now and then someone will say, "How did you become a Christian?"

238
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 They'll say, "Well, I've always been a Christian."

239
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 That's not a true statement.

240
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 You have not always been a Christian.

241
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 There was a point of justification.

242
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 There was one moment in your life when you were headed toward hell, and then there

243
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 was another moment where you've trusted in Christ, his finished work on the cross

244
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 for the forgiveness of your sins, and you were in that moment declared righteous,

245
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 meaning that God is no longer counting your sins against you.

246
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 You don't have to pay for them.

247
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 Jesus paid for them, and you trusted that.

248
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 Therefore, you are justified or declared righteous.

249
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 As Scripture says, "Anyone who believes in him will never be put to shame, for there

250
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 is no difference between Jew and Gentile.

251
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 The same Lord is Lord of all and richly blesses all who call on him.

252
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 For everyone who calls in the name of the Lord will be saved."

253
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 "Call" there means to pray in faith for salvation.

254
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 Simply put, I need someone to save me.

255
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 I need a Savior.

256
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 God provided a Savior in Jesus Christ.

257
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 There's a moment in your life where you realize you are drowning in your sin, and you need

258
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 someone to save you from your sin.

259
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 That Savior, that lifeguard, if you will, is Christ Jesus.

260
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 That is the gospel.

261
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 My first point this evening is the method of our salvation is a message.

262
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 This is important.

263
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 The method of our salvation is a message.

264
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 How is someone saved?

265
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 How does someone cross over from death to life, hell to heaven?

266
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 It doesn't just happen.

267
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 It's a message.

268
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 The power comes through words that are shared.

269
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 A message.

270
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 This is very simple.

271
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 Let me explain it like this.

272
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 Growing up, we wouldn't ever really travel overseas.

273
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 I'd never been on an airplane until the eighth grade.

274
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 Our vacations looked like tubing the river.

275
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 There was this one particular time we went and tubed the river in this area in far east Texas.

276
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 It wasn't green.

277
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 Maybe that's what you know of, tubing the river.

278
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 Maybe you've been on green with an inner tube and a bud light.

279
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 That's not what I'm talking about here.

280
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 This is a different kind of tubing the river.

281
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 This is one with Mom and Dad present, and I was eight.

282
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 We're there, and the guy is telling us, "Maybe you've went whitewater rafting."

283
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 You can picture this.

284
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 We're about to tube the river, and the guy is very concerned about this fork in the river where he says,

285
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 "If you go left, there is a drop-off."

286
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 He keeps telling us, "You do not want to go left.

287
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 You do not want to go left.

288
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 You will see signs that tell you not to go left.

289
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 Make sure you stay to the right."

290
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 As we were tubing the river, we began to pass those signs.

291
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 "Hey, the fork in the river is coming.

292
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 Make sure you stay to the left."

293
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 Or, "Make sure you stay to the right."

294
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 "Make sure you stay to the right."

295
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 Then we got to this one big sign that simply said, "If you go left, you will die," which I appreciated.

296
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 I appreciated that.

297
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 We went right, and we were safe, and we enjoyed our river tubing trip.

298
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 But that is what you are.

299
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 Friends, you are simply a sign carrying a message that if you continue in your ways,

300
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 you will die.

301
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 But I have good news.

302
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 You do not have to die, for there is one who died on your behalf.

303
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 His name is Jesus Christ.

304
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 If you believe that he died on your behalf, if you believe that he paid the price for your sins,

305
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 then you will live with God forever.

306
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 That is indeed the gospel, which simply translates "good news."

307
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 You are a sign.

308
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 You are a fork in the road.

309
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 In fact, Jim Elliott said it like this.

310
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 This was his prayer.

311
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 Jim Elliott was a missionary.

312
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 He prayed, "Father, make me a crisis man.

313
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 Bring those I contact to a decision.

314
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 Let me not be a milepost on a single road.

315
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 Make me a fork that men must turn one way or another on facing Christ in me."

316
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 Lord, make me a fork that when someone comes to me, and they come in contact with Christ in me,

317
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 they have to go right or left, but they cannot continue in their ways.

318
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 They have to deliberately choose to reject your message or to accept your message and be with you forever.

319
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 But make me a fork.

320
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 We have a message.

321
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 God uses messengers to carry it forward.

322
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 Who are the messengers?

323
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 It is simply, guys, those who have believed upon the message.

324
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 Anyone who has believed upon the saving good news of the gospel, that they have trusted Christ,

325
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 and they then carry that selflessly forward.

326
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 Why? Because it was selflessly shared with them.

327
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 And that is how Christianity works.

328
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 It is the last part of the gospel.

329
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 The last part of the gospel is not simply the resurrected Jesus.

330
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 In fact, the last thing the resurrected Jesus said was to go and to share this good news to all the ends of the earth.

331
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 That you would take it forward.

332
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 Christianity is like the largest multi-level marketing program the world has ever seen.

333
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 If you are not familiar with the term, maybe you have heard it called network marketing,

334
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 or maybe you have heard it called pyramid scheme.

335
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 It has a negative connotation in many circles.

336
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 Think Amway, if you are familiar with that, or something else that you are involved in,

337
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 or your cousin or aunt are involved in.

338
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 The simple way that this works is you buy their product,

339
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 and then you become a seller of their product, who then gets the product at a discount.

340
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 But some people, they join up with that just so they can simply consume the product.

341
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 That is not Christianity.

342
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 We benefit from the product, if you will, and then we share the product with others.

343
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 Why? Because we believe upon it.

344
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 The best network marketers are always those who believe in the product.

345
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 And if you do not believe in the product, you will not share it.

346
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 And it is that simple.

347
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 Why does not someone share it? They do not believe in the product.

348
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 That is it.

349
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 There is only one reason.

350
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 You either hate people or you do not believe it.

351
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 The only thing necessary to share the gospel is to believe the gospel.

352
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 I am not sure why we do not. I know there is an enemy.

353
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 David reminded me of this story this week.

354
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 We were in Mexico once.

355
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 We were there on vacation, but wherever we are, we are also on mission,

356
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 because we are Christians and that is what Christians do.

357
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 They are always on mission, regardless of their business, pleasure or mission.

358
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 We are there on mission.

359
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 We were eating dinner and the server came forward.

360
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 The waitress came up and we had engaged with her.

361
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 Remember, engage, share, invite.

362
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 We had engaged with her.

363
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 "Hey, how long have you been here? How long have you lived here?

364
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 How long have you worked here?"

365
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 We were talking. "Can we share some good news with you?

366
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 Can we share this truth with you about Jesus Christ?

367
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 What do you think you have to do to get into heaven?"

368
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 She said, "You have to believe in God and you have to do these things."

369
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 I said, "Do you think that is what the Bible teaches?"

370
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 She said, "I do not know."

371
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 I said, "Let me show you what the Bible teaches."

372
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 Ephesians 2.8.9, 1 John 5, 11-13.

373
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 We walked through the scriptures.

374
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 I said, "Did you know that Jesus Christ did everything on your behalf?

375
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 That what your job is, your part is, you believe.

376
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 Right now, you can go and you can believe upon this truth and be with God forever."

377
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 This was her response. I want you to listen closely.

378
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 This is what she said.

379
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 "Wow. That is good news."

380
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 That is what she said.

381
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 The reason that she said it was good news is because it is unbelievably good news.

382
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 I am not sure when we, porch goers, Christian friends, stopped believing that it was good news.

383
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 People do not have to go to hell. They can be with God forever.

384
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 It is great news, man.

385
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 It is amazing news.

386
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 Everyone that you share it with one day will realize that in sharing it with them, you were loving them.

387
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 Many of them will thank you in the kingdom.

388
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 Some of them will wish they had listened.

389
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 Everyone will be glad that you shared that truth with them.

390
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 As the scripture says, "Apart from Christ, man is under condemnation of God."

391
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 That is Romans 5.

392
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 "Apart from Christ, man is a slave to sin and in the snare of the devil."

393
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 That is John 8, verse 34.

394
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 2 Timothy 2, verse 26.

395
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 "Apart from Christ, we are object of God's wrath."

396
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 Ephesians 2, verse 3.

397
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 "Apart from Christ, man is cut off."

398
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 Colossians 1, verse 21.

399
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 "Destined to die forever in the fires of hell."

400
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 Mark 9.

401
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 "In torment forever."

402
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 Luke 16.

403
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 "Ongoing destruction."

404
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 2 Thessalonians 1.

405
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 "The smoke of sinners' torment goes up forever and ever without rest."

406
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 Revelation 14.

407
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 So how would we not share it?

408
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 Verse 14, he says,

409
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 "How then can they call on the one they have not believed in?

410
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 And how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard?

411
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 And how can they hear without someone preaching to them?

412
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 And how can anyone preach unless they are sent as it is written,

413
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 'How beautiful are the feet of those who bring the good news!'"

414
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 My second point is a simple one.

415
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 They won't hear it unless you share it.

416
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 They will not hear it unless you share it.

417
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 I've heard it asked many times when we wrestle with Christianity and theological truths.

418
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 "What about those who never hear the gospel?"

419
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 I've heard many pastors and myself have before.

420
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 We go to Romans 1 and we say, "Hey, we show how the world declares God and awareness of God,

421
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 and everyone knows their God, and if they see God, if they truly see God, they will find Him."

422
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 And we go to all of these places.

423
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 I don't anymore.

424
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 Somebody says, "What about those who have never heard the gospel?"

425
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 I simply say, "What about those who have and don't share it with those who haven't?"

426
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 What does that mean?

427
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 How does that happen?

428
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 How do we sit under this umbrella of question, "Well, what about those who never hear?"

429
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 Well, what about the thousands, hundreds of thousands, billions who have heard

430
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 and feel no burden whatsoever to go share it with the two billion who haven't heard?

431
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 Well, what about--that's a better question.

432
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 What about those people?

433
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 Christianity is like a good infection.

434
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 A disease, if you will, a good disease, if you will.

435
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 How do you know if someone has a disease?

436
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 You see the symptoms of that disease pouring from their life.

437
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 Whether it's a fever or boils or whatever, the symptoms of that disease,

438
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 as you clearly see, they have it because they have the physical symptoms of it.

439
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 Just like Christianity, when someone becomes a Christianity,

440
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 the good infection of Christianity, the fruit of the Spirit,

441
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 that which indwells them, a disease, you have something in you working that is showing symptoms.

442
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 Likewise, Christianity, you have something in you, holy and good and perfect,

443
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 that is working to show symptoms.

444
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 The fruit of the Spirit bleed from your life.

445
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 Love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, gentleness, faithfulness, self-control bleed from your life.

446
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 Oh, you got that disease. But also, like a disease, Christianity is contagious.

447
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 Like a contagious infection.

448
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 How do you know if someone has a contagious infection?

449
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 Simply put, it spreads.

450
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 How do you know if someone has the good infection of Christianity?

451
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 Simply put, it spreads.

452
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 It is very, very, very contagious.

453
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 If you are contagious, in fact, by being near a Christian, you will catch it.

454
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 And this is where the metaphor breaks down, because I believe the church has begun to treat it like a disease.

455
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 In fact, we're like, "Oh, man, he caught that Christianity thing."

456
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 Make sure we quarantine them in the church.

457
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 Now, bring them in the church, make them park cars and get in a community group and pray in the corner

458
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 and read their Bibles over here, but don't let them out there.

459
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 They might do something crazy.

460
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 Might start telling everyone about Jesus.

461
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 Keep them here in the church. Quarantine them nice and close here.

462
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 May it never be, man.

463
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 May it never be.

464
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 Speaking of diseases, I heard that some are afraid to go overseas with Ebola breakout

465
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 and ISIS.

466
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 My friends, these are reasons we go, not reasons we stay.

467
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 These are reasons we go.

468
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 This is what Christians have done since day one.

469
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 I will tell you that to do, I've heard it said, to do death-defying mission work,

470
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 you must believe in the sovereignty of God, that is, that He's in control

471
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 and that you will not die one moment before the Lord has ordained.

472
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 And I will simply tell you that until God is done with you, you are immortal.

473
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 And if you're going to die, which I hate to break it to you, you are.

474
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 What better way to die than in obedience?

475
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 And answering a call to Him, I was with our senior pastor the other day,

476
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 and this is what pastors talk about when they're at lunch.

477
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 He said, "What would you do if ISIS captured you and put a knife to your throat

478
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 and said, 'We're going to cut off your head.'"

479
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 And the rest of us stopped and thought for a second.

480
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 My pastor responded like he had thought about it and said,

481
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 "I would take off my shirt and I would hand it to them."

482
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 And I said, "You need to take this before it gets bloody,

483
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 for the winter is coming and the nights are cold here.

484
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 In the name of Jesus, this is yours."

485
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 And I heard that and I'm like, "I think that's what Jesus would do."

486
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 I think you've got the question right.

487
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 And I was thinking jujitsu in my mind, but you win.

488
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 Jim Elliot said this, "When it comes time to die,

489
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 make sure all you have to do is die."

490
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 Maybe you don't know who Jim Elliot is.

491
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 In his 20s, he had heard of a tribe, the Wahodani tribe in Ecuador,

492
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 who were an unreached people group.

493
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 And he began to use all of his brain power and all of his gifts

494
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 and all of his talents to make his life mission to be sure

495
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 that the Wahodani tribe heard about Jesus before he died.

496
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 And he studied here and then eventually got on a boat,

497
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 traveled to Ecuador, lived in an area for a year

498
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 as he learned the language, then moved to a tribe closer

499
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 to where he learned some specific phrases of the Wahodani tribe.

500
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 Just to tell you a little bit about this tribe,

501
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 they were a very interesting group.

502
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 There was an oil rig near there.

503
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 They had killed all the oil workers and so the oil well was abandoned.

504
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 There was another tribe around them that had trusted in Christ

505
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 and began to share the gospel with them.

506
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 They killed every single one of them.

507
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 Anyone who came into their territory, they speared to death.

508
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 And so Jim Elliot and four of his friends made it their life mission

509
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 to make sure they heard about Jesus.

510
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 And so they got a plane and they figured out how to lower gifts

511
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 down to the Wahodani people.

512
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 And so they would lower food down to them in this bucket from this plane.

513
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 And they were very successful.

514
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 In fact, eventually the Wahodani began to give them gifts back in the bucket.

515
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 And when they did that, they thought, "Okay, it's time. We can go."

516
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 And so they found a place to land the plane near the Wahodani people on a beach.

517
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 And they got there and the plane went and told the tribal people

518
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 that they were there, "Please go see them."

519
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 A man and two women went and saw them.

520
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 They had dinner together. It went very well.

521
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 They were very excited that this tribe was going to hear about Jesus.

522
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 Three days later, they saw two other women on the shore.

523
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 They quickly went to them.

524
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 As they got closer, they realized that the women were not friendly.

525
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 In fact, when they turned around, they saw that they were surrounded

526
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
 by Wahodani warriors holding spears in the air.

527
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 Jim Elliot had a revolver on him.

528
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 He went to reach for it and then realizing that they had committed

529
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 not to kill anyone who had not heard about Jesus.

530
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 For they were sure where they would go, but they had not heard about Christ.

531
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 Jim Elliot was unsuccessful.

532
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:05,000
 He died in that moment by spear with four of his friends.

533
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 His wife, Elizabeth Elliot, waited for the call that weekend.

534
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 Never got it. Weeks went by.

535
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 They got concerned. It became a nationwide issue.

536
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,000
 The United States of America sent people to recover their bodies.

537
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 They buried their bodies on the beach there.

538
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,000
 Elizabeth Elliot then studied here for a year, got on a plane,

539
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 and returned to the Wahodani people.

540
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 In the name of Jesus Christ, she told them that they had killed her husband

541
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 and that she was here to make sure they knew about Jesus.

542
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 The entire tribe converted.

543
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,000
 It's one of the greatest missionary stories ever known to man.

544
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 Apart from the apostle Paul, Jim Elliot is potentially one of the greatest missionaries

545
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 apart from the apostles.

546
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 Thousands have been spurred on by his story.

547
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 Thousands tonight are spurred on by his story.

548
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 More than 50 years later, some of you are like, "Yeah, but he died."

549
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 No, Jim Elliot lived more than any of us ever will.

550
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 He lived out his mission. He lived out his calling on his life.

551
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
 God's calling on his life.

552
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 It's important to say now, just to make sure your theology is accurate,

553
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 that the Lord does not need you.

554
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 No, God can make the rocks cry out indeed.

555
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 He does not need you, but if he made the rocks cry out,

556
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 it would only be because of our disobedience.

557
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 It would only be because of our apathy.

558
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 It would only be because we were not faithful.

559
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 In fact, there are 4,083 unreached people groups as a result of our unfaithfulness,

560
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 and as a result of our disobedience.

561
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 Verse 16, "But not all the Israelites accepted the good news,

562
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 for Isaiah says, 'Lord, who has believed our message?'

563
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 Consequently, faith comes from hearing the message,

564
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
 and the message is heard through the word about Christ."

565
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
 Literally, the message concerning Christ in the Greek.

566
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 "But I ask, did they not hear?"

567
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
 Of course they did.

568
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
 "Their voice has gone out into all the earth,

569
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 their words to the ends of the world."

570
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,000
 What's happening here is Paul is addressing an objection

571
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:26,000
 that the Israelites, or God's people, the Jews, have not heard the gospel.

572
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 Paul is saying, "No, they have heard it because we shared it."

573
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
 They have heard it.

574
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
 "We were a fork in the road.

575
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 Those who have rejected it have rejected it upon hearing it,

576
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 but they have heard it."

577
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,000
 My third and final point this evening is simply that success in missions

578
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
 is measured by sharing.

579
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 Success in missions is measured by sharing.

580
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 What do I mean by that?

581
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
 Success in missions is measured by sharing,

582
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
 not converting, but sharing,

583
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 that you would share the gospel.

584
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
 See, God is in charge of who accepts it.

585
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,000
 You're in charge of sharing it.

586
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
 God's in charge of saving.

587
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 In fact, I'll illustrate it like this.

588
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
 If there were two mission trips, two international--

589
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,000
 we call them short-term discipleship trips because everything we do is missions.

590
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 If there were two trips, people go overseas,

591
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:22,000
 the first trip, they share the gospel 50 times and 40 trust in Christ,

592
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
 we would celebrate that.

593
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
 If in the second trip they shared the gospel 400 times

594
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
 and four trusted in Christ,

595
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
 I'm telling you that the second trip was more successful

596
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,000
 because our responsibility is sharing the gospel.

597
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
 God is in charge of saving people.

598
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
 Your responsibility is sharing.

599
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 God's responsibility is saving,

600
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
 and he's really, really, really good at it.

601
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
 He's really, really good at doing his part,

602
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 and this means that you cannot get frustrated

603
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
 at your unbelieving father or your unbelieving boss,

604
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
 that instead of frustrations, you pray,

605
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:06,000
 you pray like their eternity depended on it because it does.

606
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,000
 But tonight is not just about sharing the gospel

607
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
 but about taking it to people who haven't heard it,

608
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,000
 all the ends of the earth.

609
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
 The gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John,

610
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
 the first books of the New Testament,

611
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
 are written about Jesus' life.

612
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
 That's why we call them the gospels,

613
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
 and they all end the same way,

614
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
 not with the resurrected Christ,

615
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
 but with the resurrected Christ calling the people closest to him

616
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:36,000
 who have believed upon him to go and share this story to the ends of the earth.

617
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
 That's how the gospels end.

618
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,000
 In fact, in Matthew 28, we see what's called the great commission,

619
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
 and I love that we use the word mission

620
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
 like we're soldiers on a mission,

621
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
 like this is the mission, and not just the mission,

622
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
 but the commission that someone else is going with us,

623
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
 our captain, God Almighty, he goes with us,

624
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
 he's with us, this is what the great commission says.

625
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
 "Then the 11 disciples went to Galilee,

626
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
 "to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.

627
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
 "When they saw him, they worshipped him, but some doubted.

628
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,000
 "Then Jesus came to them and said, 'All authority in heaven and on earth

629
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
 "'has been given to me.'"

630
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
 What an amazing statement.

631
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
 "Therefore go and make disciples of all nations,

632
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,000
 "baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,

633
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
 "and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you,

634
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
 "and surely I am with you always,

635
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
 "to the very end of the age that God goes with you.

636
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
 "As you share his truth, he is with you.

637
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,000
 "Giving you the words, he is with you.

638
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
 "You always choose your last words carefully.

639
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
 "Jesus is no exception.

640
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,000
 "He used his last words to send the disciples out into the world

641
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,000
 "on the greatest mission this world has ever known.

642
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
 "And because of their obedience, you sit here tonight."

643
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:53,000
 Christianity has exploded and spread throughout the world,

644
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,000
 spreading west, eventually reaching the Americas.

645
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,000
 It's this infectious disease that has reached itself

646
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
 to your ears tonight.

647
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000
 Maybe you're hearing it for the first time this evening,

648
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
 but this is what has happened as a result of these 12 guys,

649
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,000
 11 of which died horrific deaths,

650
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:18,000
 one of which was tortured before he died,

651
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,000
 all for the sake that you might know who Christ is.

652
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
 This is our example that we might go and do the same.

653
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
 The gospel has spread.

654
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
 And let me say this.

655
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,000
 Let me speak to my nominal believers in the room,

656
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,000
 those of you that simply attend church on Sunday,

657
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
 or maybe you don't,

658
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
 or maybe even the non-believers in the room,

659
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
 those that have yet to trust in Christ,

660
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
 his death and resurrection for the forgiveness of your sins.

661
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,000
 If you don't know my story,

662
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
 if we're meeting each other for the first time this evening,

663
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
 I've not always been a Christian,

664
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
 though I was raised in the church.

665
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
 College was rebellious for me,

666
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
 and I will tell you,

667
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
 from experience, the sin robs you of creativity.

668
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
 It was like the same thing over and over and over.

669
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
 Every weekend, every Monday, I would live for Thursday,

670
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
 so that I would get drunk on Thursday,

671
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
 cruise Thursday night into Friday,

672
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
 get extremely drunk on Friday.

673
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
 That would carry me through Saturday,

674
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
 so that I might wake up on Sunday

675
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
 with a hangover beside some stranger, typically.

676
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:24,000
 And the greatest trip, the greatest journey,

677
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
 as a non-Christian, it came every year,

678
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,000
 was to Sal Padre on spring break.

679
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
 That we would go down to Sal Padre,

680
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
 we would sit next to some muddy water,

681
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
 kind of called a beach,

682
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
 and we would drink a lot of beer out of a funnel

683
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,000
 next to a bunch of coeds around our age.

684
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
 And that was what life was.

685
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
 I thought it was awesome.

686
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,000
 I thought that was the epitome

687
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,000
 of pleasure and satisfaction, sin of life.

688
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
 Sin robs you of creativity, like what a joke.

689
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,000
 Nearly two years after becoming Christian,

690
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,000
 I found myself not in Sal Padre, but South Africa.

691
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,000
 Sitting with a Maasai warrior,

692
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
 as he showed me his house,

693
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
 and I told him about Jesus.

694
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
 And what I'm telling you, frankly,

695
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
 non-believing friends, is you're getting ripped off.

696
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
 You have not yet found life.

697
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
 And I'm telling you that boldly,

698
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
 as someone who's snorted lines from a mirror,

699
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
 and bonged beers, or whatever you think life is,

700
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
 you are getting ripped off.

701
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000
 'Cause you haven't found it yet.

702
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
 And I'd love to share it with you tonight.

703
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
 If you have not heard it yet,

704
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
 if it has not hit your heart yet, let's talk.

705
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:46,000
 Jesus is clearly, as clearly as he can,

706
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
 telling us to go, and to find the people

707
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
 who do not know him, and tell him.

708
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,000
 And I'm asking you, can you think of a greater mission?

709
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,000
 Our question tonight is, why haven't we gone?

710
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
 Why haven't we gone?

711
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
 There's gonna be some opportunities for you

712
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
 as soon as the message wraps up.

713
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
 I know Fort Worth, Garrett's gonna circle you up

714
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
 and talk to you about an opportunity in Haiti

715
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
 at Mission of Hope, and here in Dallas,

716
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
 there in the loft, we're gonna talk about Ethiopia and Haiti.

717
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
 If you have any interest in even gaining information,

718
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
 I would urge you to go there.

719
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
 There's a simple application tonight,

720
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
 I wanna make sure everyone hears it.

721
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
 It is to get on a plane and go somewhere,

722
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
 and if for any reason you can't,

723
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,000
 it is to give to those who can.

724
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
 That's it, that you would go somewhere

725
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,000
 and share the gospel with someone who needs to hear it.

726
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
 Okay, certainly, asterisk,

727
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
 certainly with your neighbor first.

728
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
 Okay, and as you're faithful,

729
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
 sharing the gospel with your neighbor,

730
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,000
 and in your supermarket, and in your Starbucks,

731
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
 and at work, that you would get on a plane

732
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
 and you would go somewhere,

733
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
 and you would share it with someone who hasn't heard it.

734
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
 And if you hear that and you're like,

735
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
 I don't have vacation days,

736
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
 or I can't do that for some reason,

737
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
 or for whatever it is,

738
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
 that you would give to those who can

739
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
 and make it possible for them to do that.

740
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
 And we're not taking up an offering,

741
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,000
 that's not us, man, that's for you to find the need

742
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,000
 and for you to meet the need on your own.

743
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:12,000
 Okay, that's the simple application this evening.

744
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
 Have you guys seen,

745
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:20,000
 there's this thing that's been repeated in movies.

746
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,000
 It's, like, I think, "Act of Valor."

747
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
 Have you seen "Act of Valor?"

748
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
 Does that connect with anyone?

749
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
 The SEAL Team Six has just kind of been, like,

750
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
 thwarted in the cinema lately, right?

751
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
 And so, we see these Navy SEALs.

752
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
 You've seen this scene,

753
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
 whether you've seen "Act of Valor" or not.

754
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
 It looks like this.

755
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
 There's these soldiers and they're on a base,

756
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
 and they're kind of doing ordinary things.

757
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
 What I mean by that is they're jogging in sweats,

758
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
 or they're working out, or they're playing chess,

759
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
 or they're giving each other a hard time

760
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
 about each other's girlfriends,

761
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
 and they're just kind of talking smack,

762
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
 and they're just doing ordinary things, right?

763
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
 That's one scene.

764
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
 You see the soldiers, they're in sweats,

765
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
 they're just kind of doing ordinary things.

766
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,000
 Scene two, the captain brings everyone together in a room,

767
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
 and there's a whiteboard, typically,

768
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
 or some sort of slide or projector or something,

769
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
 and he begins to give the mission.

770
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
 "Okay, guys, hey, you ready?

771
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
 "This is what we've been training for.

772
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
 "We're gonna go now.

773
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
 "I found the bad guy.

774
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
 "We're gonna go get the bad guy.

775
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
 "You ready on mission?"

776
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
 And then scene three, usually it cuts to this scene

777
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,000
 where these same superhuman, almost, dudes

778
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,000
 are walking around in camo, carrying AR-15s with helmets,

779
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
 and their face shield is down,

780
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
 and they're usually crawling up the back of some helicopter,

781
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
 ready to do work.

782
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
 You seen it?

783
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
 You guys nod your heads if you've seen this,

784
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
 or if you fell asleep, like, elbow your neighbor or something.

785
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
 You guys seen this?

786
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
 You guys seen it?

787
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
 Can you imagine with me for just one moment?

788
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
 Okay, same scene, dudes in sweats,

789
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,000
 running, jogging, playing chess, hanging out.

790
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
 Captain says, "Hey, come together.

791
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
 "Hey, we're gonna go get the bad guy.

792
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
 "We're gonna go on mission."

793
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,000
 Scene three, back in sweats, jogging, hanging out,

794
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
 playing chess.

795
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
 Captain comes, "Hey, what are we doing?

796
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
 "Did you not hear the mission?

797
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
 "Did you not hear what we're going to do?

798
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
 "Did you not hear?

799
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
 "This is what we've been training for."

800
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,000
 "Cool, Captain, I'm good, man.

801
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
 "Go work on my bench press, okay, I'm good.

802
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
 "Like, y'all have fun."

803
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
 "And this is what we've done."

804
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:17,000
 Jesus said, "Gather soldiers,

805
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,000
 "for there is a mission."

806
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:25,000
 Simply put, it is I want you to go into the world

807
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,000
 and teaching them the very things that I've taught you,

808
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
 baptizing them in the name of the Father

809
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
 and the Son and the Holy Spirit,

810
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
 and lo, I will be with you always to the very end of the age.

811
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
 You guys ready?

812
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
 Ready, break.

813
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:42,000
 Get suited up, grab your AR-15s, and let's do work.

814
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,000
 Ah, Jesus, we're good.

815
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
 We're good, man.

816
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
 I'm just gonna wait for your return.

817
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,000
 Somebody else will do that.

818
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
 Man, I'm gonna be in Dallas,

819
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
 I'm gonna be in Fort Worth or Houston

820
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
 or somewhere else around America,

821
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
 just getting comfortable,

822
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,000
 building my kingdom, but we're good, Jesus.

823
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,000
 No, I'll read my Bible every now and then, I'll pray,

824
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,000
 even go to church on Sunday, we're good.

825
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,000
 Just leave me alone, don't ask much of me.

826
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,000
 That ain't the gospel, friends.

827
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,000
 That ain't the gospel.

828
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,000
 Let me pray specifically that we would hear

829
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,000
 and understand the gospel.

830
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,000
 Father, we cannot without you.

831
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:36,000
 Lord, we come to you in the name of Jesus.

832
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:41,000
 Yeshua, Isa, Jezis,

833
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:47,000
 Yeshu, Disas, Jezus, Jesus,

834
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:53,000
 Isas, Jezus, Isus, Disus,

835
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:57,000
 Isa, Lisao, Sai,

836
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:04,000
 Jesus, Jesus, Jesus,

837
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:13,000
 Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.

838
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:17,000
 Father, may his name be preached in every language,

839
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:22,000
 in every tongue, to every nation.

840
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:27,000
 Would you use this group in that way, God?

841
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,000
 Help us to reach them.

842
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,000
 Amen.

843
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:41,000
 It's our time.

844
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,000
 We must rise up and no longer disparage.

845
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,000
 It's our time, church, to honor our heritage.

846
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,000
 We have a Savior. He gave it all on the cross.

847
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,000
 We stand beside martyrs who counted nothing as loss.

848
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:59,000
 They took God's mysteries, opened them up for us.

849
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:03,000
 Stephen, John the Baptist, Bonhoeffer, Jan Hus.

850
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,000
 Surrounded by a cloud of witnesses above,

851
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,000
 it's now our turn to model his unending love.

852
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
 Our mission is one we cannot confuse,

853
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,000
 nor muddy up with some trite excuse.

854
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,000
 You say you're not well-versed, ready, or able.

855
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,000
 I think Moses even tried to use that fable.

856
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,000
 The time we have, it's now more urgent.

857
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,000
 If we should hear, "Well done, faithful servant."

858
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,000
 Yeah, church, it's our time.

859
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,000
 It's our time to confess the ways we're mangled,

860
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,000
 the sins and selfishness that have us entangled.

861
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,000
 Lust, greed, and pride, their path leads to the grave.

862
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,000
 Yet we return to our sins as if we're a slave.

863
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,000
 Can we survive in this putrid, dead sea?

864
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,000
 I quote Paul, "May it never be."

865
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:57,000
 So let's cast aside our individual leprosy

866
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,000
 and begin to leave a biblical legacy.

867
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,000
 There's a glorious prize awaiting to be won,

868
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,000
 and the way to win is to start to run.

869
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,000
 Let's lace them up and fight the good fight,

870
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,000
 become to the world both salt and light.

871
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,000
 Our life on earth is merely a vapor.

872
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,000
 Our chapter must move from pen to paper.

873
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,000
 So church, let's get to writing because it's our time.

874
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
 It's our time, church.

875
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,000
 We have what it takes to help the world from its slumber awake.

876
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,000
 To Jesus we are his beautiful bride.

877
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,000
 Whom shall we fear with him on our side?

878
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
 We have each other. We are not alone.

879
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,000
 It's iron to iron in the combat zone.

880
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,000
 There's a promise of life full of adventure.

881
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,000
 As long as we give both talents and treasure,

882
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,000
 the workers are few, the harvest is plenty,

883
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,000
 with so many lives running on empty.

884
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
 Scores of people trying to cope.

885
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,000
 They've come to the end of their proverbial rope.

886
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,000
 Young eyes are wandering, looking for direction.

887
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
 Make sure we point them to his resurrection.

888
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,000
 The clock's ticking. We're on our dime.

889
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
 Hey, church, rise up!

890
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,000
 It's our time!

891
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:20,000
 It's our time.

892
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:26,000
 To Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, and to all the ends of the earth,

893
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,000
 I just need you to get it.

894
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
 All right?

895
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:34,000
 The only people who share it are those who believe it,

896
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,000
 and those who believe it share it. They can't not.

897
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
 It's infectious.

898
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
 It's infectious.

899
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
 It's infectious.

900
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:53,000
