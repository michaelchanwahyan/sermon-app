[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   [Music]
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   Welcome to the porch. It's good to be with you guys this evening.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   Really excited about the message this evening.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   And I'll start just by talking about a conversation that recently occurred between my wife and I,
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   between Monica and I. I'm often reflecting back to my time in high school, okay?
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   Which looked like me talking about, you know, my best friend. Yeah, my best friend and I.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   My best friend Travis and I, we were there. And then, you know, later on I'll tell her another story.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   My best friend Trey and I, you know, and then I'll tell her another story.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   My best friend Cullen and I, and then I'll tell her another story.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   I'm like, "Hey, my best friend Sean and I." Well, she starts keeping track.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   And she's like, "Hey, why did you have so many best friends? Like, were you just popular?
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   Like, why did you have all these best friends in high school?"
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   And I'm like, "No, it wasn't that I was popular. It was that I couldn't keep them."
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   And I started, like, reflecting on this and kind of had this breakthrough moment.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   I'm like, "Oh, no." And I realized that I had this, like, explosive anger problem, which would, like, end.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   You know, there would be these explosions and then it would end a relationship.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   And then I would move into another friendship or a relationship, dating relationship or friendship, whatever that was.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   There would be another explosion. And then rather than, you know, figure out what was going on in the midst of that explosion,
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   I would move on to another relationship. And I'll give you a picture of one, okay?
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   There was a summer that I actually worked in a neighboring town, Victoria, if you've heard of it.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   And so I would work there. I worked at Courtesy Car Wash.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   And rather than drive back and forth, I was about 30 minutes away, for the summer, I moved in with my friend and his mom.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   And I just lived with them that summer so that I could work there.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   And so he was my best friend. And some other friends were going to go to Schlitterbahn.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   If you don't know what that is, it's the closest thing to heaven on this planet.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   And so they were going to go to Schlitterbahn, and I wanted to go to Schlitterbahn.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   And so I, you know, and I invite my buddy who I'm living with, "Hey, you want to go to Schlitterbahn with us?"
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   Okay, and this is in high school. And I think we were juniors or seniors.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   And he's like, "No, man, I can't. You know, I don't have any money. I can't afford the ticket to get in."
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   And I'm like, "Oh, no, no worries, bro. You gave me a place. I'm banking up at Courtesy Car Wash. I got you. Okay?
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   No, you come. I will pay for your ticket. Man, I got you."
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   And he's like, "Really? You do that?" I was like, "Yeah, of course, man. You gave me a roof. Man, I got you. Let's go."
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   And so we all go to Schlitterbahn. Have an amazing time. Okay?
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   Uphill water coasters. Who knew? It was fantastic, this Schlitterbahn.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   And so towards the end of our wonderful time there, I see him go into the gift shop.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   All right? And I'm watching. And he comes out of the gift shop, and he's got a new Puka shell necklace.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   And I'm like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you doing?"
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   And he's like, "Well, I bought a necklace. Had a little shark tooth hanging down there in the middle."
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   I was like, "Say, idiot. I thought you didn't have any money."
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   And he's like, "Well, I didn't have money for a ticket in, but when I saw this necklace, I couldn't refuse."
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   You know, it's Puka shells. And I'm like, "No, no, no, no, bro. I paid. I paid for you to get in there.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   You had money. You're spending it on dumb necklaces? And right there in the parking lot of Schlitterbahn, it escalated.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   And you saw another explosion of JP's anger, and push came to shove, literally.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   And what happened was I never talked to him again.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   He very literally was like, "No, get your stuff out of my house."
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   And I called. No return phone call. I talked to his mom. "No, it's done, man."
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   I tried to embarrass him in that parking lot, and the truth is I succeeded.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   And it cost me a friend. And what's crazy, over a shark tooth Puka shell necklace.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   And I saw him years later. Now we're grown men, post-college, and we're at a party together, and it's still awkward.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   Because of a shark tooth necklace.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   "Hey, man. Hey. Wife and kids. Oh, yeah. Wife and kids. Yeah, yeah. Cool. You doing what? You still got the necklace? Okay. I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding."
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   And isn't that what conflict does? It causes these explosions in our life that sometimes we don't know exactly how to respond to?
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   See, explosions marked my life and cost me most of the relationships that I had.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   And you know what the common denominator was? It was me.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   It was me.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   And so my guess is this evening that some explosions marked your life.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   And so as we move through this series, Quarter Life Crisis, tonight we're talking about the crisis of conflict.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   The crisis of conflict.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   It is fun to watch these explosions from a distance, but it is not fun when you are a part of them.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   Like, I'll just give weight to what I just said. I remember when reality TV started, okay?
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   Like, there was no reality TV. Then all of a sudden there was the real world one.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   And it was like watching a train wreck of an explosion.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   You could not look away. And then all of a sudden, reality TV just exploded and everybody began to watch it.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   Why? Because we were entertained by these explosions.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   In fact, you know what makes reality TV wonderful?
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   Constant conflict. Constant conflict.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   Watching dysfunctional people not work through their problems.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   And we watch from afar.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   But the problem is, some of these explosions mark our lives.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   It marks our career.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   It marks our relationships.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   It marks our friendships.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   It marks families.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   It marks holidays.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   It marks roommate situations.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   If you don't know how to navigate through this, your life will end up looking like one big train wreck.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   One big explosion with a common denominator of you.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   And you will take it into marriage. You will take it into future season.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   You will take it into parenting.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   Do you know the number one, I read this, that one of, I'll just say the number one from this particular source,
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   the number one determiner of success in marriage is ability to resolve conflict.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   As Monica and I meet with people in premarital counseling,
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   they take a test called Prepare, it's a personality kind of profile,
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   and they grade you on your ability to resolve conflict.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   It's the first thing I look at.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   Because I know how hard they're going to have to work at marriage based on what that says.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   Their ability to resolve conflict is.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   What I am going to teach you tonight, friends,
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   I have traveled to Africa to teach the governments there with friends.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   Presidents, and I'm not exaggerating, presidents of foreign nations have traveled here to this property
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   to learn the very things that I am going to present you with this evening from the scriptures.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   If you apply this to your life, it will change your life for the better.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   This is huge stuff. You have to have this.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   So why do we put it in the quarter life crisis series?
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   Because as I look at the crises that people face in their 20s and 30s so often,
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   right at the center of it is an interpersonal conflict.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   An inability to get along with someone.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   A roommate, someone that has hurt you, a parent, a co-worker, a boss.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   And we have to understand what the scriptures say to this.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   So we have covered career, crisis of career, money crisis, selfie crisis, singleness crisis, authority crisis.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   Tonight we are going to talk about conflict crisis, which affects every relationship you have.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   And the path that I want to take you down this evening through the scriptures is a change in perspective.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   I want to give you a new perspective of conflict.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   In the middle, my second point will be a part to own.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   We are going to talk about your part in the conflict.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   And before you leave here this evening, I want to present to you a very practical path to peace.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   A path you can walk in to pursue peace.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   And so I'm going to be all throughout the scriptures.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   The Bible has a whole lot to say about this.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   But I will camp primarily in Matthew 5 if you want to turn there.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   It's the first book of the New Testament.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   Chapter 5. I'll also be in chapter 7 and eventually chapter 18.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   I will be in Ephesians 4.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   But if you just want to turn to one place, you can go to Matthew 5.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   It's the Sermon on the Mount.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   It is the greatest sermon ever preached.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   It was preached by King Jesus.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   And here he says in chapter 5, verse 21.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   "You have heard that it was said to the people long ago, 'You shall not murder.'
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   And anyone who murders will be subject to judgment."
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   Jesus is referencing the Old Testament Ten Commandments.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   The commandments that were given to Moses as he came down from the mountain.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   That were written with the finger of God.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   And one of them was, "Thou shalt not kill" or "Thou shalt not murder."
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   Jesus is saying to the people, "Hey, you've heard it said as he's preaching his sermon.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   Hey, you guys know you're not supposed to murder."
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   And so here at the Porsche today, 2014, we're nodding our head.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   Like, "Yeah, man, you just don't kill people. That's not good."
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   We don't kill people. Okay?
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   As followers of Jesus, we don't do that.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   That's like low-hanging fruit. Got it. Don't kill people.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   Okay? So, man, that's good. We're passing that test.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   Jesus says, "But I tell you that anyone who is angry with a brother or sister will be subject to judgment."
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   Okay, so I know I'm not supposed to kill, but if I get angry?
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   Again, anyone who says to a brother or sister, "Raca," which just literally translates "worthless."
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   So you're giving them a degrading term.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   You're trying to embarrass them.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   You're trying to make them feel less than human or less than you.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   "Anyone who says this is answerable to the court, and anyone who says you fool will be in danger of the fire of hell."
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   Whoa, Jesus.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   Okay, I got, like, "Okay, so don't take a gun, put it in someone's head, pull the trigger."
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   Okay, got that.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   You're telling me if I call somebody a fool, I'm in danger of the fires of hell?
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   That if there's anger in my heart, that I might be in dangers of hell?
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   Jesus is talking about a state of being.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   You walk around just angry.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   It can be evidence that you do not have his spirit.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   Jesus is telling you something very important.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   Your anger is an opportunity.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   It is an opportunity to be given to that you would respond with anger,
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   or it is an opportunity to honor God in the way that you handle or control your anger.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   He's talking about a response to anger.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   He says, "Hey, if you call someone a fool or you internalize that emotion,
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   maybe you don't say it, but you think it,"
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   He says, "you're guilty of murder."
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   You're guilty of an offense as grave as murder.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   And so being a Christ follower is retraining our response to anger by yielding to God's spirit.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   It is dependence that he wants from us.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   And so our problem, your and my problem this evening,
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   is that we see conflict as an opportunity to display our anger.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   "Oh, yeah? You want to do that? Oh, yeah?
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   Oh, you want to buy that chartreuse necklace?
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   Oh, it's like that, huh?
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   Oh, no, I'm going to show her. Oh, I'm going to show him.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   I'm going to tell him. Oh, I got a word for him."
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   And that's just not how followers of Jesus respond.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   Conflict is not an opportunity to display your anger.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   Conflict is an opportunity to bring our anger under the Spirit's control.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   And so my first point this evening is I want to talk about a perspective to change.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   I want to change your perspective of the way that you see conflict.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   I want you this evening to begin to see conflict as an opportunity to show who you are.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   Better said, to show who you belong to.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   Conflict is your greatest opportunity to show the world who is in control of you,
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   who is your master, who is your father.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   Let me show you from the Scriptures.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   It's the same chapter, verse 9, the Beatitudes.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God."
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   Who's children of God? Who is called God's children?
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   The peacemakers.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   You want to look like God.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   Like in the same way that my kids resemble a lot of me.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   I'm in the freakishly weird tall category.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   There's like normal tall and then there's weirdo tall.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   I'm in the weirdo tall category.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   So my little girl in first grade, she's also in the weirdo tall category.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   I can say that. I'm her daddy.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   Those kids say that. It's going to be conflict.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   But in the same way that she looks like me, we look like God in the way that we make peace.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   Not fake peace.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   The Scriptures are not calling you to be a peace faker.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   Someone who suppresses their anger.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   It's there, but you just don't let the world see it.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   You think you're not going to show the world?
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   It doesn't call you to be a peace breaker.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   These are people who walk around and there's just explosions everywhere.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   I can't wait to show you how angry I am.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   I'm going to give you a piece of my mind.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   Oh yeah? You just kind of have that attitude.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   Oh, you want to do that? I'm going to get the best of me.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   You know them. Don't nudge them right now.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   I see some of you.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   I'm looked down when I said that. It's safe.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   And so some of our greatest opportunities as believers to display our faith
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   and display who our God is, is conflict.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   We may not face real persecution in this day and age.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   We may not get the opportunity to show our faith in the midst of someone wanting to cut our head off
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   or putting us in prison.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   But in the midst of conflict, you have an incredible opportunity to show who your God is.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   And so all healthy relationships are marked by conflict.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   That might blow your mind.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   All healthy relationships are marked by conflict.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   I hear all the time, "We have a great relationship. We never have conflict."
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   That's not a relationship.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   That's not a real relationship.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   One of two things. Either it's a very new relationship
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   or it's a very surface-level relationship.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   But healthy relationships in this fallen world have conflict.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   That's just a fact.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   But unresolved conflict marks the lives of unhealthy people.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   If you go around and there is unresolved conflict,
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   there are these explosions that have not been mended.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   That marks the life of an unhealthy person.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   So let me just say this to you, that hard conversations are not fun.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   If you're here and you're a peace-maker, I know that hard conversations are not fun.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   They are also not optional.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   It's not something that you can choose not to do as a follower of Jesus.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   It is an opportunity that you cannot pass up.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   Ephesians 4, verse 3 says it like this,
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   "Make every effort," maybe yours says,
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   "be diligent at, work hard at, keeping the unity of the Spirit and the bond of peace."
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   This is what we do.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   See, anger drives a wedge between us, but we work hard to close that chasm.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   We work hard to close that gap between brothers and sisters or our peers.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   Whenever you are angry, this is what I want you to think about of your anger.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   Your anger is like a warning sign.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   Your anger is telling you, it is a bright red flashing light telling you there is a conflict to resolve.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   When you see that bright red flashing light, you can respond in a number of ways.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   It's just like a warning light on your dashboard.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   You're driving down the road, your temperature light goes off or something goes off,
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   telling you something, your check engine light, telling you something is wrong with the car.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   You can respond to that in a number of ways.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   One, you can ignore it.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   Two, you can fix the wrong things.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   You can go after the wrong things.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   If you're in anger, you're like, "I'm going to show them or I want to win.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   I want to show them how right I am or how wrong they are."
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   These are the wrong things.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   You're responding out of the flesh.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   Or you can respond in the Spirit and say, "I want to fix this.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   I want to, dependent on God's Spirit, bring peace here.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   I want to resolve this conflict."
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   What does it look like to respond in the Spirit?
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   It looks like being eager, by keeping short accounts,
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   like not letting the sun go down.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   Why? Why would you be eager to resolve, to close that gap?
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   Because that's someone Jesus died for.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   That's someone God made.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   That's one of his, the Scriptures say, that's one of his masterpieces.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   A child of God, whom you have a problem with.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   God desires you to pursue peace.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   Ephesians 4, verse 26 says, "In your anger, do not sin."
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   So as you're angry, anger is the warning sign.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   In that anger, do not sin. Respond in the Spirit, not in the flesh.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   And do not let the sun go down while you're still angry.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   Be eager to close that gap.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   Be eager to pursue reconciliation.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   Matthew 5, now, back in the Scriptures, says it like this.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   "Therefore, if you are offering your gift at the altar,
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   "and there remember that your brother or sister has something against you,
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   "leave your gift there in front of the altar.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   "First go and be reconciled to them, then come and offer your gift."
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   What is going on here?
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   This is in the old time, if we were seeking, or in this day, the first century,
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   if we were seeking God's forgiveness, we might bring an offering to the altar,
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   saying, "God, would you forgive me? Here's a sin offering."
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   And God's saying, "Hey, I don't want your sin offering until you've asked their forgiveness."
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   You take that, you leave that there, but you run now.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   It says, "Run and go and be reconciled to your brother."
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   If someone has something against you, you run.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   Do you know what this means?
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   This is what this means. Some of you shouldn't be here next Tuesday.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   Next Tuesday, you need to be on a plane flying home,
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   saying, "Hey, man, I forgive you for buying that shark tooth necklace."
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   Oh, that's just me.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   Some of you have something, right? There's someone that has something against you.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   And you know it. You're sitting here, and you're like, "Man, I know.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   I know that I did that the wrong way. I know I should have never said that to them.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   They don't know they're God that I worship.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   They don't know that I'm a child of the creator of the heavens and the earth.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   I need to go and sit in front of them and ask their forgiveness."
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   It's like, "Stop singing Shane and Shane songs.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   Stop singing worship, and run and be reconciled to your brother.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   Like, don't sing, 'Hey, God, I love you.' No, no, no. Run."
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   I said, "I'm so sorry.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   I've been worshiping God in vain because I realize there's been an infraction here that I haven't mended,
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   and you have this against me."
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   And so this is the part to own.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   My second point this evening is a part to own.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   What is the part you need to own?
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   And it's simply this. It's your part.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   You have to own your part.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   Let me say this. If you are a part of the conflict, you have a part in the conflict.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   And it's really hard to get your mind around, because you might be sitting there,
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   "No, you don't understand. They dated my ex.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   They slept with them while I was dating.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   They used my toothbrush without asking me.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   They said something about me behind my back.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   They ruined your name. I don't care if they walked up and they punched you in the face."
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   You determine, "Hey, what is my mind to own?"
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   Maybe you sinned in your anger.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   Maybe you had a conversation in the car.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   "Oh, yeah, you want to do that? I can't wait."
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   Maybe you're just sitting there getting all worked up in the shower.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   No one else is there, but you're just having this dialogue, going back and forth.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   And you can start with that.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   "Hey, you know what? You know what? Before we go any further, I just want you to know,
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   man, I've been having this conversation with you in my head.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   I've called you some really ugly things. No one else heard me.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   But up here, I've been saying some awful things about you, and I want to ask your forgiveness for that.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   That does not display who is my God."
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   You start there.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   "Hey, I want to start by owning my part in this conflict."
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   But the problem is anger blinds you.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   When you are angry, you can't see your part.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   You can only see their part.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   You can only see their part.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   And so what happens is you want to lash out.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   But before you lash out, I want you to look inward.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   When you see that bright red flashing signal,
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   instead of lashing out, you look inward and say, "Hey, what is my part in this?"
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   What is my part in this?
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   Because when you begin to escalate in your mind and in your heart,
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   you sinned already.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   You're already in sin.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   You already have something that you can own, and you can start right there.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   Let me read to you from the Scriptures.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   Luke 27, verse 3.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   "Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother's eye
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye?
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   How can you say to your brother, 'Let me take the speck out of your eye,'
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   when all the time there is a plank of wood, a two-by-four,
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   sitting in your own eye, you hypocrite?
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   First take the plank out of your own eye,
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye."
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   See, anger, when you're angry, you can't see their fault.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   You can't see your own fault.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   You can only see their fault.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   You can't see the two-by-four sticking out of your forehead.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   You can only see the flake of sawdust in their eye.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   And so you have something to own,
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   and the challenge here from the Scriptures is for you to find it.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   Stop thinking about what they did and start thinking about what you did.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   And so what does that look like for me in Schlitterbahn?
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   It looks like, "Hey, bro, man, I know I paid your way in,
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   and I want to ask your forgiveness because there were clearly strings attached to that ticket.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   I had some expectations that I did not express to you that you did not meet.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   My expectations upon you is that you would not have spent any money
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   because you told me you didn't have money for the ticket,
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   and that's an unfair expectation because I never told you that.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   So much of your conflict is an unmet expectation.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   So much of the conflict that you experience is some expectation that you put on someone else
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   that they did not meet for you.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   And so you can start there, "Hey, I had an expectation of you that was not fair.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   It was not fair in that I did not express it to you.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   It was not clear that that was my expectation.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   You never agreed to meet that expectation, and I'm sorry.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   But not only am I sorry, will you forgive me?"
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   There's power in those three words, "Will"--four words--"will you forgive me?"
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   Okay? Learn those four words.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   "Will you forgive me?"
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   Not, "I want to ask your forgiveness." Good, I'm glad you want to. Do it.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   Not, "I'm sorry." You are sorry. Yes, you are.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   "Will you forgive me?
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   Will you please forgive me?" Five words now.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   It's funny, when you're a student in high school,
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   those relationships, they just seem different. There's a different depth there.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   But man, I was a believer. I was on staff at a church.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   Teaching the Word of God, my best buddy was also on staff at a church, senior pastor.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   He discipled me. We sat down. We went through systematic theology together.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   We met once a week. We traveled together. We vacationed together.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   A really, really, really dear friend of mine I had placed on a pedestal in my life
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   as someone who had discipled me and shepherded me, someone who I really looked up to.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   And in the midst of that, he began to make some decisions,
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   specifically financial decisions that I began to question.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   And at one particular phone call--this is my best friend--
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   as I'm questioning these decisions as an adult, as grown men,
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   I began to call him things.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   And so I believe to this day that questioning those decisions was the right thing.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   Now, he wasn't doing anything--he wasn't stealing money.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   I just didn't think he was spending it wisely as a pastor.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   I didn't think he was above reproach in what he was doing.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   And so what I told him in a moment of explosive anger is I said,
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   "It's like you're a prosperity preacher."
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   Those words came out of my mouth.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   To which the phone call ended, to which I did not talk to him again for years.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   And I pursued him, and I texted him, and I wrote him letters,
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   and I called him, and I left him voicemails, and I begged his forgiveness on voicemails.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   I told him I was sorry. I said it was a moment of anger.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   But again, this explosion had cost me a relationship now
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   that as an adult hurt very badly.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   Very badly. And I began to resent him.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   How could he write us off that fast?
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   Like, clearly, I was delusioned in what I thought the friendship we had was.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   That he could just end it like that.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   Like, are you serious? Like, you're just going to go your separate ways?
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   You're going to throw me that in the Bible? Where is that in--
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   "Be diligent in preserving the unity of the Spirit in the body of Christ."
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   Haven't you taught that? Haven't you stood up here and preached that message?
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   Where is that in Matthew 18, Matthew 5, Matthew 7?
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   And that's what was going on in my heart.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   And what did that do? It just drove the wedge bigger.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   Bigger and bigger.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   I continued to call, I continued to text, I continued to write.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   To which one text he responded and said, "I will meet."
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   God brought him back to Dallas. We met.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   Sat there.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   And the first thing I said, I said, "Bro, thank you for meeting me.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   "Will you please forgive me?
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   "When I said that, I said exactly this, I know what I said.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   "I should not have said that.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   "I spoke from a place of anger.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   "And will you please forgive me?"
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   To which he said, "Well, I didn't expect that."
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   Which was odd to me because I had said that so many times via text, via email, via phone.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   And I said again, "Will you please forgive me?"
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   To which he said, "Yes, I forgive you."
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   And then he said, "I think you're waiting for me to ask your forgiveness."
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   I said, "You know what, bro? I forgive you.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   "I no longer hold any debt that you've caused in my life against you."
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   And he said, "I'm not ready to ask that yet."
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   I said, "You don't need to."
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   And so many would say, "Hey, that wasn't peace. That didn't look like peace."
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   You know what, I got in the car and I had peace, man.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   Because as long as it was up to me, I lived at peace with my brother.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   And that's it. You focus on your part. On your part.
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   And by the Spirit of God, we'll give you strength to move on, to step forward.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   You focus on what you can do.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   It doesn't always go well, but as long as it is up to you,
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   the Scripture says, you live at peace with your brother.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   Being diligent at preserving the unity of the Spirit and the bond of peace.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   Making every effort to do so.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   It says in verse 25,
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   "Settle matters quickly with your adversary who is taking you to court.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   "Do it while you are still together on the way."
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   This is Matthew chapter 5, verse 25.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   "Settle matters quickly with your adversary who is taking you to court.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   "Do it while you are still on the way to court."
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   As you're still on the way, and it goes on to say,
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   "Or else there will be greater consequences. The consequences will grow.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   "The consequences will escalate. Settle matters quickly."
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   Now what's interesting is when people are on their way to court,
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   they're not thinking about settling matters, they're thinking about winning.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   That's whenever somebody goes to court, they're thinking about,
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   "Hey, I want to win. I want to show them. I want to get the best of them."
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   And the Scripture says, "No, you are not concerned with winning
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   "because when you're concerned with winning in conflict, you lose."
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   Let me say that again.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   When you are concerned with winning in conflict, you've already lost.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   Okay? This is the mark, this is a mark of a mature believer.
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   You are not concerned with winning, you are concerned with peace, which is different.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   You are not concerned with being right because then you're already wrong.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   You're concerned with pursuing and preserving peace
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   on the way to the matter, being eager, being diligent.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   Here's what I want to show you, that conflict is a crossroad.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   When you are in conflict with someone, you are at a "why."
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   There is two directions you can go.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   You can move towards a broken relationship, you can cause a fraction which grows over time.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   It just gets weirder and more awkward.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   You can pretend like it's not there, but it is.
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   Or you can take the path of peace.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   The path that is worthy to pursue, the path of peace.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   That's my third point this evening, a path to pursue.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   The path to pursue is peace.
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   I'm going to walk you through a very practical verse.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   I want you to turn to Matthew 18 in your Bibles.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   I want you to underline this, I want you to circle it.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   This is something you want to know and live by.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   It is a process we call the Matthew 18 process or Matthew 18 principle.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   Here it is, verse 15.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   "If your brother or sister sins against you, go and point out their fault, just between the two of you.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   If they listen, you have won them over.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   But if they will not listen, step two, take one or two brothers along,
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   so that every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   If they still refuse to listen, step three, tell it to the church.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   And if they refuse to listen to even the church, step four,
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   treat them as you would a pagan or a tax collector."
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   It starts out, step one, let's go now slowly through this.
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   I'm going to camp on step one for just a minute,
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   because most conflicts are resolved right here at step one.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   If your brother sins against you or your sister sins against you,
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   if you feel anger towards someone, you go to that someone.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   Without talking to anyone else, you go directly to them and say,
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   "I am here to resolve this conflict."
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   Should you pursue every conflict? Is everything wrong?
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   If they put a door ding in your car or accidentally stepped on your toe,
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   do you pursue every conflict that way? No, you don't.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   The scriptures say that it is a person's wisdom yields patience.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   It is one's glory to overlook an offense.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   So if you can overlook an offense, you should.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   How do I know if I can overlook offense? Because you can.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   If you can move on and not think about it, not have the conversation in your head,
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   then you can overlook it.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   Let me tell you like this.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   When I eat something bad, it begins to gurgle in my stomach.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   I know, usually, I know if that's going to go away and I'm going to be okay
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   or if that's coming back up.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   Like if it just doesn't sit right, like I eat something, it just doesn't sit right,
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   and I'm sitting there and I'm like, "Man, this thing just doesn't sit right."
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   I usually know, "Man, I'm going to be all right," or, "No, no, no.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   This is coming back up."
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   And conflict is the same way.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   You sit there and you're like, "Oh, yeah. You know what?
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   I think I can overlook that," or, "You know what?
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   I'm going to have conversations in my head.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   I'm going to get in the car. I'm going to get spun up.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   I think this is going to come back up in my life.
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   I think I'm going to continue to think about this."
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   And so just be eager then.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   Before the sun sets, run and be reconciled to brother.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   Leave your gift there. Run to them.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   "Hey, when you did this, it hurt me.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   Can I just tell you something?
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   When you said that it hurt me, I heard this and it hurt me."
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   And I want to give you the opportunity to bring clarity to it.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   Maybe what I heard wasn't true.
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   I want to give you the benefit of the doubt.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   Can we talk about this because I heard it and it hurt me.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   And so should you talk to someone else?
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   Sometimes it looks like, "Hey, Shane, let me talk to you for a second.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   David, the other day did this, and I just don't know.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   Should I go back and tell him about that?
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   I just don't know if I should or if I shouldn't."
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   And I just was thinking because I couldn't believe he said that.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   "Okay, is it okay? I just want to vet this with you.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   I just want to talk to you. I just want some wise counsel.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   Hey, will you just pray for me and David because David did this really stupid thing the other day.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   Will you just pray about it? Is that okay?"
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   No, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   What you just did is you just invited someone else in.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   So if somebody comes to you and says, "Hey, can I just talk to you for a second?
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   Man, stupid over there did something stupid," because that's what stupid does, right?
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   "And would you just pray for stupid?"
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   And I'm not talking about David now, David. We're not stupid.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   "But would you just pray for stupid because I just can't believe it?"
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   And you know what? You just say, "Oh, you know what, man?
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   Hey, you need to go talk to stupid
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   because what you just did is you just painted my picture of them.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   You just influenced my perception of them.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   And man, I didn't ask for that.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   You need to go talk to him, and by the way, if you don't, I will."
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   So we--oh, no, no, I'll talk to him. When?
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   Man, just when I see him, I'll talk to him. No, no, how about this?
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   Because you came to me with eagerness, how about you go to them with eagerness?
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   How about I say 24 hours? How about I call them tomorrow,
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   and I'm going to ask them if you've talked to them?
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   And if you haven't, then I'm going to tell them. I'm going to say, "Hey, this is what you said.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   It's just so I'm clean."
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   You know what that does?
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   It makes this a really unsafe place for gossip.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   Can I just tell you something?
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   This is a really unsafe place for gossip
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   because now you've all been trained to do that.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   Somebody comes to you, "Hey, man, you wouldn't believe what stupid did."
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   Oh, man, I don't want to believe it, and let's just go talk to stupid right now.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   Okay?
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   And could you imagine if the church was a really unsafe place for gossip?
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   Hey, you need to help make the church a really unsafe place for gossip.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   Hey, you have 24 hours.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   You go, and you be eager before the sun sets, it says.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   Before the sun goes down, you go, and you tell them.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   And so if they refuse, now, step two,
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   if they listen to you, awesome, praise God, right?
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   You're there. You're trying to seek to understand.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   You don't know everything. You don't know everything that went on,
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   so you go there all by yourself.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   Hey, you run to them, "Hey, when you did this, it hurt me. I want to give you the benefit of the doubt."
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   I want to seek to understand why you did that.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   I want to understand why you did that.
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   That's step one, okay?
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   And if they listen to you, you've won them over, praise God.
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   If they don't, then you go, and you invite somebody back in.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   And so when you go to step one, you've now stepped in the ring,
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   not to fight, but to work out the conflict.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   So this ring right now represents the area of which we're going to resolve the conflict.
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   Now, what I don't do is I don't carry the conflict outside the ring.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   I don't go and circle up people, okay?
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   I don't conspire against you.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   No, if we're going to fight, quote unquote, we're going to fight in the ring.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   And so what I'm going to do now is I'm going to go and grab somebody else,
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   and I'm going to bring them in the ring with you.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   And if there's other people, the only people who are going to be in the ring
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   is people who are part of the problem or a part of the solution.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   Nobody else. I don't need to vet. I don't need to get wise counsel.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   I don't need to think about it. I don't need to have prayer requests, okay?
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   I'm going to bring anybody who I think is a part of the solution into this room,
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   and we're going to work through it.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   So now I'm leaving. Hey, you didn't listen.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   So I'm leaving, and I'm going to go find some others.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   Hey, listen, so-and-so and I are in a conflict.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   Would you please come with me as I go back to them?
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   I'm now at stage two of Matthew 18 principle.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   Would you please go with me and just kind of mediate and observe?
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   And if there's anything in me that I'm missing, would you show me that?
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   Hey, would you come?
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   Now you bring one or two people with you back into the circle,
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   and you tell them, "Hey, I want to tell you again.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   When you purchased that necklace, it hurt me.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   Here's why. Here's my part in it.
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   I'm eager to come to you.
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   I want to keep short accounts. I want to overlook a small offense,
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   but this I've just been sitting on. It hasn't sit well with me.
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   I want to tell you again."
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   And now somebody's watching.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   And if they say, "Hey, man, get out of here. I don't want to work it out."
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   Now, you leave, and you get to church.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   Someone in a position of authority in the church, you say,
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   "Hey, would you guys come with me and mediate this conversation?
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   I'm now at step three of Matthew 18 principle, and I need to tell them now."
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   And this is why we talked about last week, it's so important to be under the authority of the church.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   So now your brother or sister who has sinned against you,
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   you bring the church into that conversation.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   You step into the place where you're going to resolve the conflict with the church,
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   and you say, "Hey, I want to present this to you again. You have hurt me."
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   And I mean you do this every time.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   And you've got to be sitting out there like, "Does this really happen?"
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   Eighty percent of what our staff does is that.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   So you want to know, you know, if you're tithing to church,
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   if it's going to good resources as it pays our salaries,
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   80% of what we do as a staff is resolve conflict.
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   Is that time well spent? You better believe it is.
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   Because the scripture says, "Work hard at preserving unity of the spirit and the bond of peace."
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   And so 80% of what we do as a staff is resolve conflict,
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   which means 100% of what we do as a staff is make disciples.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   Because we're showing you how to yield to the spirit.
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   When you are angry as a follower of Jesus Christ, you have a greater force within you.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   That is God. God is going with you.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   And God will help you not to give in to that anger or display that anger,
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   but to bring that anger under His control so that He can do something righteous.
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   This, if you apply it to your life, it will save your relationships.
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   It will change your life. It will save your marriage.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   It will change the way you parent and everything moving forward.
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   It's simple, and you do this every time.
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   Every time it's necessary.
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   And so then, step four.
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   If they refuse to listen to the church now, you treat them as you would a pagan,
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   which is just a word for a non-believer, someone who is not a Christian.
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   You treat them as you would a pagan or a tax collector.
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   Now, some of you are like, "Oh yeah, now here we go.
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   Like a pagan." No, no, no, no.
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   How do we treat pagans?
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   We love them. How did Jesus treat pagans and tax collectors?
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   He loved them. We treat them wisely.
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   We understand that they are not controlled by the same spirit that we are,
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   and so we may not partner with them in business.
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   We may not be in a position where we let them hurt us again,
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   so we treat them wisely.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   And then thirdly, and most importantly, we share the gospel with them.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   We assume they do not know our God, and so we tell them,
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   "Hey, do you know the God who has resolved all conflict?
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   Do you know how God resolved conflict?
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   Did He hold what you did against Him? Have you done anything against God?"
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   Let me ask again, because I-- "Have you done anything against God?"
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   Oh my goodness. Nod your head up and down.
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   Have you done anything against God?
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   Friends, you have done a lot against God.
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   If you don't think so, then you've got self-righteousness against God, okay?
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   You've got grave sins against God. Do you know how He handled those?
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   He said, "I'll pay for them. I no longer hold your sins against you.
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   This is how I resolve conflict.
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   My Son dies and washes away all of your sins.
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   I show you that I can defeat death so that you can be with me forever.
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   I will do anything. I will go to great lengths to close the chasm of conflict between us,
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   including sending my only Son to die for your sins
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   so that you can be with me forever. This is the gospel.
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   And that is what you represent as you move towards somebody who has hurt you.
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   Hey, I'm not going to let you keep hurting me, okay?
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   But I want you to know my God. Can I tell you what He's done for you?"
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   And at step four, you share the gospel.
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   Peace is so powerful, man.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   Can you imagine being able to move and insert peace into any situation?
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   It's so counterintuitive to respond towards peace when you're angry.
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   But the fruit of the Spirit is peace. It's what the Spirit produces inside of us.
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   And so in summary, a new perspective is to see conflict as an opportunity.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   This starts with you owning your part, being eager, owning your part, and overlooking small offenses.
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   And thirdly, the path that you pursue is outlined here in Matthew 18.
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   So follow it, tell it, preach it, live according to it.
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   In this, man, I've seen wives sit before a woman who slept with their husband and forgive them.
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   Yielded to the Spirit. I've seen husbands talk to wives who cheated on them and forgive them, and vice versa.
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   I've seen crazy situations. I've seen those who were abused sexually sit in front of their abuser and say,
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   "I forgive you by the power of God that lives in me. I am no longer at conflict with you.
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   I will no longer carry this burden, this weight with me throughout my life.
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   This dark cloud will no longer exist over me. I forgive you."
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   But I will tell you that some of the most amazing conflict resolutions I've seen
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   are simply roommates that just got into it and hated each other.
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   I'm talking just young adults or friends that just got sideways and one just exploded in anger
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   and caused a deep hurt, which caused them to cause another deep hurt, deep hurt, deep hurt, back and forth.
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   And now there's just this huge chasm, and they come together, and one person yielded to the Spirit of God
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   who responds bigger and says, "I no longer want to hurt you.
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   In the same way that God forgave my hurts in Christ, I want to forgive you.
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   This is what I believe my part is in this.
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   Will you please forgive me first and foremost before we go any further for my part in this?"
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   And I have seen God do incredible things when people respond to conflict in how they were trained.
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   I want you to watch a video. We'll end with this.
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   It's a video a friend showed me this week of an explosion that was caused by someone else.
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   And I want you to see how someone responded.
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   And so watch closely. Watch their first response and then their second response.
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   And I want you to listen to what is said about them, if you would. Watch this.
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   I want you to hear that.
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   I want you to hear that.
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   He started out at first, he responded as a victim.
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   He ran from the explosion.
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   He didn't want anything to do with the explosion.
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   When you experience the explosion of conflict, you feel like a victim.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   Man, something has been done to me. I've been hurt. I'm a victim.
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   But then it says, "His training kicked in."
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   And so then, after you realize, "Hey, I'm not a victim.
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   Man, I am a child of God. I'm a peacemaker.
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   I'm blessed by God who I'm going to be with forever
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   because of his purchasing me through the blood of Jesus Christ.
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   I now, him with me, we have the power to go and bring peace to this situation."
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   Your training kicks in and you run back to that situation.
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   And you say, "You know what? I want to bring resolve to this explosion.
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   I want to save you and save me and save our relationship from this explosion."
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   Let me ask you a question. Anybody watch that and think, "Man, what an idiot.
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:21.000]   Some drunk guy hit the thing."
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   Anybody think he was drunk? I'll confess to you.
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   I watched that the first time. I'm like, "Dude, he must have been a drunk guy."
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   And then you find out it's a 70-year-old man in diabetic shock, and you feel stupid.
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   And it's just like conflict. We assume we know everything.
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   "Oh, I assume I know why that explosion caused it."
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   And then you go there and you're like, "Oh, man. Oh, you thought I said that?
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   Oh, my goodness. I'm so sorry. Will you please forgive me?
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   That is not what I meant. That's not what I meant to say.
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   That's not how I meant to represent myself. This is what I meant."
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   We think we know everything. We think we're so smart.
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   Hey, God wants you to work hard at pursuing peace.
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.000]   Can I tell you something?
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   As we sing this song, and the Shanes and the band are going to come up,
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:13.000]   there are people in your life that you need to forgive.
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:18.000]   And as we worship together, you need to know who those people are.
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:22.000]   And then some of you, man, some of you, you need to leave quietly during this song,
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   and you need to go and pursue peace.
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:30.000]   As someone has something against you, you need to run to them before the sun sets.
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:33.000]   And you need to go and beg their forgiveness.
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:36.000]   You know that they have a grievance against you.
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   You might need to purchase a plane ticket.
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   You might need to go get a bus fare or something,
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   but you need to go and be reconciled to your brother.
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:47.000]   My prayer for the rest of us, and really all of us,
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   is that we would live according to these principles.
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   That peace would mark our life.
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:56.000]   You would no longer take pride in being bad or angry.
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:59.000]   You would now be controlled by the Spirit of God.
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:03.000]   Because if you are given to anger, it is a mark that the Spirit may not be--
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:05.000]   it is a mark that the Spirit's not in you.
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   I'll just say it like that. It's like Jesus says it.
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   Okay?
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   It's something worthy of thinking about.
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   Let me pray.
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:18.000]   Father, we love you, and just thank you that you love us enough to tell us these truths.
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:22.000]   Tell us how we can be with you forever,
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:24.000]   through your grace, your pursuit of us.
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:26.000]   As we have a conflict against you,
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   you ran after us and you chased us because you love us.
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   That's why I pray my friends would know right now how they are loved by you.
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.000]   And Lord, some of us, we're scared to death,
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:40.000]   because we feel right now that there's someone we're supposed to pursue reconciliation with,
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:42.000]   and we're supposed to mend this relationship,
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   and we're like, "How can we do that?"
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:46.000]   Would you remind them that you will go with them?
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:49.000]   That you're going to go with them into that explosion.
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:52.000]   That you're going to protect them from that explosion.
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:57.000]   You're going to give them the words to say in the midst of that explosion.
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:59.000]   Father, thank you that you are always with us.
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:03.000]   You say that you will never leave us, and you will not forsake us.
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:07.000]   Father, thank you that you have closed the chasm between you and us.
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:09.000]   In Jesus' name.
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:14.000]   I think for a lot of us this evening, the only thing that you need to hear,
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   or I'll say the biggest thing you need to hear,
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:20.000]   is that God has closed the gap between you and him.
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   He's closed the chasm.
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   And he did that with the death and the resurrection of his son.
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:29.000]   You've got to be here asking, "Why did Jesus have to die?"
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   Maybe you're wrestling with who God is.
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:32.000]   Start with Jesus.
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:36.000]   2014 years ago, something happened to reset time.
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:37.000]   It started over.
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:39.000]   Why did he have to die?
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:45.000]   He had to die so that you and God could be in relationship again.
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:48.000]   Because your sin was between you and God.
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:50.000]   And that sin went on Jesus.
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:51.000]   Jesus died.
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:53.000]   He paid the penalty.
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:54.000]   He paid the consequence.
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:57.000]   He paid the price for that sin.
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   So that you can be God's again.
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.000]   So that you can be his child.
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:02.000]   So that you can be with him forever.
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:04.000]   You're not going to be with him forever because you're good.
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:07.000]   You're not going to be with him forever because you read the Bible or you prayed a lot.
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   Or you were in a small group or a member of a church.
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:14.000]   You're going to be with him forever because Jesus Christ died for you and raised from the dead.
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:16.000]   You need to know that.
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:18.000]   If you don't know that, we'd love to wrestle with that truth with you.
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   Or if you have questions about that, we'd love to talk to you.
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:24.000]   Every single week, praise God, someone has questions about that.
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:29.000]   And it is our greatest joy and honor to talk with you about those questions.
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:30.000]   So please come up here.
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   We'd love to do that.
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:33.000]   Okay.
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:43.000]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
