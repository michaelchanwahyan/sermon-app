1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,420
 (soft music)

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:04,840
 (soft music)

3
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:32,540
 - All right, all right, how we doing?

4
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:33,380
 Come on.

5
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,160
 Come on, start a new series.

6
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,340
 Great to be with you, Dallas, Fort Worth, Houston,

7
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:40,480
 wherever you're at listening.

8
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,300
 So excited to be at the porch this evening.

9
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:47,260
 And so in the month of April,

10
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:50,820
 my family and I, we fasted from sweets,

11
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,160
 from all sorts of desserts.

12
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,380
 That means no cake, no candy, no pie,

13
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:59,580
 no anything that is remotely would resemble a dessert.

14
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:01,820
 And so my kids are not excited about this.

15
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,700
 There was one exception.

16
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:07,060
 We just said, hey, unless we're celebrating something,

17
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:09,100
 okay, so if they go to a birthday party

18
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,700
 or we were celebrating something,

19
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,400
 we, you could have a dessert.

20
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,700
 And so I don't know if you knew this,

21
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,380
 but April 2nd is International Children's Book Day.

22
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:20,980
 I didn't know that till I Googled it needing any, no.

23
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:24,060
 But so, no, unless you were celebrating something,

24
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,040
 we couldn't have dessert.

25
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,940
 And so at the end of April, my little girl Finley,

26
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:30,620
 her soccer season is over.

27
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:32,300
 And so we go to the last game

28
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,100
 and then there's this party afterwards.

29
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,980
 And so as we move to the party,

30
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,700
 we're, you know, the kids are like,

31
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:39,860
 hey, daddy, can we have a dessert?

32
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:43,460
 Can we have cake or whatever's gonna be there?

33
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:46,620
 And I said, yes, everybody can have, you know, one dessert.

34
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:49,660
 And so we get in there, we go into the restaurant,

35
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,300
 we kind of have this back room reserved

36
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,180
 and the kids walk past the mints.

37
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,980
 Mints are always the moral dilemma of this deal.

38
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,420
 Like, 'cause it's like a mint,

39
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,580
 it kind of serves a purpose, it freshens your breath.

40
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,180
 Is it really candy, is it not?

41
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,980
 It's almost like medicine of sorts.

42
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:08,260
 You know, and so we decided early on, no mints, okay?

43
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:10,380
 That's a dessert, that's a sweet, that's a candy.

44
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,780
 And so we go to the back room

45
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,620
 and my son had grabbed a mint.

46
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,980
 He grabbed one, Weston, my three-year-old.

47
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,820
 And he says, daddy, can I have this?

48
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,500
 And I said, no, you know, we're gonna have,

49
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,020
 and I saw they were serving cupcakes.

50
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,500
 So we're gonna have, you're gonna have a cupcake.

51
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,820
 Everybody's gonna get cupcakes, it'll be awesome.

52
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:30,180
 And yay for cupcakes, you know?

53
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,540
 And he goes, but daddy, I want the mint.

54
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,740
 And I'm like, no, no, no, no, we're gonna have cupcakes.

55
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,980
 In just a minute, they're gonna bring out cupcake.

56
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:39,260
 I've seen them, red, white, and blue, amazing cupcakes,

57
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,900
 sprinkles on top, incredible.

58
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:41,940
 They're coming out.

59
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:44,380
 And he goes, but daddy, I want the mint.

60
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,780
 I said, Weston, if you have the mint,

61
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:47,860
 you can't have a cupcake.

62
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:48,940
 I'm getting frustrated now.

63
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:51,100
 I'm like, don't you understand, it's cupcake.

64
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:53,900
 He goes, but I want the mint.

65
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,620
 And so I level with him.

66
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,780
 I get down on his level, kneel beside him.

67
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:01,700
 Son, he's holding this little bitty Lifesaver mint.

68
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:05,460
 I'm like, son, you don't want the mint.

69
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,900
 They're bringing cupcakes, bro.

70
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,500
 Now you, you traveling?

71
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:13,820
 Like if you eat this mint, you cannot have a cupcake.

72
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,100
 You can get one dessert, that's the rules.

73
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,040
 We're celebrating Finley's soccer team.

74
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,560
 You get one dessert, if you eat the mint,

75
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,540
 you can't get a cupcake.

76
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,460
 He says, I want the mint.

77
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,620
 I said, you're gonna take the mint.

78
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,100
 You're gonna put it in your mouth.

79
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,860
 And you're not, everybody's gonna get a cupcake.

80
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:28,780
 Everybody's gonna be happy.

81
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,940
 It's gonna be a celebration.

82
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,260
 And you're not gonna have a cupcake

83
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,100
 'cause you ate your mint.

84
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:32,940
 That's what you want.

85
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,300
 He said, yes.

86
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,300
 Can I have the mint?

87
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,140
 Sure.

88
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:38,380
 Sure.

89
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:41,400
 I've spelled it out for you.

90
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,060
 Rips it open, throws it in his mouth,

91
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,460
 instantly bites into it, because who can resist

92
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,300
 biting into a mint?

93
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,120
 I can't.

94
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,320
 I'm always like, I'm not gonna bite into it this time.

95
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,160
 Yes, I do.

96
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,380
 And so he bites into it, takes the mint down,

97
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:56,240
 like chews up, 30 seconds, daddy, I want a cupcake.

98
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,820
 (congregation laughing)

99
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,180
 No, buddy.

100
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,620
 No, you're not getting a cupcake.

101
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,780
 So they bring out the delicious cupcakes.

102
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,480
 Everybody gets a cupcake.

103
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,460
 Weston's screaming his head off 'cause he didn't get it.

104
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:09,540
 And I'm like, buddy, I told you this was going to happen.

105
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,300
 You had a choice.

106
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,100
 And you know what you chose?

107
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,460
 Do you know what he chose?

108
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:17,360
 He chose not to trust his father.

109
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,060
 That's what he chose.

110
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:24,540
 He chose not to trust a good daddy.

111
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:29,540
 He chose his desires over his father's instruction.

112
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:33,900
 And you and I do the exact same thing.

113
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,340
 You did it today.

114
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,740
 We did it this week.

115
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:41,060
 We do the exact same thing.

116
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:46,060
 We trust our desires over a loving father's instruction.

117
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,180
 And so this is the question we're starting with.

118
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:51,900
 Do you trust your father or do you trust your desires

119
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,300
 in decisions?

120
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,120
 Because we have the same choice.

121
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,620
 Do we want to have one more drink?

122
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:03,840
 Are we going to go too far again?

123
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,140
 Are we going to return to that muddy puddle of pornography?

124
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:14,340
 Or go back to the mall to do some coping and shopping?

125
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,900
 Are we going to continue to entertain the thoughts

126
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,800
 of that guy that doesn't belong to us?

127
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,020
 Are we going to continue to do these things

128
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:23,860
 that we can't stop doing?

129
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,740
 Are we going to continue to talk about people

130
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:26,580
 behind their back?

131
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,200
 Are we going to continue to gossip?

132
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,160
 Or are we going to trust our father?

133
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,860
 We have the same choice that Weston had.

134
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:36,740
 And there are little choices that you are making

135
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:41,660
 in this season that are bringing about death in your life.

136
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:45,420
 They are costing you the life that God has for you

137
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:47,820
 and the really difficult thing is just like Weston,

138
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,620
 you cannot see them.

139
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:55,220
 You need help, we need help seeing these things.

140
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,940
 And so tonight we're going to look at a choice

141
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,780
 that was like this but someone else made it

142
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:03,300
 and it cost all of us greatly.

143
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,700
 In fact, it's costing us tonight.

144
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,400
 So we're moving through this series,

145
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,100
 beginning this series rather called BC.

146
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,180
 It just stands for Before Christ.

147
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,460
 We could have called it OT.

148
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:12,900
 We could have called it Old Testament.

149
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,140
 We're telling you some ancient stories,

150
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:19,580
 literal historical narratives that actually happened.

151
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,820
 We're looking in the lives of people

152
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:25,020
 and tonight we're starting at the very beginning,

153
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:29,500
 the invention, the creation of humanity if you will.

154
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,540
 And so we're looking at the story of Adam and Eve.

155
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,180
 What went wrong in Eden?

156
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,940
 That's where we'll be tonight if you want to turn

157
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:38,840
 to Genesis chapter one, two and three.

158
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,340
 That is where we'll be.

159
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:42,780
 And so to set this up, God made everything.

160
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:45,360
 In Genesis chapter one, it's the creation story,

161
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,240
 seven days all together.

162
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,660
 Genesis chapter two, camps in creation day six

163
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:55,480
 and really explores this again in a larger fashion.

164
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,740
 It tells you more about the lives of Adam and Eve.

165
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:00,460
 So it's the same story, Genesis one, Genesis two,

166
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:03,280
 same story told in a different way,

167
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,860
 in a different order if you will.

168
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,540
 And so that's kind of how that goes

169
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,780
 and then we'll go into Genesis chapter three.

170
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:12,340
 And so in chapter one, God made it

171
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:15,500
 or God said it, it was and it was good.

172
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,060
 This is the pattern we see in chapter one.

173
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:21,820
 God said it, it was and it was good, day one.

174
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:24,180
 God said it, it was and it was good, day two.

175
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,540
 God said it, it was and it was good.

176
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:30,780
 And then we get to day six and he brings forth animals.

177
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:33,780
 He speaks them into existence, father, son and spirit

178
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:38,500
 working together to create, to form and to fill the earth.

179
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,740
 And he said it and it was and it was good.

180
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:44,060
 And then he creates his kind of grand opus,

181
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:49,060
 his finale if you will, he creates man, humans.

182
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:53,460
 He said it, it was and the end of chapter six says,

183
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,500
 it was very good.

184
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:00,020
 And so he puts man and woman in Eden, in paradise,

185
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,940
 in perfect relationship with him.

186
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:04,740
 We can't even fathom this, that they walked

187
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:07,300
 and talked with God, they communed with God.

188
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:11,700
 And there it was, two grown, naked adults

189
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,980
 in perfect paradise where the manifestation

190
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:18,240
 of all evil comes to them in the form of a serpent

191
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,980
 and they royally screw it up.

192
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,540
 And we tell it to kids as children's stories

193
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:23,740
 before they go to bed, it's weird,

194
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:26,620
 I don't know why we do that but we do that.

195
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:29,860
 And we would do the same thing, in fact,

196
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:32,460
 we do the same thing every day.

197
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:35,400
 So let's dive in, chapter two, verse 15.

198
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,780
 The Lord God took the man and put him in the garden

199
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:42,700
 of Eden to work it and to take care of it.

200
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,060
 And the Lord God commanded the man,

201
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:46,820
 you are free to eat from any tree in the garden

202
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,620
 but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge

203
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,820
 of good and evil for when you eat from it,

204
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,340
 you will certainly die.

205
00:08:53,340 --> 00:09:00,180
 God says, here you are, everything I have is yours.

206
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:04,660
 Look around you, it's amazing.

207
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:09,040
 The lion lays with the lamb, it's all for your enjoyment,

208
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,520
 it's all for your pleasure and for your care

209
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,600
 and you get to rule over them.

210
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,200
 Oh, that tree over there, don't eat it.

211
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,720
 Don't eat the fruit from that tree.

212
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,960
 So in, you know, I don't know if you've ever done

213
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:26,960
 like memory verses, the only memory verse in this moment

214
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:30,120
 in history is don't eat from that tree.

215
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,280
 That's the Bible, it's like a fortune cookie.

216
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,480
 It's like, don't eat from that tree, that's it.

217
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,320
 That's all the instruction you have to know.

218
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,800
 Do not eat from that tree.

219
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,040
 And so this reminds me, 'cause we hear this

220
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,040
 and we're like, man, that's a,

221
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,060
 it's kind of a strange dilemma, but it's really not.

222
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,840
 It's not that strange if you think about it.

223
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,980
 It's the same dilemma that we exist in all the time.

224
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:53,720
 In fact, I'll tell you, it's like the backyard

225
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,540
 of my old house, Monica and our old house,

226
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:59,960
 we had a backyard and I went to great lengths

227
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,400
 to make that backyard like Eden.

228
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:06,200
 I planted flower beds, specifically for my kids.

229
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,160
 We had a koi pond back there.

230
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,920
 I bought this swing set, okay, with all sorts of swings

231
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,640
 and a trapeze thing and a slide.

232
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,180
 I put sidewalk chalk back there so they could ride

233
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:19,540
 on the sidewalk, put tricycles back there

234
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:21,700
 so they could race around the swimming pool.

235
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:24,520
 Oh, and then there was the swimming pool

236
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,780
 and they can't swim.

237
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:29,340
 And I said, go back there and have a blast.

238
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,120
 Do anything you want, slide down the slide,

239
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,960
 swing on the swings, write your name with sidewalk chalk,

240
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,920
 draw pictures if you'd like, race around on your tricycles,

241
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,580
 but don't touch the pool or you'll die.

242
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:43,320
 You could die.

243
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,240
 (congregation laughing)

244
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,360
 So don't touch the pool.

245
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,040
 This is, and you're like, this is their instruction.

246
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,440
 Hey, go have fun, kids.

247
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,640
 I love you.

248
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,560
 And because I love you, I know that's dangerous.

249
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,760
 So don't do that.

250
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,080
 And loving God gives his kids loving instruction.

251
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,640
 You exist in the same reality.

252
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,320
 Hey, date, go have fun, man, talk to each other,

253
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,680
 be careful with your heart.

254
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,100
 No, y'all spend time together.

255
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,840
 Don't cross physical boundaries.

256
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,840
 You want a glass of wine, have a glass of wine.

257
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,760
 Don't have three.

258
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,600
 Okay?

259
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,160
 You like your job, good, work.

260
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,320
 Don't make it an idol.

261
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,840
 You wanna buy that fine, don't worship it.

262
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:27,780
 You make money, awesome, don't worship it.

263
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,520
 God gives us the same kind of instruction.

264
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,480
 Chapter two, verse 20.

265
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,440
 But for Adam, there was no suitable helper found,

266
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,920
 so the Lord God caused the man to fall asleep,

267
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,160
 fall into a deep sleep, and while he was sleeping,

268
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,740
 he took one of the man's ribs,

269
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:45,180
 and then he closed up the place with flesh.

270
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,760
 Then the Lord God made a woman from the rib

271
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,640
 he had taken out of the man,

272
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:53,320
 and he brought her to the man.

273
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:56,760
 And it's funny, 'cause in verse 23, he breaks out in Psalm.

274
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:00,920
 So Adam comes, wakes up, sees the woman lying there naked,

275
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,640
 and he just sings, "I can't keep my hands to myself,"

276
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,840
 or something, I don't know what he's saying.

277
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,160
 I mean, I could, but why would I want to?

278
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,240
 I don't know what he's saying.

279
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,880
 But he's saying something to there, okay?

280
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,880
 So he just busts out, it's like the first words

281
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,200
 Adam spoke to the woman, he sang.

282
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,600
 Not a lot has changed, okay?

283
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,800
 And so, and so I just wanna insert

284
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,160
 this interesting fact here.

285
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,240
 I got this from gotquestions.org.

286
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,520
 The only reason I got it from there,

287
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,280
 because it was the most concise source

288
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,880
 of citing a bunch of scientific journals.

289
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,040
 But I'll read it to you.

290
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,060
 Why chromosomal Adam and mitochondrial Eve

291
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:35,840
 are the scientifically proven theories

292
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:40,000
 that every man alive today is descended from a single man,

293
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,160
 and every man and woman alive today

294
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,080
 is descended from a single woman.

295
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,280
 And these scientific journals go on to say

296
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,080
 that there was some sort of bottleneck

297
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:51,140
 in humanity's history, see, also a flood.

298
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:53,880
 And so it has been proven, some people might say,

299
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:57,080
 you believe that everybody came from two human beings?

300
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,280
 So does science.

301
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:04,680
 Okay, so does any credible scientist

302
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,400
 believes that everyone came from one woman.

303
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:11,960
 And as it says, it's a scientifically proven theory.

304
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:16,140
 And so then, in chapter two, verse 25,

305
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:18,760
 is this really profound reality

306
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,040
 I could spend an entire night on.

307
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,240
 It says, Adam and his wife were both naked

308
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,440
 and they felt no shame.

309
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:28,160
 And you'll never know this until you're with Jesus.

310
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,680
 You will never know what this is like,

311
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,200
 'cause what it's saying is this profound reality

312
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,960
 that they were fully known and completely accepted.

313
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:42,780
 That there was nothing to hide,

314
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,880
 and they were completely loved.

315
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,540
 Everything was seen displayed in the open,

316
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:51,960
 and they were completely accepted.

317
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,940
 And there's this one thing that's off limits.

318
00:13:55,940 --> 00:14:00,880
 And this is where the enemy is a mastermind.

319
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,680
 This is his playing field in your life.

320
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:06,040
 He takes the one thing that is not readily available to you,

321
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,560
 and he grabs you by the back of the head,

322
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,360
 and he begins to rub your face in it.

323
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,460
 And you see that, you don't have that,

324
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:16,480
 why don't you have that?

325
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,320
 And you're driving down the road,

326
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,880
 ah, why don't you have, where, where,

327
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,080
 why don't you have it, what's going on?

328
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,240
 Your guy's not good.

329
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,840
 And he makes it worse than it is,

330
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:28,240
 and he will drive you to a place of complete desperation,

331
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,480
 depression, despair, if you let him.

332
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,800
 But where you don't have something, where you lack,

333
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,100
 that's his playing field.

334
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:39,700
 Chapter three.

335
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,760
 Now the serpent was more crafty

336
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,360
 than any of the wild animals the Lord had made.

337
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,640
 He said to the woman, did God really say

338
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,840
 you must not eat from any tree in the garden?

339
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,960
 No, he didn't say that.

340
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,880
 That's what he does, though.

341
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:57,240
 No guy's gonna like you, you can't have a guy, no guy.

342
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,680
 And he just takes the reality and he exaggerates it.

343
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,880
 And he just keeps planting it in your heart.

344
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,960
 The woman said to the serpent,

345
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,220
 we may eat fruit from the trees in the garden,

346
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:12,400
 but God did say you must not eat fruit from the tree

347
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,120
 that is in the middle of the garden,

348
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,320
 and you must not touch it, or you will die.

349
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,440
 This is the first act of legalism.

350
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,080
 Legalism is taking the word of God and adding to it.

351
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,560
 God said don't eat the fruit.

352
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:27,040
 He says, God said don't eat it and don't touch it.

353
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,080
 They added to the rules.

354
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,840
 Like, right, it may be wrong for me

355
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,500
 to have a computer in my bedroom,

356
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,040
 but if I tell you that being a Christian

357
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,680
 means not having a computer in your bedroom,

358
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:39,700
 then that's an act of legalism.

359
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:40,920
 Now it may be wise for you

360
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,260
 not to have a computer in your bedroom,

361
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:47,200
 but if I begin to define Christianity or God's instructions

362
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,160
 based on what is wise for me,

363
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:52,400
 that is extra-biblical ideas, that's legalism.

364
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,780
 Like, it may be wrong for me to consume alcohol,

365
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:58,820
 but if I say it's wrong to consume alcohol, right,

366
00:15:58,820 --> 00:15:59,760
 that's legalism.

367
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,160
 The Scripture says don't get drunk,

368
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,720
 that it's a sin to get drunk.

369
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:09,720
 When I begin to tell you these universal truths are sins,

370
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,040
 when it's unwise for me or sin for me,

371
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,600
 and it's outside of what God directly commands,

372
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,440
 that's legalism.

373
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,560
 That's what Eve did here.

374
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:21,580
 The enemy just says, "You will not certainly die,"

375
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,660
 the serpent said to the woman,

376
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:24,420
 "for God knows that when you eat from it,

377
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:26,540
 "your eyes will be opened and you will be like God,

378
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,260
 "knowing good and evil."

379
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:31,740
 My first point this evening is the consideration of sin.

380
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,700
 The consideration of sin is temptation.

381
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,500
 Tonight we're going to look at the consideration of sin,

382
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,660
 the consequence of sin,

383
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:40,820
 and before you leave here this evening, the cure for sin,

384
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:44,100
 the first idea is the consideration of sin is temptation.

385
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:48,260
 Temptation asks, does God really care?

386
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,520
 Is it really against the rules?

387
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,880
 Like after all, it's his creation, right, he made it.

388
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,260
 Does he really care how far you go?

389
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,100
 Do you think God doesn't want you to have,

390
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,340
 does God really care?

391
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:00,080
 This is called justification.

392
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:03,160
 It's you wanting permission to sin.

393
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:07,520
 Temptation asks, is God keeping good from you?

394
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,500
 He's not a loving father, he's not a father you can trust,

395
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,020
 he's trying to rip you off.

396
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:15,860
 He's trying to keep something from you.

397
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,360
 He's trying to keep good from you.

398
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:21,120
 Temptation asks, is God really that big of a deal?

399
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:25,460
 See, everywhere you see God in this text,

400
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:28,400
 it's Yahweh Elohim, it's this incredible, intimate,

401
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:33,400
 profound word for God, it's I am God, I am who I am, God.

402
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,420
 And so Eve says, Yahweh Elohim said

403
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:39,260
 that we must not eat the fruit or we will die,

404
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:42,940
 and Satan says, Elohim said you won't die.

405
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:45,200
 Elohim didn't say that.

406
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,460
 And he tries to get you to think less of God.

407
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,140
 God's not that big of a deal.

408
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:53,220
 God's not a big deal.

409
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:57,340
 Temptation ultimately asks this.

410
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,540
 I want you to hear this.

411
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,460
 Who is ultimate?

412
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:03,860
 Are you ultimate?

413
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:04,900
 Is your desires ultimate?

414
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:05,780
 Is your pleasure ultimate?

415
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,820
 Is what you want, is what you want ultimate?

416
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,540
 Is what you want your God?

417
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:13,080
 Temptation asks, who is ultimate?

418
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,580
 See, this is the second fall.

419
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:18,700
 The first fall happens is displayed in Isaiah and Ezekiel

420
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,300
 that Satan comes to the earth and he's here

421
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:25,460
 and he's the prince of this air and he's ruling this world

422
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:29,460
 and he's trying to lure you out of relationship with God

423
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:32,860
 and his message to you is simply this,

424
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:33,700
 and you've gotta hear this,

425
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,740
 this is so relevant for where we live.

426
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,100
 You can be like God.

427
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:42,540
 You don't need to worship God, you can be like God.

428
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:45,860
 You can build a palace and you can have lots of money

429
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:48,100
 and you can make great of your name.

430
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,380
 You don't need to make great of his name,

431
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,500
 make great of your name.

432
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,580
 And this is demonic and his essence.

433
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,620
 It is Satan's mantra.

434
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:59,320
 In fact, this is the mantra of the satanic church.

435
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,300
 The satanic church does not worship Satan.

436
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,840
 They don't even believe in Satan.

437
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,180
 They worship themselves, it's hedonism.

438
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:08,780
 The mantra of the satanic church is do as thy will.

439
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:12,060
 It's this, do whatever you want to do.

440
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:14,720
 So whenever you go through this world thinking,

441
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,020
 well, whatever makes them happy, that's Satanism.

442
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:20,020
 Have you ever said that?

443
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,820
 Well, whatever makes, I just want them to be happy.

444
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:24,500
 So does Satan wants them to pursue happiness

445
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,980
 so they will never be happy.

446
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:29,500
 So they will never be, they will sit in discontentment

447
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,800
 'cause to pursue happiness is not to have it.

448
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:36,580
 The mantra of the satanic church is do as thy will.

449
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:39,380
 And so if you follow your desires,

450
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:41,620
 that's the satanic message in our world.

451
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,860
 We see this, like people use this for advertising,

452
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:46,900
 feed your preferences, indulge your flesh.

453
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:49,140
 Spas use this, vacations use this.

454
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:52,020
 Come and indulge here, indulge your flesh.

455
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,980
 Do whatever you want, take a break, kick up your feet,

456
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,760
 relax and feed your preferences.

457
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,920
 This is a satanic message.

458
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,860
 It's very different than the message of God.

459
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,540
 Discipline yourself for godliness.

460
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:06,620
 You see how different those are?

461
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:08,260
 Feed, do whatever you want,

462
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:10,120
 discipline yourself for godliness.

463
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,780
 You see how those are different?

464
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:16,500
 See, the opposite of loving God is not hating God,

465
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,780
 it's loving self.

466
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:21,100
 It's making yourself like God.

467
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:24,060
 And Satan is crafty, he knows you, he hates you,

468
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,300
 he wants to kill you.

469
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:28,460
 And his game plan is to get you to doubt God.

470
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,540
 He finds out what you desire

471
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:32,500
 and he makes you feel entitled to it

472
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,860
 and he says, why has God kept that from you?

473
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,740
 If God was good, he wouldn't have kept that from you.

474
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,660
 That's his game plan.

475
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:43,900
 He says, what, you have to wait to be married, have sex?

476
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,020
 What?

477
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,060
 God's trying to keep that.

478
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,740
 You don't get to live there,

479
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,180
 God's trying to keep that from you.

480
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,200
 Why hasn't that boss noticed you?

481
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,100
 Why hasn't that boy noticed you?

482
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,940
 Go ahead and please yourself, it's not as bad as sex.

483
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:00,300
 God's trying to keep pleasure from you.

484
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,580
 Have a shot.

485
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:04,040
 Take the edge off, take a hit, relax a little.

486
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:07,180
 What is your temptation, I'm asking?

487
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:10,420
 What's your greatest temptation today?

488
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,860
 What'd you come in here with?

489
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:16,400
 Because he tempts us with something we like.

490
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,940
 He doesn't tempt me when I'm not doing desserts

491
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,580
 with broccoli and Brussels sprouts.

492
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,380
 I mean, he tempts me with chocolate.

493
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,900
 Hey, he tempts me with the things that I want.

494
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,940
 And he uses phrases like, JP, you deserve.

495
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:31,540
 You deserve, like I'm most tempted

496
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,180
 when something's lacking, like three kids

497
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:36,020
 and running around in ministry,

498
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:38,340
 and you just get, every now and then you're tired

499
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,980
 and I'm walking around, I'm like, man, I deserve a nap.

500
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:44,460
 Dude, that is when I am in the war, like center in the war.

501
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,500
 I deserve a nap, I'm hungry.

502
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:50,020
 I'm lacking something, I'm tired.

503
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:54,140
 And I'm right in the middle of the battleground.

504
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,480
 Or I'm lonely.

505
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:01,100
 Man, he will meet you there and mess you up.

506
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:04,860
 And so Satan wins if you feel sorry for yourself.

507
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:07,780
 If you listen to that you got ripped off message

508
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:10,380
 because he wants you to focus on you.

509
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,660
 And so I've heard people say, even here at the porch,

510
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:15,140
 they say, well, God wouldn't give me these desires

511
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:16,540
 if he didn't want me to do this.

512
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,380
 What?

513
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:18,940
 I mean, you're telling, I don't know if you've read

514
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,700
 the narrative of this book,

515
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:24,420
 but it's that you have all kinds of wicked desires.

516
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:26,740
 Philippians says, their God is their stomach,

517
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:29,380
 their enemies of the cross of Christ

518
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:31,340
 because they follow their appetite,

519
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:32,740
 they follow their desires,

520
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:35,740
 that makes them enemies of the cross of Christ.

521
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:37,220
 That's a satanic message.

522
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:39,560
 God wouldn't have given me these desires

523
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,620
 if he didn't want me to do this.

524
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:43,180
 Where's discipline yourself for godliness in that?

525
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:50,100
 Satan thinks he is ultimate.

526
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,940
 But he'll make you think you are ultimate

527
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:55,900
 because he just doesn't want you to think God is ultimate.

528
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:57,900
 Here's what I'm saying.

529
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:02,580
 If you worship anything other than God,

530
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,180
 Satan receives it as worship.

531
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:07,820
 You worship clothes, money, a relationship,

532
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:10,580
 a boy, a girl, a boss, any obsession,

533
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:15,220
 a car, an apartment, anything, Satan will receive.

534
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:17,380
 He doesn't need you to worship him.

535
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,420
 He'll receive your worship.

536
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,900
 You worship self.

537
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,780
 He'll receive that as worship.

538
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:23,380
 You have two options.

539
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:26,340
 As it comes to worship, worship the one true God

540
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,540
 or worship Satan, period.

541
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,380
 That's it.

542
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,860
 Those are your only two options.

543
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:35,260
 And so trusting God and temptation

544
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:38,380
 is believing that God is good, loving, and in control.

545
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:43,100
 Because there's something in us that wants to be like God.

546
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:46,260
 What's crazy about this story is they were already like God.

547
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,860
 Adam and Eve, they were made in his what?

548
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:51,460
 They were made in his love.

549
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:54,780
 They were made in his image and likeness.

550
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:57,420
 They were made like God, right?

551
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:58,340
 And there they are.

552
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:00,660
 They were set in the Garden of Eden as rulers

553
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:03,100
 to rule over things like God.

554
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,140
 And then Satan comes and is like,

555
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:06,380
 "Hey, if you eat from that, you'll be like God."

556
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:09,460
 He should've said, "I'm already like God."

557
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:12,380
 But we do the same thing when we're discontent.

558
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:14,300
 Like I can hit a spot.

559
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,740
 Like when I'm in my lowest of lows

560
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:19,860
 or when I look back in history of my lowest of low points,

561
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:22,340
 I notice that what I'll do is I'll go

562
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:24,340
 and I'll check my bank account.

563
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:26,780
 I'm reaching for a security blanket.

564
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:27,900
 Then I'll usually get depressed,

565
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,300
 so then I'll check my Twitter followers

566
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:34,420
 or my Facebook friends or my Instagram likes.

567
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:38,460
 And I'm just reaching for something to find significance in

568
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:44,660
 so that I can be like God in my own messed up, sinful mind.

569
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:47,940
 We do the same thing.

570
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:51,100
 And so your greatest weapon against temptation

571
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,380
 is God's word.

572
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:54,980
 Like Eve should've reflected on her one memory verse

573
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:56,140
 and was like, "Don't eat that.

574
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:58,060
 "I'm not gonna eat that.

575
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:00,420
 "I'm not going to do it."

576
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:03,100
 Last week, we here on staff,

577
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,020
 every year we have a staff play day.

578
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:08,340
 And this particular day was archery tag.

579
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,180
 You ever done this?

580
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:11,140
 So it's kinda like paintball with like a bow and arrow

581
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:14,100
 and the arrow has this big foam tip on it.

582
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,060
 Dangerous, yes.

583
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:18,700
 And so we got into teams.

584
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:19,540
 It's like dodge ball.

585
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:20,980
 You run to the middle, you grab your arrows,

586
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:23,700
 you back up and you're just shooting at the other team.

587
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,220
 And I caught one to the face.

588
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:26,060
 It wasn't fun.

589
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:28,140
 It swole up, couldn't see out of that eye for a few minutes.

590
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:29,340
 Wasn't cool.

591
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:30,340
 But when you're out there

592
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:33,100
 and these fiery darts are just coming at you,

593
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:36,300
 like there's no question that you're in battle.

594
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,260
 No question.

595
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:38,860
 Nobody's out there just like standing around like,

596
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:40,020
 "Hit me, how dare you?"

597
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:42,220
 David, you kinda were.

598
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:45,900
 But nobody else, nobody else was like that.

599
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:48,620
 Everybody else was like, "Duck in, you're shooting."

600
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:50,060
 Running around, right?

601
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:53,020
 Because there's no question you're in battle.

602
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,220
 If some of you came in tonight,

603
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,980
 you don't realize you're in a war.

604
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:59,460
 There's an enemy trying to kill you, man.

605
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,300
 He's trying to lure you out

606
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,900
 of an intimate relationship with God

607
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:06,940
 and move you towards despair and depression

608
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09,420
 and apathy and nothingness.

609
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:12,120
 And for some of you, he's winning.

610
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:16,660
 And I just need you right now to say in your mind,

611
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:19,660
 in your heart, he's winning, but he ain't gonna win.

612
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:22,020
 We're gonna change that.

613
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:24,180
 I'm gonna cling to some hope tonight.

614
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:26,740
 I'm gonna reach out for some help tonight

615
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:28,660
 'cause he's not going to win.

616
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:32,060
 How are you going to respond in temptation?

617
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:33,860
 How did they, verse six.

618
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:35,580
 When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree

619
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,660
 was good for food and pleasing to the eye

620
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:39,860
 and also desirable for gaining wisdom,

621
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,860
 she took some and ate it.

622
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:44,420
 He also gave some to her.

623
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:46,020
 She also gave some to her husband

624
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:48,540
 who was with her and he ate it.

625
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,180
 Then the eyes of both of them were opened

626
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,820
 and they realized they were naked

627
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:53,760
 and so they sewed fig leaves together

628
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,780
 and made coverings for themselves.

629
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:58,780
 In verse six, it offered to satisfy,

630
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:01,460
 it looked good, and it offered her control.

631
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:03,980
 And it's interesting that it says that Adam was with her

632
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:06,100
 because here we see a passive man.

633
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:06,940
 Women, let me tell you something.

634
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:09,960
 If you're looking for a man, you do not want a passive man.

635
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,300
 You want a man who will stand against sin.

636
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:14,220
 What happened?

637
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,120
 Huh?

638
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,580
 Come on, yes, thank you.

639
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:22,980
 You do not want a passive man.

640
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,220
 That's funny.

641
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:25,580
 Preach, come on.

642
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:29,180
 You do not want a passive man.

643
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,900
 I'm gonna give you more on this in just a minute.

644
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:33,620
 But you want someone who rejects sin,

645
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:35,780
 not someone who is apathetic towards it,

646
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:37,960
 not someone who will watch it happen,

647
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,420
 someone who will make war with it,

648
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:41,980
 someone who stands in opposition to it.

649
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:45,460
 And it's interesting to me, just a side note here,

650
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:47,760
 that they attempted to cover themselves.

651
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,480
 What's crazy is the narrative

652
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,140
 is not that they covered their mouth.

653
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:53,980
 They ate the fruit.

654
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:55,540
 It's not that they covered their eyes.

655
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,360
 Don't let me see.

656
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,940
 It's not that they covered their ears or anything.

657
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:01,600
 They covered their reproductive organs.

658
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,100
 Why?

659
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,020
 I don't know, let's go.

660
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:06,260
 No, I think, I think,

661
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:10,020
 I think, it's just a theory.

662
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:12,980
 I think it's like, it's our flesh.

663
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:15,320
 Like, we have a flesh, we have a desire,

664
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:18,100
 and that is a way that is going to take us out.

665
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,460
 And so when sin entered the world, right,

666
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:22,980
 we began to cover up our flesh, that area.

667
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:25,180
 Like, people will say, you know,

668
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:27,940
 I hope this isn't inappropriate.

669
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:28,780
 It probably is.

670
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:30,600
 Like, what's he thinking with?

671
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:34,860
 Is he thinking with, what's he thinking with?

672
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:36,660
 I'm not gonna point anywhere else, relax.

673
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:40,000
 [congregation laughing]

674
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,780
 But is he thinking with his head

675
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:47,220
 or is he thinking with his flesh, right?

676
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,960
 And so I think that that's just a theory.

677
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,160
 That's a side, write it down, or maybe don't.

678
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,180
 [congregation laughing]

679
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,640
 It is the first act of religion

680
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,960
 that they covered themselves, interesting aside.

681
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,820
 Then the man, verse eight,

682
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:00,860
 and his wife heard the sound of the Lord God

683
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:03,740
 as he was walking in the garden in the cool of the day.

684
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,180
 And they hid from the Lord God

685
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:06,760
 among the trees of the garden.

686
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,720
 But the Lord God called to the man,

687
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,960
 "Where are you?"

688
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,100
 He answered, "I heard you in the garden,

689
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:16,060
 "and I was afraid because I was naked, so I hid."

690
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:19,040
 Says the Lord God was walking in the cool of the day.

691
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:23,300
 Okay, that word for cool in the Hebrew is ruach.

692
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:26,920
 And 92 times in the scripture,

693
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:30,540
 it's translated storm, like a windstorm.

694
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:34,840
 One time in the scripture, it's translated cool.

695
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:39,560
 And so, listen, I've got an associate's degree in art, okay?

696
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:42,880
 The most worthless degree you can imagine.

697
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,880
 And, sorry, if that's you.

698
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,400
 And-- [congregation laughing]

699
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,520
 And I don't know Hebrew,

700
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:54,320
 but I have heard a credible case multiple times

701
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,480
 that this is not God walking in the cool of the day,

702
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:00,940
 but that this is God moving toward them like a windstorm.

703
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:03,580
 That this is God, why?

704
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:07,060
 Because God is not passive to our sin.

705
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:11,680
 God is never casual about our sin because he loves us,

706
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:15,260
 and everything God does is restorative.

707
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:18,640
 So when we sin, you may feel like God is running from you.

708
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,660
 God is running after you in your sin,

709
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:23,320
 running to you in your sin.

710
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:26,700
 It says in the Psalms that he reached down in the miry muck,

711
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,720
 in the slimy pit, and set you on a solid foundation.

712
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,940
 He's moving towards you in your sin.

713
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:36,560
 I can think about one time I was in the backyard

714
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:39,340
 with the girls, Presley and Finley were playing back there,

715
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:40,420
 and I was supposed to be watching them,

716
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:41,720
 but I turned my back for a minute,

717
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:44,840
 and I was doing something in the flower bed,

718
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,680
 and Monica begins to beat on the window

719
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,800
 from inside the house and point to the pool,

720
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,880
 and when I turn around,

721
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:52,380
 I saw the one thing you never wanna see as a parent.

722
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:56,280
 I saw Presley flailing in the deep end.

723
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:59,040
 She couldn't swim, and drowning.

724
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,520
 And I just remember, like, with every,

725
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,040
 I don't even know how it happened.

726
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:05,840
 Like, all I know is one minute I'm in the flower bed,

727
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,760
 and like, Raiden, the next minute I'm in the pool,

728
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,600
 it just happened like a warp zone.

729
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:15,600
 And iPhone, clothes, everything, to save my daughter.

730
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,260
 Because I saw her in danger.

731
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:20,880
 This is what's happening here.

732
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:21,920
 I'm convinced.

733
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:27,280
 That they did the one thing God asked them not to do,

734
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:30,680
 and shh, in fact, the Hebrew boy,

735
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,760
 in the Hebrew, this reads so fast,

736
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:36,000
 she saw, she ate, she offered, he ate,

737
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,160
 God moved like a storm.

738
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,460
 And the Hebrew child, a young Israelite,

739
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:41,680
 would've read this like,

740
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:44,480
 oh, he's gonna rip 'em to shreds.

741
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,400
 He's gonna kill 'em.

742
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,120
 And then you just see this act of grace,

743
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,080
 and ask for repentance, where are you?

744
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:54,400
 Who told you you were naked?

745
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,400
 And ask, and repent.

746
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:00,120
 Repent, I know the answers to these questions,

747
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,920
 but I want you to repent.

748
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:06,640
 And he said, who told you you were naked?

749
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,720
 Have you eaten from the tree

750
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,400
 that I commanded you not to eat from?

751
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,720
 The man said, the woman you put here with me,

752
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:15,480
 she gave me some fruit from the tree, and I ate it.

753
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,160
 Some of you have dated this guy.

754
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:21,000
 Then the Lord God said to the woman,

755
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,160
 what is this you have done?

756
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:27,080
 The woman said, the serpent deceived me, and I ate it.

757
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,560
 So the Lord God said to the serpent,

758
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,000
 because you have done this,

759
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,920
 cursed are you above all livestock and all wild animals.

760
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,520
 You will crawl on your belly,

761
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,680
 and you will eat dust all the days of your life.

762
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,800
 Interesting that the serpent

763
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:44,240
 was probably a lizard before this, not a snake.

764
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,520
 In fact, probably the only animal

765
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:51,320
 that changed through the fall was the serpent.

766
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:54,680
 Because now he's, I know, mind's blown.

767
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,680
 'Cause I, yeah, we always see a snake,

768
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:59,080
 but probably a lizard before that.

769
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:02,040
 And I will put enmity between you and the woman,

770
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,480
 and between your offspring and hers.

771
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:06,760
 He will crush your head, and you will strike his heel.

772
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,600
 To the woman he said,

773
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,040
 I will make your pains and childbearing very severe.

774
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:13,160
 With painful labor, you will give birth to children.

775
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,360
 Your desire will be for your husband,

776
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,440
 and he will rule over you.

777
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,920
 To Adam he said, because you listened to your wife

778
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,200
 and ate the fruit from the tree

779
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,000
 about which I commanded you, you must not eat from it.

780
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 Cursed is the ground because of you.

781
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,480
 Through painful toil, you will eat food from it

782
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,040
 all the days of your life.

783
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:34,240
 It will produce thorns and thistles,

784
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,600
 and you will eat the plants of the field.

785
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,240
 By the sweat of your brow, you will eat your food

786
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,800
 until you return to the ground,

787
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:44,240
 since from it you were taken, for dust you are,

788
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,040
 and to dust you will return.

789
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,800
 You will die.

790
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:55,360
 The second point is the consequence of sin is death.

791
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,800
 The consequence of sin is always death.

792
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,780
 Your sin of pornography, your sin of lust,

793
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:05,840
 your sin of materialism, your sin of covetousness,

794
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:08,480
 your sin of greed, your sin of jealousy,

795
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,040
 your sin of gossip, it's death.

796
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,600
 It brings about death.

797
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,600
 So let me define sin, verse six.

798
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:18,280
 It looked good, it satisfied her desire,

799
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,600
 and it gave her knowledge.

800
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:24,600
 It looks good, it does good, but God says it's not good,

801
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,400
 and God gets to define what is good,

802
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:30,960
 regardless of what you see, regardless of what you feel,

803
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,440
 regardless of what you think, God says what's good.

804
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,120
 And so do we trust God to define what is good?

805
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:41,120
 Or has our desire turned to sin?

806
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,320
 James says this, "But each one is tempted

807
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:47,040
 "when by his own evil desire he is dragged away and enticed.

808
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,760
 "Then after desire has conceived, he gives birth to sin,

809
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,440
 "and sin, when it is full grown, gives birth to death."

810
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,320
 Let me say what sin is.

811
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:58,360
 Sin is simply anything that does not come from trusting God.

812
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,280
 Did you hear that?

813
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,440
 It's worth writing down.

814
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:06,440
 Sin is simply anything that does not come from trusting God,

815
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:10,560
 that comes directly from Romans 14, verse 23.

816
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,960
 Anything that does not come from faith is sin.

817
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,080
 And so the result of sin, you feel shame,

818
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:21,960
 you feel ashamed, you cover up, you justify, you blame.

819
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:25,240
 She did it, he did it, they did it, they caused me to do it,

820
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,440
 everybody else is doing it.

821
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,360
 You'll blame anything you can reach for.

822
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,920
 And you even blame God, you get angry at God.

823
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,640
 I talk to this person up here all the time.

824
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:36,920
 JP, man, he broke up with me.

825
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,840
 Like we were living together and then he moved out.

826
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:42,760
 I just can't believe God did this to me.

827
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,600
 I'm like, what?

828
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:47,960
 I can't believe God did this to me.

829
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:51,400
 Sweetie, God's been jumping up and down,

830
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:54,120
 waving his arms, saying that dude is a loser.

831
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:57,400
 Like do not date him, run.

832
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,800
 And you've been like, what, you wanna move in?

833
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,720
 Okay, I'll move in with you.

834
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,120
 And I can't believe God did this.

835
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:06,080
 God didn't do this to you, you did this to you.

836
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,920
 You chose this.

837
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:11,520
 Like who else, what other believers were around you saying,

838
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,840
 hey, this is a good idea right here.

839
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:16,240
 That's gonna be amazing, beautiful babies.

840
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,160
 I mean, y'all, no, man.

841
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:21,160
 God's like, don't do it.

842
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,520
 But we'll blame anybody.

843
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:26,040
 And God wants repentance.

844
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,720
 Not just confession, not hey, this is what I did,

845
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,480
 but I'm turning from what I did.

846
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:34,480
 And I'm gonna do everything I need to do to own what I did.

847
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:37,560
 I did that, that right there, that was me, man.

848
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,560
 I did that.

849
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:42,160
 Hey, everybody stop, 'cause I gotta tell you

850
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,000
 what I just did.

851
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,520
 I'm gonna shine a big old bright spotlight on it, okay?

852
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,720
 It's ugly, man, it's so gross.

853
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:50,800
 So gross what I did, but I did it and I'm gonna own it.

854
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,120
 My God can restore me, he can heal me.

855
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:57,520
 I can find restoration, he's gonna take this mess,

856
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,000
 he's gonna make it a message,

857
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,920
 he's gonna do an incredible work here.

858
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:05,360
 But I'm turning from that, man, I'm moving on.

859
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,760
 I'm not gonna do that again.

860
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:09,200
 I want repentance.

861
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:13,800
 My little girl was, when we lived at that house,

862
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:16,520
 I walked in the back and Presley's there,

863
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,880
 she's like three years old.

864
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:21,800
 And I walked back there and I'm like,

865
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:25,280
 Presley, who threw those rocks in the pool?

866
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,920
 And she opens her hand and rocks just fall from her hand.

867
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,160
 She's like, I don't know.

868
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,960
 I said, sweetie, you cannot throw rocks in the pool.

869
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,360
 I didn't throw rocks in the pool.

870
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,240
 Well, who threw rocks in the pool?

871
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:42,240
 Finley, her little sister, who can't even clench her fist.

872
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,800
 And I go, Presley, Finley threw rocks in the pool?

873
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,240
 Yeah, Daddy, I'm sorry.

874
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:50,920
 Sweetie, if Finley threw rocks in the pool,

875
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:53,480
 then Finley's gonna get a spanking.

876
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,480
 Oh, that's terrible.

877
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:59,000
 All right, Presley, I'm like, I don't know what to do.

878
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,520
 I've never been here before as a parent.

879
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,760
 I'm like, all right, Presley, Finley's getting a spanking.

880
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,520
 Okay, Daddy, take her inside.

881
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,960
 I'm sitting in the room like, God, what do I do?

882
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:08,000
 Help me, help me.

883
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,520
 I'm like, I can't, I don't know what to do.

884
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,120
 And so I go back out and I'm like, Presley,

885
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:15,500
 do you have something you need to tell me?

886
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:18,900
 Daddy, I'm so sorry that Finley threw rocks in the pool.

887
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,540
 (congregation laughing)

888
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:21,580
 Oh, man.

889
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:22,660
 I'm like, at my wit's end.

890
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:25,180
 Well, right about then, this guy lives with us.

891
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:26,740
 And he lived with us at the time,

892
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:28,380
 and he pulls up the window upstairs

893
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:29,220
 and he overlooks the pool.

894
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:31,420
 He goes, Presley, she goes, hey, Matt.

895
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:34,100
 He goes, did I just see you throwing rocks in the pool?

896
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:36,300
 And he's like. (congregation laughing)

897
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:39,220
 And it was like, I was like, praise God.

898
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:41,660
 'Cause I didn't, but it was just like somebody was saying,

899
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:44,540
 one, she's trying to blame anything that she can

900
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:48,220
 on her sin, and two, somebody saw her.

901
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:52,100
 Dude, God sees everything you do.

902
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:55,260
 Everything, you've never done anything

903
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:56,180
 that he doesn't intimate.

904
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:57,540
 He sees your thoughts.

905
00:38:57,540 --> 00:39:00,980
 And he's not running from you.

906
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:02,020
 He's not afraid of you.

907
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:05,940
 He went to great lengths to pay for it.

908
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:07,880
 He let his own son die for it.

909
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:11,620
 And so, like, it's time to bring it to the light.

910
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:12,460
 Like, it's time to shine a light.

911
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:14,100
 He's like, man, I did that, I repent.

912
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,780
 I'm moving from that.

913
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:17,500
 God already knows.

914
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,900
 He knows the intimate details of all of it,

915
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,560
 the craziness of all of it.

916
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:26,140
 Man, if you knew everything that went through my mind,

917
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:27,500
 you wouldn't let me preach.

918
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:30,300
 If I knew everything that went through yours,

919
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,980
 I wouldn't let you in.

920
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:35,140
 So it's mutual, as it works. (congregation laughing)

921
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:38,340
 But here we are, and God is bigger than that.

922
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:41,540
 So the consequence of sin,

923
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:46,100
 to the woman, he says, childbearing's gonna be hard.

924
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:48,660
 There's pain, there's miscarriage, there's loss,

925
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:50,900
 there's difficulty in it.

926
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:53,860
 Child rearing, raising them, it's difficult.

927
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:55,980
 Like, no kid, like, kids don't have to be taught

928
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:57,420
 to do wrong, if you've never been there,

929
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:58,420
 I'm just telling you.

930
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:00,020
 They will automatically do wrong.

931
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:01,700
 They have to be taught to do what's right.

932
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,740
 And in verse 16, it says this interesting thing.

933
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:07,260
 It says, your desire will be for your husband,

934
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:09,860
 which I'm like, that ain't so bad, you know.

935
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:12,380
 Like, in the bedroom with Monica, I'm like,

936
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:15,460
 maybe the fall should happen right here, you know.

937
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:17,060
 Your desire will be for your husband.

938
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:18,740
 That's not what it means, okay.

939
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:21,380
 It's the same word for desire.

940
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:23,580
 Some of you are just catching up, like, oh.

941
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:25,500
 (congregation laughing)

942
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,820
 Desire for your husband, it's the same word for desire

943
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:30,100
 that shows up in Genesis chapter four.

944
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:33,740
 And it says, Cain, sin is crouching at your door,

945
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:36,060
 and it desires you.

946
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:37,660
 It desires to rule over you.

947
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:41,060
 And so a part of the fall is that now a woman

948
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:43,780
 wants to play the man's role.

949
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:47,340
 And a woman who is stuck in sin will be contentious

950
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:50,460
 and unruly and impossible to lead.

951
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:54,700
 And so, fellas, now is where you say amen or come on, yeah.

952
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:57,740
 (congregation laughing)

953
00:40:57,740 --> 00:41:01,460
 You don't wanna date this woman, okay.

954
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:02,300
 There you go.

955
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:05,540
 And some of you ladies right now, you hate it.

956
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:06,980
 You're like, what, I hate that.

957
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:09,260
 And you've just proven the point.

958
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:13,180
 (congregation laughing)

959
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:15,180
 And to Adam, the passive man, he says,

960
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:18,100
 now work is toilsome, it will never be done.

961
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:20,500
 And so there's a guy out there that's like,

962
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:23,580
 he doesn't know what job to take because he gets in,

963
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:25,300
 he's like, it's hard, so it must be wrong,

964
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:27,820
 it's difficult, so it must be wrong, it's difficult.

965
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:29,740
 No, no, work is difficult.

966
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:32,820
 Because, see, work, before the fall, Adam worked.

967
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:36,180
 After the fall, work became hard, it fought against him.

968
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:40,780
 So now, work that's hard is not wrong, it just is.

969
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:41,700
 Like, work is tough.

970
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:44,840
 So if you date or marry a passive guy,

971
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:45,940
 that's gonna be a guy that's like, man,

972
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:48,320
 I guess there's no job for me 'cause jobs are hard.

973
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:51,100
 Jobs are hard, okay.

974
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:53,180
 Come on, I know.

975
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:56,700
 And so Adam worked before the fall.

976
00:41:56,700 --> 00:42:00,320
 But now, he's tempted to find identity in his work.

977
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:03,900
 Because of the fall, this is the monotonous irony.

978
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:07,140
 You work the ground, you eat from the ground,

979
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:08,840
 only to fertilize the ground.

980
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:12,660
 To dust you will return, and death enters the world.

981
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:15,380
 Verse 20, Adam named his wife Eve

982
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:19,300
 because she would become the mother of all the living.

983
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:22,600
 And the Lord God made garments of skin for Adam

984
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,900
 and his wife and clothed them.

985
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:27,220
 Before this moment, nothing had died.

986
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:30,700
 And because they sinned, something had to die,

987
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:34,240
 and God made garments for them from that animal's skin.

988
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:38,280
 Before this moment, nothing had died, nothing would die.

989
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,220
 Sin enters the world, death enters the world,

990
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:42,060
 and you see the first sacrifice.

991
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:45,980
 You see that God did not abandon them, he clothed them.

992
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:48,340
 He allowed them to have children,

993
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:53,340
 and he has a glorious plan to fix all of this.

994
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:56,940
 And that's found in Romans chapter five,

995
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:58,680
 verses 17 through 19.

996
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:02,260
 For if by the trespass of one man,

997
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:04,740
 death reigned through that one man,

998
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:06,420
 how much more will those who receive

999
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:08,420
 God's abundant provision of grace

1000
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:11,420
 and of the gift of righteousness reign in life

1001
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:14,940
 through the one man, Jesus Christ.

1002
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:18,060
 Consequently, just as the result of one trespass

1003
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:20,060
 was condemnation for all men,

1004
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:22,940
 so also the result of one act of righteousness

1005
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:26,760
 was justification that brings life for all men.

1006
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,820
 For just as through the disobedience

1007
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:31,180
 of the one man the many were made sinners,

1008
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:33,700
 so also through the obedience of the one man

1009
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:35,740
 the many will be made righteous,

1010
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:37,660
 will end with the cure for sin.

1011
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:40,220
 The cure for sin is Jesus.

1012
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:41,700
 The cure for sin is Jesus.

1013
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:43,160
 Here's a trivia question.

1014
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:46,340
 Where does Jesus first show up in the Bible?

1015
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:52,620
 I heard John one, in the beginning was the word,

1016
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:54,140
 the word was God.

1017
00:43:56,540 --> 00:44:00,900
 Genesis chapter three verse 15.

1018
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:03,880
 A little passage called the Protoevangelium

1019
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:06,100
 translated the first gospel,

1020
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:08,180
 the first account of good news

1021
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:11,540
 is Genesis chapter three, three chapters in verse 15.

1022
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:13,980
 I will put enmity between you and the woman

1023
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:15,860
 and between your offspring and hers.

1024
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:19,540
 He will crush your head and you will strike his heel.

1025
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:22,220
 That woman is going to, from her lineage,

1026
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:25,880
 a child will be born who is going to crush you

1027
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:29,100
 and he will be bruised or hurt in the process.

1028
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:31,140
 That child is Jesus Christ,

1029
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:35,460
 shows up foreshadowing Genesis chapter three.

1030
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:36,900
 And so here's another trivia question.

1031
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:38,960
 What is the oldest religion known to man?

1032
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:45,100
 It's Christianity.

1033
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:49,900
 In the beginning was the word, was Jesus Christ.

1034
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:54,220
 Christianity is the oldest religion known to man.

1035
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:56,680
 It starts at the beginning of the beginning

1036
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:59,800
 with the Father, Son and Spirit, Jesus Christ.

1037
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:02,060
 There in the very beginning, the Trinity,

1038
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:03,880
 the God that we worship,

1039
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:07,400
 that Jesus was born 2016 years ago

1040
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:10,420
 in a date that reset the calendar.

1041
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:12,780
 But he existed in eternity past,

1042
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:15,600
 in the very beginning he was there.

1043
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:18,320
 Christianity was God's plan from the very beginning.

1044
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:20,880
 So how is Jesus the cure for sin?

1045
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,960
 Romans 5:19, through the obedience of the one man,

1046
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:25,440
 the many will be made righteous.

1047
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:28,200
 He paid for your sin, all of your sin,

1048
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,440
 everything you've done, 100% of it,

1049
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:33,120
 the most wicked acts you could possibly do

1050
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:36,160
 were paid for on the cross of Jesus Christ.

1051
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:39,280
 He paid for it.

1052
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:42,320
 You don't have to pay the consequence in eternity.

1053
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:45,860
 Jesus paid the eternal consequence as an eternal God.

1054
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:48,220
 First Corinthians 15 verse 45.

1055
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:52,040
 So it is written, the first Adam became a living being.

1056
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:56,600
 The last Adam, just a word for man, a life-giving spirit.

1057
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:59,480
 So not only did Jesus pay the price for our sin,

1058
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:03,120
 we now have his Holy Spirit reigning in our lives

1059
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:06,960
 as Satan tries to lure us out of a relationship with God,

1060
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,000
 he fights for us.

1061
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,560
 He's fighting for you and you don't have to sin.

1062
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,940
 You never have to give in to temptation.

1063
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:16,800
 You can surrender to the Spirit.

1064
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,600
 You can yield to the Spirit and you will have victory

1065
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:21,560
 'cause First Corinthians 10, 13 says,

1066
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:25,320
 no temptation has seized you except what is common to man.

1067
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:26,880
 And God is faithful.

1068
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:29,760
 He will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you can bear

1069
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:32,120
 and when you are tempted, he will provide a way out

1070
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:34,280
 so that you can stand under it.

1071
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:37,660
 And what this means is for the rest of your existence,

1072
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:39,240
 if you've trusted in Christ,

1073
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:44,240
 you will never, not one time, ever have to sin.

1074
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:49,000
 It will never be like all of my options is I can only sin.

1075
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,340
 I don't have to sleep with him.

1076
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:51,520
 I don't have to sleep with her.

1077
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:52,760
 I don't have to drink that.

1078
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:53,920
 I don't have to smoke that.

1079
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,120
 I don't have to think that.

1080
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:56,280
 I don't have to buy that.

1081
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:57,560
 I don't have to worship that.

1082
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:58,720
 I don't have to get that.

1083
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,480
 I don't have to go there.

1084
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,080
 I don't have to be with him.

1085
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:03,680
 Never for the rest of your life,

1086
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:09,860
 you can trust a loving father who's crazy about you

1087
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:15,120
 and he's given you instruction

1088
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:19,400
 and you have the same choice as Eve,

1089
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:22,060
 the same choice as Adam.

1090
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:27,320
 Will you trust him or will you follow your flesh?

1091
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:30,200
 Will you follow your desires?

1092
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:33,360
 And if you're like, but you don't understand,

1093
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,680
 man, I can't stop thinking about him.

1094
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:36,820
 I can't stop sleeping with her.

1095
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:38,260
 I can't stop looking at porn.

1096
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:44,560
 God in you can, period.

1097
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:49,280
 And so in summary, the consideration of sin is temptation.

1098
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:52,240
 The consequence of sin is death.

1099
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:58,420
 And the cure for sin, beautiful, amazing,

1100
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:04,340
 incredible, complete cure for sin is Jesus Christ,

1101
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:06,940
 the son of God, your savior.

1102
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:11,820
 One day growing up, we would go to this swimming pool

1103
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:16,460
 all the time and on this particular day,

1104
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:19,920
 there was this girl who was clearly babysitting.

1105
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:22,040
 She had a kid with her who was not hers

1106
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:24,760
 and he was a little older than a toddler.

1107
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:27,320
 Like I remember, he was a little too old to have floaties,

1108
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:28,720
 but he did have floaties.

1109
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:31,440
 And so he's like rolling around the pool with these floaties

1110
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,560
 and he's just a bad kid, man.

1111
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:34,740
 I mean, he was acting crazy

1112
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:36,600
 and the lifeguard kept blowing the whistle.

1113
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,680
 You know, he'd run and the lifeguard blow the whistle

1114
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:40,920
 and he'd just look at him and stick out his tongue and run.

1115
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:43,180
 And I was like, gosh, who's kid is this, you know?

1116
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:48,180
 And he kept just kind of making faces at the lifeguard,

1117
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:51,460
 making fun of the lifeguard, taunting the lifeguard,

1118
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:53,720
 rejecting the wisdom of the lifeguard.

1119
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:57,400
 And so finally the lifeguard comes down off the stand,

1120
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:00,400
 he goes, has a conversation with the babysitter.

1121
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:03,200
 Like, hey man, you gotta, you know, we can't have this.

1122
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:06,600
 And so she eventually leaves.

1123
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:08,440
 She's packing up her stuff, she's going to leave.

1124
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:09,560
 She takes off his floaties,

1125
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:11,120
 she turns her back for a moment.

1126
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:13,900
 The kid runs to the pool,

1127
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:17,020
 jumps in the pool and he's flailing.

1128
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:19,660
 Can't swim, didn't realize he didn't have his floaties on.

1129
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:25,420
 Lifeguard throws the lifesaver, the little ring,

1130
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:27,060
 and then jumps in.

1131
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:30,540
 And then with everything, swims to that kid,

1132
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:34,700
 the kid that had been taunting him the entire time.

1133
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:39,700
 The kid that had been just completely rejecting his wisdom

1134
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:41,960
 the entire time, he's now saving, moving toward,

1135
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:44,800
 with all of his might, with everything he can,

1136
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:48,180
 with all of his being, to save that child.

1137
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:56,060
 As some of you, you're here and you're flailing in your sin.

1138
00:49:56,060 --> 00:50:00,520
 Can't swim, you're drowning in it.

1139
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:06,000
 And God in all of his might is moving towards you.

1140
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,020
 Jesus Christ was the greatest act and example

1141
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:15,020
 of someone moving toward you to save you in the gospel.

1142
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:22,240
 So when you came in, you got a little lifesaver mint.

1143
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,500
 Did you guys get that?

1144
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:26,560
 Anybody eat it?

1145
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:28,780
 Come on.

1146
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:30,360
 (congregation laughing)

1147
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:31,780
 Resist the urge.

1148
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:34,700
 And these things don't last around me.

1149
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:37,340
 If I see one, you know, I'm like, it's like candy.

1150
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:39,380
 It's like medicine that you need to take.

1151
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:42,820
 But I don't want you to eat that one.

1152
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:45,700
 Whoops.

1153
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:49,940
 I want you to save that one.

1154
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:51,220
 I want you to put it somewhere,

1155
00:50:51,220 --> 00:50:53,340
 and I want it to serve as a reminder to you

1156
00:50:53,340 --> 00:50:57,900
 that God is moving towards you in temptation,

1157
00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:01,260
 that he has something better for you,

1158
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:06,260
 that he's a loving father, offering you something better

1159
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:10,300
 than your urges may present to you in the moment.

1160
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:12,820
 So put it somewhere where you're gonna see it.

1161
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:16,540
 Put it on your dashboard or there by your speedometer

1162
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:18,380
 or wherever you want where you're gonna see it

1163
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:22,380
 on a regular basis to serve as a reminder

1164
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:27,380
 that Christ is your savior, that God is moving to you,

1165
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:30,780
 and you do not need to follow your impulses

1166
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:33,620
 and your urges and feed your preferences

1167
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:35,240
 and indulge your flesh.

1168
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:37,240
 You can hold out for something better

1169
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:40,460
 because I know no greater way to overcome temptation

1170
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:44,680
 than to find a superior satisfaction in our savior.

1171
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:49,100
 If you believe that God has something better for you,

1172
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:52,840
 you will not eat the mint.

1173
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:56,140
 If you believe that the father, a trusting,

1174
00:51:56,140 --> 00:51:58,660
 a father you can trust, a loving dad

1175
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:00,460
 has something good for you,

1176
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:05,260
 you will not follow the urge in a moment.

1177
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:07,900
 And if you don't, you will.

1178
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:12,460
 You will, you'll do what you want when you wanna do it.

1179
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:13,400
 Satanic.

1180
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:15,980
 Let me pray for us.

1181
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:24,460
 Father, would you strengthen our resolve

1182
00:52:24,460 --> 00:52:26,580
 to follow you, your spirit in us.

1183
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:29,060
 God, you reign.

1184
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:33,220
 And we praise you with our lives.

1185
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:36,340
 We want to praise you with our whole lives,

1186
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:38,340
 with the way we steward your resources,

1187
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:40,400
 with the things that we give thoughts to,

1188
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:44,980
 the way that we feed our appetite, the way that we date,

1189
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:46,580
 the way that we commune in fellowship,

1190
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:48,900
 the way that we hang out, the way that we work.

1191
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:51,800
 Would all of these things be acts of worship to you?

1192
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:56,180
 That we would not conform any longer

1193
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:57,860
 to the patterns of this world, God,

1194
00:52:57,860 --> 00:53:00,620
 but by your spirit we would be transformed.

1195
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:03,740
 By the renewing of our mind,

1196
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:06,020
 that we would be able to test and approve

1197
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:09,320
 what your will is, your good, pleasing,

1198
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:12,640
 and perfect will help us, God.

1199
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:16,780
 Thank you for your provision of Jesus Christ.

1200
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:20,100
 As we come to the altar to worship you,

1201
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:23,000
 help us to lose the world

1202
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,460
 so that we might offer you our entire soul.

1203
00:53:25,460 --> 00:53:26,300
 Amen.

1204
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:30,180
 You guys like love letters?

1205
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:33,820
 I don't know if you guys did this,

1206
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:37,780
 but in a time I shouldn't have been dating,

1207
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:42,020
 you know, in high school you just write those letters

1208
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:44,580
 and get one and make the swap,

1209
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:46,220
 figure out creative ways to fold 'em.

1210
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:47,660
 Maybe just me, I don't know.

1211
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:52,420
 It's just cool to read something.

1212
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:54,860
 Maybe you haven't, maybe you haven't been there yet,

1213
00:53:54,860 --> 00:53:58,100
 and that's honestly God's grace to you, I assure you,

1214
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:00,060
 'cause those letters for me represented

1215
00:54:00,060 --> 00:54:03,340
 a lot of heartbreak, but I will say,

1216
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:05,260
 it's cool to read something to know

1217
00:54:05,260 --> 00:54:07,140
 that somebody really cares about you,

1218
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:11,100
 and you're special to them, and you matter to them.

1219
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:13,860
 You have this amazing love letter.

1220
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:17,620
 And it is the single greatest way, I think,

1221
00:54:17,620 --> 00:54:21,820
 to overcome the lies of temptation is with the truth,

1222
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:23,580
 and you've gotta know this book,

1223
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:26,340
 you've gotta figure out a way to get this in here,

1224
00:54:26,340 --> 00:54:28,020
 and more importantly in here,

1225
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:31,060
 because when Jesus was tempted, right,

1226
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:34,060
 on the Mount of Temptation, Satan is right there,

1227
00:54:34,060 --> 00:54:36,580
 the full manifestation of evil in front of him.

1228
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:40,220
 He responds three times with truths from Deuteronomy,

1229
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:44,340
 and that's how he overcame temptation.

1230
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:46,620
 He's modeling something for us.

1231
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:48,980
 And some of you right now,

1232
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:52,380
 you're battling thoughts of shame and guilt,

1233
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:54,540
 and I just want to remind you

1234
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:57,620
 that God knows every single thing that you've done.

1235
00:54:57,620 --> 00:54:59,980
 He's moving towards you, and he loves you,

1236
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:04,460
 and it is for his joy, to his delight to forgive you.

1237
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:07,220
 To his delight.

1238
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:09,940
 He takes pleasure in forgiving you, man.

1239
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:13,020
 He cannot wait to forgive you and make you the next,

1240
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:14,300
 I mean, it's awesome, man.

1241
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:18,140
 He cannot, he's right now like,

1242
00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:20,300
 please let me forgive you, like repent,

1243
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:21,900
 like I can't wait to forgive you,

1244
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:25,420
 and restore you, and make something amazing out of you,

1245
00:55:25,420 --> 00:55:27,860
 with your whole life, to do something incredible.
