[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760]   (dramatic music)
[00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.340]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:19.140]   - All right, let's go.
[00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.060]   Welcome, friends, in the room in Dallas.
[00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.080]   Those who braved all the crazy traffic
[00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.180]   in the last couple days, and friends in El Paso,
[00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.180]   Fayetteville, Phoenix, Austin, Houston, go Strohs,
[00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.200]   and wherever you are joining and listening in.
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.360]   As we continue this series, Ready to Offer Romance,
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.080]   I'm gonna start by telling a little bit of a story.
[00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.320]   A couple years ago, went to the doctor
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.480]   for my annual physical,
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.840]   and which is always an interesting experience,
[00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.880]   and got there and had that experience
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.640]   where the doctor tells you, hey, step on the scale,
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.500]   we're just gonna check, and it's kinda that moment of truth,
[00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.160]   and you step up there, and it was like a scene
[00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.560]   from Heavyweights came back, because he was like,
[00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.600]   step on the scale, okay, wait, step on the scale,
[00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.040]   step back on the scale here for just a second,
[00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.000]   and he looked at the number,
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.320]   and then he looked down at his paper,
[00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.400]   and he goes, you know, the last two times you've come in,
[00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.800]   you've put on like 10 pounds each time,
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.400]   let's talk about your weight.
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.980]   It's like, let's talk about your weight.
[00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.840]   It's called muscle, is what it is,
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.200]   and it was not at all the case,
[00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.000]   and it was one of those scenarios where he was like,
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.960]   hey, you know, tell me, exercise, and what are you doing,
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.440]   and it's like, look, dude, we got little kids,
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.440]   it's a little hard to find time to exercise right now,
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.280]   I just prefer wearing bigger shirts,
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.140]   and so that's my offense right now,
[00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.120]   and he began to walk through, you know,
[00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.060]   it's important to stay in shape and get in shape,
[00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.640]   so that led me to like, man, I need to get back in shape
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.160]   and begin to do that, and there's that experience
[00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.560]   where if you have been out of shape before,
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.880]   probably you have, you go back into the gym,
[00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.640]   or you go back to running or doing things
[00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.240]   that you've done before, and what seemed at some point
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.120]   in the past to be easy, and you could lift that weight,
[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.960]   or you could, you know, run a mile,
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.920]   all of a sudden becomes like, oh my gosh,
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.320]   what has happened to me, how did I get so out of shape?
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.840]   And the answer, for all of us, is pretty elementary
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.880]   or pretty simple, right, like if someone came up to you
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.280]   and they were like, hey, I got out of shape,
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.320]   I don't know how, you would say,
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.820]   well, have you been exercising, have you been eating,
[00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.480]   you would immediately connect the dots,
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.800]   there's no mystery in your mind,
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.000]   or mystery in any of our minds,
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.040]   anytime we find ourselves no longer in shape,
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.440]   and the reason I start there is tonight,
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.520]   we are continuing this look at Song of Solomon
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.800]   as it relates to the idea of love and romance
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.680]   and everything that God has to say,
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.520]   and we have an expression as it relates to love
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.160]   that someone will fall in love with another person,
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.420]   and there's also an increasingly popular expression
[00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.720]   that people will cite even as a reason for divorce
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.560]   that I fell out of love, I'm no longer in love.
[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.500]   What does that have to do with in shape and all that?
[00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.040]   Well, in the same way that I would say,
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.620]   hey, I'm not in shape, you would say,
[00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.920]   well, I know how that happened, or how you got there,
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.960]   and how you get back in shape,
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.440]   and yet people don't make the same connection
[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.040]   when it comes to love.
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.500]   When someone says, hey, we were in love and we were married,
[00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.160]   and then they end up saying,
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.760]   you know, we're just not in love anymore,
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.480]   most of us don't connect the dots
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.600]   that just like being in shape,
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.640]   you do certain things to stay in shape,
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.880]   there are certain things biblically,
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.880]   it says you do to stay in love.
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.820]   That just like, in that scenario,
[00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.180]   you would exercise and you eat right,
[00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.280]   and that's where you do in shape.
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.640]   The Bible says there are things
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.920]   that you don't just stay in love and neutral,
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.540]   there are things that you do to stay in love.
[00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.540]   It is easy to fall in love,
[00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.660]   all you gotta have is a pulse, a pulse and a person.
[00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.840]   You got it, you can fall in love.
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.260]   But it takes certain things in order to stay in love,
[00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:48.180]   and I know in the room, you're like,
[00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.820]   that's crazy right now, not us, baby,
[00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:50.860]   we're gonna be in love for whatever,
[00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.920]   no matter what happens, we got this.
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.120]   No, you don't, and there are certain things
[00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.940]   that are characteristics that you need to know,
[00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.020]   but here's what the world will tell you.
[00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:02.080]   They're like, hey, if you fell out of love,
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.620]   you probably were never in real love to begin with.
[00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.880]   And it is not true.
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.740]   Generally, almost every scenario,
[00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:13.180]   in fact, not I mean almost, every scenario
[00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.220]   where someone says we were in love,
[00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.820]   and 50% of marriages are this way.
[00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.100]   Like people generally don't just go like,
[00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:20.460]   hey, we're getting married on a whim,
[00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:21.460]   she was there, and I was like,
[00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:23.020]   hey, what are you doing, let's get married.
[00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.380]   They generally get married when they're like,
[00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.140]   man, I love this person, and then in a short time later,
[00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:29.800]   they're standing in front of the person
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.020]   sometimes they've had children with,
[00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.760]   and they say, I don't love you,
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.180]   I don't want any part of you in my life.
[00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.460]   And I had fallen in love, but I'm no longer in love with you,
[00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.260]   but most of us don't connect the dots
[00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.320]   that there are certain reasons why that is the case.
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.620]   So tonight, we're gonna explore
[00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:49.980]   the more difficult of the two.
[00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:51.740]   Falling in love is easy.
[00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.780]   Staying in love requires certain things,
[00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.100]   and biblically, there are things
[00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.340]   that we're given all throughout the Bible,
[00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:59.860]   but specifically in Song of Solomon,
[00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.160]   which is the book that we've been in,
[00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.700]   there are things that are laid out
[00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.340]   that are a part of if you're gonna have
[00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.860]   a love story that lasts, we'll be there.
[00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.180]   So if you take notes, you can just write out,
[00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.060]   hey, staying in love, here's three things
[00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.200]   that are involved every time a relationship stays in love.
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.080]   So I don't know if you're dating, if you're engaged,
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.980]   if you're married, wherever you are in the room,
[00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:18.040]   if you hope to have a relationship that lasts someday,
[00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.780]   these are things that are going to be a part
[00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.820]   of any healthy marriage, regardless, really,
[00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.700]   even of what you believe in terms of faith,
[00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.140]   though that's probably, not even probably,
[00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:29.620]   is more important than any marriage you're gonna have.
[00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.260]   But if you're gonna have any type of relationship
[00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:32.840]   and love that lasts, these are going to be
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:33.680]   a part of each of them.
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:34.580]   So here's what we're gonna do.
[00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:39.020]   I'm gonna start in chapter six, verse 13 of Song of Solomon,
[00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:40.860]   and we're gonna read through the text,
[00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.880]   and then I'm gonna give three takeaways.
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.460]   Song of Solomon, if you're just joining us,
[00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.940]   rated R for romance, is because, we named it that
[00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:50.600]   because this series, unlike maybe any series we've ever done
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.140]   is a look at a book that is very rated R.
[00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:56.360]   What do I mean by that, why do I say that?
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.520]   The book of Song of Solomon was so erotic
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.920]   that young Hebrew boys and girls were not allowed
[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:06.480]   to read the book until they were 30 or married.
[00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:07.960]   Think about that.
[00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.840]   If you're under the age of 30, and you're an Orthodox Jew
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.600]   still, and you're not married, you can't read it.
[00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.520]   This means in Solomon's day, when people were like,
[00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:15.680]   and they weren't sneaking in Playboy,
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.560]   they're like pulling in Song of Solomon
[00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.880]   as a teenager into their tent while they're living there.
[00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:21.420]   They're like, dude, oh my gosh.
[00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:23.460]   And you may have come in thinking,
[00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:24.980]   man, God is not about sexuality,
[00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:26.380]   he's not about intimacy in marriage,
[00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:30.080]   he's not about romance, God invented all of that,
[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.220]   and he is very pro that.
[00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:32.960]   So we've been exploring that inside of this book,
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.560]   but he's for that in the context of marriage.
[00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.520]   So far, to catch you up, we looked at chapters one through
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:41.320]   six, where we saw the attraction stage,
[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.300]   then we saw the dating, or kind of the courtship,
[00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:44.280]   as they're getting to know each other,
[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.380]   and moving towards marriage.
[00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:47.960]   Then we saw engagement, and the honeymoon night,
[00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:51.520]   and it was steamy, and then we moved into conflict,
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:54.080]   which is a part of any healthy relationship.
[00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.600]   And tonight, we are going to explore what it looks like
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:57.660]   to stay in love.
[00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:01.340]   Let me just preface this, if there by chance are any
[00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:03.160]   children here, which there shouldn't be,
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.800]   but if there are, this would be a good time to go get
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.600]   a snow cone or something, because this chapter
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:12.200]   has been named by scholars the most erotic section,
[00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:17.020]   not just in this book, but in all of the Bible.
[00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:19.140]   So it is about to get real, people.
[00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:22.360]   And I will start in verse 13, and you'll see exactly
[00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:24.280]   kind of what I mean by that, and we'll read through
[00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:26.180]   the exchange that these two people have
[00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:28.100]   in this relationship.
[00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:31.300]   One last thing, in case again you are joining us,
[00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:34.740]   Song of Solomon is a song between a guy and a girl,
[00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:37.260]   and they kind of go back and forth between one another.
[00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.340]   Every now and then, like their friends chime in,
[00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:41.100]   but think Romeo and Juliet, if you will,
[00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:43.880]   as they just sing back and forth to one another.
[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.640]   So verse 13, the guy speaking says this.
[00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:52.740]   Turn, O turn, to his lady, O perfect one.
[00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:55.140]   This is after they're married, after a little bit of time
[00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:57.440]   has gone by and they're no longer newlyweds,
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:00.000]   and they're just continuing to deepen in relationship.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.520]   This section we're looking at, he starts with him saying,
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:06.120]   hey turn, turn, O perfect one, turn that I may stare at you.
[00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:09.680]   Not a great pickup line, gentlemen, for a girl
[00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:12.500]   that you're just meeting, but appropriate in marriage.
[00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:15.020]   So he's like, hey girl, let me look at you.
[00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:17.460]   Girl, you are so fine, that's where he's beginning.
[00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:19.560]   Verse, or the next verse, she says,
[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:22.240]   why do you gaze upon the perfect one
[00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:24.580]   like the dance of Mahanayn?
[00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:28.560]   Mahanayn, virtually every theologian studying this week
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:31.440]   says that she is now, the dance of Maharayn
[00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:33.040]   is something that she is now engaging in
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:35.480]   where she is dancing seductively before her husband.
[00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:37.480]   This is like a strip tease, if you will,
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:40.240]   that she is doing, or at least a naked dance
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.400]   in front of her husband, and he's about to praise
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:45.320]   all of her body, way before, that's what the next verses are
[00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:48.220]   of him laying out, you got this, and girl, you got this.
[00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:49.800]   Way before John Mayer came over with your body
[00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:51.480]   as a wonderland, Solomon was going,
[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:54.640]   hey, I love the way your hair falls to your hips.
[00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:56.640]   And here's what he says, verse one,
[00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:59.400]   as she dances in front of him,
[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:01.640]   how beautiful are your feet, your sandaled feet,
[00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:03.300]   O nobleman's daughter.
[00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:05.920]   The curves of your thighs, or your hips,
[00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:08.680]   your translation may have, are like jewels.
[00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:11.160]   The work and the hands of a master craftsman.
[00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.220]   Girl, I like your legs and your hips, Shakira, Shakira.
[00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:18.100]   Your navel is a round mixing bowl,
[00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:20.720]   may it never lack mixed wine.
[00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:25.100]   This word navel is translated in one of two ways.
[00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:27.560]   Either belly button, which most scholars don't think
[00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:30.480]   makes sense because he talks about her belly next,
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:33.720]   or her vagina, and virtually every scholar that I read
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:36.000]   said that's what he is saying here.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:36.840]   Let's keep moving.
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:40.520]   Okay, your belly is like a mound of wheat
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:43.160]   encircled by the lilies.
[00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:46.120]   Not always the best compliment to give a lady.
[00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:49.440]   You know, you've got a wheat belly, that's what you got.
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.920]   Here's what he's saying, he's likely talking
[00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:52.760]   about the color of it, like wheat would be bound together
[00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:54.120]   in the shape and the color of it,
[00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:57.080]   and he's saying it's like this bronze-tanned stomach
[00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:58.840]   that smells good, encircled by lilies.
[00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:02.640]   Your breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle.
[00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:06.160]   Your neck is like a tower made of ivory, this slender neck.
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.540]   Your eyes are like the pools of Heshbon,
[00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:09.960]   by the gate of Bath Ruben.
[00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:11.920]   Heshbon was just a city known for its beautiful
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:13.800]   and calm pools.
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:18.360]   Your nose is like the Tower of Lebanon overlooking Damascus.
[00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:21.000]   Again, probably not the compliment that I would give,
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.880]   but dude, Solomon's a nose guy, man.
[00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:27.160]   Okay, your head crowns you like Mount Carmel,
[00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:28.740]   which was the most beautiful place
[00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:30.440]   that sat atop all of Palestine.
[00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:33.340]   Your locks of your hair, or the locks of your hair
[00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:35.240]   are like royal tapestries.
[00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:38.300]   The king is held captive in its tresses.
[00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:41.180]   How beautiful you are, how lovely, oh love,
[00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:42.700]   with all of your delights.
[00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:45.400]   Your stature is like a palm tree,
[00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:49.020]   and your breasts are like clusters of grapes.
[00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:52.060]   I want to-- (audience laughing)
[00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:53.900]   I want to climb that palm tree
[00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:55.700]   and take hold of its fruit stalks.
[00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:59.720]   I don't know if I even need to explain that verse.
[00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:04.200]   May your breasts be like the clusters of grapes
[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:05.900]   and the fragrance of your breath.
[00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:07.180]   Be like apricots.
[00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:09.580]   May your mouth be like the fine or best wine
[00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:12.220]   flowing smoothly for my beloved,
[00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:15.340]   gliding gently over our lips as we sleep
[00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:16.820]   or make love together.
[00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:19.060]   So he goes through, he praises her from her feet
[00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:20.820]   to her head, head, shoulders, knees, and toes.
[00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:22.660]   These are all the things that I love about you,
[00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:25.420]   and he just praises her as she dances seductively
[00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:26.540]   in front of him.
[00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:29.220]   And in response, she said, "I and my beloveds
[00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:32.940]   "and his desire, and he desires me."
[00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:34.900]   The word desire, you may feel like,
[00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:35.800]   oh, she said that before.
[00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:38.780]   That is the only time, other than in Genesis chapter three,
[00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:41.060]   that word is used in all of the Bible.
[00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:42.900]   The other time it was used was with Cain,
[00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:44.020]   if you know the story of Cain and Abel,
[00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:46.240]   and God shows up to Cain and basically is like,
[00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:49.720]   hey, sin's desire is to consume you.
[00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:51.280]   And she uses that word here and says,
[00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:54.060]   hey, I and my husbands, and dude, there is no mistaking,
[00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:56.500]   this man, he loves his lady,
[00:11:56.500 --> 00:12:00.180]   and he wants to be all up in this
[00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:01.820]   and climb that palm tree.
[00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:04.540]   So she's just a confidence security
[00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:06.540]   as they move intimately towards one another,
[00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:08.500]   and they're making love together.
[00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:11.180]   And then we're told a scene happens shortly after that.
[00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:14.620]   The next scene is of them sitting in the palace,
[00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:16.460]   and the wife basically saying,
[00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:18.160]   hey, here's what I wanna do.
[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:19.700]   I've planned a getaway.
[00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:21.980]   So next scene, verse 11.
[00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:23.580]   Come, my beloved.
[00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:24.940]   Let us go to the countryside
[00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:27.340]   and let us spend the night in the villages.
[00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:29.060]   Let's go out to a bed and breakfast.
[00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:31.360]   Let's get away from all the hustle and bustle of town
[00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:33.220]   and all the work and all the responsibilities.
[00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:34.740]   Let's go away from the city.
[00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:38.580]   Let us rise early in the morning and go to the vineyards
[00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:40.580]   and see if the vines have budded,
[00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:42.580]   see if their blossoms have opened,
[00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:44.780]   and if the pomegranates are in bloom.
[00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:47.060]   There I will give you my love.
[00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:50.520]   So she further uses euphemism and says,
[00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:51.620]   hey, let's get out of the city
[00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:54.340]   and let's go make love in the outdoors.
[00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:58.660]   Verse 13, the mandrakes send out their fragrance.
[00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:01.740]   Over our door is every delicacy, both new and old.
[00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:02.760]   Here's what mandrakes was.
[00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:05.420]   Mandrakes was an aphrodisiac inside the Bible.
[00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:09.100]   And so there's another occasion where in the Bible,
[00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:12.500]   there's these two women who fight over giving mandrakes,
[00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:14.200]   Rachel and Leah, to Jacob,
[00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:15.940]   because they knew it was a form of arousal,
[00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:16.900]   it was associated with that.
[00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:18.440]   There was a belief that in eating them,
[00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:19.500]   it would just be arousing.
[00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:20.840]   So basically what she's saying is like,
[00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:22.620]   hey, let's get out of town.
[00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:25.820]   I'm gonna put on Usher, whatever song you want, boo.
[00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:29.060]   And the mood is set, the candles have been lit,
[00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:30.620]   the mandrakes are in season.
[00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:35.620]   And over our door is every delicacy, both new and old,
[00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:38.680]   which I have stored up for you, my lover.
[00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:40.980]   So she says, let's get out, let's make love.
[00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:43.540]   And I got some old things I know you like,
[00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:46.300]   and I got some new things we're gonna try out.
[00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:48.800]   Now you know why it's been called
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:51.380]   the most erotic section in the Bible.
[00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:53.060]   Verse one of chapter eight,
[00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:56.740]   where Nin told of the next scene,
[00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:59.260]   where she's just reflecting on her husband.
[00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:00.100]   It says this,
[00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:05.020]   oh, how I wish you were my little brother.
[00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:07.020]   She feels like a curve ball, left turn.
[00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:09.900]   Nursing at my mother's breasts,
[00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:11.940]   which doesn't make it any better.
[00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:14.180]   If I saw you outside, I could kiss you,
[00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:15.820]   and surely no one would despise me.
[00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:16.640]   What is she saying there?
[00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:18.660]   Hey, basically she's saying in this time in Israel,
[00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:20.300]   it was inappropriate for a husband and wife
[00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:21.980]   to show public displays of affection.
[00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:22.980]   That if you were out in the open,
[00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:25.600]   you were not to kiss the person you're married to.
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:26.700]   That seems bizarre to us.
[00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:28.060]   It was a cultural thing at that time,
[00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:29.780]   but it would be appropriate to kiss someone
[00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:33.020]   of your own family, or to kiss a sibling that was around you.
[00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:35.500]   She's basically saying, man, I wish that you were my brother
[00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:38.540]   so that at any point I could display affection to you.
[00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:40.900]   The social norms of what is appropriate
[00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:44.100]   are too constraining for me and how much I love you,
[00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:45.820]   would be another way of saying that.
[00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:48.460]   Verse two, I would lead you into my mother's house,
[00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:49.760]   the one who taught me.
[00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:52.580]   There I would give you spiced wine to drink
[00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:56.220]   and the nectar of my pomegranates, talking about sex.
[00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:59.600]   His left hand caresses my head,
[00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:01.260]   his right hand stimulates me.
[00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:06.660]   It is hot and heavy, and then she takes this turn
[00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:08.820]   as though she's very intentionally bringing up something
[00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:11.180]   she said three different times in the book.
[00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:15.660]   I admonish you, oh maidens of Jerusalem,
[00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:19.500]   or unmarried women, do not arouse or awaken love
[00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:20.340]   until it pleases.
[00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:22.340]   So everything's like, I mean, clearly,
[00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:25.540]   they're passionate, exchange, sexual intimacy
[00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:27.220]   is taking place in the midst of all of that.
[00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:29.140]   It's as though she pauses and go, hey,
[00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:32.700]   do not introduce sex or intimacy and passion
[00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:35.540]   until the right time, until marriage.
[00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:37.980]   Despite all of the freedom that they show together
[00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:39.200]   with one another in their relationship,
[00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:41.980]   it's as though she pauses and it's like, this is amazing.
[00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:44.700]   Don't introduce it until you get married.
[00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:46.980]   This is a couple that prioritizes one another.
[00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:48.140]   They pursue each other sexually.
[00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:50.620]   They do all types of things, and three takeaways
[00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:51.980]   that I wanna look at from their relationship
[00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:53.380]   just really quickly as it looks like,
[00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:55.820]   or as it relates to staying in love.
[00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:58.820]   How did they keep the romance and the fire of their love
[00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:01.240]   burning hot when it likely was years later
[00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:03.260]   that this relationship, or they're reflecting
[00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:04.100]   on their time together?
[00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:05.740]   They're not newlyweds at this point.
[00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:08.140]   And so there's three takeaways that would be a part
[00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:10.020]   of any relationship that are always involved
[00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:13.140]   in love that lasts, or in staying in love,
[00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:14.860]   not falling in love, and staying in love.
[00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:15.860]   The first one is this.
[00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:19.620]   Staying in love always involves work.
[00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:21.500]   It always involves work.
[00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:23.300]   The reason this is so important is there is this myth
[00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:25.540]   out there, and I know most of you on the surface,
[00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:27.080]   you're like, oh, no, I wouldn't believe that.
[00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:27.920]   That's crazy.
[00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:30.700]   And many of you have bought it that if I can just find
[00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:33.320]   the right person, if I just find the one out there,
[00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:35.300]   kind of the soulmate, the one that was made for me,
[00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:36.420]   then it's really gonna be easy.
[00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:37.420]   We're gonna have our ups and downs.
[00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:39.540]   You know, life has those, but for the most part,
[00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:40.920]   it's not gonna be that much work.
[00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:42.660]   It's just kinda gonna go naturally,
[00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:45.420]   and everything's gonna work out well for us.
[00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:49.420]   And the Bible says that is just not true.
[00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:51.860]   Paul even says in 1 Corinthians 7 that if you get married,
[00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:54.100]   you need to know it is going to bring trouble
[00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:57.060]   into your life, and I wanna spare you of that.
[00:16:57.060 --> 00:16:58.280]   It is going to be hard.
[00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:01.040]   It is amazing, and there is work always involved.
[00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:04.540]   If you want to stay in love, it will always involve work.
[00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:06.940]   And just because things get challenging
[00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:09.020]   in someone's marriage, or they find themselves
[00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:12.460]   in a hard time, does not mean that they should not be
[00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:15.220]   in a marriage with that person.
[00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:19.580]   Staying in love will always find, or always include work.
[00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:22.300]   People often think that, hey, man, whenever it gets hard,
[00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:23.540]   it shouldn't be like this.
[00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:26.900]   I think, you know, they just weren't the one for me.
[00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:30.620]   Or maybe this, you know, we were never really, truly in love,
[00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:32.920]   and that is a flawed way of thinking.
[00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:35.780]   The Bible says the way that you keep romance,
[00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:37.440]   or the way that romance stays in a relationship,
[00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:41.220]   includes work, pursuing each other, sacrificing,
[00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:42.740]   communicating with one another,
[00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:44.740]   working through conflict together,
[00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:46.640]   as they did in the last chapter there.
[00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:52.660]   It's as though God says this is a gift, marriage,
[00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:54.860]   which it is, that requires work every time.
[00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:58.260]   It's like in Proverbs chapter 18, verse 22, it says this.
[00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:00.660]   The one who finds a wife finds what is enjoyable,
[00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:03.780]   or a good thing, and receives a pleasurable gift
[00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:04.920]   from the Lord.
[00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:09.100]   It is a gift that comes with work in order to make it work.
[00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:10.820]   It is a gift that comes with work in order to make it work.
[00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:12.180]   So in other words, if you're gonna have a marriage
[00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:14.060]   that lasts some day, you need to know,
[00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:15.540]   it is gonna require work.
[00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:17.700]   It is gonna require you and the other person being committed.
[00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:19.380]   We are in this, we are gonna work through,
[00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:21.500]   we're gonna grow together, we're gonna sacrifice
[00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:25.620]   and serve one another, put each other's desires and needs
[00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:29.580]   in front of our own, and continue to care first
[00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:30.820]   for the other person above ourself.
[00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:32.780]   It's gonna require work, and work,
[00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:36.220]   this incredible gift, God says, that I'm giving to people,
[00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:39.060]   will also be a gift that comes with it some work,
[00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:40.740]   because there isn't, you're like, hey, I'm just looking
[00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:42.120]   for the most compatible person.
[00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:45.940]   There has never been a wedding in the history of history
[00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:48.540]   that involves two people who are compatible,
[00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:51.380]   because you have two sinners who at some times in their life
[00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:53.500]   are gonna be incompatible, not just with you,
[00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:54.740]   but with humanity.
[00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:57.020]   And so there has never been some occasion where it's like,
[00:18:57.020 --> 00:18:59.860]   man, if you just find the most perfect, compatible person,
[00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:01.900]   you are looking for a unicorn that is out there.
[00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:03.980]   It is a gift that involves work every single time.
[00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:04.820]   It's like this.
[00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:09.260]   I recently had a friend that offered to give me a suit.
[00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:11.100]   They worked, her and her husband were like,
[00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:12.760]   hey, we're gonna give you a suit.
[00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:14.280]   They work at this clothing line,
[00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:16.400]   and they knew that I'd had multiple suits
[00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:18.860]   that because of my opening illustration,
[00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:20.300]   two times that I was getting into the car,
[00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:22.120]   they ripped, and I was like, I gotta go to the tailor again,
[00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:24.300]   on the dance floor again after it, and they just ripped.
[00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:26.580]   And so they knew, hey, we gotta get you a new suit.
[00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:28.460]   So they called me, came out to the shop,
[00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:30.540]   they were like, man, let me take you over to the warehouse,
[00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:31.500]   like get in the warehouse.
[00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:34.000]   They say every single one of these suits,
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.940]   and almost as big as this section,
[00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:38.300]   there was suit after suit after suit,
[00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:39.780]   and they got black and red,
[00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:41.420]   and every color that you would imagine,
[00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:42.420]   and blue and gray and everything,
[00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:44.340]   they were like, hey, you pick any of 'em.
[00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:47.420]   And that would be our gift to you.
[00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:49.800]   But you need to know, these are all returns,
[00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:51.140]   and they've all been formed and shaped
[00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:54.740]   in a bunch of different people's height and size and weight,
[00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:56.260]   so no matter which one you choose,
[00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:57.580]   and you can pick any of 'em,
[00:19:57.580 --> 00:20:01.420]   it's gonna require work to make it work.
[00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:02.820]   In the same way, in other words,
[00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:04.220]   it's gonna require you taking that suit
[00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:05.920]   and taking it to a tailor 'cause it's too big here,
[00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:06.940]   it's too long in the pants,
[00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:09.580]   or it's too big in the waist or in the jacket.
[00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:11.220]   It's gonna require this free gift,
[00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:13.980]   or this gift to you will require some work
[00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:16.400]   and tailoring in order to make it work.
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:18.660]   No matter who you choose, if you're dating somebody,
[00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:21.100]   or if you ever date somebody, here's what you need to know.
[00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:22.540]   They are not gonna be the perfect person
[00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:23.900]   that you complete together, and it's like,
[00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:25.300]   hey, this is gonna be easy all the time.
[00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:28.780]   It is going to require tremendous work
[00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:30.060]   in order to keep the relationship
[00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:32.140]   and the love in that relationship alive
[00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:34.260]   through communication, dealing through conflict,
[00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:36.500]   prioritizing each other.
[00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:38.340]   It's gonna require work, and here's the truth.
[00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:39.380]   Guys, just like I was like, hey,
[00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:40.460]   any of these suits you could pick,
[00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:43.460]   and all of them are gonna require some sort of tailoring.
[00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:45.740]   If you're a believer in the room,
[00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:49.160]   and there's a believer who's a girl in the room or anywhere,
[00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:51.500]   you could pick really any of the suits
[00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:55.580]   or the suitors out there, and you could make it work
[00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:57.220]   if you're willing to do the work.
[00:20:57.220 --> 00:20:59.860]   And you're gonna have to do the work
[00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:02.380]   in order to make any relationship work.
[00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:03.340]   Does that make sense?
[00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:04.820]   So you can pick any of 'em, just like in that scenario.
[00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:05.660]   I'll pick any of these,
[00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:06.900]   and they're gonna require some tailoring.
[00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:09.220]   I don't care, and girls, I don't care who you pick.
[00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:12.460]   As handsome and as great as he seems like he is,
[00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:15.260]   you're gonna find out soon, especially if you marry him,
[00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:17.500]   that this brother needs some work,
[00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:19.580]   and you have to be willing to do the work.
[00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:21.420]   That's really the question in marriage.
[00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:23.980]   It's not like, will it be hard?
[00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:28.500]   It's gonna be hard, and it is the most amazing gift,
[00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:30.260]   but it will only work for those
[00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:31.700]   who are willing to do the work.
[00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:32.940]   Love always requires work.
[00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:35.580]   So here's the last thing I'll say about this point.
[00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:38.300]   What this means is that looking
[00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:40.300]   for the most compatible person for you
[00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:43.500]   is a foolish thing to spend your time doing.
[00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:46.660]   One, because no matter who it is,
[00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:48.740]   they're gonna be incompatible.
[00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:49.780]   At some level, in some way,
[00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:51.300]   they're gonna be incompatible with you.
[00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:52.720]   You're kinda just picking your problems,
[00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:53.860]   just like picking the suit pants.
[00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:55.180]   Do I want too long, or do I want,
[00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:57.300]   doesn't matter, I've gotta do work either way.
[00:21:57.300 --> 00:21:59.000]   And the second reason why it's foolish
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.420]   to look for the most compatible person is this.
[00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:04.020]   I'm gonna pop somebody's bubble.
[00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:05.520]   You're never gonna find them.
[00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:07.780]   Why do I say that?
[00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:10.900]   You're like, I'm American, I'm gonna prove you wrong.
[00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:11.740]   No, you're not.
[00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:12.560]   Here's why.
[00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:14.780]   Because in our generation, or in society right now,
[00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:16.940]   if you're between the ages of 20 and 35,
[00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:17.820]   here's what you need to know.
[00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:19.900]   There's about 70 million of you in America.
[00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:22.480]   So let's assume there's about 70 million options
[00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:23.320]   for you in America.
[00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:24.780]   Maybe you're like, dude, I'll date a 50-year-old.
[00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:26.260]   Great, you do you.
[00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:29.260]   Either way, there's about 70 million of people
[00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:32.140]   on 10 years either side of you in America.
[00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:34.140]   Of the opposite sex, there's about 35 million.
[00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:35.140]   I think they've even got slides.
[00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:36.740]   So there you go, now we're down to 35 million.
[00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:38.260]   That's the potential people, likely,
[00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:39.860]   that you're gonna get married to.
[00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:41.460]   And then inside of that, statistically,
[00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:45.180]   there's about 12 million who are Christians.
[00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:46.500]   That feels a little generous,
[00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:48.060]   people who are actually following Jesus,
[00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:49.020]   but let's go with it.
[00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:51.980]   And then inside of that group of 12 million people
[00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:54.760]   of the opposite sex, 10 years either side of you,
[00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:58.580]   then you gotta go, well, you know, let's be honest.
[00:22:58.580 --> 00:22:59.540]   Who am I attracted to?
[00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:00.740]   And probably not all 12 million.
[00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:02.900]   So let's whittle that down 'cause I'm probably a nine,
[00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:03.740]   so I'm looking for a nine.
[00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:07.780]   And so that's gonna be roughly three million, maybe,
[00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:09.700]   depending on your standard out there.
[00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:14.080]   Three million people that could be viable options for you.
[00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:17.580]   Now, let's assume you could get in contact with all of them
[00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:20.240]   because in order to find the most compatible person for you,
[00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:23.500]   you have to evaluate every single one of them.
[00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:25.080]   In order to find the most, you know,
[00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:26.740]   the best orange at the grocery store,
[00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:28.300]   I have to pick up every single orange
[00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:29.500]   and evaluate every single one of them
[00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:31.260]   or else I can't know, did I get the right orange
[00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:32.740]   or get the best orange out there.
[00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:33.780]   In order for you to know,
[00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:37.140]   I have got the most compatible person option
[00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:37.980]   that I have out there.
[00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:38.820]   You have got to spend time
[00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:40.100]   and evaluate every single one of them.
[00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:43.120]   Now, if you did speed dating with all three million of them,
[00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:48.120]   that would take roughly 15 million minutes,
[00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:52.940]   which would be the equivalent of 57 years.
[00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:55.420]   If you do it 12 hours a day and you're a go-getter,
[00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:57.840]   you would be 82 years old if you're 25.
[00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:00.340]   So point being, let me just, let me hammer it home
[00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:01.780]   'cause you're like, no, I still could find me.
[00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:02.740]   No, you won't.
[00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:04.700]   You're not gonna find the most compatible person out there.
[00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:07.300]   You're gonna marry someone who is not as compatible
[00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:08.820]   as somebody else could be for you.
[00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:10.020]   And as long as you hide behind, you know,
[00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:11.100]   I'm just, I'm still searching
[00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:12.620]   for like the most compatible person.
[00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:15.620]   You are searching for a leprechaun and a unicorn.
[00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:16.900]   That might as well be your task out there
[00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:18.120]   'cause you are not gonna find them.
[00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:19.840]   So you can't find the most compatible,
[00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:22.300]   but you can find someone, listen to me very closely,
[00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:25.900]   with the qualities that God says matter most.
[00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:29.620]   Qualities of character.
[00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:30.980]   If you're a guy, I want you to write down
[00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:33.700]   1 Peter chapter three and Titus chapter two,
[00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:34.860]   and I want you to go read the qualities
[00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:37.100]   of the type of godly woman that you should have,
[00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:38.380]   or Proverbs 31.
[00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:41.500]   If you're a girl, you should be looking for a guy
[00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:42.740]   that God says is the type of man
[00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:46.740]   that he would let lead his bride, the church,
[00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:48.340]   and those are laid out in 1 Peter chapter three
[00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:50.100]   and Titus chapter one.
[00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:51.780]   You will not find the most compatible.
[00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:53.620]   You're not even gonna find the most attractive.
[00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:54.740]   Hate to burst your bubble.
[00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:55.960]   Even if you boil it down and you're like,
[00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:56.800]   I don't need that long.
[00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:59.060]   It's like tender version, just 60 seconds a person,
[00:24:59.060 --> 00:24:59.900]   you could do it.
[00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:02.820]   It's gonna take you 15 years.
[00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:06.620]   And so looking for the most attractive
[00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:08.300]   or most compatible is not an option,
[00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:09.540]   but finding someone with the qualities
[00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:12.260]   God says matter most is,
[00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:14.860]   and regardless of who you pick,
[00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:17.580]   they are gonna be incompatible for you,
[00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:22.580]   and it's gonna require work to keep staying in love together
[00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:24.260]   and working through and growing.
[00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:25.660]   Okay, so the second quality.
[00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:31.160]   That we see is that staying in love
[00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:33.900]   requires and involves serving.
[00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:36.960]   Just like this couple worked to care for their relationship,
[00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:39.140]   they prioritized one another, they got out of town,
[00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:40.300]   they pursued each other sexually,
[00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:42.000]   they cared for one another's needs,
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.920]   they worked through conflict, we're told in chapter four,
[00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:47.720]   they also over and over again served one another.
[00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:48.800]   If you're gonna be in a relationship
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:52.400]   or have a love that stays, if you're gonna stay in love,
[00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:54.620]   it doesn't happen in neutral.
[00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:56.480]   You can fall in love,
[00:25:56.480 --> 00:26:01.180]   but it requires being intentional to stay in love.
[00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:02.020]   And if you're gonna stay in love,
[00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:03.240]   the second thing it always involves
[00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:04.640]   is serving the other person.
[00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:05.880]   Here's why this is important.
[00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:07.180]   Underneath a lot of the reasons
[00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:08.240]   why a lot of us wanna get married
[00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:09.600]   is the assumption that I'm gonna get married
[00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:11.560]   and this person is gonna meet my needs.
[00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:12.540]   You know, I'm gonna show up,
[00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:13.900]   I'm gonna come home from work in a long day,
[00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:15.600]   and she's gonna be standing there in lingerie
[00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:17.180]   with the laundry done and cooking dinner,
[00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:19.240]   and like, oh man, it's time for sex again,
[00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:20.800]   three more times before we hit bed,
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:22.240]   and that is not gonna happen.
[00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:26.200]   And it's kind of like, oh, this person is kind of there
[00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:30.260]   to be the, you know, fulfillment or the meter of my needs,
[00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:32.140]   or the girl, you have the opposite thing,
[00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:33.300]   where you're like, he's gonna come home,
[00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:35.180]   we're just gonna sit there, stare in each other's eyes,
[00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:37.180]   light candles, and just talk about our day,
[00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:40.420]   and he's gonna be like, honey, you need another massage,
[00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:43.260]   go, go, you've worked so hard,
[00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:45.520]   and it's not gonna happen.
[00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:47.780]   And you need to enter into marriage,
[00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:51.080]   and here's how you can know that you're ready to get married.
[00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:52.340]   When you're at a place where you're like,
[00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:56.020]   I do not see this as an opportunity for them to serve me,
[00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:58.620]   I want to serve them for the rest of my life,
[00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:01.900]   and there's gonna be moments in all of us,
[00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:04.100]   in everyone who gets married, where it's selfish,
[00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:06.180]   and there's sinful parts of my heart
[00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:07.460]   that don't want to serve.
[00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:11.500]   But if you're gonna enter into a covenant,
[00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:13.040]   you need to go in thinking that, hey,
[00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:15.060]   I'm in this to not get anything out,
[00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:16.700]   but to give towards this person.
[00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:18.660]   I'm not about what I can take, what I can get,
[00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:19.900]   I'm about what I can give,
[00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:22.040]   because staying in love involves serving
[00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:23.580]   the other person, and the beautiful thing
[00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:25.540]   is when two people who love Jesus come together,
[00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:29.100]   and both of them are committed to serving the other person.
[00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:30.760]   And it's like, no, no, I'm here to serve you,
[00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:32.100]   no, I'm here to serve you, no, I'm here to serve you,
[00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:35.000]   and it just goes back and forth between one another.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.340]   And it's the way God intended marriage to be.
[00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:38.700]   In Ephesians chapter five, it says,
[00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:42.660]   "Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ."
[00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:46.000]   That if you're gonna have a love that stays,
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.300]   it is gonna involve serving one another.
[00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:50.020]   They served one another.
[00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:51.100]   How did she do it?
[00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:53.380]   She dances naked in front of her husband.
[00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:56.860]   My guess is, this wasn't something that she was like,
[00:27:56.860 --> 00:27:58.500]   oh, this is just what I do every Tuesday.
[00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:02.140]   She was committed to serving her husband.
[00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:03.900]   Am I saying that that's like the application
[00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:05.940]   you should take away in your marriage someday?
[00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:06.840]   I don't know, you do you.
[00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:08.420]   But point being, she was serving her husband.
[00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:09.820]   The other ways that she served is she planned
[00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:10.980]   a weekend to get out of town.
[00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:13.900]   All throughout the book, we're told that she initiates,
[00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:16.320]   she pursues, and she praises her husband.
[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:20.820]   She tells us that she has brought creativity
[00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:23.140]   into the bedroom to serve her husband.
[00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:27.540]   He serves her by consistently communicating
[00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:30.180]   and working through conflict, by praising her
[00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:32.940]   and going over and creating a safe place to care for her,
[00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:34.520]   saying this is who you are to me,
[00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:36.340]   driving clarity into the relationship.
[00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:40.260]   They served one another over and over and over again.
[00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:43.060]   He made clear that the standard of beauty
[00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:45.060]   for him was his wife.
[00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:47.060]   And if you get married, and guys,
[00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:48.260]   this probably goes without saying,
[00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:50.520]   but just in case it doesn't, when you get married,
[00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:52.320]   when you decide, I'm gonna say I do,
[00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:58.100]   that woman now is your standard of beauty.
[00:28:58.100 --> 00:29:00.260]   If you get married and she's a blonde, you like blondes.
[00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:02.140]   If you get married and she's a brunette, you like brunettes.
[00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:04.300]   If you get married and she's tall, you're into tall.
[00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:06.300]   If you get married and she's short, you're into short.
[00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:07.920]   If you get married and she's thin, you're into thin.
[00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:09.900]   If you get married and she was formerly thin,
[00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:10.940]   you're into formerly thin.
[00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:13.860]   Whatever the characteristics, she is now the quality
[00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:16.060]   and characteristic of what beauty is to you.
[00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:21.500]   And your role is to go, man, God, I wanna feed anything,
[00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:24.380]   not right now, 'cause you're single,
[00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:27.460]   or unless you're married, I wanna feed anything
[00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:29.900]   that just allows me to continue to see my wife
[00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:32.240]   is the epitome of beauty.
[00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:34.380]   And whatever changes and whatever happens to her body,
[00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:36.240]   she is my standard of what beauty is.
[00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:38.220]   I'm gonna feed that attraction in her
[00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:40.940]   and I'm gonna starve anything that competes with that.
[00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:43.940]   This is why pornography is so dangerous,
[00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:45.940]   because it disrupts that.
[00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:47.380]   It begins to feed you, hey, you know what you need?
[00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:49.160]   It's not her, you need variety.
[00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:52.620]   You need blonde here, brunette here, you need plastic.
[00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:53.900]   Same thing with women.
[00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:55.900]   Pornography does the same thing to both.
[00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:59.660]   And the goal now, just like the goal in marriage,
[00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:01.860]   is to starve anything that competes,
[00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:05.020]   whether it's just a glancing at a woman in the office
[00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:07.860]   who bends over and you're tempted to take a double take,
[00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:08.940]   or it's pornography.
[00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:11.300]   I cannot recommend if pornography,
[00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:13.300]   which is a large struggle for many people in the room,
[00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:14.620]   is a part of your story, or currently,
[00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:16.740]   if pornography has been something you looked at
[00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:19.180]   and last week, getting Covenant Eyes.
[00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:21.180]   Covenant Eyes is a software and app that goes on your phone.
[00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:22.860]   I've spent hundreds of dollars,
[00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:24.420]   hundreds of dollars over the last decade,
[00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:26.500]   and they're some of the best money that I've ever spent.
[00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:29.340]   It's like 9.99 a month is to becoming an ad for Covenant Eyes
[00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:30.580]   but putting it on your phone
[00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:32.700]   so that you can have people in your life
[00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:34.540]   who can hold you accountable,
[00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:36.500]   sends an email to other people that help
[00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:37.780]   hold you accountable, that hey,
[00:30:37.780 --> 00:30:40.580]   what were you searching and feeding your heart?
[00:30:40.580 --> 00:30:44.620]   For him, we're not told that she had done
[00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:46.340]   all types of exercise.
[00:30:46.340 --> 00:30:47.440]   If it had been a few years,
[00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:49.180]   maybe they had kids, their stretch marks,
[00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:51.060]   and he goes, you are the standard of beauty.
[00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:52.860]   I love everything about you.
[00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:54.500]   Even that nose, like a tower.
[00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:57.020]   I'm into tower noses, I love it.
[00:30:57.020 --> 00:30:58.020]   That's what he says.
[00:30:58.020 --> 00:31:01.380]   And the same thing is true of women,
[00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:02.580]   for the men in your life,
[00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:05.420]   that you're gonna end up married to a guy
[00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:07.820]   and hair is gonna go from here to back here,
[00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:09.660]   and they're gonna have changes to their body,
[00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:13.100]   and that guy is the standard of beauty
[00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:14.620]   or standard of attraction for you,
[00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:16.100]   and you can come alongside of him
[00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:18.580]   and you can do what very few wives do,
[00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:20.340]   which is what she does all throughout the book.
[00:31:20.340 --> 00:31:23.060]   You can praise him and praise the qualities
[00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:25.100]   that you wanna see grow in him,
[00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:25.940]   and they'll grow.
[00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:30.020]   Or you can starve them and think,
[00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:30.860]   well, he didn't deserve it,
[00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:32.180]   and he didn't need that type of encouragement,
[00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:33.580]   and he needs to do more for me,
[00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:34.620]   and they won't grow.
[00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:36.180]   There was a guy, a pastor on our staff,
[00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:39.200]   who said that if you, in getting married,
[00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:42.020]   treat your husband as a loser, he will be a loser.
[00:31:42.020 --> 00:31:44.680]   And if you treat him as a king, he'll be a king.
[00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:45.820]   And some of the words that you use
[00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:47.940]   are the most powerful things to a future husband
[00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:48.760]   that you're gonna have,
[00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:50.020]   but she comes alongside, she serves,
[00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:51.580]   they serve and they devote themselves
[00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:52.420]   to caring for one another.
[00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:54.660]   So how do I know that I'm marrying someone
[00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:55.940]   or moving towards a relationship
[00:31:55.940 --> 00:31:57.420]   with someone who's gonna be a servant lover,
[00:31:57.420 --> 00:31:58.380]   not a selfish lover?
[00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:00.780]   'Cause guys, oh man, this is so huge.
[00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:02.260]   Listen back in in case you're losing it
[00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:03.300]   and you're looking at the Astros game
[00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:04.900]   or counting these things over here.
[00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:09.860]   Marrying someone who's hot, who's selfish,
[00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:13.460]   is gonna make for a relationship
[00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:17.420]   that you don't wanna be in.
[00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:18.820]   I've seen it just too many times with a guy,
[00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:20.620]   I mean, I can think of names and people
[00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:21.940]   just haven't done this the last 10 years.
[00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:23.300]   And they married someone and she's so hot
[00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:24.540]   and she's over there and she's got
[00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:26.380]   all types of cosmetic work done everywhere,
[00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:28.320]   and you're like, man, she was a former model,
[00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:29.740]   but she's so selfish.
[00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:31.140]   And the relationship and the intimacy
[00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:32.860]   that they experience in marriage
[00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:35.580]   pales in comparison to someone else
[00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:37.380]   who doesn't look quite like the supermodel
[00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:39.620]   and she's beautiful, this other person,
[00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:41.220]   but they're a servant of Jesus
[00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:42.700]   and they give themselves to their husband
[00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:43.760]   and they care for their husband
[00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:45.060]   and they encourage their husband
[00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:47.140]   and they talk about their husband
[00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:49.220]   in a positive way when they're in public.
[00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:50.700]   And they experience a relationship
[00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:52.540]   and an intimacy like just doesn't matter
[00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:53.540]   as much as you're like, dude,
[00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:55.480]   but her being hot really matters.
[00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:56.800]   It really doesn't.
[00:32:56.800 --> 00:33:01.380]   When it comes down to the relationship
[00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:02.500]   that you want to have,
[00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:06.340]   if it comes at the cost of her being a servant lover,
[00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:08.740]   how can you know they're gonna be a servant lover
[00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:12.000]   if they're following Jesus
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.100]   and they're committed to their life following Jesus
[00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:15.820]   who said he is a servant king
[00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:17.720]   and anyone who follows him will serve?
[00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:20.540]   Ephesians chapter five, Paul even commands it
[00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:22.340]   or the Bible commands husbands,
[00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:26.000]   serve your wife, lay down your life for her.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.860]   Your needs and put everything that you want,
[00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:29.920]   everything from like, hey, the temperature in the room,
[00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:32.300]   my wife thinks it's hot, I think it's freezing
[00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:34.520]   and we'll move in the direction of compromise,
[00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:36.560]   which means we keep it at whatever she wants.
[00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:38.580]   This is the type of thing that you're gonna have.
[00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:40.060]   (congregation laughing)
[00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:42.180]   And the goal is mutual, back and forth,
[00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:44.540]   where you're serving and caring and loving for one another.
[00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:48.060]   Are you in relationship with someone who's a servant?
[00:33:48.060 --> 00:33:49.180]   'Cause I know if you're dating him,
[00:33:49.180 --> 00:33:50.740]   you're probably like, they're attractive.
[00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:52.520]   Are they a servant?
[00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:53.380]   Will they be a servant?
[00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:55.140]   Are they following Jesus right now?
[00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:57.540]   There's a cliche triangle that really is,
[00:33:57.540 --> 00:33:59.120]   captures the essence of how you can know
[00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:01.200]   your relationship is gonna grow together
[00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:03.380]   where it just puts this idea of here's how you can know
[00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:05.560]   that you and him are gonna move towards one another.
[00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:08.060]   The further that you move in the direction of God,
[00:34:09.140 --> 00:34:10.700]   the further that you are gonna move
[00:34:10.700 --> 00:34:11.900]   in the direction of one another.
[00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:13.140]   And the opposite is true.
[00:34:13.140 --> 00:34:17.700]   The further that you move distance from God,
[00:34:17.700 --> 00:34:19.300]   the further you're gonna move in distance from one another.
[00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:21.460]   So here's the question I have for you if you're dating.
[00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:26.820]   Where or what direction are you
[00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:29.720]   and the person that you're dating moving on that triangle?
[00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:32.180]   Are they moving closer to God?
[00:34:32.180 --> 00:34:33.680]   Are you moving closer to God?
[00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:34.960]   If so, man, that's a great thing
[00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:36.640]   and you should be really encouraged to be like,
[00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:38.200]   this is only gonna hopefully get better
[00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:39.040]   and better and better.
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:42.820]   Or are they, be honest, moving further away from God,
[00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:44.500]   even if you're moving closer?
[00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:46.380]   And if so, you should be concerned.
[00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:50.500]   The third equality that is involved
[00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:54.580]   anytime someone stays in love is this.
[00:34:54.580 --> 00:34:59.580]   Staying in love involves sexually pursuing each other.
[00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:05.220]   Now hold on, 'cause people are about, wait a second.
[00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:06.500]   Over and over throughout this book,
[00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:08.240]   we're giving example after example
[00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:09.760]   of them pursuing each other sexually.
[00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:11.200]   I mean, dude, it gets hot and bothered,
[00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:14.160]   from a striptease to oral sex to just like them
[00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:15.960]   having sex out in the woods.
[00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:17.600]   It's like, good grief.
[00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:20.320]   Oh man, I'm so uncomfortable reading this right now.
[00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:23.560]   But they had this sexual intimacy where they pursued
[00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:25.400]   and they cared and they prioritized one another.
[00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:26.640]   Do you know, in case you're like,
[00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:27.600]   well, that's kind of a leap,
[00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:31.560]   the Bible in another place commands husbands,
[00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:33.000]   your sexual rights are not your own,
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.440]   wives, your sexual rights are not your own.
[00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:36.160]   First Corinthians chapter seven, it commands,
[00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:38.060]   in case you're like, wait, really?
[00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:39.140]   In order to have love that lasts,
[00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:40.060]   you have to have sex involved?
[00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:44.820]   Yes, a husband should give to his wife her sexual rights.
[00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:46.920]   And likewise, a wife to her husband.
[00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:49.700]   It's not the wife who has the rights of her own body,
[00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:50.540]   but the husband.
[00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:53.760]   In the same way, it's not the husband
[00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:58.020]   who has the rights to his own body, but the wife.
[00:35:58.020 --> 00:36:01.060]   Do not deprive each other except for by mutual agreement
[00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:03.160]   for a specified time so that you may
[00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:04.860]   devote yourselves to prayer.
[00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:08.320]   Now Paul says, the only circumstances under which
[00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:10.680]   you should reject one another is if you're spending
[00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:13.300]   time in prayer, which, side note, guys,
[00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:16.860]   if you get married someday and you're excited
[00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:18.820]   about moving forward, hopefully that night,
[00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:21.820]   getting lucky, I would not introduce this idea
[00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:24.700]   of like, hey, well, we're not, is this a prayer night?
[00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:25.700]   Is that what this is?
[00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:28.940]   Has never gone well for me in the experience
[00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:31.860]   of our relationship, but Paul would say,
[00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:35.500]   and I'm playing clearly, but Paul would say,
[00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:38.280]   hey, do not deprive one another sexually in marriage.
[00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:39.640]   Your rights are no longer your own,
[00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:41.800]   and his rights are no longer his own.
[00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:44.600]   That you're to give yourselves to one another.
[00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:47.600]   It is commanded, and every time that love lasts
[00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:49.640]   over and over, and there's so many psychological studies,
[00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:52.240]   even the secular world, outside of anything related
[00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:57.240]   to church says, is that love that lasts involves pursuing
[00:36:57.240 --> 00:36:59.040]   and caring for one another sexually,
[00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:00.600]   and there's gonna be extreme scenarios
[00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:03.120]   where somebody gets sick, or there's seasons of life
[00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:07.940]   where that's not possible, but by and large,
[00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:10.140]   most of the sexless marriages in America,
[00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:12.160]   and there's about 25% that are,
[00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:16.660]   are not because of somebody in some crazy tragedy
[00:37:16.660 --> 00:37:21.660]   or accident, they're because they didn't pursue one another,
[00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:24.540]   and all of a sudden, that flame just went cold.
[00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:25.940]   Sexual intimacy will always involve that.
[00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:27.740]   Here's what you need to know, though.
[00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:29.340]   The temptation here is gonna be to think,
[00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:33.240]   well, in order for that to remain red hot,
[00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:35.080]   I need to introduce sex, and I need to make sure
[00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:37.160]   that I'm on the same page sexually with that other person,
[00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:38.800]   so like in dating, I need to make sure
[00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:41.400]   our expectations are the same, we're sexually compatible,
[00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:42.600]   we have the same kind of chemistry,
[00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:43.560]   'cause I don't wanna get in marriage,
[00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:44.960]   and it's a big part of marriage, clearly,
[00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:46.040]   and I don't wanna get in there and be like,
[00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:47.720]   oh, we're just totally off the same page,
[00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:49.920]   and I really have a high sex drive,
[00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:51.840]   and they're just not as kinky as I'd like.
[00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:53.920]   I'm like, let's do role play, cops and robbers,
[00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:54.880]   and they're just not into that,
[00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:57.360]   and so we need to figure that out before we get married.
[00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:00.520]   Here's why that's a bad idea.
[00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:03.400]   Here's why.
[00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:06.720]   Couple reasons, one, all of your sexual drive
[00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:08.920]   and sexual desires and all that stuff is gonna change.
[00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:10.720]   Different seasons of your life,
[00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:13.320]   after she has kids, or during the time
[00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:15.520]   where it's immediately after a child is born,
[00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:17.080]   there's this long, dark winter
[00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:18.840]   where it just won't look like that.
[00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:20.640]   There's different seasons where the body's gonna change,
[00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:21.920]   where hormones, where all kinds of stuff,
[00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:25.320]   whatever sexual drive that you have,
[00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:26.660]   it's not going to look that same,
[00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:28.480]   so whatever you're like, oh, we're on the same page,
[00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:30.080]   and six months into marriage,
[00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:31.000]   not on the same page anymore,
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:32.380]   so it's a foolish thing to make sure
[00:38:32.380 --> 00:38:33.800]   that we're on the same page.
[00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:36.900]   Secondly, it's foolish because the best chance you have
[00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:39.080]   of making sure we're sexually on the same page
[00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:41.320]   is by pursuing, not sex before marriage,
[00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:45.320]   but a servant lover who's gonna be like,
[00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:47.360]   I'm going to move in the direction of the things
[00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:49.940]   that sexually are gonna serve my husband
[00:38:49.940 --> 00:38:51.760]   or serve my wife together,
[00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:53.520]   not getting on the same page about,
[00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:56.520]   oh, we're both into the same stuff before you get married.
[00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:59.960]   And the biggest reason why it's such a bad idea
[00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:03.980]   is sex is this powerful thing,
[00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:05.440]   and I know we've talked a lot about it in this series,
[00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:06.840]   but you've gotta hear me.
[00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:09.720]   Sex was given by God, and it does two things every time.
[00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:11.980]   It blinds and it binds.
[00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:14.680]   It binds you together, Paul says in 1 Corinthians 6,
[00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:16.120]   and then it glues you.
[00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:18.380]   He writes in 1 Corinthians 6, verse 18,
[00:39:18.380 --> 00:39:19.920]   there were these dudes inside of the church
[00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:21.000]   who didn't really realize this,
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:21.880]   and they're hanging out, and they're like,
[00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:24.400]   yeah, we're married, but we also go down to the temple
[00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:26.160]   every now and then 'cause our wives' sex drive
[00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:28.600]   are not the same, and we have sex with these prostitutes,
[00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:31.640]   which feels like Christianity 101, don't do,
[00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:33.480]   but Paul writes, and he says,
[00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:35.600]   don't you know every time you have sex with a prostitute,
[00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:38.120]   you are gluing yourself to her?
[00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:38.960]   That's what sex does.
[00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:40.660]   It binds you to that other person
[00:39:40.660 --> 00:39:42.920]   where there's always an exchange of them taking part of you
[00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:44.560]   and you taking part of them
[00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:46.160]   'cause it's so much more than physical.
[00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:49.880]   Sex not only binds you together, it also blinds you.
[00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:53.680]   In Proverbs chapter five, it says that love,
[00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:55.440]   let me see if I even have it,
[00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:57.180]   that love is intoxicating.
[00:39:57.180 --> 00:39:59.920]   It says basically, hey, you should let your wife
[00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:02.560]   and the wife of your youth and her breasts
[00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:04.780]   satisfy you at all times.
[00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:07.840]   Let you always be intoxicated in her love.
[00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:10.540]   Let you always be drunk in love or always drunk in sex.
[00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:12.680]   Long before Beyonce said it, Solomon said it,
[00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:14.460]   and here's why you need to know that.
[00:40:14.460 --> 00:40:16.140]   Sex, any time you introduce it,
[00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:18.080]   it's blinding your inhibitions.
[00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:19.540]   It's binding you to that person
[00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:21.320]   and blinding you to their flaws.
[00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:24.040]   That is incredibly important and powerful in marriage
[00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:25.840]   because it allows you to overlook small offenses.
[00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:28.840]   You're coming back together and unifying.
[00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:32.920]   Incredibly dangerous though is sex in the context of dating
[00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:35.080]   because the dude is throwing all kinds of red flags
[00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:36.360]   out there that you should be seeing,
[00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:38.920]   but because you're intoxicated or drunk,
[00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:42.360]   you're not able to see them as clearly.
[00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:44.880]   You're dating after having a few glasses of wine
[00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:46.000]   and you're like, yeah, he seems great,
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:47.600]   and it's like, he doesn't speak English,
[00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:50.000]   and that would be nuts, you would think.
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   In the same way, that is essentially what the Bible says.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.280]   It's like any time you introduce sex,
[00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:58.240]   you can't think clearly because that's the point of sex.
[00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:00.000]   It binds you and it blinds you,
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.200]   and you are setting yourself up
[00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:05.440]   to make one of the most important decisions of your life,
[00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:08.160]   buzzed and intoxicated,
[00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:10.600]   and this incredible gift that God has given.
[00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:12.480]   So that's the reason why trying before you bind,
[00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:15.000]   all of that nonsense is not just nonsense.
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:17.160]   It is incredibly destructive and incredibly dangerous,
[00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:19.240]   and some of you, you have stayed in relationships
[00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:22.040]   way too long because you have sexually gone farther
[00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:23.040]   than you ever thought that you would,
[00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:25.800]   and you feel like, you know, we've already gone there.
[00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:26.880]   I feel like, you know, we might as well
[00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:29.440]   just keep moving forward, and you need to break up.
[00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:31.880]   And if you're like, no, it's not important.
[00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:33.360]   We can go without sex.
[00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:34.520]   Go without sex.
[00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:37.920]   In order that you can rightly evaluate the relationship
[00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:40.880]   and whether or not it should continue moving forward.
[00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:42.960]   The second reason why, you know,
[00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:45.840]   pursuing a relationship just 'cause sexual intimacy,
[00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:47.940]   or even prioritizing that, like, you know,
[00:41:47.940 --> 00:41:49.080]   is the sex gonna be really good?
[00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:50.960]   We're kinda into all the same stuff.
[00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:52.400]   It's such a foolish thing because you know
[00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:54.040]   the percentage of time that you're gonna spend
[00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:55.360]   in marriage and sex?
[00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:57.680]   Like, it's crazy.
[00:41:57.680 --> 00:41:59.080]   It's like less than 1%.
[00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:01.560]   In other words, you're gonna spend most of life,
[00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:04.760]   and most of marriage is not just like sex and sex and sex.
[00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:06.760]   It's less than 1% on a good day.
[00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:07.580]   What do I mean by that?
[00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:09.040]   Okay, so here's some of the numbers.
[00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:11.400]   The average person is gonna spend,
[00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:14.560]   everyone above average.
[00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:19.280]   In a given year, if you had sex four times a week
[00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:22.160]   for 30 minutes each time,
[00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:27.160]   you will spend 1% of that year having sex in marriage.
[00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:31.520]   That means 99% of the time that you're spending
[00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:33.760]   with that person not doing sex.
[00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:35.320]   And maybe you're out there like, hey, four times a week,
[00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:36.640]   not us, we're doing seven.
[00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:38.140]   That's what we're going.
[00:42:38.140 --> 00:42:40.360]   No, you're not, but let's give it to you.
[00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:42.440]   You know what the statistic would be there?
[00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:44.120]   2%.
[00:42:44.120 --> 00:42:47.720]   Why would you make a decision based on 2%
[00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:49.720]   of what you're actually gonna do in marriage?
[00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:51.600]   And really, I mean, let's be honest, dude.
[00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:53.320]   It's really that important to make sure
[00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:54.920]   like she's good in bed or he's good in bed?
[00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:57.460]   Think about what you're telling yourself there.
[00:42:57.460 --> 00:42:59.780]   You're telling, I want somebody who has had so much sex
[00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:03.120]   outside of marriage that they're amazing at this act
[00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:05.560]   because they've had so many other sexual partners.
[00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:08.280]   And if that's part of your story and wherever you're at,
[00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:11.040]   man, God can heal and work in the midst of all of that.
[00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:14.180]   But the idea of like, man, she's a lady in the street,
[00:43:14.180 --> 00:43:15.960]   freak of the bed, and she's a virgin, and that's,
[00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:17.280]   that doesn't exist.
[00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:20.680]   And you're prioritizing something that is so small
[00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:22.080]   that it's so destructive.
[00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:25.580]   And it's such a foolish thing to bank a relationship
[00:43:25.580 --> 00:43:28.440]   surviving and a relationship on, but staying in love
[00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:32.700]   in marriage involves sexually pursuing one another.
[00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:35.000]   Where is the line sexually of what you can do?
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:39.400]   This is where having a servant lover and being together
[00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:41.240]   and saying, man, I want to care for you
[00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:43.320]   and I want to prioritize you and I don't want to do
[00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:45.560]   anything that is uncomfortable with you.
[00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:47.880]   That's essentially where the line is.
[00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:49.700]   Wherever you two together say, man, I'm serving
[00:43:49.700 --> 00:43:50.620]   and loving one another.
[00:43:50.620 --> 00:43:55.620]   This couple is fully indulging in their relationship
[00:43:55.620 --> 00:44:01.160]   as they pursue one another and they stay in love together.
[00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:04.320]   But today, the best chance for those of you who are dating
[00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:07.000]   or single is to make sure you are prioritizing pursuing
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:10.340]   purity as you pursue that other person.
[00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:16.340]   I think a lie that so many people believe is that,
[00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:19.900]   man, you know where great sex happens?
[00:44:19.900 --> 00:44:22.240]   Like I just need to make sure that they are great at sex
[00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:24.140]   and then we'll have great sex together.
[00:44:24.140 --> 00:44:25.640]   And so it doesn't happen in marriage.
[00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:29.020]   It happens just kind of based on how they look
[00:44:29.020 --> 00:44:30.620]   or how good they are.
[00:44:30.620 --> 00:44:33.680]   And you've never had great sex.
[00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:36.700]   And you think you have, and right now you're like,
[00:44:36.700 --> 00:44:38.960]   oh, you don't know me, I totally have.
[00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:42.460]   And you have no idea where great sex is like.
[00:44:42.460 --> 00:44:45.260]   Great sex outside of the confines of marriage
[00:44:45.260 --> 00:44:46.100]   does not exist.
[00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:46.940]   And here's what I mean by that.
[00:44:46.940 --> 00:44:48.340]   Let me explain it like this.
[00:44:48.340 --> 00:44:50.180]   Anybody like acai bowls in here?
[00:44:50.180 --> 00:44:53.340]   Okay, three of you, good, awesome.
[00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:55.100]   This would be a great illustration.
[00:44:55.100 --> 00:44:57.100]   Somebody on my team was like, hey, we gotta go get
[00:44:57.100 --> 00:44:58.660]   acai bowls, it's gonna be great.
[00:44:58.660 --> 00:45:01.220]   And I was like, it was for lunch, and it was like,
[00:45:01.220 --> 00:45:03.340]   who gets acai, that's like soft serve for lunch.
[00:45:03.340 --> 00:45:04.460]   Why would we eat soft serve for lunch?
[00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:05.780]   And they were like, no, they're so great.
[00:45:05.780 --> 00:45:07.180]   Have you ever had an acai bowl?
[00:45:07.180 --> 00:45:08.820]   And I said, yes, I've had an acai bowl.
[00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:09.940]   And they say, where from?
[00:45:09.940 --> 00:45:11.420]   I said, Costco.
[00:45:11.420 --> 00:45:14.540]   And they said, oh, that's not an acai bowl.
[00:45:14.540 --> 00:45:16.500]   They call it an acai bowl, but it's insulting
[00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:17.340]   when you look at the picture.
[00:45:17.340 --> 00:45:18.860]   That's not what an acai bowl is.
[00:45:18.860 --> 00:45:20.700]   You've never actually had an acai bowl,
[00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:22.260]   even though you think you have.
[00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:24.660]   You've never actually had great sex,
[00:45:24.660 --> 00:45:25.500]   even if you think you have.
[00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:27.060]   Here's what I mean by that.
[00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:29.520]   Because outside of the confines of a secure,
[00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:31.860]   covenant relationship, which is called marriage,
[00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:33.100]   it does not exist.
[00:45:33.100 --> 00:45:34.860]   And you may be like, no, it was really great,
[00:45:34.860 --> 00:45:36.700]   that one night stand that I had off Tinder.
[00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:38.980]   You're having Costco acai bowl.
[00:45:38.980 --> 00:45:40.580]   (audience laughing)
[00:45:40.580 --> 00:45:42.660]   I want you to hear me really clear.
[00:45:42.660 --> 00:45:44.380]   You're having a Costco acai bowl.
[00:45:44.380 --> 00:45:45.220]   Why do I say that?
[00:45:45.220 --> 00:45:47.420]   Because you know how different it is in the context,
[00:45:47.420 --> 00:45:49.260]   like sex is amazing in marriage.
[00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:50.080]   And it's not because it's like,
[00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:51.380]   oh, we're always swinging from the chandelier
[00:45:51.380 --> 00:45:52.600]   and every night's lingerie night.
[00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:54.140]   It's because you're in the context
[00:45:54.140 --> 00:45:56.260]   of a secure relationship with another person
[00:45:56.260 --> 00:45:57.580]   who's covenanted their life to you,
[00:45:57.580 --> 00:45:58.700]   saying, I'm not going anywhere.
[00:45:58.700 --> 00:45:59.540]   You're not going anywhere.
[00:45:59.540 --> 00:46:02.140]   I'm not putting out because I need you to stay.
[00:46:02.140 --> 00:46:04.220]   I'm giving myself to you because I love you in marriage
[00:46:04.220 --> 00:46:06.420]   and because no matter what, you won't leave.
[00:46:06.740 --> 00:46:08.200]   That's what marriage is.
[00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:09.300]   And there's a security.
[00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:10.540]   And if you're here and you're like, no,
[00:46:10.540 --> 00:46:12.140]   but it's so much greater here,
[00:46:12.140 --> 00:46:13.940]   you're eating a Costco acai bowl.
[00:46:13.940 --> 00:46:15.060]   And I hope you believe me.
[00:46:15.060 --> 00:46:16.500]   Those Tinder one night stands,
[00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:18.300]   those hookups from the guy off of Bumble,
[00:46:18.300 --> 00:46:20.960]   you are selling yourself short for a counterfeit.
[00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:23.140]   You're swimming in the shallow end and it's a joke.
[00:46:23.140 --> 00:46:25.520]   And I candidly, I feel bad for you
[00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:27.680]   because you think you have something that God says,
[00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:29.420]   I invented sex, I'm all about it.
[00:46:29.420 --> 00:46:31.700]   And I want you to experience levels of intimacy
[00:46:31.700 --> 00:46:34.100]   in your marriage that you cannot even dream of.
[00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:38.840]   And you've sold yourself short for a joke.
[00:46:38.840 --> 00:46:41.620]   And I don't care how much sex that you're having out there,
[00:46:41.620 --> 00:46:43.560]   apart from experiencing sex on a physical,
[00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:45.240]   emotional and spiritual level,
[00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:48.440]   you're eating the Costco bowl.
[00:46:48.440 --> 00:46:50.900]   And how tragic.
[00:46:50.900 --> 00:46:55.160]   And the God who's there, he hasn't given up on you.
[00:46:55.160 --> 00:46:56.120]   He's for you.
[00:46:56.120 --> 00:46:57.000]   He loves you.
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:58.440]   He wants you to experience intimacy
[00:46:58.440 --> 00:46:59.640]   in your marriage someday.
[00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:02.320]   But it's not a marriage,
[00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:05.260]   or it's not gonna be experienced
[00:47:05.260 --> 00:47:08.380]   apart from you pursuing purity, pursuing God's way,
[00:47:08.380 --> 00:47:09.480]   honoring one another,
[00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:11.600]   covening together,
[00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:14.320]   and experiencing the design and the place
[00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:16.480]   for which he created that binding
[00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:18.480]   and blinding thing to take place.
[00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:21.360]   In conclusion, if you wanna have a love that lasts,
[00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:22.680]   it'll always involve work.
[00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:26.880]   It's always gonna involve serving the other person.
[00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:29.880]   And it's always gonna involve sexually pursuing one another.
[00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:33.320]   God is so passionate and I'll close here
[00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:35.540]   and we can bring the band up.
[00:47:35.540 --> 00:47:37.120]   He's passionate about staying in love
[00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:38.580]   and this idea of couples staying together in love
[00:47:38.580 --> 00:47:40.320]   because God ultimately defines
[00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:42.100]   that marriage is all about him.
[00:47:42.100 --> 00:47:44.020]   He's the perfect picture of staying in love
[00:47:44.020 --> 00:47:45.180]   no matter what you face.
[00:47:45.180 --> 00:47:47.220]   So we're laying on the plane, listen to me.
[00:47:47.220 --> 00:47:50.780]   He's passionate about staying in love no matter what comes
[00:47:50.780 --> 00:47:52.380]   because that is what God is like.
[00:47:52.380 --> 00:47:54.460]   There's even a picture that we're given
[00:47:54.460 --> 00:47:55.780]   inside of the Bible of a guy named Hosea,
[00:47:55.780 --> 00:47:56.860]   where God says, "You know what I'm gonna do?
[00:47:56.860 --> 00:47:58.180]   "I'm gonna showcase to the world."
[00:47:58.180 --> 00:47:59.020]   You guys with me?
[00:47:59.020 --> 00:48:00.520]   It's a book of the Bible called Hosea.
[00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:02.320]   And in it, he says, "I'm gonna showcase to the world
[00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:04.440]   "I'm a God that no matter what my people do,
[00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:06.540]   "no matter despite all the different ways that they fail,
[00:48:06.540 --> 00:48:07.980]   "all the different ways that I should leave,
[00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:10.100]   "I'm staying in love.
[00:48:10.100 --> 00:48:12.480]   "I'm staying, I'm not going anywhere.
[00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:13.420]   "And I'm staying."
[00:48:13.420 --> 00:48:16.100]   He shows up to a guy named Hosea.
[00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:18.020]   He's a man, he lived.
[00:48:18.020 --> 00:48:19.260]   He was a prophet in the Old Testament.
[00:48:19.260 --> 00:48:20.580]   He shows up and God comes to him and he says,
[00:48:20.580 --> 00:48:22.920]   "I want you to do me a favor, Hosea.
[00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:26.780]   "I want you to go marry a prostitute."
[00:48:26.780 --> 00:48:31.500]   And we're told, Hosea, you know,
[00:48:31.500 --> 00:48:34.100]   doesn't respond like most of us would of like,
[00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:35.220]   "Come again, what?"
[00:48:35.220 --> 00:48:38.780]   Says, "Okay."
[00:48:38.780 --> 00:48:42.020]   And I've already got her picked out, her name is Gomer.
[00:48:42.020 --> 00:48:45.420]   And I want you to go marry her.
[00:48:45.420 --> 00:48:49.400]   And you're gonna have children with this prostitute.
[00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:52.940]   You're gonna marry her and not only that,
[00:48:52.940 --> 00:48:54.700]   you're gonna have a child from her
[00:48:54.700 --> 00:48:58.700]   and she's gonna have other children out of wedlock
[00:48:58.700 --> 00:49:03.200]   'cause she's gonna cheat on you over and over and over.
[00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:06.900]   And he says, "This will be a picture
[00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:08.660]   "of what the people of God do to me
[00:49:08.660 --> 00:49:11.000]   "when they chase after other gods
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:13.140]   "and they break my heart and they go after other lovers
[00:49:13.140 --> 00:49:14.940]   "and I never leave them.
[00:49:14.940 --> 00:49:19.140]   "I stay in love no matter what comes and what I face,
[00:49:19.140 --> 00:49:21.740]   "what is experience or what they do, I stay in love."
[00:49:21.740 --> 00:49:23.260]   And you're gonna go do this and we're told that Hosea,
[00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:24.900]   he goes and he marries Gomer.
[00:49:24.900 --> 00:49:26.860]   And they have one son together.
[00:49:26.860 --> 00:49:28.420]   And not long after that, we're told that Hosea,
[00:49:28.420 --> 00:49:32.580]   or Gomer, goes around town and she's sleeping around.
[00:49:32.580 --> 00:49:36.300]   And she comes home one day and she's pregnant.
[00:49:36.300 --> 00:49:39.300]   She's pregnant with a little baby girl, La Roma,
[00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:41.220]   is what they name her.
[00:49:41.220 --> 00:49:42.900]   Which means God said and he came to her and says,
[00:49:42.900 --> 00:49:44.540]   "Name her La Roma, which is not my people
[00:49:44.540 --> 00:49:48.540]   "'cause they've turned and gone after other gods."
[00:49:48.540 --> 00:49:51.140]   And Hosea is heartbroken but he continues to love Gomer
[00:49:51.140 --> 00:49:52.100]   and he continues to care.
[00:49:52.100 --> 00:49:53.700]   And then we're told that one day she goes
[00:49:53.700 --> 00:49:56.780]   and again she finds herself pregnant by another man.
[00:49:56.780 --> 00:50:01.780]   And God says, "I want you to name him Lo-Ami,
[00:50:01.780 --> 00:50:04.660]   "not received mercy.
[00:50:04.660 --> 00:50:07.700]   "Because my people, despite the fact that I want
[00:50:07.700 --> 00:50:09.100]   "to give them mercy and I want them to know
[00:50:09.100 --> 00:50:11.300]   "that I'm staying in love and I'm in relationship with them,
[00:50:11.300 --> 00:50:13.580]   "they continue to run after other gods.
[00:50:13.580 --> 00:50:16.580]   "And I want you to showcase the faithfulness of God,
[00:50:16.580 --> 00:50:17.980]   "that I stay in love."
[00:50:17.980 --> 00:50:22.300]   And tragically, I mean the book is heartbreaking.
[00:50:22.300 --> 00:50:25.500]   Hosea again goes after and we're told shortly after,
[00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:28.020]   Hosea is there raising their three little kids
[00:50:28.020 --> 00:50:30.620]   and Gomer goes again and she sleeps with another man
[00:50:30.620 --> 00:50:33.500]   and it gets so bad she's sold into sex slavery
[00:50:33.500 --> 00:50:35.500]   and becomes the property of another man.
[00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:39.580]   And we're not told exactly but for some reason,
[00:50:39.580 --> 00:50:40.700]   it's like Hosea was like,
[00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:43.340]   "I can't move forward anymore with this."
[00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:47.020]   And God shows up and he says,
[00:50:47.020 --> 00:50:49.860]   "Go again," Hosea chapter three, verse one.
[00:50:49.860 --> 00:50:51.780]   "Go again, Hosea.
[00:50:51.780 --> 00:50:53.700]   "Go and love a woman who's the lover
[00:50:53.700 --> 00:50:56.660]   "and being loved by a lover who's committing adultery,
[00:50:56.660 --> 00:51:02.260]   "just like the love of the Lord for the children of Israel,
[00:51:02.260 --> 00:51:06.260]   "for the people of God, who look to other gods."
[00:51:06.260 --> 00:51:08.300]   Then he shows up and he says, "Go again and love her,
[00:51:08.300 --> 00:51:10.460]   "just like I love my people, despite the fact
[00:51:10.460 --> 00:51:12.120]   "that every single day they make decisions
[00:51:12.120 --> 00:51:13.820]   "where they turn and they worship success,
[00:51:13.820 --> 00:51:15.660]   "they worship sex, they worship pornography,
[00:51:15.660 --> 00:51:16.940]   "they worship a dating relationship,
[00:51:16.940 --> 00:51:18.980]   "they worship whatever this world has to offer
[00:51:18.980 --> 00:51:22.060]   "and I never leave them 'cause I stay in love
[00:51:22.060 --> 00:51:23.140]   "and I pursue them.
[00:51:23.140 --> 00:51:26.100]   "Go again," and we're told that he goes
[00:51:26.100 --> 00:51:27.620]   and he's in the middle of the city and he sees her
[00:51:27.620 --> 00:51:30.140]   and she's on an auction block being sold.
[00:51:30.140 --> 00:51:31.340]   I mean, he's like sitting there, he's going,
[00:51:31.340 --> 00:51:33.220]   "That's my wife.
[00:51:33.220 --> 00:51:34.820]   "That's my wife," and he goes up and the guy says,
[00:51:34.820 --> 00:51:37.800]   "I don't care who she is, this is the price that she's,
[00:51:37.800 --> 00:51:39.700]   "you can pay it or not."
[00:51:39.700 --> 00:51:42.660]   He doesn't have enough money, we're told.
[00:51:42.660 --> 00:51:44.780]   So he goes home and he like gathers up
[00:51:44.780 --> 00:51:46.500]   some different things from around the house
[00:51:46.500 --> 00:51:48.060]   and he brings like, "Here's 15 shekels
[00:51:48.060 --> 00:51:49.060]   "and here's some of the stuff that I have,
[00:51:49.060 --> 00:51:49.900]   "will you take it?
[00:51:49.900 --> 00:51:51.320]   "Whatever the price, I'll pay it.
[00:51:51.320 --> 00:51:53.020]   "Whatever the price, I'll pay it.
[00:51:53.020 --> 00:51:55.520]   "And I'm staying in love."
[00:51:55.520 --> 00:51:58.420]   And God said, "This is just like
[00:51:58.420 --> 00:52:00.200]   "the love of the Lord for you."
[00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:03.180]   Every single sin that's represented inside of this room,
[00:52:03.180 --> 00:52:04.820]   every single dysfunctional relationship
[00:52:04.820 --> 00:52:07.020]   you've ever been a part of or are currently a part of
[00:52:07.020 --> 00:52:10.140]   in every way that all of us have failed God,
[00:52:10.140 --> 00:52:11.980]   he's a God who says, "No matter what comes,
[00:52:11.980 --> 00:52:14.620]   "I'm staying, I'm staying in love.
[00:52:14.620 --> 00:52:16.180]   "I care about my people being in marriages
[00:52:16.180 --> 00:52:17.700]   "where they stay in love and they reflect
[00:52:17.700 --> 00:52:20.300]   "the commitment that I have for them
[00:52:20.300 --> 00:52:23.960]   "despite all the failures of their spouse,
[00:52:23.960 --> 00:52:25.660]   "that I'm not going anywhere."
[00:52:25.660 --> 00:52:28.860]   And ultimately the picture of Hosea and Gomer
[00:52:28.860 --> 00:52:32.220]   is a picture of Jesus towards you and towards me.
[00:52:32.220 --> 00:52:34.780]   He's a God who says, "This covenant I will never break,
[00:52:34.780 --> 00:52:37.280]   "I will never end, no matter what you do,
[00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:39.860]   "I am staying in love.
[00:52:39.860 --> 00:52:42.860]   "And I made that decision."
[00:52:42.860 --> 00:52:45.420]   He's a God who died in your place 2,000 years ago
[00:52:45.420 --> 00:52:48.340]   on a cross and he made that ultimate commitment
[00:52:48.340 --> 00:52:50.060]   and the covenant was sealed.
[00:52:50.060 --> 00:52:52.260]   No matter what you do, if you put your faith in Jesus,
[00:52:52.260 --> 00:52:54.540]   you enter into that relationship
[00:52:54.540 --> 00:52:56.540]   'cause you're Gomer and so am I.
[00:52:56.540 --> 00:53:01.020]   In every different ways that all of us this week sinned
[00:53:01.020 --> 00:53:03.340]   and rebelled against God and were selfish and self-seeking
[00:53:03.340 --> 00:53:05.220]   and angry and lustful and prideful,
[00:53:05.220 --> 00:53:08.820]   all of them he paid for and said, "I'm staying in love
[00:53:08.820 --> 00:53:11.480]   "and I'm paying whatever the price.
[00:53:12.920 --> 00:53:15.680]   "She's mine, he's mine, they're mine."
[00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:17.600]   That's why God cares about staying in love.
[00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:19.600]   He's passionate about it and our hope in this series
[00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:21.720]   is that you will learn and marriages will be formed
[00:53:21.720 --> 00:53:24.440]   of people who stay in love
[00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:28.400]   because they ultimately are in a relationship with the God
[00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:32.680]   who through Jesus has promised there's never a moment
[00:53:32.680 --> 00:53:36.020]   where he will not be staying in love with them.
[00:53:36.020 --> 00:53:38.420]   Let me pray.
[00:53:38.420 --> 00:53:39.400]   Father, I've...
[00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:42.440]   (sighs)
[00:53:42.440 --> 00:53:52.700]   God, I just wanna pray for anyone in this room
[00:53:52.700 --> 00:54:00.780]   who's never stepped into a relationship with you.
[00:54:00.780 --> 00:54:05.400]   The most important relationship that they will ever have
[00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:12.200]   is their acceptance or begins with them accepting
[00:54:12.200 --> 00:54:14.080]   the free gift that you offered
[00:54:14.080 --> 00:54:16.080]   where you extended the invitation to anyone
[00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:16.920]   who will accept it.
[00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:19.120]   I paid for everything wrong you've ever done,
[00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:22.200]   everything all over this room that is representative
[00:54:22.200 --> 00:54:25.480]   of the ways that all of us have sinned and fallen short
[00:54:25.480 --> 00:54:28.480]   of our standards, of other standards and of your standard.
[00:54:28.480 --> 00:54:32.880]   And yet you said despite all of that,
[00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:36.600]   you paid for it by dying in our place.
[00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:39.780]   Tonight, God, would you allow what the spirit of God
[00:54:39.780 --> 00:54:43.520]   only can do, no message, no music, no person could do
[00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:47.440]   to allow people to see you're a God who's offered
[00:54:47.440 --> 00:54:49.760]   the extension of that love, who stays in love,
[00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:51.960]   who's been pursuing every person in this room
[00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:54.040]   despite everything wrong, God,
[00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:57.680]   from the moment they took their first breath
[00:54:57.680 --> 00:54:58.860]   and will be pursuing them
[00:54:58.860 --> 00:55:00.600]   to the moment they take their last.
[00:55:00.600 --> 00:55:03.200]   Father, I pray for dating relationships
[00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:05.940]   and marriages to form out of this room
[00:55:05.940 --> 00:55:07.440]   and out of men and women inside of this room
[00:55:07.440 --> 00:55:08.800]   who know you and walk with you
[00:55:08.800 --> 00:55:10.840]   and they would bring kids into this world
[00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:15.920]   who walk with you from an early age, who know you.
[00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:17.840]   I pray that you would prevent marriages
[00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:18.960]   that do not need to happen.
[00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:21.360]   Tonight, breakups would take place all over our country
[00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:22.960]   with those who are listening in.
[00:55:22.960 --> 00:55:26.440]   And I pray that you'd solidify relationships
[00:55:26.440 --> 00:55:28.640]   with people pursuing you and they would feel
[00:55:28.640 --> 00:55:32.480]   like despite all the craziness the world says,
[00:55:32.480 --> 00:55:34.480]   I can't believe you would date that way.
[00:55:35.400 --> 00:55:37.280]   They would feel just a confidence and a peace
[00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:39.680]   that comes from knowing that your way leads to life,
[00:55:39.680 --> 00:55:41.760]   your ways are not our ways, they're higher, they're better,
[00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:44.440]   and they're for our good and we can trust you, God.
[00:55:44.440 --> 00:55:46.100]   Help us to be more like Jesus.
[00:55:46.100 --> 00:55:47.360]   We need you, God.
[00:55:47.360 --> 00:55:49.240]   Take ground in all of our hearts.
[00:55:49.240 --> 00:55:50.320]   Start with me.
[00:55:50.320 --> 00:55:53.760]   We worship you now in song, amen.
