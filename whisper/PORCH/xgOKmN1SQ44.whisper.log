[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400]   What's up guys, David and JD here.
[00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.000]   What up?
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   And The Porch 2022 is back.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.100]   We're back, baby.
[00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:07.600]   That's right.
[00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.100]   And we are kicking off a brand new series.
[00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.200]   Speaking of babies.
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.000]   Oh, that's right.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.200]   Oh, you had a baby.
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.200]   That's correct.
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.600]   Which is why you're hearing from us at the beginning of this podcast.
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:16.100]   Mm-hmm.
[00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.400]   And I am not at The Porch this Tuesday.
[00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.100]   So sad.
[00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:20.600]   I know.
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.600]   Because we missed you.
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.100]   We were in the hospital.
[00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.100]   And I know this is...
[00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.000]   We missed you.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.600]   This is sad to miss the first kickoff I've ever missed.
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.900]   But it was an amazing night.
[00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:28.900]   Amazing night.
[00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.200]   And Josiah Jones brought the gospel.
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.500]   We're kicking off a new series.
[00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.100]   RIP to the old me living the new life in Christ.
[00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.600]   And last night he talked about...
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:43.400]   Yeah, well, we just want to make sure, hey, before we get to what it looks like to live a new life in Christ,
[00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.800]   have you died to your old self?
[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:46.300]   Yes.
[00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.500]   And so it was very just, I mean, an amazing night together.
[00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.900]   And we want you guys to listen.
[00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.000]   Just have some context.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.900]   Because we know it didn't start off with the normal bumper and music and all of that.
[00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:56.400]   Yeah.
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.100]   You got us.
[00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.200]   So we're so pumped.
[00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.900]   Check it out.
[00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:59.300]   Listen.
[00:00:59.300 --> 00:00:59.800]   Enjoy it.
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.300]   And we'll see you next week as we kick off a brand new series.
[00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.000]   RIP to the old me.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.600]   Good to be back at the porch.
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.500]   My name is Josiah.
[00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.100]   If we haven't met, I hope to meet you over the course of the next few weeks.
[00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:19.300]   And I get to spend a few minutes with you tonight as we just stay in this moment and as we continue to worship Jesus,
[00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.300]   not only in song, but now as we open up his word.
[00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.200]   And so let me just pray one more time as we get ready to hear from him.
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:36.300]   God in heaven, thank you for this opportunity where we get to open up your word and we get to hear what you would have to say.
[00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:37.700]   And so, God, get me out of the way.
[00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.600]   May your voice be maximized in this place and may my voice be minimized.
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:55.200]   God, thank you for what you're doing all across Dallas, Texas and our nation, this world, the people watching tonight,
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.500]   God, all across America, God, literally.
[00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:13.000]   Porch Live locations in Cincinnati and Boise, Idaho and Tulsa, Oklahoma and Austin, Texas and North Houston.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:22.800]   God, you are at work and for the very first time, the Porch Live Midland, Texas and many others I failed to mention.
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.000]   God, would you speak?
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.500]   Would you go before us in Jesus' name?
[00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.300]   Amen.
[00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:35.400]   Well, as JD mentioned earlier, we are going to be starting a brand new series next week titled RIP to the Old Me.
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:46.200]   And it's this idea that we're going to tackle just a few things that God asks us to walk away from after we commit our life to him.
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:53.400]   It's this idea that, man, when we commit to Jesus, when we say, Jesus, you're mine and I want you,
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:03:00.200]   then God begins to come in and he begins to transform us from the inside out.
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:06.200]   And I believe that that's what he's doing in this moment and in the next few moments.
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:16.300]   But before we can even ask God to transform us, we got to ask God and examine where we are with him.
[00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.900]   We got to ask that question tonight.
[00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.600]   God, where am I with you in relation to you?
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:29.900]   Before we can rest in peace to the person we once were,
[00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:36.500]   we have to begin to ask first and foremost and evaluate where are we with Christ?
[00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.700]   Where are we with Jesus?
[00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:45.100]   Before Christ can change us, we got to make sure that we have a right relationship with him.
[00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.800]   You might be asking, what does that even look like?
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.700]   For me, it started when I was a kid.
[00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.700]   I kind of heard this idea of having a relationship with Jesus.
[00:03:53.700 --> 00:04:02.800]   But then at a young age, my parents divorced and it was like a bomb was dropped in our living room.
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:08.400]   And then my life began to spiral and unravel just out of control.
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:14.700]   And women drove my need for approval, sports drove my need for success,
[00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.900]   pornography kept calling my name behind closed doors.
[00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.500]   The party consumed me on the weekend.
[00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:25.900]   Before I knew it, I was drowning.
[00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:33.800]   I had all the freedom of a college student leaving for college one afternoon,
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.600]   getting in my car, and had all the freedom of a college student,
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.300]   but not the maturity to go with it.
[00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.700]   Ever been there?
[00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:44.900]   And all those things I just mentioned began to intensify.
[00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.800]   Playing college baseball.
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:56.500]   And I remember vividly my third year of college, getting off the bus after playing a game
[00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.000]   and heading to my apartment that night and my roommates,
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.700]   who also my teammates were getting ready to go out to the party.
[00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.300]   And I just said, hey, I'm taking this one off.
[00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.800]   Why? Because I kept asking myself the question, is that it?
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.600]   Because if these things weren't going to do it anymore, what was going to do it?
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:18.500]   I just went right down the list with everything I'd been filling my life with.
[00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.300]   The things I just mentioned.
[00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:28.600]   And that evening in my apartment, I just said, God, I'm done.
[00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.900]   I'm done.
[00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.200]   I can't do this anymore.
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:38.400]   From the outside, people would think, man, this guy has it all.
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:46.300]   Playing the sport he loves, dating the girl that, quite frankly, everybody wanted.
[00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.300]   The life of the party.
[00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:56.400]   But it left me empty and unsatisfied and unfulfilled.
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:03.400]   And that night I began to see my sin for the very first time.
[00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.500]   That it was leading to death.
[00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:10.100]   It was leading to heartache and it was leading to pain.
[00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:16.900]   Proverbs 14, 12 says, there's a way that seems right to man, but that way ends in death.
[00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:26.200]   The Bible says in Romans 6, 23, for the wages of sin is death.
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.500]   Spiritually, the Bible says that we're dead.
[00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:33.700]   We're cut off from Christ, from our Creator, and destined for hell for all of eternity.
[00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:37.800]   Not because God doesn't love us, but because God can't have anything to do with sin.
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.000]   Because he's holy.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.600]   That just means he's perfect.
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:44.500]   He's without sin.
[00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:50.100]   And in the beginning, he created the heavens and the earth, and he created to be perfect.
[00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:53.800]   But because he didn't want to force his love on man, he gave them a choice.
[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.300]   And what did man do in that moment?
[00:06:55.300 --> 00:07:01.100]   He rebelled against God and sin entered the world and it sent creation into chaos.
[00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:07.500]   So therefore, we see pain.
[00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:11.500]   We're a product of pain.
[00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:18.600]   Divorce, murder, rape, disease, COVID.
[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:20.200]   See, all those things are a result of sin.
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:31.000]   Not because God is a bad God or he doesn't know what he's doing, but it's because the world's out of control right now.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.300]   And I'm looking at some of you as I share this.
[00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:39.000]   And just like me, if you continue to live in that thing that the Bible calls sin, it will kill you.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   Maybe not physically right now, but spiritually, you're cut off.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.100]   You're separated.
[00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:46.300]   You've got God on one side and he's perfect.
[00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:54.300]   And then you've got you and me on another side and we're not.
[00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:55.500]   And you know this.
[00:07:55.500 --> 00:08:06.500]   Deep down inside, when you lay your head down on the pillow as I did for many days before that night in my apartment, you know this to be true.
[00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:10.600]   That the sin isn't leading to more and more life and it's not leading to flourishing.
[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:13.300]   It's actually leading to more and more pain and heartbreak.
[00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:20.600]   And if you're to be honest, death.
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:23.000]   Google 2021 urine review video.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   I don't know if you watch that.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.700]   I like watching those at the end of the year.
[00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:33.900]   And it went on to say the question that was searched the most on Google, you want to know what it was?
[00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:36.100]   How to heal.
[00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:39.600]   How to heal.
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:44.700]   Like we know that something is wrong, something is broken, something is not right.
[00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:51.400]   We know that we need healing.
[00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:56.700]   Romans 3.23 says for all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God.
[00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:01.000]   There is none righteous, no not one, including the guy that's up on stage right now.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.700]   The glory of God is his perfection.
[00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:03.500]   That's his standard.
[00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:04.600]   And none of us are perfect.
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:09.900]   I haven't met one person that is.
[00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:17.100]   But the second part of Romans 6.23 says right before, for the wages of sin is death.
[00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:27.600]   It says but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:34.800]   Romans 5.8 says while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:39.400]   Like he didn't wait for us to clean our life up and then die for us.
[00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:44.600]   It says while we were yet sinners, he knew everything you and I would do in thought, word, and action.
[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:47.500]   Way before we were ever in our mother's womb.
[00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:50.200]   And he says I see that and I'm going to die for that.
[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:54.200]   That's crazy.
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.300]   Because he loves you.
[00:09:56.300 --> 00:10:00.000]   He's crazy about you.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.400]   For God so loved the world that he gave his one only son.
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:09.500]   That whosoever believes in him should not perish but have everlasting life.
[00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:11.100]   Put your name where it says world.
[00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:12.900]   For God so loved Katie.
[00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:14.200]   For God so loved John.
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:17.300]   For God so loved JD.
[00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:19.200]   For God so loved Ramsey.
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:22.600]   For God so loved David.
[00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:25.400]   For God so loved Josiah.
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.300]   That he gave his one only son.
[00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:34.000]   That whosoever believes in him should not perish but have everlasting life.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.700]   Romans 10.9 and 10.
[00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:42.500]   The response to what Jesus has done for you and me.
[00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:45.000]   That Jesus didn't just die the scripture says.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:50.300]   History records that three days later he rose again from the dead.
[00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:55.200]   As an anthem of saying I defeated that thing that put me on the cross.
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:57.500]   Sin.
[00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:59.500]   And I defeated the grave.
[00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:02.700]   So that you can too.
[00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:04.400]   And now the response.
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:07.900]   How do we know if we're right with God?
[00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:16.300]   How do we respond to this incredible rescue mission that God sent his only son on?
[00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:17.000]   Says it right here.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.700]   If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord.
[00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:24.600]   That he is who he says he is.
[00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:30.400]   And believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead.
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:32.700]   You will be saved.
[00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:36.300]   For with the heart a person believes and is justified.
[00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:40.900]   And with the mouth one confesses and is saved.
[00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:44.500]   See some of you you've trusted Jesus to be real.
[00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:49.800]   But you've never truly surrendered your entire life to him.
[00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:52.200]   You want to trust Jesus with your eternity.
[00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:55.500]   But you don't really want to trust him with your sin.
[00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:57.100]   Now I've been there.
[00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:02.600]   I get it.
[00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:08.900]   But tonight's the night that you can do that.
[00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:17.500]   You know deep down that it's not going to end well for you.
[00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:23.300]   That God's written eternity on the hearts of every man and every woman.
[00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:29.100]   And God has done the only act that can make us right with him.
[00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:33.200]   What he's done on the cross and through his resurrection.
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:35.900]   And he says the ball's in your court.
[00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:37.900]   Tonight's the night that you give your life to Christ.
[00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:42.100]   Tonight's the night that you surrender once and for all.
[00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:44.500]   If that's you, that's your next step.
[00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:48.600]   What I'm about to say next, like you don't even need to hear it.
[00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:52.500]   Like you just need to stay there right there where you are seated.
[00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:55.400]   And you say, hey, I'm going to wait for the opportunity.
[00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:56.300]   Because tonight's the night.
[00:12:56.300 --> 00:13:01.500]   I'm going to, I'm crossing the line.
[00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:08.800]   I'm getting out of death and I'm going to receive life.
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:15.200]   But for others, man, we've been to the porch time and time again.
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:18.300]   And we keep rehashing what was buried.
[00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:22.100]   You know that thing that you said you'd never go back to?
[00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:26.500]   Because Jesus died for it, but instead you find yourself picking it back up.
[00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:28.300]   Even though Jesus has freed you from it.
[00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:34.000]   You thought it was buried, but now it's beginning to bury you.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:42.200]   It's kind of like, I liken it to this casket.
[00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:50.700]   This casket is a symbol of death.
[00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:57.400]   The purpose of this casket is to bury dead people.
[00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:03.200]   Now that's morbid, but sit in it for a second.
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:06.600]   You never see a casket really dug back up.
[00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:09.900]   And if you do, like something went terribly wrong.
[00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:14.200]   And like Jesus is saying tonight that, hey, when I went to the cross,
[00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:20.400]   I took upon all your sin, all of my sin was put in the grave.
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:21.500]   It was buried.
[00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:28.700]   I died for it.
[00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:31.300]   And when he rose again, he showed the world that he not only died for it,
[00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:33.000]   but he defeated it.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.200]   But some of us, man, we're not living with that freedom because we keep digging things
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:42.700]   out that we thought we buried.
[00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:46.500]   I don't know what that is for you.
[00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:50.500]   Tonight, I don't know what that is for you, but you do.
[00:14:50.500 --> 00:15:00.000]   Maybe it's your achievement.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:09.900]   Maybe it's the things that are in your life that symbolize achievement.
[00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:14.300]   Like you look at a trophy and you're like, hey, it started really young when you were
[00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:17.400]   on the sports field or you were in the academic realm.
[00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:22.000]   And, I mean, you just chased one accolade after another.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:27.100]   And it just kind of moved as you graduated and went on to different seasons of life.
[00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:28.200]   Now you have that job.
[00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:31.400]   And, I mean, now you're just building the resume.
[00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:36.600]   It's just performance after performance after performance, and you're chasing money,
[00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:38.300]   the next tax bracket.
[00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:43.300]   And then it's the car, and then it's the apartment, and then it's the, quite frankly,
[00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:46.700]   it's the zip code.
[00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:50.700]   And listen, none of those things are bad in and of themselves.
[00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:54.200]   But you know that they're consuming you.
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:58.500]   And you know you run back to them to find purpose and meaning and to define you.
[00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:03.200]   And you know at the end of the day, it's keeping you from having a thriving relationship
[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:05.000]   with Jesus because I've been there.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.600]   I've chased it.
[00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:08.700]   It just keeps you busy.
[00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:13.400]   And you never really take next steps in your faith, and you don't get into community,
[00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:14.700]   and you don't ever serve.
[00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:17.900]   And it's just the next thing after the next thing after the next thing.
[00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:20.000]   Let me just tell you something.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.300]   If you're too busy to be a Christian, then you're too busy.
[00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:30.100]   And as you're examining what you want to commit to in 2022, ask yourself, at what cost?
[00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:31.700]   At what cost?
[00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:35.300]   See, for some of you, it's not performance or achievement.
[00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:40.200]   And it's broken relationships.
[00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:47.700]   And so every time you look at a picture of your family, it just reminds you of the brokenness,
[00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:53.800]   that divorce that your parents had.
[00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:56.300]   Your daddy ran out on you.
[00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:59.800]   He was never the man that you needed him to be.
[00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:07.900]   And so you pursue in relationships with other men and other women who give you one false
[00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:14.100]   promise after another only to lead you to more brokenness, and your heart is just trashed,
[00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:20.800]   if you had to be honest tonight.
[00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:27.400]   Broken relationships is what you rehash, what you dig back up, the pain in the hurt associated
[00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:28.400]   with that.
[00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:33.960]   And for some of you, it's not broken relationships, it's comparison.
[00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:40.500]   After a long day at work, you get on social media and you just start scrolling.
[00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:46.720]   And you just start comparing your life to that girl who just seems to have it all together.
[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:51.000]   She's got the next thing, and she's going here, it's like, "Hawaii again?
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.340]   Good night.
[00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:55.080]   I can't even get out of Texas."
[00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:59.480]   You know what I mean?
[00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:03.640]   And you're like, "That guy at the gym, he's getting his gains, and whenever he gets his
[00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:05.680]   — he's always got that girl next to him."
[00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:07.480]   It's like, "Come on."
[00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:14.940]   And then the body image, and you're comparing yourself to that person, and it's just leading
[00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:20.840]   you to more and more brokenness, more and more depression, more and more anxiety.
[00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:26.160]   And it's keeping you from being God's man, God's woman.
[00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:31.000]   You keep rehashing it.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.560]   For others, it's addiction.
[00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:41.240]   These chains, they symbolize the addictions that we have in our life.
[00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:43.160]   You know what they are.
[00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:48.240]   I was a porn addict for a decade of my life.
[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:54.480]   The thing you did this past weekend, the one-night stand you had, you drank too much, you smoked
[00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:59.080]   that, you took those pills, because you're trying to numb the thing that you need to
[00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:01.240]   deal with.
[00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:05.180]   And you're running from one thing to the next, just hoping that it'll give you some type
[00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:08.200]   of reprieve.
[00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:16.440]   But all it does is lead you to more and more addiction.
[00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:18.460]   And you're bound.
[00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:21.320]   You know you're bound.
[00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:31.800]   And you can't get out, because you're bound in that sin.
[00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:43.120]   You know what, Jesus, He came to die because He knew that we would be tempted to give in
[00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:48.680]   to those things, to run back to those things.
[00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:54.560]   And the good news is that Jesus paid for your sin and my sin.
[00:19:54.560 --> 00:20:02.640]   JD quoted it earlier, but he said 2 Corinthians 5, 17, "Therefore, if anyone is in Christ,
[00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:05.240]   he's a new creation.
[00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:11.760]   The old has passed away, and behold, the new has come."
[00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:15.280]   Maybe the whole point of this series that we're going to dive into tonight is that Jesus
[00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:24.200]   takes everything, He takes everything in your life and He begins to make it new.
[00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:28.560]   He doesn't take the bad that you are and make it good.
[00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:32.960]   He takes the dead person you were before Christ and He makes you alive.
[00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:39.160]   He makes you incredibly new.
[00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:44.400]   He gives you a new life and you don't have to wallow in the shame and the guilt anymore.
[00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:49.000]   Rest in peace to the old you, my bro, my daughter.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:56.640]   Girl, you don't have to live chained and in bondage.
[00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:59.360]   Some of you tonight, you don't want to share that thing.
[00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:00.880]   You know that thing.
[00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:02.240]   It's keeping you in chains.
[00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:07.000]   It's keeping you in bondage.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:14.160]   But you need to share it tonight because Romans 8, 1 says, "Therefore, if anyone is in Christ,
[00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:19.640]   he doesn't have to experience condemnation.
[00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:27.200]   There is therefore now no condemnation for those that are in Christ Jesus."
[00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:28.880]   He makes you new.
[00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:33.420]   And so some of you, man, you need to die.
[00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:43.000]   Some of us, like I did my third year in college in that apartment, I had a funeral and that
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.400]   funeral was mine.
[00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:47.760]   Like I had never really surrendered my life to Christ.
[00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:52.680]   Like intellectually, I was what I call an intellectual believer for 21, 22 years of
[00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:57.100]   my life.
[00:21:57.100 --> 00:22:01.400]   But I kept doing the same things over and over, expecting a different result.
[00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:06.880]   See, you want to know if you really believe?
[00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:09.720]   Watch how you live your life.
[00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:13.040]   Men and women always say what they think, but they do what they believe.
[00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:14.760]   You want to watch what someone believes?
[00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:16.240]   Just watch how they behave.
[00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:18.240]   It's simple.
[00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:24.360]   Jesus begins to change you from the inside out when you say, "Hey, listen, I might have
[00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:27.720]   struggled with that, but listen, I want to fight against it.
[00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:28.720]   I don't want to make excuses.
[00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:32.600]   I don't want to keep running back to that thing."
[00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:35.640]   Some of you need to die to you.
[00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:44.440]   Some of you, you need to pick up the trophy and the resume that you're building and chasing
[00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:51.560]   that next promotion and it needs to go back into the casket tonight.
[00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:56.120]   You need to die to that.
[00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:59.720]   Not because it's necessarily bad in and of itself, like I said, but because it defines
[00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:06.060]   you and it's keeping you from being who you know God's called you to be.
[00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:12.140]   Or that hurt from previous relationships.
[00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:19.960]   Jesus has forgiven you and you don't need to carry the pain from those relationships
[00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:20.960]   anymore.
[00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:21.960]   You don't need to carry that hurt.
[00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:28.840]   You can forgive others because Christ has forgiven you.
[00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:30.200]   Or comparison, man.
[00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:36.220]   Anytime you are so fixated on other people and what they're doing, their work, it keeps
[00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:38.440]   you from doing your work.
[00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:45.360]   See, Jesus takes comparison and he makes it celebration because he's created you to be
[00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:50.400]   unique and to be you and there's no one else like you.
[00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:55.220]   He takes that comparison and he celebrates what he's called you to do and he celebrates
[00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:59.940]   what he's called others to do and you can be free from that.
[00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:07.560]   Because when you pursue him, he will begin to show you how you take your time, your talents
[00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:15.180]   and your treasures and you begin to leverage those for his glory and for his kingdom.
[00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:20.360]   There is no comparison when that's the case.
[00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:25.160]   So many of us, we spend so much time wishing we were like them when God's made you not
[00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:27.560]   to be like them.
[00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:34.760]   He will show you who you are called to be if you would just lay it down and pursue him.
[00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:42.440]   For some of us, man, tonight's the night.
[00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:48.480]   Twelve years of a porn addiction.
[00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:52.440]   The thing that you said you would never tell anybody that you're going to take to the grave.
[00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:53.440]   Tonight is the night.
[00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:54.440]   We got to lay it down.
[00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:56.160]   Like we're doing business tonight.
[00:24:56.160 --> 00:25:03.780]   We're putting the addictions in this room to rest because Christ has died for those
[00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:10.320]   and he not only died but he was raised to life and we serve a living God, not a dead
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:15.200]   God, who you can talk to, who you can have a relationship with.
[00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:20.240]   And the same spirit that raised Jesus Christ from the dead promises to live inside of you
[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:21.240]   and me.
[00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:27.400]   And if it can raise a dead man from the ground, it can take care of your porn addiction or
[00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:31.640]   that abortion that you said you would never tell anyone about.
[00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:33.640]   Let me talk to you.
[00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:35.480]   You're loved.
[00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:39.840]   Jesus loves you in spite of all of that.
[00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:46.840]   Or that guy that took advantage of you or maybe you're the perpetrator, young man.
[00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:49.920]   God loves you.
[00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:53.200]   He wants to meet you in that pain.
[00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:56.240]   He wants to meet you in that sin.
[00:25:56.240 --> 00:26:02.520]   He wants to set you free tonight because he died the death that you and I were supposed
[00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:04.120]   to die.
[00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:07.520]   And he lived the life that you and I could never live.
[00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:13.040]   He got what we deserved and we get what he deserved.
[00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:15.040]   It's called the great exchange.
[00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:22.600]   It's the most incredible message out there and I can't stop telling people about it.
[00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:27.120]   So here's what we're going to do.
[00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:30.280]   We need to ask ourselves an honest question.
[00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:32.680]   What is that thing that we need to bury?
[00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:41.120]   What is that thing that we need to die to tonight once and for all?
[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:48.060]   Do you believe that God can free you once you die to it?
[00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:49.880]   I believe he can.
[00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:56.240]   And there's a whole community, there's thousands of people here that I believe can be set free
[00:26:56.240 --> 00:27:01.320]   and that you can begin to walk with week in and week out every Tuesday night and you can
[00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:07.320]   get plugged in outside of this place and you can go all in and there's no more excuses.
[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:10.800]   Tonight's the night.
[00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:14.520]   And so you're going to see, if you haven't already, maybe you already discovered it,
[00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:19.480]   but there's an index card and a sharpie marker underneath every chair.
[00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:26.560]   Why don't you grab that out for me?
[00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:29.360]   Pull that out.
[00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:32.600]   And this is what we're going to do.
[00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:40.000]   We're going to write that thing that is keeping you from going all in with Jesus.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.760]   Some of you tonight, you just need to write your name.
[00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:49.440]   Like if this was me at 22, I'm writing Josiah Jones.
[00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:54.600]   That's the thing that I'm dying to and that's the funeral that I'm going to have tonight.
[00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:57.760]   And you need to surrender your life to Jesus.
[00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:06.720]   Others of you, you got to surrender performance, achievement, comparison, brokenness, like
[00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:14.360]   hurt, pain, and past relationships, addictions.
[00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:24.080]   And we're going to shut those sins once and for all.
[00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:33.600]   And so we have a team of leaders that are going to be in the balcony and on the edges
[00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:36.800]   of the rows, like at the end of the rows.
[00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:40.800]   If you're close to the stage, you can drop that card off on the stage.
[00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:45.400]   And so we're going to interact tonight with the message because I believe this is a powerful
[00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:49.320]   moment for you to draw a line in the sand, for you to nail a stake in the ground, and
[00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:51.600]   for you not to forget there's nothing special.
[00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:56.840]   There's nothing magical about this moment other than you just saying, "Hey, tonight's
[00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:58.200]   the night.
[00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:01.680]   I'm done.
[00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:07.540]   My sin is dead and gone because of what Christ has done."
[00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:14.640]   And I believe moments like this, you can look back on and God can give you the power and
[00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:22.720]   the strength in remembering what you did because it's a physical act.
[00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:27.480]   Like we're going to stand up and we're going to drop it off in a basket that leaders will
[00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:29.040]   have all throughout this auditorium.
[00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:33.280]   And like I said, if you're close to the stage, you can just drop it off on the stage.
[00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:36.520]   And some of you in the balcony, you just need to come all the way down here to the stage
[00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:39.920]   because you just need to sit in this moment as long as you can.
[00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:41.880]   If that's you, don't be ashamed.
[00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:42.880]   We're not going to belabor it.
[00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:46.880]   We're not going to drag this on, but we're going to give you an opportunity tonight to
[00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:48.280]   bear your sin.
[00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:58.160]   Father God, would you move in a mighty way as we continue to worship you in song?
[00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:09.920]   And God, would you allow men and women all across this auditorium to just die?
[00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:13.760]   Paul says in Galatians 2.20 that I've been crucified with Christ and it's no longer I
[00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:15.840]   who live, but it's Christ who lives in me.
[00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:19.560]   And the life that I now live, I live by faith in the Son of Man who loved me and gave himself
[00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:23.400]   for me.
[00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:30.080]   So God, would we crucify our life and the things that are hindering us from knowing
[00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:32.140]   you more and making you known?
[00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:33.140]   We love you.
[00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:35.080]   We worship you now.
[00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:35.800]   In Jesus' name.
