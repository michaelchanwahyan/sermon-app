00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:25,020
 All right, Porsche, how are we doing?

5
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:27,020
 We doing okay tonight?

6
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:28,020
 It's awesome.

7
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:29,020
 Great to see you.

8
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:30,020
 You look good as always.

9
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:32,020
 Love what God's doing here in Dallas.

10
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:37,020
 And so glad that you would give us your time on a Tuesday night to be a part of what He is doing here.

11
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,020
 But not just those of you in the room.

12
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:45,020
 Also, everybody that is online and tuning in this evening or in the future, we're really glad that you would be here with us.

13
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:47,020
 Special shout out to all of our Porsche Live locations.

 Porsche Live Wheaton, Midland, and Boise.

15
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:53,020
 Special shout out to y'all tonight.

16
00:00:53,020 --> 00:01:07,020
 Well, in 2017, I found myself standing on the cusp of a legitimately life-altering, trajectory-shaping decision that would shape my future forever as I knew it.

17
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:15,020
 I was considering proposing to one Brooke Nicole Gadesa.

18
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:18,020
 Which was a huge deal for me for a couple of reasons.

19
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,020
 Number one, I'm not an event planner.

20
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:21,020
 I'm pretty bad at it.

21
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:27,020
 And a proposal, fellas, if you're listening, is a major event that you're probably going to need some help with.

22
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:39,020
 Number two, the second thing that I knew is I was about to step into making a decision that was not just big, but the biggest decision as well as the biggest purchase I had ever made in my life.

23
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:43,020
 And so I was kind of weighing through whether or not I was ready to go for it.

24
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:49,020
 And yet as I evaluated all the variables, I knew it was time.

25
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,020
 She was the one.

26
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:55,020
 Now, going into the proposal, I wanted everything to be perfect.

27
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,020
 I wanted there to be no hiccups whatsoever.

28
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:04,020
 And so I made a clear plan that I could follow along and check off as I went.

29
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,020
 So I went ahead and I booked the venue.

30
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:08,020
 I coordinated with all of our friends.

31
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:11,020
 I made sure that they were there in the area.

32
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:18,020
 I talked to our families, her parents and our siblings, and I hid them there on site so that way she could see them whenever the proposal happened.

33
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,020
 I booked a photographer.

34
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:28,020
 I hid that person in plain sight so they could get all the best action shots as we were making our way to the spot where it would actually happen.

35
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,020
 And I would pop the question.

36
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,020
 I prep decorations.

37
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:38,020
 I went to incredible lengths to make this event one that was perfect.

38
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:42,020
 Like I wanted it to be the best proposal possible.

39
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:46,020
 But if that was not enough, I had one ace up my sleeve.

40
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:52,020
 You see, over the course of our dating relationship, which was three years, don't judge me.

41
00:02:52,020 --> 00:03:00,020
 She had never heard from me, nor had any woman whom I dated ever heard from me those three fateful words.

42
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,020
 I love you.

43
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:10,020
 And I was prepared to say those words to her in this moment because she was the one and only one person I ever wanted to communicate these words to.

44
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:13,020
 So to set the scene, the moment finally comes.

45
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:16,020
 The sun is setting. I had timed golden hour perfectly.

46
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:26,020
 The sky is watercolor red and orange, that perfect spot where the clouds had rolled in and the sun had dipped behind them and everything lit up beautifully.

47
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:42,020
 And I had made sure that we were walking at the perfect cool of the day, pond to our right, serene setting, geese swimming, hand in hand, making our way to what was a gazebo decorated in twinkling lights.

48
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:49,020
 And as we walked up those steps, it occurred to her what was happening, which was the best gift for me because I had achieved my final check.

49
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:52,020
 It was a surprise. She had no idea whatsoever.

50
00:03:52,020 --> 00:04:01,020
 And so as we make our way into the gazebo, there are framed pictures that marked the key moments and memories over the course of our relationship.

51
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:08,020
 I had littered the area with white tulips, her favorite flower, and tea candles just to set the ambiance.

52
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:14,020
 And so I grabbed her by the hand and I look her in the eye and I bend to one knee.

53
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:21,020
 And as I pull the ring from my pocket, I forgot everything I was about to say.

54
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:25,020
 Namely, I forgot to say, I love you.

55
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:34,020
 I managed to pull the proposal off, but I had waited my entire life at that point, 25 years to propose to this woman.

56
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:38,020
 And I had never said these words, reserved them exclusively for this hour.

57
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:41,020
 And I totally blanked on it.

58
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:50,020
 All of the drama, all of the buildup, all of the hype over the course of my life for nothing.

59
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:56,020
 Now, do you think she questioned whether I loved her or not?

60
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:59,020
 No, of course not. We had history.

61
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:08,020
 And yet, do you think she wanted to hear those words that she knew I had reserved very exclusively for this person, which happened to be her?

62
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:13,020
 Yes, of course she did. So much so that she reminded me in the moment,

63
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:16,020
 "Aren't you forgetting something? I love you."

64
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:19,020
 You know, it was like that kind of moment.

65
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:32,020
 You see, she was not in question about the fact that I loved her, but she wanted to hear the expression that embodied our experience over the course of the last couple of years.

66
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:35,020
 You see, she knew those words, they meant something.

67
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:39,020
 They launched the two of us into a whole new way of life.

68
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:44,020
 Like, by way of me saying that and identifying a new kind of relationship,

69
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:50,020
 we were stepping into a situation where we were pursuing a new sort of reality,

70
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:52,020
 where we were living a new life together.

71
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:59,020
 We had a new future to find. Our purpose had been redefined in a moment.

72
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:01,020
 Now, why do I tell you all that?

73
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:12,020
 Because I am increasingly convinced that while many of us know Jesus loves us, we do not live like Jesus loves us.

74
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:17,020
 You see, everything has in fact not changed.

75
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:27,020
 And so here tonight, what I want to do is I want to speak those fateful few words to those of you here listening right now.

76
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:33,020
 I want to bring you in on one of the greatest passages declaring the love of God for you,

77
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:41,020
 because I want to move you past simply the facts of the gospel into the kind of feeling those facts

78
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:46,020
 where you not only know the love of God, but you feel the love of God in your life.

79
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:49,020
 That's what I want to do.

80
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:54,020
 And to do it, we're going to listen to the Apostle Paul in his letter to the Ephesians.

81
00:06:54,020 --> 00:07:00,020
 So if you have a Bible, you can grab it and you can turn with me to the book of Ephesians.

82
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,020
 Here's why we're doing this right now.

83
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:05,020
 Last week, we finished a series, great series, series on joy.

84
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:07,020
 Next week, we're starting a brand new series.

85
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:11,020
 And as we were considering what's going to happen in the middle of those two things,

86
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:16,020
 I just considered praying to God, what is most important for these people?

87
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:21,020
 And I sensed the Lord tell me, "Kylin, just tell them that I love them."

88
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:25,020
 And my response was, "God, they probably know that.

89
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:31,020
 We've been singing about your love for us since we were small children, more than likely.

90
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:34,020
 We know you love us, God. Give us something more profound."

91
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:37,020
 And in that moment, I felt immense conviction.

92
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:41,020
 What do you mean more profound?

93
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:44,020
 Faith, hope, and love, these three remain, but the greatest of these is love.

94
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:46,020
 Why, God? Why is it the greatest?

95
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:49,020
 Because though you need faith now, you will not need it forever.

96
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:51,020
 You will see me face to face.

97
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:54,020
 Though hope is needed now, you will not need hope forever,

98
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:58,020
 because you will be with me in heaven as your home for all eternity.

99
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:03,020
 And yet love never ends.

100
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:05,020
 And it begins right now.

101
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:09,020
 So many of us do not feel like love has actually begun.

102
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:15,020
 Our experience does not jive with what we know the scriptures subscribe.

103
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:21,020
 Instead, what we often hear is a form of Christianity that feels more synonymous for you and I,

104
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:24,020
 of just living above average in our morality.

105
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:29,020
 We're dealing with the nagging guilt of missing another quiet time.

106
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:33,020
 Or rationalizing our sin because, man, it's not that big of a deal,

107
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:35,020
 and it feels good whenever I frequent it,

108
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:38,020
 and so I'm going to keep it over here as a little bit of a pet.

109
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:41,020
 Or we feel that shameful feeling of not really wanting to share the gospel with anybody.

110
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:44,020
 We know we should, but man, that's kind of something that someone else can do.

111
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:48,020
 This is more synonymous with our Christian experience,

112
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:58,020
 rather than the thrill of a theology that tells us God radically, wildly, crazily loves you.

113
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:04,020
 We have a kind of Christian experience that does not jive with the truth

114
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:08,020
 that there's a rush of relationship in walking with Jesus.

115
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:10,020
 I want to give you back the thrill.

116
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:12,020
 I want to give you back the rush.

117
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:15,020
 I want to imbue you with all the vitality and vibrancy and energy

118
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:19,020
 that your relationship to God is supposed to be filled with.

119
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:23,020
 I want to get you out of knowing and playing make-believe

120
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:28,020
 and into experiencing and realizing that all of this is true.

121
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:31,020
 Because I think too often we move through life,

122
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:38,020
 and we act the part, but we do not feel the part.

123
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:41,020
 And as we come to chapter 3 in Paul's letter to the Ephesians,

124
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:44,020
 it's the perfect place to unpack this idea

125
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:46,020
 because Paul is writing to a group of people

126
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:49,020
 that are living in this massive city called Ephesus.

127
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:54,020
 Ephesus was the center of trade in the ancient Greco-Roman world.

128
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:56,020
 It was the epicenter for Greek and Roman idol worship,

129
00:09:56,020 --> 00:10:00,020
 meaning it was this massive city with a group of young adults

130
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:05,020
 whom Paul is writing to that is built around big business,

131
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:09,020
 materialism, and sexual opportunity.

132
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,020
 Sound familiar?

133
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:13,020
 Paul is writing to a group of people in that sort of context,

134
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,020
 and it's to them that he says,

135
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:18,020
 "Hey, the world is promising you so much else,

136
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:20,020
 satisfaction in all these other places,

137
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:23,020
 and yet it's only actually found in Jesus."

138
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:28,020
 You see, the climax of history is not in what you have materially.

139
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:30,020
 It's not in where you live.

140
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:33,020
 It's not in what you do occupationally.

141
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:39,020
 It's not in what you actually--what kind of pleasure you find.

142
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:41,020
 It's found in Jesus.

143
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:44,020
 All of history has been pointing to this man,

144
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:46,020
 and it's for very good reason.

145
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:49,020
 And as we come to chapter 3, we see Paul.

146
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,020
 He pivots in his letter.

147
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:53,020
 He goes from chapters 1 and 2 where it's all orthodoxy,

148
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:57,020
 what scholars identify as a focus on doctrine,

149
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:59,020
 and he moves into orthopraxy after chapter 3.

150
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:02,020
 He moves into chapters 4 and 5, and he starts talking about orthopraxy.

151
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:04,020
 He starts to tell us how we're supposed to live.

152
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:06,020
 In chapters 1 and 2, he only gives us one command.

153
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:08,020
 He just tells you to remember.

154
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,020
 Remember what?

155
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:11,020
 Remember the details of the gospel,

156
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:16,020
 the fact that Jesus, he has stepped into our reality

157
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:19,020
 to defeat our enemy, to take out our sin,

158
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:22,020
 to pay the cost of that on the cross,

159
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:24,020
 to unite us to himself,

160
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:28,020
 to be identified with us and have us identified with him,

161
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,020
 and he is building a multi-ethnic community.

162
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:32,020
 That's what Jesus has done.

163
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:35,020
 And yet before he moves on and tells us,

164
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:38,020
 "In light of all that, here's what you should now do,"

165
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:40,020
 he stops.

166
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:42,020
 He actually gets distracted

167
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:47,020
 because he wants you and me to know what these verses say.

168
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:52,020
 And so, in Ephesians 3, 14 and 16, he says this.

169
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:56,020
 He says, detailing how crazy God's love is for his people,

170
00:11:56,020 --> 00:12:01,020
 he says, "For this reason, I bow my knees before the Father,

171
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:04,020
 "from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named,

172
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:06,020
 "that according to the riches of his glory,

173
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:08,020
 "he may grant you to be strengthened with power

174
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:11,020
 "through his Spirit in your inner being."

175
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,020
 We'll stop right there.

176
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:15,020
 Like, you might read this or hear it read to you

177
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,020
 and it sounds like typical Bible,

178
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:19,020
 and yet what you need to know is this is pretty melodramatic,

179
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:21,020
 even for the apostle Paul.

180
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:22,020
 Like, he could have just said,

181
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:26,020
 "I pray to God that you would know you're loved."

182
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:28,020
 Go in peace, to love, and serve the Lord, everybody.

183
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,020
 But he doesn't do that.

184
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:33,020
 He goes to an incredible level of detail,

185
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,020
 a Shakespearean level of speech

186
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:37,020
 to articulate the depth of affection that God has for us.

187
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,020
 Why would he do that?

188
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:44,020
 Well, why do men, or did men, speak poetry to their beloved?

189
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:46,020
 (audience laughing)

190
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:49,020
 Because men, not only then, but still today,

191
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:52,020
 are bad at communicating their feelings.

192
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:55,020
 It's not something that we are necessarily good at.

193
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:59,020
 I will speak as one ambassador for the male population.

194
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:01,020
 (audience laughing)

195
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:05,020
 And so, because we care deeply about that person,

196
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:11,020
 we know I cannot run the risk of speaking in a way

197
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:13,020
 that will fall short of my feelings.

198
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:16,020
 No, mere words will not suffice.

199
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:19,020
 I must express my feelings instead.

200
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,020
 That's what Paul is doing.

201
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:24,020
 He's not just reciting facts about the way that God loves you.

202
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:26,020
 He's pouring out his heart

203
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:28,020
 so you might know just how wildly you're loved.

204
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,020
 Listen to it.

205
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:32,020
 "For this reason, I bow my knees before the Father,

206
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:35,020
 "from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named,

207
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,020
 "that according to the," what?

208
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:39,020
 "The riches of his glory, he might grant you

209
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:42,020
 "to be strengthened with power through his Spirit

210
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,020
 "in your inner being."

211
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,020
 Do you hear it?

212
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,020
 That's a lot.

213
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:47,020
 Like, the guy has a flair for the dramatic,

214
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:49,020
 and yet he is doing all of this

215
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:51,020
 because he just simply wants us to know

216
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:55,020
 this is how wildly you're loved,

217
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:58,020
 which raises another question for us.

218
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:00,020
 Why does he feel the need to do this?

219
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:03,020
 Like, why does he need to up the ante,

220
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:05,020
 pour on the passion?

221
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,020
 Because he knows,

222
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:11,020
 while it would be easier to just say, "You're loved,"

223
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:14,020
 he knows, while we know that,

224
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:18,020
 we don't actually often believe it.

225
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:22,020
 Sure, we know the nursery rhymes.

226
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:24,020
 We've learned the Bible stories.

227
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:27,020
 We've listened to the testimonies

228
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:29,020
 of how God has reached in,

229
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,020
 and he has saved people

230
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:32,020
 from the depth of their own despair,

231
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:34,020
 and yet, despite knowing it all,

232
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:36,020
 when we get honest with ourselves,

233
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:40,020
 and it boils down to the most gut-level,

234
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:42,020
 honest place within our inner being,

235
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:47,020
 what we know is that while it is true,

236
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:51,020
 we don't feel it's true for us.

237
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:53,020
 That's why Paul is praying here.

238
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:56,020
 He wants us to grasp the love of God,

239
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,020
 not just with our minds,

240
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:59,020
 but with our own hearts.

241
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:02,020
 He wants it to move from here down into here.

242
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:05,020
 He wants it to permeate every faculty of your being.

243
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:08,020
 He wants you to know what kind of impact

244
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:12,020
 that kind of love should have in your life.

245
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:14,020
 And so he tells us four things specifically

246
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:16,020
 that will help us to understand

247
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:18,020
 what the love of Jesus feels like,

248
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:20,020
 what it actually does to a person

249
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:22,020
 in their life.

250
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:25,020
 And he picks it up in verse 16.

251
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:27,020
 And so he says, "Hey, I bow my knees,

252
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:30,020
 "so that according to the riches of his glory,

253
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:32,020
 "he may grant you to be strengthened with power

254
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:34,020
 "through his Spirit in your inner being."

255
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:38,020
 You see, the first thing that Paul wants us to remind us of

256
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:41,020
 is that Jesus gives strength in place of exhaustion.

257
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,020
 That's the first point.

258
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:46,020
 Jesus gives strength in place of exhaustion.

259
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:48,020
 Anybody tired in here?

260
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:50,020
 (congregation chattering)

261
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:55,020
 It's always inevitably true that when I ask that question,

262
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:58,020
 and yet I never cue a response,

263
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:01,020
 people raise their hands and they lift their voices.

264
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:03,020
 Because people just, they want to be identified.

265
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,020
 Like, man, I'm tired.

266
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:06,020
 Like, work has me beat.

267
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:08,020
 My boss is asking way too much of me.

268
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:11,020
 My friends, they are constantly asking me to go out.

269
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:13,020
 It's difficult being popular.

270
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:15,020
 I know that the weekends are coming,

271
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:17,020
 but it feels like the weekdays are never ending.

272
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,020
 I don't get enough sleep.

273
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:21,020
 Instead, I'm awake too often and not by my own choice.

274
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:23,020
 I would kill for a vacation.

275
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,020
 I get it.

276
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,020
 I understand that this is the case.

277
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:27,020
 And yet here's what I want you to know.

278
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:29,020
 Your tiredness is not the product

279
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:32,020
 of what's happening outside of you.

280
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:36,020
 It is the product of what's happening inside of you.

281
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,020
 Your tiredness is not the product

282
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:39,020
 of what's happening outside.

283
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:41,020
 It's the product of what's happening inside.

284
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:44,020
 Like, it's not that the work is just so crazy.

285
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:47,020
 It's that you are desperately identifying

286
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:50,020
 with the success your work offers,

287
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:52,020
 and that's making you crazy.

288
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:54,020
 It's not that your boyfriend or your girlfriend

289
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,020
 is just so needy.

290
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:57,020
 It's that you want to be needed by somebody.

291
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:59,020
 It's not that all of your friends,

292
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:01,020
 man, they just want too much of me.

293
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:04,020
 It's that you want to be approved of by these people,

294
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:07,020
 and so you drive yourself to the point of exhaustion

295
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:09,020
 in order to achieve it.

296
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:11,020
 It's not just that you're constantly trying

297
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:13,020
 to measure up to everybody that's around you.

298
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:17,020
 It's that you actually only find your value

299
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:20,020
 in how you stack up against the competition.

300
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:22,020
 It's not what's happening outside.

301
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:25,020
 It's what's happening inside that is making you tired.

302
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:27,020
 I could go on, and yet so many of us,

303
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:30,020
 we let the outer world impact our inner lives

304
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,020
 as opposed to letting our inner lives

305
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:33,020
 impact the outer world,

306
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:38,020
 and the results, they are exhausting.

307
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:40,020
 I remember when I was in college,

308
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,020
 and I've told this story before,

309
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:43,020
 but it feels too perfect to pass on

310
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,020
 to help make the point here,

311
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:48,020
 how to craft a world-class resume.

312
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:50,020
 I got really good at it, so good to the point

313
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,020
 that I actually took a job

314
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:54,020
 in helping people craft their resumes.

315
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,020
 I'm not in that line of work anymore,

316
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:56,020
 so save the emails.

317
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:58,020
 You can find somebody else to help you with that,

318
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,020
 and yet I learned all the tools of the trade.

319
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:02,020
 I learned good action verbs.

320
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:03,020
 I knew what it looked like to take

321
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:05,020
 one's achievements and accolades

322
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:08,020
 and put them on paper in a way that really impressed.

323
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,020
 I knew what it looked like to format

324
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,020
 and use the right fonting,

325
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:13,020
 so that way businesses would read it,

326
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,020
 and they would say, "Man, this guy or this girl

327
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:18,020
 "actually has a leg up on the rest of our candidates."

328
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:22,020
 I knew what it meant to self-promote

329
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,020
 at the highest level possible,

330
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,020
 and yet there was always one thing

331
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,020
 that stood out to me as really interesting

332
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:28,020
 when I would help people with their resumes.

333
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,020
 I would ask them, "Hey, send me over

334
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:31,020
 "whatever resume you have as of now,"

335
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,020
 and so what they would send me

336
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:34,020
 is not one page, though that's what it's supposed to be.

337
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:37,020
 They would send me multiple pages

338
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:40,020
 recounting all of their achievements,

339
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:44,020
 awards, causes for recognition,

340
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:46,020
 and what struck me about that

341
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:49,020
 was not that they were sending me multiple pages

342
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,020
 because surely one page is not enough

343
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:53,020
 to contain my awesomeness,

344
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:56,020
 but because one page was surely not enough

345
00:18:56,020 --> 00:19:00,020
 to impress anybody in their estimation.

346
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:02,020
 They needed more than that.

347
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:05,020
 They knew something was wrong on the inside,

348
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:08,020
 and so I needed to fix myself on the outside.

349
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:12,020
 I don't think that I'm actually genuinely enough

350
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,020
 to impress anybody.

351
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:15,020
 I'm not enough to impress anybody socially,

352
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:18,020
 financially, professionally, romantically.

353
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:22,020
 Spiritually speaking, I'm not enough,

354
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,020
 and the case is true for so many of us.

355
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:28,020
 That's why you wrap yourself in high-powered jobs.

356
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:31,020
 That's why you filter your photos.

357
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:36,020
 It's why you choose to buy the nicest brands

358
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,020
 as opposed to the brands

359
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:40,020
 which exist within your current budget.

360
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:43,020
 It's why you choose to pursue big goals

361
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,020
 that other people want

362
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:47,020
 as opposed to the goals that you yourself want.

363
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,020
 Why you chase after that job

364
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,020
 as opposed to just a good job.

365
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:52,020
 It's because you are measuring yourself up

366
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:55,020
 in accordance with what everyone else thinks.

367
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:59,020
 You are finding your value in the love of the world

368
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:02,020
 and not the love of a king,

369
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:06,020
 and the results of it are exhaustion.

370
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:08,020
 You feel flawed on the inside,

371
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:10,020
 so you're trying to fix yourself on the outside,

372
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,020
 and here's the truth.

373
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:16,020
 You are flawed on the inside.

374
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:18,020
 You are dead in your trespasses and sins,

375
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,020
 and yet Jesus Christ,

376
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:22,020
 he has come to not fix you on the outside,

377
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,020
 but to fix that which you cannot fix.

378
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:27,020
 He has come to fix you on the inside.

379
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:30,020
 He has come to give of himself,

380
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:33,020
 to give to you all that you lack,

381
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:38,020
 so that way you might find all that you want in him.

382
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:43,020
 He has come to replace your exhaustion with his strength.

383
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:45,020
 It's not just even that he has come to save you

384
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,020
 from where you were.

385
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:48,020
 The fact that you used to be back there

386
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:50,020
 dealing with those sins and those problems

387
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:51,020
 and all of those mistakes.

388
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:53,020
 He's not just worried about the past.

389
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:55,020
 He's not just saved you from that.

390
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:58,020
 He has saved you to a glorious future.

391
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,020
 He is leading you into something,

392
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,020
 the likes of which will be better

393
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:04,020
 than you could ever dare ask or imagine.

394
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,020
 Don't believe me?

395
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:09,020
 Place your faith in him and take him up on the offer.

396
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:11,020
 See if it is better.

397
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,020
 I assure you, it will be.

398
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,020
 His word is true.

399
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:17,020
 His promises are perfect.

400
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:20,020
 He does not fail to keep his word.

401
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:22,020
 He will lead you forward into that

402
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:25,020
 which you could not dare dream for yourself.

403
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:30,020
 And it's because there he is waiting for you.

404
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:33,020
 Paul says it like this to the Corinthians

405
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:38,020
 when talking about the inner person.

406
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,020
 He says in 2 Corinthians 4, 16,

407
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:41,020
 "So we do not lose heart.

408
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:43,020
 Though our outer self is wasting away,

409
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:47,020
 our inner self is being renewed day by day by day."

410
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:50,020
 That's how much God cares about your inner person.

411
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:52,020
 That's why in here in Ephesians 3, he says,

412
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:55,020
 "He is literally strengthening every day by his spirit,

413
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:58,020
 our innermost being from the inexhaustible well

414
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,020
 of his glorious riches."

415
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:01,020
 That's amazing to consider.

416
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:04,020
 God cares a lot about how you are doing on the inside.

417
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:10,020
 So let me ask you, how healthy is your inner life tonight?

418
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:12,020
 How healthy is your inner life?

419
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:16,020
 What do you see when you stare at that part of yourself

420
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,020
 which no one else can see?

421
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:21,020
 How do you feel in your soul?

422
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:25,020
 How's your spiritual pulse doing?

423
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:31,020
 Is it strong, beating vibrantly within your chest?

424
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:33,020
 Or is it flatlining?

425
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:37,020
 Are you striding with the spirit, making great ground?

426
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:40,020
 Or are you cold, dead on the table

427
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,020
 because your inner life is withering

428
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:46,020
 while you try to keep up with the world's watching?

429
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,020
 What is it for you?

430
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:49,020
 Listen to me.

431
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:54,020
 God's desire for your life is not a life of hopelessness

432
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:58,020
 or exhaustion or stress or desperation or insecurity.

433
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,020
 If that describes your experience, that's not his heart for you.

434
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:02,020
 That's not his life for you.

435
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:06,020
 Instead, his desire is that your life would flourish.

436
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:10,020
 That you would be bursting and beaming with life.

437
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:14,020
 That everywhere you go would be a place of flourishing.

438
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:16,020
 Not because the circumstances are great,

439
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:18,020
 but because he is with you in the circumstances.

440
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:21,020
 Because he goes with you wherever it is you go.

441
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:25,020
 Because he is the source of your life, not the things in this world.

442
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:28,020
 You see, his love should strengthen your innermost self

443
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:31,020
 so that when, not if, but when things go bad,

444
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:34,020
 when failure inevitably comes, when trouble eventually strikes,

445
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:36,020
 when hurt however happens,

446
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:38,020
 you are still standing on the other side of it.

447
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:43,020
 That is the first thing that the love Jesus offers does to your life.

448
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:46,020
 That's how it should feel. It should feel like strength.

449
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:48,020
 But that's not all.

450
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:51,020
 The second one is in verse 17.

451
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:55,020
 He prays that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith.

452
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:58,020
 That you, being rooted and grounded in love.

453
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,020
 We'll stop right there.

454
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:02,020
 It's interesting. When you read this verse in the original language,

455
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:05,020
 because our English translations, they don't exactly do justice

456
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:07,020
 to what Paul is meaning here.

457
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:10,020
 When Paul says that Christ may dwell in your hearts,

458
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:16,020
 he uses the word for dwell that means more than simply being in a house,

459
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:19,020
 but actually means being at home.

460
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:23,020
 Like Jesus looks at your life,

461
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:26,020
 and he does not treat it like an Airbnb.

462
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:29,020
 Like it's not a place that he stays at for a while,

463
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:33,020
 but then he slips out whenever things are not up to his standard.

464
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:36,020
 It's not that he lives in your heart,

465
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:39,020
 but then the minute you start to misbehave, or you do something bad,

466
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:41,020
 or you're praying enough, or man, I don't know,

467
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:43,020
 that doesn't actually feel worthy for me.

468
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:47,020
 When that happens, he doesn't just dip and leave you to pick up the mess.

469
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:49,020
 He does not treat you that way.

470
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:52,020
 No, he considers your heart his home.

471
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:54,020
 He knows every nook and cranny.

472
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:57,020
 He has keys to every single room.

473
00:24:57,020 --> 00:25:02,020
 And he likes it there.

474
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:08,020
 Jesus likes making his home in your heart.

475
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:10,020
 Anybody got homebodies in the room?

476
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:12,020
 Anybody bold enough to raise a hand and say,

477
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:16,020
 "Yeah, man, I'd rather be at home than go out with some people."

478
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:19,020
 Jesus is a homebody when it comes to you.

479
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:21,020
 He wants to be with you.

480
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,020
 He wants you to take up residence inside of you.

481
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:27,020
 He wants to dwell with you and make you into his home

482
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:32,020
 because Jesus, the love he offers, it gives acceptance, not rejection.

483
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:34,020
 The second point.

484
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:38,020
 Jesus gives acceptance and not rejection,

485
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:40,020
 which is easy to understand,

486
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:43,020
 but it is much more difficult to believe.

487
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:45,020
 Why?

488
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:49,020
 Well, let me try an exercise to see if I can't illustrate this.

489
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:55,020
 What I want you to do is I want you to hear the question I ask in a moment,

490
00:25:55,020 --> 00:26:01,020
 and I want you to answer it in two ways, quietly, within yourself,

491
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:04,020
 because I want you to answer it honestly.

492
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:07,020
 I don't want you to fear your anonymity being risked

493
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:09,020
 and people are going to know.

494
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:12,020
 I want you to answer it quietly, and I want you to answer it quickly,

495
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:14,020
 like the first thing that comes to mind.

496
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:19,020
 Grab hold of that and remember it as we walk through this.

497
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:23,020
 So here's the question.

498
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:41,020
 What single word comes to mind when you think about yourself?

499
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:45,020
 I remember a counselor asking me this same question,

500
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:49,020
 not even five years ago, and the answer for me, it sprung top of mind,

501
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:54,020
 and it's still an answer that I find myself even identifying to this day.

502
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:58,020
 The answer for me was disappointment.

503
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:00,020
 I felt behind all of my peers.

504
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:02,020
 I was not happy with where I was in life.

505
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:05,020
 I was stuck in a city that I didn't want to be in any longer.

506
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:09,020
 I was mentally struggling in ways that I never had before.

507
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:12,020
 I was fighting off some nagging sin that was impacting the lives of people

508
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:14,020
 that I cared a lot about,

509
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:18,020
 and as I looked at all of the evidence of who I was here in that moment,

510
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:22,020
 I realized is I'm not worthy of love.

511
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:29,020
 I'm unattractive. I am undesirable. I am unlovable.

512
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:32,020
 Some of you can relate to that.

513
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:34,020
 Like that's why it's easier for you to list your weaknesses

514
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:37,020
 than it is for you to list your strengths.

515
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:43,020
 That's why you rewrite captions and you retake selfies

516
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:47,020
 and you redo voice memos again and again and again,

517
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:51,020
 and some of you know it's you because you don't think

518
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:56,020
 that the genuine, authentic, true article of who you are is enough.

519
00:27:56,020 --> 00:28:00,020
 It's why you replay conversations that you had in your mind

520
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:03,020
 long after those conversations have concluded.

521
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:05,020
 It's why you walk into rooms like this and you look a certain way

522
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:07,020
 and you act a certain way.

523
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:11,020
 You put up a front because you're fearful of people actually knowing you for who you are.

524
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:14,020
 Why are you so fearful? Why do you do all of this?

525
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:16,020
 Because no one will actually accept you.

526
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:22,020
 No one will reject you if they know who you really, truly, wholeheartedly are.

527
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:24,020
 But not Jesus.

528
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:26,020
 That is not the heart of Jesus.

529
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:33,020
 You see, Jesus, he isn't interested in people giving him a good reason to love them.

530
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:38,020
 Jesus is interested in the people that have no good reason for him to love them

531
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:43,020
 because he has come to give them a good reason himself.

532
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:45,020
 This is the heart of who Christ is.

533
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:48,020
 Just think about the people he drew near to in life.

534
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:52,020
 Sinners and blasphemers and adulterers and addicts and traitors and outcasts,

535
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:54,020
 those on the periphery.

536
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:58,020
 He drew near not to the lovable of the world, but to the unlovable of the world.

537
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:01,020
 Not to those who were, "Man, it's beneficial to be around you guys."

538
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:03,020
 That's not who Jesus spent time with.

539
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:06,020
 He spent time around those that it was costly to spend time with.

540
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:10,020
 So costly, in fact, that it cost him his own life.

541
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:15,020
 Like he so badly wants to be near those that are unwanted

542
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:17,020
 because it's to them that he can give worth.

543
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:20,020
 He wants to be near those that are hopeless because it's to them that he can give hope.

544
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:23,020
 It's to those that feel lonely that he wants to be close to

545
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:25,020
 because he can give them a friend.

546
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:30,020
 It's to those that feel so unworthy of the world's affection

547
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:33,020
 that he has come to give you something so much bigger than their affection.

548
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:39,020
 He has come to give you God's.

549
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:41,020
 That's what it says in Romans 5.8.

550
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:46,020
 Famous verse, and one that you should put to memory if you do not know it.

551
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:49,020
 "But God, he shows his love for us, and that while we were still sinners,

552
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,020
 Christ died for us."

553
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:54,020
 Not while you were perfect, not while you were doing okay,

554
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:56,020
 not while you were up on the mend.

555
00:29:56,020 --> 00:30:00,020
 While you were still a sinner, he died for you.

556
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,020
 And here's the thing.

557
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:04,020
 This isn't a flighty or a feeble feeling kind of love.

558
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:07,020
 Paul goes on to say that it's rooted and grounded.

559
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:09,020
 What does that mean?

560
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:11,020
 Well, it's agricultural and it's industrial language.

561
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:13,020
 Think about roots. What do roots do?

562
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:17,020
 Roots, they reach out in search of nourishment so that way they can grow.

563
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:22,020
 Foundations, they need to be strong so that way you can build on top of them.

564
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:27,020
 So last year, Brooke and I, we were on house hunt in this crazy market

565
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:29,020
 in Dallas, Texas, and as we were going into houses,

566
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:34,020
 we would perpetually look for cracks in the ceilings and on the walls

567
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:36,020
 and on the exterior.

568
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:38,020
 I remember we went into one house and it was beautiful.

569
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:42,020
 Like it had all of the right trappings, great fixtures and great furnishings,

570
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:46,020
 and it was well-painted, renovated recently in a great location in town.

571
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:50,020
 It looked perfect, and yet we could not look past the cracks

572
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:54,020
 that were snaking down the wall,

573
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:59,020
 serving as evidence to us that it did not have a good foundation.

574
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:01,020
 And because it did not have a good foundation,

575
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:05,020
 it would be costly to live there.

576
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:11,020
 Some of you, you have built your life on a bad foundation,

577
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:14,020
 and it has cost you dearly.

578
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:17,020
 It has cost you dearly.

579
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:20,020
 Like you're giving more than you should.

580
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:23,020
 You're giving your body over to some guy because you want his approval.

581
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:26,020
 His approval isn't worth it.

582
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:28,020
 It's not worthy of offering yourself over.

583
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:30,020
 Some of you, you want so badly for the approval of your friends

584
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:33,020
 that you're willing to compromise your personal integrity.

585
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:36,020
 Their approval is not worth that.

586
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:39,020
 Some of you, you are so enslaved to success

587
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:43,020
 because you have to get that job, and yet that job isn't worth the cost.

588
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:45,020
 Some of you, you want so badly to measure up,

589
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:47,020
 not in other people's eyes, in your own eyes.

590
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:50,020
 And so you are living under an immense amount of pressure,

591
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:52,020
 and yet you don't have to do that.

592
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:54,020
 It's not worth it.

593
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:56,020
 Some of you, it's not a bad foundation.

594
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:58,020
 Instead, you are drawing on nothing.

595
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:01,020
 You have set your roots into places where it's not pulling on living water,

596
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:03,020
 it's pulling on no water.

597
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:07,020
 It's pulling on something that is making you not healthy, but unhealthy.

598
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:10,020
 You're indulging toxic relationships just so you can feel valued.

599
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:13,020
 You have an addiction to pornography just because it helps you to feel happy.

600
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:15,020
 You care so much about the opinions of others

601
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:17,020
 because you want desperately to fit in.

602
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:21,020
 You suffer from imposter syndrome because you think you'll never measure up.

603
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:24,020
 And what it has done is it has left you weak and guilty and insecure

604
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:26,020
 and paranoid and jealous.

605
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:28,020
 I know it because I've lived it. I've been there.

606
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:32,020
 I am also one of you in this regard.

607
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:34,020
 Here's the thing.

608
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:37,020
 You either draw from or you build on something

609
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:42,020
 that gives you scarcity or stability in life.

610
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:45,020
 The world will give you scarcity.

611
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:47,020
 Jesus will give you stability.

612
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:53,020
 His love, it is one that you can root into and build upon

613
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:57,020
 and find life within because the love of Jesus doesn't tolerate you.

614
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:59,020
 It doesn't endure you.

615
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:02,020
 It isn't indifferent towards you.

616
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:04,020
 It's wild about you.

617
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:06,020
 God is wild about you.

618
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:09,020
 So wild, in fact, that the Apostle Paul, he keeps going.

619
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:11,020
 He wants you to know, hey, the love of Jesus,

620
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:13,020
 what it does is it makes you strong.

621
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:15,020
 It gives you acceptance.

622
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:17,020
 But not just that. It says in verse 18,

623
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:20,020
 "I pray that you may have strength to comprehend with all the saints

624
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:22,020
 what is the breadth and the length and the height and the depth

625
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:25,020
 until you know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge."

626
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:27,020
 How wild is Jesus about you?

627
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:31,020
 So wild that Paul prays we would have strength

628
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:35,020
 to comprehend the breadth and the length and the height and the depth of it.

629
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:37,020
 Do you hear that?

630
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:41,020
 He's saying, "Hey, I hope you're ready for this."

631
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:45,020
 You might break a mental sweat thinking about it.

632
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:47,020
 I just need to make sure, are you sure you're ready

633
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:50,020
 to have this conversation, to consider the things that I'm going to tell you?

634
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:52,020
 It's big, man. Are you sure?

635
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:55,020
 It's way bigger than just a conversation about predestination.

636
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:59,020
 This is way bigger than the dispute between lordship, salvation,

637
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:01,020
 and the alternative positions.

638
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:04,020
 This isn't just covenant theology we're talking about.

639
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:06,020
 No, the age of the earth, that has nothing on this.

640
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:08,020
 Those are small things in comparison to this.

641
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:10,020
 This thing is big. Are you ready for it? Are you sure?

642
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:14,020
 You need to make sure.

643
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:21,020
 We're talking about the love of Christ.

644
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:25,020
 He tells you, you need strength to comprehend that.

645
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:31,020
 And yet here's the thing, this should be convicting to us.

646
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:35,020
 Because we are not like Paul.

647
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:38,020
 We so casually talk about the love of Christ.

648
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:40,020
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, man, I know that.

649
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:43,020
 He talks so carefully about it.

650
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:47,020
 He is strapping on his spiritual weight lifting belt

651
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:49,020
 while we're willing to just slip under the bar

652
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:52,020
 and get crushed by the fact that we do not know

653
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:56,020
 the love Paul is describing here.

654
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:58,020
 You see, Paul knows what we don't.

655
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:03,020
 He knows that Jesus gives a love too big for bored belief.

656
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:07,020
 He gives a love too big for bored belief, our third point.

657
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:10,020
 That's why he describes that it has breadth.

658
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:12,020
 Like, what does he mean?

659
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:14,020
 Like, that's a reference to Ephesians 2, 11 through 18,

660
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:16,020
 that the breadth of it includes all people,

661
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:19,020
 every background, every color, every language,

662
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:22,020
 every ethnicity, every single person

663
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:24,020
 is included in this kind of love.

664
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:26,020
 That his love is length, that he chose us

665
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:28,020
 from before the foundation of the world.

666
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:30,020
 That's Ephesians 1, 4, and 5.

667
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:32,020
 That it is height, that it has seated us with Christ

668
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:33,020
 in the heavenly places.

669
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:35,020
 That's Ephesians 2, verse 6.

670
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:37,020
 That is depth, that Jesus came from the heights of heaven,

671
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:39,020
 not just to the depth of this earth,

672
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:41,020
 but to the depth of your depravity,

673
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:44,020
 to the very worst of all of us to save us.

674
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:45,020
 That's Ephesians 2, 1 through 3.

675
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:47,020
 He is praying that we would understand two things,

676
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:50,020
 the immensity and the intensity of God's love for us.

677
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:56,020
 The immensity, that he loves the entirety of who you are

678
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:58,020
 and the length of your days.

679
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:00,020
 Like, he is here for the beginning of your life

680
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:01,020
 to the very end of it.

681
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:04,020
 The immensity of his love spans over the entirety

682
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:06,020
 of who you are, but the intensity of it

683
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:10,020
 is focused at every single individual aspect

684
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,020
 of who you are.

685
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:13,020
 That's the kind of love that Jesus has.

686
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:15,020
 And that's crazy.

687
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:17,020
 That is a wild thing to consider.

688
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:19,020
 Have you thought about it that way?

689
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:20,020
 But here's the thing.

690
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:21,020
 It goes even further.

691
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:22,020
 Like, he keeps going.

692
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:24,020
 He goes, "I pray you would know the love of Christ

693
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:26,020
 that surpasses knowledge."

694
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:29,020
 I remember when I was in college,

695
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:32,020
 every single day I would sit at my kitchen table

696
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:35,020
 and I would stare up, eating my Cheerios,

697
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:38,020
 at this giant painted canvas of this verse,

698
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:40,020
 which my roommate had hung up in our house

699
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:42,020
 without anybody's permission.

700
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:43,020
 Anybody got roommates like that?

701
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:45,020
 And so here I am, reading this verse,

702
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:47,020
 considering to myself, "What does this even mean?"

703
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:50,020
 Like, this is what's so frustrating about Christianity.

704
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:51,020
 Like, I don't understand.

705
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:54,020
 How can you know something that surpasses knowledge?

706
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:56,020
 And yet, as I've walked with Jesus,

707
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:58,020
 I think I know the answer.

708
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:00,020
 God wants you to have more than a conceptual understanding

709
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,020
 of his love.

710
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:04,020
 He wants you to have an experiential understanding

711
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:06,020
 of his love.

712
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:08,020
 More than a conceptual understanding,

713
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:10,020
 an experiential understanding,

714
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:12,020
 which may freak some of us out.

715
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:14,020
 But here's the thing.

716
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:19,020
 He is not calling you to simply an intellectual orientation

717
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:21,020
 where your mind is engaged,

718
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:24,020
 nor is he calling you to simply an emotional orientation

719
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:25,020
 where your heart is engaged.

720
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:28,020
 He is calling you to an experiential orientation

721
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:31,020
 where both head and heart are intertwined intimately

722
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:33,020
 to one another, where you actually encounter God.

723
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:35,020
 You walk in rooms like this, and it's not just,

724
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:37,020
 "Man, okay, we sang some songs, I listened to that guy,

725
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:38,020
 kind of rambled for a little bit,

726
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:40,020
 I saw my friends, and then I walked out."

727
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:42,020
 That's not your experience here, because if you're showing up

728
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:47,020
 and you're engaging with a living God,

729
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:50,020
 it should change things for you.

730
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:52,020
 It should move something in you.

731
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:57,020
 It should stir up your soul.

732
00:37:57,020 --> 00:38:02,020
 And yet what we know is that often our experience

733
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:06,020
 of Jesus' love does not match the experience

734
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:09,020
 people in the Bible have of Jesus' love.

735
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,020
 Just consider the gospels.

736
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:12,020
 How do people experience Jesus' love?

737
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:14,020
 Well, he forgave sinners, he didn't condemn them.

738
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:16,020
 He moved towards the outcasts, not away from them.

739
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:19,020
 He protected the poor, he didn't take advantage of them.

740
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:22,020
 He empowered regular people, not celebrity Christians

741
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:23,020
 and spiritual superstars.

742
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:25,020
 He defended the weak.

743
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:26,020
 He comforted the hurting.

744
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:27,020
 He taught the curious.

745
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:30,020
 He challenged the arrogant, and he loved his enemies.

746
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:33,020
 This was people's experience of Christ's love

747
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:35,020
 in the gospels, and we know it.

748
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:37,020
 And yet our experience of Jesus' love,

749
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:39,020
 it feels so very different, because when we mess up,

750
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:41,020
 it's not a voice of mercy that meets us,

751
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:45,020
 it's a voice of shame.

752
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:47,020
 When we act in fear, it's not a voice of compassion

753
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:50,020
 that meets us in that moment, it is a voice of frustration.

754
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:52,020
 When we hide our sin, it's not a voice of pursuit.

755
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:54,020
 Instead, it is a voice of judgment.

756
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:57,020
 When we sin against Jesus, it's not the voice of grace

757
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:59,020
 that meets us, it's the voice of condemnation.

758
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:02,020
 But here's the thing, porch, I need you to see it.

759
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:04,020
 If what we feel from Jesus does not match

760
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:06,020
 what we know from Jesus in the Bible,

761
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:09,020
 what it means is we do not know the love of Jesus

762
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:11,020
 as well as we think.

763
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:13,020
 We do not know it as well as we think,

764
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:15,020
 because we are not experiencing it

765
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:18,020
 as they experienced it.

766
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:20,020
 Does that make sense?

767
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:23,020
 That's so important for you to get.

768
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:25,020
 That's why he has given you his spirit.

769
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:28,020
 Romans 5:5 says, "And hope does not put us to shame,

770
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:31,020
 "because God, he has poured his love into our hearts

771
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:34,020
 "through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us."

772
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:36,020
 How much does Jesus love you?

773
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:39,020
 So much so that he has given you the Holy Spirit

774
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:41,020
 to remind you, hey, I love you.

775
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:44,020
 Today, yeah, today.

776
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:47,020
 Tomorrow, yes, tomorrow.

777
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:50,020
 Next week, yeah, next week.

778
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:54,020
 This life, yeah, I'm not going anywhere.

779
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:58,020
 Forever, that's exactly where I'm taking you,

780
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:00,020
 because I love you.

781
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:02,020
 God wants to assure you of his love so much

782
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:05,020
 that he has poured his Holy Spirit into your life

783
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:12,020
 to declare to you how much he loves you.

784
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:15,020
 He wants to save you from a life of knowing his love distantly

785
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:18,020
 but never feeling his love personally.

786
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:20,020
 If he didn't, why would he enter into a relationship with you?

787
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:21,020
 Have you ever thought about that?

788
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:23,020
 Why would Jesus want relationship with you

789
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:25,020
 if all he wanted was for you to know about him?

790
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:27,020
 You can know about someone by just reading their story,

791
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:30,020
 but you cannot feel their love for you

792
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:32,020
 until you enter into their story.

793
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:35,020
 So many of us, we've read the story,

794
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:37,020
 but we have not read ourselves into it.

795
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:39,020
 The fact that he not only came to save the world,

796
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:42,020
 he came to save you.

797
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:46,020
 Last point, and we're going to have to go fast.

798
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:48,020
 Verse 19, he says, "That you may be filled

799
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:49,020
 with all the fullness of God."

800
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:51,020
 Here's the thing, we're all full of something, okay?

801
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:53,020
 Some of you, you're full of stress.

802
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:55,020
 Others of you, you're full of disappointment.

803
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:57,020
 Others, you're full of anxiety.

804
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:58,020
 Others, it's frustration.

805
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:00,020
 Some, it's regret.

806
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:01,020
 Contrary to what most people say,

807
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:03,020
 the world does not leave you empty.

808
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:06,020
 In fact, it is filling you up with something

809
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:08,020
 and the wrong thing.

810
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:09,020
 When I was in high school,

811
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:12,020
 I took my dad's truck to go and get some gas.

812
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:16,020
 By nature of my own habit, I hopped out of the truck,

813
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:18,020
 swiped my card, I grabbed the pump,

814
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:23,020
 and I proceeded to put gasoline into his diesel excursion.

815
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:28,020
 I was putting the wrong thing in his truck.

816
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:31,020
 I was filling it with that which would not help it,

817
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:32,020
 but hurt it.

818
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:34,020
 Many of you are filling yourself with things

819
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:37,020
 that will not help you, but will hurt you.

820
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:39,020
 Some of you, you have a habit

821
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:41,020
 of pumping the wrong thing into your life.

822
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:44,020
 And yet, here's the thing, my dad, he showed up,

823
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:47,020
 and he helped me siphon the gas from his tank.

824
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:48,020
 Jesus has shown up,

825
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:52,020
 and he has come to siphon the sin out of your soul.

826
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:53,020
 He wants to help you.

827
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:55,020
 He wants to move you back into right relationship,

828
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:59,020
 because Jesus gives fulfillment where the world cannot.

829
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:03,020
 He gives fulfillment where the world cannot.

830
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:06,020
 And here's the thing, we are all looking for fulfillment.

831
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:09,020
 What you need to know is fulfillment came looking for you.

832
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:11,020
 Fulfillment is not something you attain.

833
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:13,020
 It is something you appreciate,

834
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:15,020
 because you already have it if you have him.

835
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:18,020
 I love the way Charles Spurgeon described this lesson

836
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:19,020
 as he was teaching a friend.

837
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:21,020
 He took that friend to the edge of the ocean,

838
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:25,020
 and he took an empty bottle, unscrewed its lid,

839
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:28,020
 and plunged it into the depth of the ocean.

840
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:30,020
 And as he pulled it forward, and he showed it to his friend,

841
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:33,020
 he said, "This bottle, or the fullness of the ocean

842
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:35,020
 "is in this bottle."

843
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:39,020
 And he proceeded to take the bottle, put on its cap,

844
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:42,020
 and then throw the bottle into the ocean.

845
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:45,020
 And he said, "All the fullness of the bottle

846
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:47,020
 "is now in the ocean."

847
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:49,020
 That's the nature of relationship with Jesus.

848
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:51,020
 All of his fullness is in you,

849
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:53,020
 and all of your fullness is in him.

850
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:56,020
 He wants to be intimately, intricately intertwined with you.

851
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:59,020
 That's how deep his love is,

852
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:03,020
 and how big his heart wants for you.

853
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:08,020
 How do you know the love of God?

854
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:12,020
 You look to him who came to give you life,

855
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:14,020
 and life to the full.

856
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:17,020
 Some of that sounds too good to be true.

857
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:19,020
 It sounds too impossible to believe.

858
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:21,020
 It's too unreasonable to consider.

859
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:23,020
 And yet you need to know the way Paul ends

860
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:25,020
 is the right answer for you,

861
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:27,020
 not to him who is able to do far more abundantly

862
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:29,020
 than all we ask or think.

863
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:31,020
 Truth of the matter is, this is too good to be true.

864
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:33,020
 It is too unbelievable to consider.

865
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:36,020
 It is too impossible to be true.

866
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:40,020
 And yet God has made a business of doing the unbelievable.

867
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:43,020
 He delights in the impossible.

868
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:48,020
 He walks in the ways that are unreasonable to the world.

869
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:51,020
 He has come to give you strength in place of exhaustion

870
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:53,020
 through the love of his son,

871
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:56,020
 who came to give you life in place of death.

872
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:59,020
 He has come to give you acceptance and not rejection.

873
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:01,020
 Though all of us were dead in our sin,

874
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:03,020
 separated from God,

875
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:08,020
 he sent his son to bring us back into relationship with himself.

876
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:11,020
 He has given a love that is bigger than bored belief,

877
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:14,020
 a love that doesn't just lead you to want to believe in him,

878
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:18,020
 but wants you to be with him forever.

879
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:20,020
 He has come to give you fullness

880
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:22,020
 where the world cannot give you fullness.

881
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:26,020
 For Christ, he came to give you what the world and you yourself could not give you.

882
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:33,020
 He came to give you life, even at the cost of his own self.

883
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:35,020
 Do you want to know?

884
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:38,020
 Do you want to feel the love you know?

885
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:41,020
 You were here and you've heard of this love.

886
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:44,020
 If you want to feel the love you know,

887
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:48,020
 then you have to know the love he felt.

888
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:50,020
 The love he felt for you,

889
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:52,020
 the lengths he'd go to get to you,

890
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:54,020
 the life he would offer up in your place,

891
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:57,020
 the death he would die so you would not have to,

892
00:44:57,020 --> 00:45:00,020
 the resurrection he would take up,

893
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:03,020
 declaring that as he rises, you can rise with him.

894
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:05,020
 If only you place your faith in him.

895
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:08,020
 Do you want a love like this?

896
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:09,020
 It's not out there.

897
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:11,020
 It's right here.

898
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:12,020
 Place your faith in him.

899
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:13,020
 Let me pray.

900
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:14,020
 Jesus, thanks for tonight.

901
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:16,020
 Thank you for your love.

902
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:18,020
 We want to sing to you.

903
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:22,020
 We want to delight in what you've worked on us here this evening.

904
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:25,020
 And God, I feel, just transparently,

905
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:27,020
 the need to get off of this stage.

906
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:30,020
 The timer's going quick.

907
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:34,020
 And yet, Lord, I don't want to rush past what you may be doing.

908
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:36,020
 I think, God, you might be stirring.

909
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:39,020
 No, God, I believe you are stirring.

910
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:43,020
 There are some here that hear this call,

911
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:45,020
 that agree with the description.

912
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:46,020
 That has been my life.

913
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:48,020
 My life has been one where I have known the love of God,

914
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:50,020
 and yet I have not felt the love of God.

915
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:52,020
 And yet here tonight, I'm hearing you.

916
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:54,020
 Like that love, it offers strength.

917
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:56,020
 That love, it offers acceptance.

918
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:58,020
 That love, it offers weight.

919
00:45:58,020 --> 00:45:59,020
 And that love, it offers fulfillment.

920
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:00,020
 I want that.

921
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:02,020
 I want that kind of love.

922
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:04,020
 And you need look no longer.

923
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:07,020
 If you want that kind of love, that love has come looking for you.

924
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:09,020
 You need only place your faith in Christ.

925
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:11,020
 Others of you, you've already done so,

926
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:16,020
 and yet you find that your spirituality is more characterized by mediocrity

927
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:19,020
 than significance.

928
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:23,020
 You can change that all tonight by simply confessing that to him,

929
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:24,020
 asking him for more,

930
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:28,020
 and believing the fact that he has come to give you more than you already have.

931
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:30,020
 But, Jesus, we want you to work in us now.

932
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:32,020
 Would you take over the space?

933
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:33,020
 Would you move in us?

934
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:35,020
 We pray it's in your name.

935
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:36,020
 Amen.

936
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:38,600
 (upbeat music)
