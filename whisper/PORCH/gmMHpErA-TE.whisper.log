[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:13.300]   - All right, how's everybody doing tonight?
[00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:14.600]   All right, good, good.
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.360]   Well, glad to be here, Dallas.
[00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.240]   Say hello to Houston and anybody watching online tonight.
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.520]   Those of you guys watching online,
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.000]   just know we have been talking about you
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.920]   behind your back all night.
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.860]   I think David even said that we trim the fat
[00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.760]   with you guys staying at home watching tonight.
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.900]   So you can take that up with him.
[00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.200]   That is David Marvin, David@watermark.org.
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.040]   Any, all that stuff.
[00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.860]   All right, so I'm Adam.
[00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:37.940]   I lead the college ministry here.
[00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.220]   I'm excited to be with you guys tonight
[00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.860]   as we take a little one week break from Romans 8.
[00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:42.900]   So here's what I wanna start with.
[00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.180]   I wanna ask a question.
[00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.540]   How many of you guys out here in the audience tonight
[00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.020]   like to play cards, card games?
[00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.460]   How many card game players?
[00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.020]   All right, how many play spades?
[00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.460]   Play spades, that's your game of choice.
[00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.500]   Rummy, anybody rummy?
[00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.340]   Poker?
[00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.060]   All right, this is not a Baptist place.
[00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:59.300]   I love it, all right.
[00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.700]   Got some poker players out there.
[00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.020]   How about hearts?
[00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.260]   Let's feel like that spades like stepbrother,
[00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.100]   whatever, anybody.
[00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.860]   All right, how about a game red dot?
[00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.100]   Nobody, yeah, which is good
[00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.060]   'cause my brother made that game up.
[00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.740]   So it makes sense that none of you guys would play it.
[00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.180]   So I've got a younger brother
[00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.300]   who's about six years younger than me.
[00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.100]   And so he was probably five or six years old
[00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.200]   and he made up this game called red dot.
[00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.500]   And this was the worst game ever made
[00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.460]   because he always won and we never knew the rules.
[00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.580]   Never, ever, and he never knew the rules.
[00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:31.620]   He was just making it up.
[00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.820]   And so my mom liked to play a lot of solitaire,
[00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.860]   like old school solitaire with cards, not like on the phone.
[00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.580]   So we always had some cards like laying around.
[00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:40.940]   And so my brother, five, six years old,
[00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.580]   he just picks up these cards and he's like,
[00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:43.860]   "Hey, who wants to come play red dot?"
[00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.020]   And he'd hand the cards out
[00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.180]   and we didn't know if it was gonna be one card
[00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.020]   or 12 cards or no cards or whatever.
[00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.980]   It always went the same way, him just kind of going, "I win."
[00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.580]   And so I have a younger sister as well.
[00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.620]   So after a while, my sister and I, we wised up to this
[00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.820]   and we were like, "No way, we're not playing red dot anymore."
[00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.580]   And so after a while, my brother would try to get people
[00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.380]   to play red dot and he could not find anybody.
[00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.140]   And the only person he could find was my dad.
[00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.420]   And so I just have these memories of my dad and my brother
[00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.060]   sitting in the kitchen playing red dot
[00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.580]   and my dad just laughing hysterically
[00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.500]   at how the rules would always change.
[00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.460]   And me and my mom and my sister, the wise ones,
[00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.780]   we were over watching TV or doing something else.
[00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.140]   And so I start with that tonight
[00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.780]   because tonight we're gonna talk about a game.
[00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.140]   And this game is similar to red dot.
[00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.740]   And the way that it's similar to red dot
[00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.260]   is this, is it is a game also that nobody else ever wins.
[00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.900]   So this game that we're gonna talk about tonight
[00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.100]   is very similar to red dot.
[00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.780]   And it's a game that if you play it and when you play it,
[00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:38.940]   there are no winners.
[00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.540]   There's never a winner in this game.
[00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.460]   But this game is different than red dot
[00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.140]   where red dot has only been played by a handful of people.
[00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.020]   The game that we're gonna talk about tonight
[00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.400]   has been played by everyone.
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.380]   Every single person in the room tonight
[00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.580]   has played the game that we're gonna talk about.
[00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.060]   Some of you started playing this game
[00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.220]   really early in your life.
[00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.540]   You maybe started playing it in elementary school.
[00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.260]   You played it with classmates, you played it with friends,
[00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.740]   you played it maybe with some people in your family.
[00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.620]   When you maybe graduated and went on to high school,
[00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.540]   you maybe started playing it a lot in high school.
[00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.020]   Or then if you went to college,
[00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.420]   you started playing it in college.
[00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.580]   Or when you got out of college or if you're working now,
[00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:20.760]   you got a full-time job,
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.020]   you probably played this game with coworkers.
[00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.020]   You play this game with friends.
[00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:29.300]   You play this game with people that you know in the church,
[00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.180]   people that you know outside of the church.
[00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.740]   In fact, I'm willing to bet
[00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.440]   that a lot of you guys played this game today.
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.100]   In fact, I'm willing to go a little bit farther.
[00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.900]   I'm willing to bet that some of you guys,
[00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.840]   many of you in this room,
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.140]   have been playing this game tonight
[00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.420]   since we've been in this room.
[00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:52.140]   And this game that everybody plays, but nobody ever wins,
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.280]   this game is comparison.
[00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.740]   Comparison is the game that everybody plays,
[00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:59.920]   but nobody ever wins.
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.700]   There is never any win in comparison.
[00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.080]   My brother is undefeated in Red Dot,
[00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.360]   and comparison is undefeated.
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.480]   It always wins.
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.240]   Nobody has ever played that game and won.
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:13.160]   And we all do it.
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.180]   We all take the circumstances and the situations
[00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.000]   and the things that are going on in our life,
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.120]   and we compare it to people around us,
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.420]   or we compare it to coworkers,
[00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.040]   or we compare it to people that we know at church,
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.360]   or we compare it to our friends that we had growing up,
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.760]   or we compare our lives to people in our family.
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.000]   We all do this.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.640]   Every single one of us has played this game
[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.380]   or is playing it right now,
[00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.320]   but nobody has ever, ever, ever won this game.
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.840]   We are all losers in this game of comparison.
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.240]   And so here's what we're gonna do tonight.
[00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.800]   Tonight, as we take this break,
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.000]   just one week from Romans 8,
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.880]   what we're gonna do is we're gonna look
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.800]   at two kings.
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.880]   We're gonna look at two kings,
[00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.440]   and one of these kings that we're gonna see
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:56.660]   that we're gonna look at first,
[00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.760]   we're gonna see a reason or a reminder to us
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.960]   of what are the consequences
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.480]   if you and I continue to play the comparison game.
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.200]   If we continue to take the circumstances in our life
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.600]   and compare them to other people, where does that end?
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.460]   We're gonna be reminded again of what we know
[00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.480]   from experience, that nobody ever wins that game.
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.940]   And so one king is gonna remind us
[00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.160]   of the consequences of playing the comparison game.
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.840]   And this king is also gonna remind us
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.340]   of why we play this game.
[00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.400]   And then we're gonna look at a second king.
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.040]   And the second king that we're gonna look at
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.080]   is completely different than this first one.
[00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.280]   And what we're gonna see as we look at the second king
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.280]   is we're gonna see a way that you and I,
[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.720]   like really, really practical ways
[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.280]   that you and I can avoid playing this game
[00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.000]   so that we don't have to go around
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.700]   continuing to play this game
[00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:46.880]   that absolutely nobody ever wins.
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.060]   And so if you got your Bibles tonight,
[00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.080]   let's open up to 1 Samuel 18.
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.160]   That's where we're gonna be, 1 Samuel 18.
[00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.320]   And so let me just set up a little bit
[00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:56.680]   where we're going in this first king.
[00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.480]   So the first king that we're gonna look at
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:59.780]   is this guy named Saul.
[00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:03.280]   He was actually the first king of the nation of Israel.
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.040]   And so we're gonna be in the Old Testament.
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:07.280]   And whenever you hear about the nation of Israel
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:08.480]   in the Old Testament, what that is,
[00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:11.280]   that's the people of God.
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:12.380]   That's the people of God.
[00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:15.160]   And so here it is, it's the people of God.
[00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.280]   They've been slaves in Egypt for 400 years,
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:18.920]   and then they were set free by Moses,
[00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.120]   and they went through the Red Sea,
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.840]   and they were going into this land
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.800]   that God had promised for them.
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.400]   And they're starting to settle in this land.
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.960]   They're starting to develop as a nation.
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.360]   And for years and years and years,
[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.320]   God had been leading his people.
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:33.720]   And the way he had been leading them
[00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.840]   was he had just been, he had been kind of their king,
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.680]   and he was just leading through faithful men.
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:40.760]   And that was his preference.
[00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.440]   That's the way he wanted to continue
[00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.560]   to lead this nation of Israel.
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:45.920]   He wanted to be their king,
[00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:47.560]   and he just wanted to lead through a faithful man.
[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.520]   And so here it is, this nation, they're getting established,
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:51.840]   and they're starting to look around
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.840]   at some of the other nations that are around them.
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.880]   And they realize these other nations around them
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:57.280]   have a different form of government.
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.720]   They have an actual king.
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:00.760]   And so the nation of Israel
[00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:02.200]   goes to their spiritual leader at the time,
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:04.840]   this guy named Samuel, and they're like, we want a king.
[00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:07.280]   We wanna be like everybody else.
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.400]   And Samuel tries to talk him out of it and go,
[00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.300]   listen, I don't think you wanna be like everybody else.
[00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:12.760]   I don't think you want a king.
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:13.920]   And they're sitting there going, no, no, no,
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:15.840]   we want a king, we want a king, we want a king.
[00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:17.920]   And so Samuel finally says, all right, fine,
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:19.880]   I'll go get you a king.
[00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:21.940]   And so he prays and he seeks the Lord's guidance,
[00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:25.240]   and God directs him to a man,
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.360]   and it's this man named Saul.
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:28.880]   It's really interesting as you read here
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:32.120]   in the early part of 1 Samuel, the description of Saul,
[00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:33.680]   what it basically says about Saul,
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:36.120]   if you laid your eyes on Saul,
[00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:37.160]   here's what you would have noticed,
[00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:40.700]   is that Saul was tall and he was handsome.
[00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:42.600]   He was tall and handsome,
[00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:45.540]   like he would have been the perfect bachelor.
[00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:48.520]   Right, like one of the tall, handsome guys.
[00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:51.280]   I just imagine a little, maybe a little Italian accent.
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:55.960]   Maybe wear shorts that are a little too short,
[00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:57.560]   but we'd be like, oh, he's European, you know,
[00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:00.360]   we'll cut him some break, you know, get him a little slack.
[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:01.760]   He's really good looking or whatever.
[00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:03.680]   And so I imagine maybe, or like,
[00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:07.300]   he's one of these Disney princes, not princesses.
[00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:08.400]   He's a prince or whatever.
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:11.260]   Like he's the hero in a Disney movie.
[00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:16.120]   That's the way this king was described.
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:18.280]   And so you would think that tall and handsome,
[00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:19.960]   that his legacy would have been awesome,
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:21.600]   that he would have started to govern the land
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.120]   and he would have been fantastic
[00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:24.360]   and he would have gone down in history
[00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:26.000]   of being one of the greatest kings ever.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.480]   And there would have forever been a model
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:30.360]   to say every other leader from here on out
[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:32.520]   needs to be tall and needs to be handsome.
[00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:34.240]   And you would think that that's what his story is,
[00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:38.140]   that he should be a hero, but that's not his story.
[00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:41.820]   That's not the legacy that Saul left.
[00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:46.100]   The legacy that he left was not one of like a Disney hero.
[00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:48.940]   The legacy he left actually is more like a villain.
[00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:52.640]   He left this legacy of being somebody
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:57.640]   who was controlled by jealousy, somebody who was envious,
[00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:01.900]   somebody who was neurotic, narcissistic,
[00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:05.900]   and really lived a completely miserable life.
[00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:10.740]   And the reason why that's Saul's legacy
[00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:12.380]   is because Saul played the game.
[00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:15.100]   Saul played the comparison game.
[00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:17.460]   Shortly after he became king,
[00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:19.540]   there was this other guy that started to come on the scene
[00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:21.700]   and his name was David.
[00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:24.940]   And then David did something that was kind of a big deal
[00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:25.980]   for the nation of Israel,
[00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:28.060]   that he took down one of their enemies.
[00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:32.260]   He took down the giant, like he took down Goliath.
[00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.120]   And after he took down Goliath,
[00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:36.980]   David's notoriety and his fame started to rise
[00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:39.180]   and all the people of Israel started to say,
[00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:40.980]   hey, we like that guy.
[00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:42.980]   We wanna follow after that guy.
[00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:47.020]   And so Saul made this choice to play the game
[00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:51.260]   and to forever compare his life to David.
[00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.460]   Let's pick this up in 1 Samuel 18, look at verse six.
[00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:55.300]   Here's what he says,
[00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:57.380]   they're coming back after David had killed Goliath.
[00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:58.580]   And here's what it says.
[00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:01.140]   "When the men were returning home
[00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:02.740]   "after David had killed the Philistine,
[00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:06.500]   "the women came out from all the towns
[00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:09.500]   "of Israel to meet King Saul with singing and dancing,
[00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:12.060]   "with joyful songs, with timbrels and lyres.
[00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:15.900]   "And they danced, or as they danced, here's what they sang.
[00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:18.740]   "Saul has slayed his thousands
[00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:22.460]   "and David, his tens of thousands."
[00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:26.740]   It goes on in verse eight, Saul was very angry.
[00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:29.660]   This refrain, it displeased him greatly.
[00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:31.740]   "They have credited David with tens of thousands,
[00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:33.860]   "he thought, but me with only thousands.
[00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:37.060]   "What more can he get but the kingdom?"
[00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:38.300]   And then look at what it says here in verse nine.
[00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:39.980]   This is him playing the game.
[00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:44.140]   "From that time on, Saul kept a close eye on David."
[00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:45.940]   Skip on down to verse 12, look at what he says here.
[00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:47.920]   "Saul was afraid of David,
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:50.580]   "because the Lord was with David and had departed from Saul.
[00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:52.760]   "So he sent David away from him
[00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:54.480]   "and gave him command over a thousand men.
[00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:56.300]   "And David led the troops in their campaigns."
[00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:57.580]   You can see what Saul was doing.
[00:10:57.580 --> 00:10:59.140]   He was comparing himself to David.
[00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:00.420]   He wanted David dead.
[00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:02.820]   So here's what I'm gonna do, David.
[00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:04.140]   You're now gonna lead these armies.
[00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:05.220]   You're gonna go off into battle,
[00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:08.100]   hoping that David would die.
[00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:08.940]   But that's not what happened.
[00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:10.180]   His fame continued to rise.
[00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:11.940]   In verse 14, "In everything he did,
[00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:16.420]   "he had great success because of the Lord was with him.
[00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:20.820]   "And when Saul saw how successful he was,
[00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:22.000]   "he was afraid of him.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.120]   "But all of Israel and Judah loved David
[00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:28.780]   "because he led them in their campaigns."
[00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:32.360]   And what's so sad is you read the rest of 1 Samuel,
[00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:36.540]   from chapter 18 all the way to the end in chapter 31,
[00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:39.900]   it is just this tragic story of a man
[00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:42.020]   who is just controlled by jealousy
[00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:43.780]   and playing this comparison game.
[00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:46.700]   This man who feels like he's constantly falling short
[00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:47.820]   of this hero.
[00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:52.420]   And he's just neurotic and he's narcissistic
[00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:54.780]   and he's mean to David and he tries to kill David.
[00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:56.240]   And for the rest of that book,
[00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:59.620]   the legacy that Saul leaves all of us
[00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:02.640]   is just running after David,
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:04.300]   constantly frustrated by David.
[00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:05.220]   And then the end of the book,
[00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:09.260]   Saul dies rather uneventfully on the battlefield
[00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.320]   and his life is over.
[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:16.180]   And so we can sit here tonight and we can look at Saul
[00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:18.040]   and we can cross our arms and we can read,
[00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:19.940]   go home tonight and read 1 Samuel.
[00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:22.100]   And we can sit there and pick on him and go,
[00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:23.620]   I can't believe he did that.
[00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:25.420]   I don't understand why he would go and do that.
[00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:27.860]   Doesn't he understand that David was gonna be
[00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:29.140]   the one that God wanted to lead.
[00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:31.220]   And we can sit here and we can nitpick all of that.
[00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:34.100]   But here's what we need to remember about Saul,
[00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:37.020]   that he stands as a reminder to all of us
[00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:39.500]   of what happens when we play the game.
[00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:41.980]   Our lives don't get healthier
[00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:44.900]   when we constantly play the game of comparison.
[00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:48.100]   Our lives get to be like Saul.
[00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:52.040]   But the other thing that Saul can remind us of is this,
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:54.340]   is that the reason you and I,
[00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:56.300]   the reason we play the comparison game
[00:12:56.300 --> 00:13:00.120]   is the exact same reason Saul played the comparison game.
[00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:02.740]   We are no different than Saul.
[00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:04.080]   The reason Saul played that game
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:05.580]   is the same reason we played that game.
[00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:08.080]   And the reason we all play that game is simply this,
[00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:12.140]   we do not trust God.
[00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:12.980]   That's it.
[00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:16.060]   I mean, every single one of us has faced
[00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:19.280]   a very similar situation to what Saul faced.
[00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:23.460]   I mean, Saul was not being chosen.
[00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:24.420]   He was not chosen.
[00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:26.720]   And we've all been through that.
[00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:29.180]   I mean, as David's fame started to rise,
[00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:30.780]   people were choosing David.
[00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:31.820]   They wanted to follow David.
[00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:32.940]   They wanted to be like him.
[00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:35.300]   And so they were choosing David
[00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:37.540]   and not choosing to follow after him or to celebrate him.
[00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:39.060]   And every single, we've all been through
[00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:40.060]   something like that.
[00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:43.340]   We can all think of circumstances in our life,
[00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:44.620]   whether it started in elementary school,
[00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:47.640]   at recess with kickball, and you were the last one chosen,
[00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:50.040]   or it moved on into high school or middle school
[00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:51.440]   or college with dating,
[00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:54.020]   you felt like you were never the one chosen
[00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:56.060]   to go to date functions or never the one chosen.
[00:13:56.060 --> 00:14:00.100]   Now, maybe today, maybe it went on to applying to colleges
[00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:01.460]   and you didn't get into the school
[00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:03.980]   that you wanted to get into, you were not chosen.
[00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:06.420]   Or maybe there were organizations you wanted to join
[00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:07.440]   at certain points in your life
[00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:10.060]   and you were not chosen to join those organizations.
[00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:12.300]   Maybe you didn't get the job that you wanted,
[00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:14.220]   or maybe in the job that you're in right now,
[00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:15.780]   you didn't get the promotion.
[00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:18.260]   And so every single one of us can identify
[00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:19.940]   with Saul's situation and go,
[00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:21.680]   we all have situations in our life
[00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:25.240]   where we were not chosen and it hurts.
[00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:26.080]   It hurts.
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:29.840]   I remember for me very specifically,
[00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:31.800]   one of the times in my life where I was not chosen,
[00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:34.480]   and there have been a lot, but one that stung.
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:38.960]   And it was in the winter of 1988, I was in eighth grade.
[00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:41.720]   And it was the winter ball.
[00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:45.280]   And the winter ball, it was a big deal.
[00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:46.920]   It was on a Friday night in eighth grade.
[00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:48.360]   And I just remember everybody went to it.
[00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:50.920]   And it was not a date function and that was okay.
[00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:53.100]   Everybody just showed up kind of stag to this thing.
[00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:55.080]   And that was really good for me in my circumstances
[00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:56.840]   because three weeks before the winter ball,
[00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:58.760]   I broke up with Jessica Vollmerhausen.
[00:14:58.760 --> 00:14:59.800]   So Jessica Vollmerhausen and I,
[00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:01.440]   we talked a little bit on the phone the summer
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:04.200]   before the class started or before school started.
[00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:05.040]   You know how that goes.
[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:06.400]   You talk to somebody on the phone and you connect
[00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:07.500]   and you're like, I think I like her.
[00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:08.800]   And so third day of school,
[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:10.360]   I asked Jessica Vollmerhausen to go with me.
[00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:12.040]   And she said, yes, she chose me.
[00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:15.020]   And we were like going together in eighth grade.
[00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:17.380]   And so we did things like we held hands this way,
[00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:20.240]   walking through the hallways like real lovers do, right?
[00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:21.960]   Like interlocked fingers.
[00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:24.000]   And we would hug sometimes, not side hugs
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.320]   'cause not following Jesus,
[00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:27.320]   full frontal hugs and all that, okay?
[00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:31.200]   And so we were dating or we were going together.
[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:32.520]   I never took her on a date, right?
[00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:33.760]   So we were going together.
[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:35.640]   And then for some reason we broke up.
[00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:38.520]   And so it was the time for the winter ball.
[00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:39.900]   And I got all dressed up.
[00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:41.680]   I got a picture of it.
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:42.760]   You guys wanna see it?
[00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:46.520]   This is what I looked like that night of the winter ball.
[00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:48.220]   Is it up?
[00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:51.540]   (congregation laughing)
[00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:57.600]   Very tall and handsome, very tall.
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:00.780]   There's tight rolled pants there.
[00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:01.900]   This is 1988.
[00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:06.820]   It's a gray turtleneck because that's a staple
[00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:08.180]   in everybody's wardrobe.
[00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:11.300]   Cardigan.
[00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:14.600]   Calculator watch.
[00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:17.180]   (congregation laughing)
[00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:20.060]   But I had like a smile that was like a 1920s picture
[00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:21.460]   for some reason, I don't know why.
[00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:24.220]   Like they never smiled back then and I was upset.
[00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:26.380]   And so anyway, I show up, I'm looking great.
[00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:28.220]   I show up to the winter ball.
[00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:30.740]   And I'm like, man, this is gonna be fun.
[00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:31.980]   I'm gonna be out there with all my friends.
[00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:32.820]   And so you know how that goes.
[00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:34.860]   You walk into the school and you walk through the hallway
[00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:36.260]   and you go into the multi-purpose room
[00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:38.340]   that you were just eating lunch in a few hours earlier.
[00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:41.020]   And those tables that fold in flat with the round seats,
[00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:42.300]   they're pushed over on the side.
[00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:44.640]   And so I walk into that room
[00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:47.320]   and then there's chairs all around and there's music blaring
[00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:48.880]   but nobody's dancing 'cause Salt-N-Pepa
[00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:50.000]   hasn't been played yet.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.160]   And we're waiting for George Michael's father figure
[00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:55.480]   so we could start to slow dance and all that kind of stuff.
[00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:56.840]   And there's my friends.
[00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:58.360]   They're all sitting there, nobody's dancing.
[00:16:58.360 --> 00:16:59.920]   There's my friends.
[00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:03.380]   And I walk over and there's Jessica.
[00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:07.200]   She's got her dress on and a little corsage.
[00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:09.700]   And there's Miles.
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:13.080]   (congregation laughing)
[00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:14.700]   With his arm around her.
[00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:17.280]   'Cause now they're going together.
[00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:19.680]   And like my heart broke
[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:21.160]   and I did what any eighth grade boy would do.
[00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:22.140]   I just went out in the hallway
[00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:23.880]   and I cried the rest of the night.
[00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:26.880]   Way more symphony than I deserve on that.
[00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:29.080]   All right, so I went out there
[00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:30.920]   and like my heart was broken.
[00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:32.660]   I was not chosen.
[00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:34.520]   And it was just the Lord preparing me
[00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:36.880]   for a lot of heartbreak for the rest of my life.
[00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:39.000]   But we've all been through situations like that
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.560]   where we have not been chosen for something
[00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:43.240]   and it stings every time.
[00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:46.280]   And I did what anybody would do.
[00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:47.880]   You know, as I'm sitting there and I'm trying to think like,
[00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:49.800]   hey, why did she choose him and not me?
[00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:50.640]   Was it the hair?
[00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:51.760]   Is it that I don't skateboard?
[00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:53.320]   Is it that he plays baseball better?
[00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:54.160]   Like, what is it?
[00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:56.520]   And you just start comparing your life to somebody else
[00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:57.760]   or the one who was chosen.
[00:17:57.760 --> 00:17:59.860]   And you just start trying to think of all of this stuff
[00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:02.580]   that you need to change and you just, you lose.
[00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:05.040]   You play the game and you lose.
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:05.920]   And we've all been through that.
[00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:08.080]   Saul went through that and that's why we go through it.
[00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:10.840]   And in that, it's not trusting God.
[00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:12.400]   So we've been through situations like that
[00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:14.400]   where we haven't been chosen.
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:16.600]   And then there's other situations like what Saul was facing
[00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:19.600]   where we just think maybe something's better out there.
[00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:22.600]   Like maybe something is better.
[00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:24.000]   Like maybe that person's better
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.400]   and so I need to maybe try to be
[00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:26.360]   a little bit more like them.
[00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:28.240]   Or maybe there's something around the corner.
[00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:30.280]   Or if I dated that person or if I did that job
[00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:32.900]   or if I had that title or if I went over to that company,
[00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:33.900]   then that would be better.
[00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:35.740]   And you start comparing and getting your eyes
[00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:37.800]   looking everywhere and it just starts to drive you
[00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:39.480]   crazy 'cause you just think something
[00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:40.720]   might be better out there.
[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:43.620]   And so you can't enjoy anything that's going on right now.
[00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:46.160]   I saw a great example of this.
[00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:48.000]   I've got a seven year old and a five year old little boy.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.320]   And a seven year old boy a couple of weeks ago named Jake.
[00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:54.140]   It was spring break and got to spend most of a day with him.
[00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:56.440]   And so we did a couple of things that were fun that day.
[00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:58.200]   And one of the things we were gonna do at the end of the day
[00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:00.480]   is I was gonna take him to Target and we were gonna get,
[00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:01.940]   I was gonna buy him some baseball cards
[00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:03.960]   and some Pokemon cards 'cause that's what he's into.
[00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:06.200]   And I was just gonna do it, not because he deserved it.
[00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:08.560]   And I was just gonna bless him.
[00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:10.300]   He's my son and I was spending time with him.
[00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:12.860]   And I just wanted to bless him with something
[00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:14.160]   that would make him happy.
[00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:17.080]   And so we're walking into Target and I'm like,
[00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:17.920]   "Hey Jake, here's the deal.
[00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:19.960]   "I'll buy you maybe two packs of that or one pack of that.
[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:21.900]   "I got about $10 that I'll spend on you.
[00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:22.740]   "That's what I wanna do."
[00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:23.560]   And he's like, "Okay."
[00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:24.920]   And he's like, "All right, so what racks?"
[00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:26.880]   And he starts looking at that rack and those cards.
[00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:27.840]   And then he's over there.
[00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:31.260]   And then his eyes dropped from what I told him
[00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:34.920]   I would buy him and then it went to the lower shelf.
[00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:37.760]   And his eyes moved from the $4 packs
[00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:41.240]   and it started to move to the $25 shiny box.
[00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:42.280]   He's like, "Hey, can I get this?"
[00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:43.880]   And I'm like, "No, bud, that's 25 bucks.
[00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:45.480]   "I wanna spend about 10.
[00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:46.360]   "Can you get something else?"
[00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:47.720]   And he sees this other box and he's like,
[00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:48.640]   "Hey, can I get this?"
[00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:51.040]   And, "No, man, that one's 35.
[00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:52.040]   "I wanna bless you.
[00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:53.800]   "I just wanna spend about 10, okay?"
[00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:55.680]   And he's going over here and he's like, "How about that?"
[00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:56.680]   "No, that one's 50."
[00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:58.240]   Which, that's cardboard.
[00:19:58.240 --> 00:19:59.240]   All right, $50.
[00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:01.680]   And so maybe that and we're back and forth and fine.
[00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:03.080]   He could not make up his mind.
[00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:06.200]   He literally could not look at those other cards.
[00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:09.760]   His eyes were just drawn to the better ones.
[00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:12.320]   And finally, I just had to get down on one knee
[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:13.160]   and I'm looking at him, I'm like,
[00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:15.000]   "Jake, I think we need to go.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.760]   "I brought you here and I did this
[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:18.880]   "and I wanted just to bless you
[00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:20.440]   "'cause I wanted to give you something.
[00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:22.200]   "And it seems like you're just,
[00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:24.880]   "you're so focused on what you're not gonna get
[00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:29.600]   "that you can't enjoy what I'm willing to freely give you."
[00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:33.600]   And so he sat there and he took the cards
[00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:34.760]   and he just kind of begrudgingly,
[00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:36.160]   we went through the line and I paid for him
[00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:37.000]   and he opened them up
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.400]   and now I'm sure he can't even find them.
[00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:40.680]   And it just, it completely robbed
[00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:41.960]   any of that joy that he had.
[00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:44.200]   He was so focused on the better,
[00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:47.320]   so focused on that might be better,
[00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:50.000]   what's in that box might be better,
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.720]   that he didn't trust me
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:54.160]   and he couldn't even enjoy any of it.
[00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:55.520]   And so every single one of us,
[00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:58.280]   we've been through situations just like Saul.
[00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:02.240]   We've been through situations in our life
[00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:04.000]   where we were not chosen for something
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.160]   or we've been through situations in our life
[00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:09.040]   where we think that there's something better out there.
[00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:11.920]   And guys, when we face those situations,
[00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:14.360]   we have two choices to make, that's it.
[00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:16.560]   There's only two things we can do.
[00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:18.080]   There's not three, not four, not five.
[00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:19.840]   There are two things we can do.
[00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:22.560]   Option number one is we can end those situations
[00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:23.400]   when we're not chosen
[00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:24.800]   or we think there may be something better.
[00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:28.960]   Option number one is trust God, trust him.
[00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:30.560]   And look at these circumstances,
[00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:32.000]   not as things that we need to fix
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.840]   or something that maybe God is trying to hold back from us,
[00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:37.360]   but look at that and remind ourselves
[00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:40.240]   of what David says in Psalm 115, verse three,
[00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:43.800]   that our God is in heaven
[00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:48.160]   and he does whatever he pleases.
[00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:53.200]   And remind ourselves of what David's son Solomon
[00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:55.520]   ultimately said here in Proverbs 16, nine,
[00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:59.000]   "In their hearts, humans plan their course,
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.320]   "but the Lord, the Lord is the one
[00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:02.640]   "who establishes their steps."
[00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:04.120]   Remind ourselves of what Paul wrote
[00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:06.800]   and that you guys studied last week in Romans 8, 28.
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:09.000]   And we know that in all things,
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.280]   God works for the good of those who love him
[00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:17.400]   and who have been called according to his purposes.
[00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:18.880]   These situations that we face
[00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:20.640]   where somebody else is being chosen
[00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:21.800]   or we think there's someone
[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:23.600]   or something else out there that's better,
[00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:26.000]   these are situations where we can trust God.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:26.840]   That's what we can do.
[00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:30.040]   We can trust him and just recognize that he's in heaven.
[00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:33.400]   He's the one controlling all of these circumstances.
[00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:34.480]   That's one option.
[00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:38.240]   Well, the other option is play the game.
[00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:39.080]   That's it.
[00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:43.600]   Trust him or play the comparison game.
[00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:48.280]   And if you choose not to trust him in those situations,
[00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:50.960]   if you choose to play the comparison game,
[00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:52.320]   and here's what's gonna happen.
[00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:54.600]   And here's what's gonna happen.
[00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:56.200]   Things are not gonna get better.
[00:22:56.200 --> 00:23:00.440]   You're gonna become more controlling.
[00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:02.520]   You're gonna become more manipulative.
[00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:05.360]   You're gonna become more discontent.
[00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:08.400]   You're gonna become filled with jealousy
[00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:09.440]   and filled with envy.
[00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:10.640]   You're gonna become more neurotic.
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:12.120]   You're gonna become more narcissistic.
[00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:13.800]   You're gonna just become this like,
[00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:18.000]   just totally and completely focused on yourself.
[00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:23.440]   You'll be miserable and you won't win
[00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:27.480]   'cause nobody ever, ever, ever wins the comparison game.
[00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:30.920]   You trust him or you play.
[00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:34.200]   I mean, here's the fact of the matter, guys.
[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:36.600]   If there's ever a time in our life
[00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:38.240]   where we feel like we're winning,
[00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:41.080]   where we feel like things are going our way,
[00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:43.560]   where we feel like, hey, the relationships are going well,
[00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:45.920]   the job's going well, the bank account's going well,
[00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:48.120]   I feel like I'm winning right now.
[00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:50.000]   What we need to remember,
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.200]   we need to remember in those situations in life
[00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:54.040]   when you and I, when we feel like we're winning,
[00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:56.200]   we generally take a lot more credit
[00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:58.400]   for those times in our life than we deserve.
[00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:01.320]   We generally take a lot more credit than we deserve.
[00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:02.840]   I think again about my brother.
[00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:04.760]   When I was growing up in Manassas, Virginia
[00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:06.440]   is where I spent my elementary school years.
[00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:08.480]   In Manassas, Virginia, one of my favorite restaurants
[00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:10.120]   or my parents' favorite restaurants
[00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:13.800]   that we went to all the time was this place called El Taco,
[00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:16.960]   which is Spanish for the taco.
[00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:18.160]   (congregation laughing)
[00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:20.760]   All right, so this was like this one Mexican restaurant
[00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:22.520]   in Manassas, Virginia,
[00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:24.840]   nowhere close to being as good as what we have
[00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:26.920]   up here in North Texas, praise the Lord.
[00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:28.480]   But this is what we had, all right?
[00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:30.120]   This is what we had in Manassas, Virginia.
[00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:33.600]   It was cheap and the kids kind of liked it
[00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:34.800]   and they were always friends there.
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:36.320]   And so we went to El Taco a lot.
[00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:38.240]   And so we showed up to El Taco
[00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:40.200]   and El Taco was in this strip center.
[00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:42.960]   And so there was no playground there.
[00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:45.040]   And so my little brother, my little brother,
[00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:47.080]   we'd walk into El Taco and my parents were like,
[00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:48.400]   "What do we do with a five-year-old?"
[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:50.640]   And so my dad came up with this brilliant idea.
[00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:52.880]   He knew that there was an original Pac-Man machine
[00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:54.240]   and we didn't know it was original at that time.
[00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:55.120]   It was just Pac-Man.
[00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:57.960]   And so there was a Pac-Man machine right there, video game.
[00:24:57.960 --> 00:24:59.680]   And my dad would get one of those chairs
[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:01.000]   and he would turn it around
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.760]   and he'd put it right in front of that Pac-Man machine.
[00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:05.120]   He'd pick my brother up and he'd say, "Play."
[00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:05.960]   And he'd walk away,
[00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:08.560]   would not put a quarter in the machine, all right?
[00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:09.840]   (congregation laughing)
[00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:11.160]   Would just tell my brother to play.
[00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:12.320]   And 'cause my dad, brilliant,
[00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:14.520]   he knew that like the computer would play
[00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:16.880]   the simulated game and he knew my brother
[00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:18.660]   was not at that time very smart.
[00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:21.280]   And so he would sit there and he'd be like, "Oh, yeah, yeah."
[00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:22.280]   And then my dad, he knows,
[00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:23.840]   eating burritos or whatever and come over
[00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:24.880]   and he'd be like, "How you doing?"
[00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:27.480]   "Doing better than last week, keep it up," right?
[00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:29.880]   And my brother would walk out of there going like,
[00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:32.560]   "I'm the man, I can play Pac-Man better than anybody."
[00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:35.800]   He was never playing the game, ever.
[00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:37.560]   He was taking way more credit
[00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:39.480]   than he deserved for all of that.
[00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:41.760]   And isn't that true?
[00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:42.580]   Isn't that what we do?
[00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:44.040]   When things in life, when it feels like we're winning,
[00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:45.440]   when the circumstances are working out,
[00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:47.640]   we generally, we're not winning.
[00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:50.360]   Like if those things are going like that,
[00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:53.320]   that's not, these are not rewards for being awesome.
[00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:58.600]   These are opportunities to be faithful,
[00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:00.340]   opportunities to steward.
[00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:04.880]   What God in His grace and His mercy and His sovereignty,
[00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:07.760]   as He's in heaven doing whatever He pleases,
[00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:09.760]   has decided to bring into our life.
[00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:13.360]   That's what's going on when it feels like we're winning,
[00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:15.000]   which means the opposite is true.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.400]   If we feel like we're losing,
[00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:21.380]   if we feel like the circumstances in life
[00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:23.200]   are not comparing to our friends
[00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:24.260]   and it's just not adding up
[00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:26.520]   and we're starting to feel bad and sorry for ourselves,
[00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:29.600]   we're not losing in those situations.
[00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:30.440]   Most of the time,
[00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:31.680]   when those circumstances are not working out,
[00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:36.040]   we take way more blame on ourselves than we really deserve.
[00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:38.280]   'Cause here's the deal,
[00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:40.680]   if we start to compare and we start to think,
[00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:42.400]   oh, if I just changed the way I look,
[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:43.520]   if I just looked this way,
[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:44.680]   or if I just got that job,
[00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:45.640]   or if I just got this money,
[00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:47.640]   or I could just get into this relationship,
[00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:49.160]   or if this one would just work out,
[00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:51.720]   like if all of that stuff changed,
[00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:53.960]   that's not gonna make us more content.
[00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:57.520]   Those aren't circumstances that need to be manipulated
[00:26:57.520 --> 00:26:58.480]   and that need to be changed.
[00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:01.920]   Those are circumstances where we need to just trust.
[00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:02.800]   We need to trust.
[00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:05.320]   So this first King Saul,
[00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:09.240]   he reminds us that the reason you and I play this game
[00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:10.440]   that nobody wins
[00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:12.080]   is the exact same reason he played the game.
[00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:15.000]   And we play the game because we do not trust God.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:19.080]   And Saul also stands as this tragic reminder
[00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:21.760]   of the consequences of playing that game.
[00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:22.760]   It does not go well.
[00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:26.440]   It ends up poorly for all of us
[00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:30.100]   because there is no win in the game of comparison.
[00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:32.760]   So let's look at the second King here.
[00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:33.760]   Let's look at David.
[00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:37.400]   So Saul, the end of chapter 31 in 1 Samuel,
[00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:40.760]   Saul died, David became the king.
[00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:43.400]   And it's really interesting.
[00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:45.680]   I mean, Saul's legacy was one of jealousy
[00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:48.040]   and being neurotic and narcissistic
[00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:51.640]   and being jealous and running after David.
[00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:52.760]   So that's Saul's legacy.
[00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:54.000]   What's really interesting
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.680]   is that's like the complete opposite of David's legacy.
[00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:58.600]   David became king.
[00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:00.840]   And what is the legacy that we know about David?
[00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:02.360]   We know that he was one of the greatest
[00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:04.400]   kings ever for the nation of Israel.
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:07.240]   It's not the greatest king ever for the nation of Israel.
[00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:08.600]   And the other thing we know about David
[00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:11.320]   is that his reputation was that he was a man
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:13.000]   after God's own heart.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.280]   We know David was not perfect,
[00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:17.040]   but we know that even in his imperfection,
[00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:21.160]   he handled it in a way that still for us today is a model.
[00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:24.400]   And David left us this amazing gift.
[00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:26.680]   He left us the Psalms, his writings.
[00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:28.040]   It's almost like reading his journal,
[00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:29.800]   reading his innermost thoughts.
[00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:31.320]   And what you see is you can see
[00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:32.160]   his innermost thoughts.
[00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:34.000]   And what you see as you read through David's writings,
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.240]   as you read through the Psalms,
[00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:37.160]   you just get this glimpse into his heart
[00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:38.960]   and the way that he viewed the world.
[00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:40.520]   And you just get this sense
[00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:44.280]   that David had just decided and resolved in his heart
[00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:46.960]   that he was gonna do whatever he possibly could do
[00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:50.400]   to make sure that his eyes stayed on God.
[00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:54.320]   That his heart and his eyes and his affections
[00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:57.600]   were gonna remain as steadfast as possible on the Lord.
[00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:00.360]   And because he was so focused on God,
[00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:03.560]   and growing in his relationship with him and trusting him,
[00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:05.360]   because he was so focused on him,
[00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:07.640]   the thought of playing the comparison game
[00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:10.280]   never even seemed to cross his mind.
[00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:17.320]   So one of these stories is David was chasing after Saul.
[00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:19.560]   Excuse me, Saul was chasing after David.
[00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:22.480]   He was trying to kill him and David didn't wanna die.
[00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:24.440]   And so in 1 Samuel chapter 21,
[00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:28.040]   David flees where Saul is, flees the geographic area
[00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:30.560]   and goes to this town where he's a stranger,
[00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:33.440]   he's a foreigner, it's this town called Gath.
[00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:37.120]   And he shows up there and he's frustrated and he's upset.
[00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:39.360]   And he knows that Saul is coming after him.
[00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:43.040]   And you can imagine like if that was us,
[00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:44.640]   if somebody was coming after us,
[00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:46.880]   if we were innocent and somebody was coming after us
[00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:49.880]   and driving us and we knew that somebody was jealous of us
[00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:51.120]   and envious of us,
[00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:52.800]   and we were sitting there in the same situation
[00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:56.000]   that David was, that we would be sitting there
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:56.840]   and just go, you know what?
[00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:57.680]   I'm gonna play this game.
[00:29:57.680 --> 00:29:58.520]   I'm gonna fight.
[00:29:58.520 --> 00:29:59.640]   If he's gonna compete against me,
[00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:00.960]   then I'm gonna compete against him.
[00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:03.040]   If he's gonna come after me, then I'm gonna go after him.
[00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:06.480]   I'm not gonna let him ruin my life.
[00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:08.520]   If it's me, that's the way I would react.
[00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:11.760]   But that's not the way David reacted.
[00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:15.480]   So David gave us this gift in Psalm 56.
[00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:17.160]   And in here guys, in here,
[00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:19.680]   I think David gives us this indication
[00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:22.240]   like these really, really practical things
[00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:26.440]   that you and I can do to avoid playing that comparison game.
[00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:29.000]   So here he is, he's sitting in this town
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:29.840]   where he's a foreigner.
[00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:30.840]   He's got somebody coming after me
[00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:31.680]   and look at what he does here.
[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:34.000]   First, Psalm 56, the first thing he does
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.880]   is he just confesses reality to God.
[00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:39.840]   Just confesses reality to God.
[00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:40.840]   He says, "God, be merciful."
[00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:43.080]   Verse one, "Be merciful to me, my God.
[00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:44.760]   "For my enemies are in hot pursuit.
[00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:46.920]   "All day long, they press their attack.
[00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:50.320]   "My adversaries pursue me all day long.
[00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:53.400]   "In their pride, many are attacking me."
[00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:54.600]   And so he started off just going,
[00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:55.880]   listen, God, they're coming after me.
[00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:58.840]   You know it, but I'm just confessing what reality is.
[00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:01.840]   My enemies are pressing in on me right now.
[00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:03.760]   And then skip on down to verse five.
[00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:04.600]   Look at what he does now.
[00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:07.200]   Now he just admits the way he feels about that.
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:08.840]   He doesn't hide it, he doesn't suppress it.
[00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:10.480]   He just says, "Hey, here's the reality, God.
[00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:12.960]   "I'm kind of afraid of this.
[00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:16.800]   "I'm not happy about the situation that I'm in right now."
[00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:17.640]   And so here's verse five.
[00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:19.600]   "All day long, they twist my words.
[00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:21.920]   "All their schemes are for my ruin.
[00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:24.200]   "They conspire, they lurk, they watch my steps,
[00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:25.840]   "hoping to take my life.
[00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:28.000]   "Because of their wickedness, do not let them escape.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.360]   "In your anger, God, bring the nations down."
[00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:33.560]   Look at this in verse eight.
[00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:35.120]   "Record my misery."
[00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:37.560]   He's just pleading with God.
[00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:40.440]   God, you know I'm miserable over this, record it.
[00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:41.800]   Do you see what's going on?
[00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:43.840]   Record my misery.
[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:47.040]   List my tears, Lord, on your scroll.
[00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:49.440]   Are they not in your record?
[00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:52.000]   So he confesses reality.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.640]   He just admits what he's feeling with all this,
[00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:54.680]   but then look at what he does here.
[00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:59.080]   Now he starts to remind himself of the truth.
[00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:00.360]   He starts to speak the truth.
[00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:01.680]   Look at here in verse nine.
[00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:06.720]   "Then my enemies will turn back when I call for help.
[00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:10.920]   "By this, I will know that God is for me.
[00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:13.680]   "By this, I will know that God is for me.
[00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:15.600]   "In God, whose word I praise.
[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:18.080]   "In the Lord, whose word I praise.
[00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:20.800]   "In God, I trust.
[00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:24.160]   "And am not afraid."
[00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:25.240]   And then look at this question.
[00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:27.400]   Look at how honest, like here's truth.
[00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:30.160]   What can man do to me?
[00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:34.680]   He's, God, I'm confessing the situation is not what I like.
[00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:36.840]   And God, I'm not feeling great about this,
[00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:39.480]   but God, I trust you.
[00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:41.680]   What can these guys, what can they do to me?
[00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:43.880]   And then look at how he wraps this off.
[00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:45.520]   He doesn't stop there, which is speaking the truth.
[00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:47.360]   And then he just reminds himself and he's grateful.
[00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:48.640]   He's thankful.
[00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:49.480]   Verse 12.
[00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:52.000]   "And I am under vows to you, my God,
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.680]   "and I will present my thank offerings to you,
[00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:57.080]   "for you've delivered me from death
[00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:59.320]   "and my feet from stumbling,
[00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:03.560]   "that I may walk before God in the light of life."
[00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:06.640]   And so here's what David has reminded us of,
[00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:08.200]   is that in those situations,
[00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:12.400]   in those situations when we are tempted to compare,
[00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:15.320]   what we need to be able to do is we need to be sure
[00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:17.560]   that we are casting our eyes on God.
[00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:22.320]   Casting our eyes on God and confessing the reality
[00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:23.420]   of what we're feeling,
[00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:26.720]   admitting what's going on, that we're not okay with it.
[00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:29.360]   Like emotionally, we're afraid or we're scared
[00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:30.760]   or we're frustrated by that.
[00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:32.960]   But then we speak the truth and remind ourself
[00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:34.720]   of who God is.
[00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:37.080]   And we're grateful, we're thankful.
[00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:39.280]   So it's God, hey, God, I did not get that promotion.
[00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:40.500]   They chose somebody else.
[00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:43.040]   God, my roommate from college is now having
[00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:45.120]   their second child and I am still single.
[00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:45.960]   I'm not okay with that.
[00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:49.160]   God, it seems like they're the ones always having fun.
[00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:51.120]   It seems like things are just going better
[00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:52.080]   for them right now.
[00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:56.080]   And I just wanna confess this reality to you.
[00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:57.420]   And I just wanna admit,
[00:33:57.420 --> 00:33:59.920]   I just wanna admit I'm not okay with it.
[00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:03.240]   Like this hurts, this stings, this is frustrating.
[00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:04.480]   I'm afraid.
[00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:07.400]   I'm afraid I'm never gonna get that promotion.
[00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:09.000]   I'm afraid that I'm always gonna be
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:10.280]   in this relational situation.
[00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:13.160]   I'm afraid that there's something wrong with me.
[00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:14.900]   And that's why other people are always being asked
[00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:15.920]   to go places and I'm not.
[00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:17.660]   I'm afraid of all of this.
[00:34:18.660 --> 00:34:21.300]   But God, I'm gonna remind myself of truth right now.
[00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:25.700]   I'm gonna remind myself, God, that you're good.
[00:34:25.700 --> 00:34:29.860]   That when I ask for bread, you don't give a stone.
[00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:31.860]   That you are a good father and you only know
[00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:32.820]   how to give good gifts.
[00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:34.420]   That you are in heaven and I am not.
[00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:36.740]   And you are in heaven and you are the one
[00:34:36.740 --> 00:34:38.420]   who does whatever you please.
[00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:40.940]   And I've got plans in my heart right now,
[00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:44.620]   but I want you to be the one to direct my steps.
[00:34:44.620 --> 00:34:46.380]   I wanna be reminded of your truth, Lord.
[00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:47.740]   And I wanna be thankful.
[00:34:47.740 --> 00:34:51.140]   Thankful that you hear me.
[00:34:51.140 --> 00:34:53.740]   Thankful that I'm not alone right now.
[00:34:53.740 --> 00:34:55.580]   And thankful that I can come to you.
[00:34:55.580 --> 00:34:57.660]   And thankful that I don't have to play that game
[00:34:57.660 --> 00:34:59.180]   that I'm so tempted to play right now.
[00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:02.820]   And I know, 'cause I know that's gonna make me miserable.
[00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:08.140]   And so Saul, he stood as this reminder
[00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:10.020]   of what happens if we play the comparison game.
[00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:12.220]   And he stood as this reminder to us
[00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:13.980]   as to why we play that game.
[00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:17.180]   And David is this reminder to us of how we can avoid it.
[00:35:17.180 --> 00:35:19.100]   And here's the deal, guys.
[00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:21.700]   When we are tempted to compare,
[00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:23.780]   then what we need to do is we need to be very careful
[00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:24.980]   where we start to stare.
[00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:29.500]   We need to do whatever we can to cast our eyes on God,
[00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:31.260]   to stay focused on Him.
[00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:33.420]   Because if we play that game,
[00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:35.540]   if our eyes start going down and start focusing
[00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:36.900]   on all the things that we don't have,
[00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:41.580]   if we do that, if we play that game, we will not win.
[00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:43.260]   Nobody ever wins that game.
[00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:45.860]   And so I'll close with this tonight
[00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:47.740]   and just talk a little bit about
[00:35:47.740 --> 00:35:51.620]   how this kind of invades some of my life right now,
[00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:53.420]   how I can be tempted to compare.
[00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:56.700]   And I'll talk about a coworker of mine.
[00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:59.020]   So it's a coworker of mine that I have here at Watermark
[00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:02.780]   and that you guys all know, and this coworker is JP.
[00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:07.020]   And so if I compare my life to JP,
[00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:09.500]   there's a lot on the surface that would look like
[00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:12.220]   things are different between he and I.
[00:36:12.220 --> 00:36:14.900]   Just kind of personally, between me and JP,
[00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:18.020]   he's a lot taller, a little better looking,
[00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:24.180]   dresses a little different, better hair product, right?
[00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:27.220]   Drives a cooler truck, I don't even have a truck, right?
[00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:30.620]   So there's some personal things there
[00:36:30.620 --> 00:36:32.180]   that on the surface would look like,
[00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:34.380]   hey, things are a little bit different.
[00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:37.540]   They're professionally, professionally in our world,
[00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:41.180]   you know, as pastors, you kind of sometimes
[00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:44.620]   will judge success by stages that you can stand on
[00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:46.500]   and how often you get to put on a microphone
[00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:49.820]   and the size of the crowd that you get to speak to
[00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:51.900]   or the size of the ministry that you get to lead.
[00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:55.180]   And JP leads one of the largest ministries
[00:36:55.180 --> 00:36:56.860]   here at Watermark on a weekly basis.
[00:36:56.860 --> 00:36:58.660]   He gets to stand in front of thousands
[00:36:58.660 --> 00:36:59.900]   and thousands of people.
[00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:05.500]   His inbox is full of people who want his time,
[00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:07.500]   want his thoughts, want his counsel.
[00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:10.180]   There's often requests coming in,
[00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:12.340]   because people wanna hear JP teach the Bible.
[00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:14.580]   They wanna be inspired by him as he stewards
[00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:16.460]   and uses his gifts that God has given him
[00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:18.420]   to stand on platforms with microphones
[00:37:18.420 --> 00:37:21.420]   and to encourage and challenge and equip the church.
[00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:24.420]   And his inbox gets a lot more of those requests
[00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:27.060]   than I tend to get.
[00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:28.780]   I lead the college ministry here at Watermark
[00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:31.220]   and sometimes I get to stand on stage with a microphone,
[00:37:31.220 --> 00:37:34.180]   but numbers wise, he stands in front of 3,500.
[00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:37.940]   I stand in front of 70 on a regular basis.
[00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:41.300]   (congregation laughing)
[00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:43.140]   And so you would look at all of that
[00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:44.380]   and you would say, "Hey, you know,
[00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:47.340]   "it doesn't really seem like it compares."
[00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:49.100]   And then on top of all of that,
[00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:53.500]   JP isn't just my coworker, he's actually my boss.
[00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:57.820]   And then on top of all of that,
[00:37:57.820 --> 00:37:59.980]   he's five and a half years younger than me.
[00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:04.340]   When I was a freshman in college, he was in eighth grade.
[00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:09.420]   And people would maybe look at that
[00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:10.820]   or there would be this temptation
[00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:13.900]   or the world would just go, "Hey, on the surface, Adam,
[00:38:13.900 --> 00:38:16.420]   "it looks like he's winning and you're not."
[00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:20.740]   And there would be this temptation to try to, you know,
[00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:23.540]   look at his life and compare myself to his life,
[00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:26.820]   but I don't compare my life to his life.
[00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:30.260]   And the number one reason I don't compare my life
[00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:32.220]   to his life is because I love that guy.
[00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:36.540]   He's been one of the greatest friends that I've had
[00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:38.140]   since I've been here on staff.
[00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:40.700]   He has been such a help to me and to my family.
[00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:42.980]   And he is one of the most amazing bosses
[00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:45.140]   that I probably will ever have.
[00:38:45.140 --> 00:38:46.340]   I know that guy loves me.
[00:38:46.340 --> 00:38:47.860]   I know that he is for me.
[00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:50.580]   And I just know the affections that he has for me
[00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:51.900]   and I love him.
[00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:55.540]   And so I do not want to compare my life to him.
[00:38:55.540 --> 00:38:58.780]   So that's one reason why I'm not gonna play that game
[00:38:58.780 --> 00:38:59.620]   when it comes to JP.
[00:38:59.620 --> 00:39:02.220]   But the other reason I'm not gonna play that game
[00:39:02.220 --> 00:39:04.580]   is because he's not winning and I'm not losing.
[00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:09.420]   Because you don't win and lose by stages that you stand on
[00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:11.860]   or people that are asking for your attention
[00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:14.540]   or crowds that you get to speak to.
[00:39:14.540 --> 00:39:15.820]   That's not winning or losing.
[00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:16.660]   You know what?
[00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:19.940]   He and I actually have the exact same job.
[00:39:19.940 --> 00:39:23.300]   Every morning he has the exact same job that I have.
[00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:25.620]   And the job that he has and the job that I have
[00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:27.820]   is the exact same job every single one of us
[00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:29.420]   has in this room.
[00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:33.140]   And that is to wake up every single morning
[00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:36.660]   and be faithful with whatever it is
[00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:38.300]   that God has put in front of you.
[00:39:38.300 --> 00:39:41.380]   If you wake up every morning and you're faithful
[00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:43.980]   with whatever circumstances that God who is in heaven
[00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:47.020]   doing what he pleases, whatever relational circumstances,
[00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:48.980]   whatever financial circumstances,
[00:39:48.980 --> 00:39:52.540]   whatever job circumstances, whatever your title is,
[00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:54.660]   if you wake up every single morning
[00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:56.740]   and you don't play the comparison game,
[00:39:56.740 --> 00:39:58.480]   you just go, Lord, you are in heaven.
[00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:00.100]   You do as you please and you are good.
[00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:01.340]   And I'm gonna be faithful
[00:40:01.340 --> 00:40:02.420]   with what's right here in front of me.
[00:40:02.420 --> 00:40:04.860]   You do that, I'm telling you guys, you don't lose.
[00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:08.540]   When JP wakes up every morning, he's gotta be faithful.
[00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:10.560]   And when I wake up every morning, I've gotta be faithful.
[00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:13.180]   We all have things that we need to steward
[00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:16.340]   and be faithful with every single day.
[00:40:16.340 --> 00:40:19.860]   And when you do that, you don't lose
[00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:21.380]   because you don't play the game
[00:40:21.380 --> 00:40:26.180]   'cause nobody ever, ever wins that game.
[00:40:26.180 --> 00:40:28.540]   And so we trust him.
[00:40:28.540 --> 00:40:32.020]   We keep our eyes on him.
[00:40:32.780 --> 00:40:37.380]   We pursue after him and we be faithful.
[00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:40.340]   That's how you avoid the game, amen?
[00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:42.260]   Amen, let me pray for us.
[00:40:42.260 --> 00:40:45.700]   God, thank you so much for just your word.
[00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:48.580]   Thank you for our friend JP, Lord,
[00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:51.220]   just what a blessing he is to all of us in this room.
[00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:54.300]   I know I'm not the only coworker on this staff
[00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:56.540]   that would just celebrate him and thank you for him
[00:40:56.540 --> 00:40:57.700]   and what he does in our life.
[00:40:57.700 --> 00:40:59.820]   And I'm just grateful for him, God.
[00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:06.540]   I'm grateful, Lord, that for David and his message to us,
[00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:09.180]   that we can confess reality,
[00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:12.300]   that we can be honest and truthful, Lord,
[00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:13.500]   with what we're feeling.
[00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:18.140]   But you've given us a lot of truth to speak to ourselves
[00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:19.100]   and to share with others.
[00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:21.340]   And God, we can be grateful.
[00:41:21.340 --> 00:41:25.580]   And so here's the deal, God, we don't wanna play the game.
[00:41:25.580 --> 00:41:26.740]   We don't wanna compare.
[00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:29.640]   We don't wanna be like Saul.
[00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:30.820]   We wanna be like David.
[00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:33.160]   And we can't do it on our own, Lord.
[00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:36.600]   We need you to help us to keep our eyes focused on you.
[00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:39.280]   We wanna be grateful for all the amazing things
[00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:40.840]   you as our father have given us.
[00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:42.960]   We don't wanna start looking around
[00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:44.160]   at what you haven't given us
[00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:46.600]   and start becoming discontent with that.
[00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:47.700]   And we need your help.
[00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:53.760]   And so God, will you help us to trust you,
[00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:56.620]   to keep our eyes on you and to be faithful?
[00:41:56.620 --> 00:42:00.480]   And that's what we pray in the name of Jesus, amen.
[00:42:01.460 --> 00:42:02.660]   - All of one more truth
[00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:05.300]   as we've been talking about this tonight, Ephesians 1.
[00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:06.700]   Let's look at what Paul says.
[00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:11.380]   He reminds us here, he says this, he says,
[00:42:11.380 --> 00:42:15.420]   "For he," talking about God, "chose us.
[00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:22.260]   "For God chose us in him before the creation of the world.
[00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:26.980]   "Before we were a thought in our parents' mind,
[00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:32.040]   "the sovereign God of the universe, he chose us.
[00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:36.660]   "He set his affections on us.
[00:42:36.660 --> 00:42:40.460]   "And he chose us to be holy and blameless in his sight.
[00:42:40.460 --> 00:42:43.080]   "And he did this, he did this in love.
[00:42:43.080 --> 00:42:45.800]   "In love, he predestined us for adoption of sonship
[00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:47.100]   "through Jesus Christ,
[00:42:47.100 --> 00:42:50.700]   "in accordance with the pleasure of his will."
[00:42:50.700 --> 00:42:54.840]   So maybe for some of us in here tonight,
[00:42:54.840 --> 00:42:57.180]   just what we need to be reminded of as we walk out of here
[00:42:57.180 --> 00:42:59.080]   is just remembering,
[00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:03.960]   just remembering that maybe in our past,
[00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:08.040]   we weren't chosen by the guy in high school.
[00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:12.500]   We weren't chosen by the girl in college.
[00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:16.840]   We weren't chosen by the employer.
[00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:19.040]   We still feel like we're not being chosen now.
[00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:22.440]   There's all these people that have not chosen us.
[00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:23.360]   And may we never forget
[00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:25.400]   that the sovereign God of the universe,
[00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:27.400]   the creator of all of it, he chose us.
[00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:29.820]   And he set his affections on us,
[00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:30.980]   and he showed us his love
[00:43:30.980 --> 00:43:33.780]   in sending Jesus to die on the cross for us.
[00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:37.580]   And if we know that, if you're in here and you know that,
[00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:41.180]   you've placed your faith in Jesus, you walk out of here,
[00:43:41.180 --> 00:43:44.300]   never, ever, ever happen to play the comparison game again,
[00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:47.660]   because the only one who matters, he chose you,
[00:43:47.660 --> 00:43:49.460]   and he loves you.
[00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:51.560]   And there's some of you in a room,
[00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:52.780]   I'm sure with this many people in the room,
[00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:54.660]   that don't know who this Jesus is.
[00:43:54.660 --> 00:43:56.920]   You don't know who God is.
[00:43:56.920 --> 00:44:00.360]   And if that's you, if you would like to hear more
[00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:02.440]   about this God of the universe who chooses people,
[00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:06.040]   this God of the universe that sets his affections on people,
[00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:08.940]   this God of the universe that sent his son to die
[00:44:08.940 --> 00:44:12.140]   so that he could be in a relationship with you,
[00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:13.820]   we would love to tell you more about that.
[00:44:13.820 --> 00:44:14.780]   There'll be some people up here.
[00:44:14.780 --> 00:44:15.620]   I'll be up here.
[00:44:15.620 --> 00:44:16.500]   David will be up here afterwards.
[00:44:16.500 --> 00:44:18.680]   We'd love to talk to you and tell you more
[00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:22.140]   about this amazing God that we sing to and that we worship.
[00:44:22.140 --> 00:44:24.220]   If you're here and you're just trying to get connected
[00:44:24.220 --> 00:44:26.140]   and you want some opportunities maybe to meet
[00:44:26.140 --> 00:44:27.540]   some other guys or some other girls,
[00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:28.820]   guys, if you wanna meet some other guys,
[00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:31.420]   they'll be right out here in the South Community Room.
[00:44:31.420 --> 00:44:33.780]   You can meet some other guys and girls right out there
[00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:34.900]   in that North Community Room.
[00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:37.460]   You can go out there and meet some others.
[00:44:37.460 --> 00:44:39.940]   A bunch of people will be hanging out afterwards
[00:44:39.940 --> 00:44:40.860]   here tonight as well.
[00:44:40.860 --> 00:44:42.560]   We thank you guys for coming and trusting us
[00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:44.060]   with some of your time tonight,
[00:44:44.060 --> 00:44:45.340]   and we will be back next week.
[00:44:45.340 --> 00:44:46.820]   You guys have an awesome week.
[00:44:46.820 --> 00:44:47.660]   Take care.
