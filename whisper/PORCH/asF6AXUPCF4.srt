 [MUSIC]

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:35,240
 All right, Ports, how we doing?

4
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,080
 We doing okay tonight?

5
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,320
 Great to see you.

6
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:38,960
 Welcome back.

7
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,680
 So glad that you would make your time to be here with us this

8
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,440
 Tuesday and particularly in this series.

9
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,040
 I don't know what it is.

10
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:50,000
 I just have so much expectation for what God is going to do as

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,920
 we read his word and we work our way through this series.

12
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,000
 And it's not just an expectation for what he's doing here in

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,800
 Dallas, Texas, though we love you and we think he's doing

14
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,000
 something tremendous here.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,160
 It's also an expectation for what he is doing all over the

16
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:02,560
 nation.

17
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,960
 So if you're tuning in with us right now, welcome.

18
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:09,080
 We love that you're a part of the porch wherever it is you

19
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:09,280
 are.

20
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,800
 We're firm believers that God can meet with any person at any

21
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,840
 place at any time, including you.

22
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,200
 Special shout out to Portslide, Springfield, Scottsdale, and

23
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,360
 Fresno.

24
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,760
 Hey, Fresno, give it up, you know.

25
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:26,680
 Hey, I want to dive into this, but I want to make sure that we

26
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,360
 take a moment and we pray.

27
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:31,080
 Again, I'm a firm believer in this space, if you're not

28
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,040
 familiar, that my goal is not to be the weekly entertainment.

29
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,720
 I do not want to stand up here and just be the man in the

30
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,240
 arena and preach to a large room.

31
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,960
 I really want you to meet with God himself because I'm a firm

32
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:43,280
 believer.

33
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,280
 He wants to meet with you.

34
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,600
 So can we just pray for a moment?

35
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,240
 Would you be willing to do that?

36
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:52,120
 God, we're so grateful that we have a moment here with you.

37
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,080
 It's good to be near you.

38
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:59,200
 God, we know that we're always near to you, God, that for those

39
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,040
 that have placed their faith in your son for the forgiveness of

40
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,840
 their sins, nothing can separate us from your love.

41
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:11,240
 And yet, God, oftentimes we grow desensitized to the fact that

42
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,720
 you're close.

43
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,720
 More, God, than even that.

44
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:21,920
 We grow discouraged to the fact that it is in your heart to be

45
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,120
 close.

46
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:29,640
 And so, God, right now we just want to quiet ourselves, still

47
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:33,440
 ourselves in your presence and be reminded you're here.

48
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,440
 Take a moment, if you would, and pray for yourself.

49
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,720
 Just ask, "God, would you speak to me?"

50
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:44,240
 As you talk to him, know that you don't speak to an empty and

51
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,320
 vaulted ceiling.

52
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,960
 You speak to a living and true God.

53
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:58,960
 And then if you would, would you pray for me?

54
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,440
 I need the Lord.

55
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,400
 I'm asking that his spirit would help me here.

56
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,920
 I have nothing good to give you.

57
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,160
 Only he has good to give.

58
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,760
 So would you pray for me and ask that he would speak through me

59
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,760
 to be helpful to you?

60
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:23,040
 Well, Father, we come with a really humble expectation

61
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,400
 tonight, knowing, God, that there's nothing within us that

62
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,680
 deserves anything from you, but believing, God, that it's in

63
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,960
 your heart to give to us because you love us and you gladly

64
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,960
 lavish, God, your favor upon those who seek you.

65
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,840
 We seek you tonight, and it is in your name we pray.

66
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,240
 Amen.

67
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:45,160
 Well, I'm not exactly the type to relive my football glory days

68
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,240
 from high school, but there is one moment that I think would

69
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,840
 make Hollywood very proud.

70
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,400
 Now, this moment is not the moment that you would likely

71
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,000
 expect.

72
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,920
 It wasn't in the pouring rain beneath Friday night lights

73
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,000
 against our crosstown rival en route to the state

74
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,680
 championship.

75
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,360
 It wasn't that kind of moment.

76
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,640
 It was actually in the moment that you would not expect.

77
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:07,320
 It was in the middle of offseason during conditioning.

78
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:11,640
 I do not remember why, but for whatever reason, on this day,

79
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:16,040
 our coaches collectively decided that we had not worked hard

80
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,760
 enough and we clearly needed to do a lot of conditioning.

81
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,280
 Now, the choice in conditioning for my coaches

82
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,560
 was always in a tune of up-downs.

83
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,440
 I don't know if you know what up-downs are.

84
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,920
 If you don't, consider yourself blessed.

85
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,320
 Up-downs are exactly as the name implies.

86
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,640
 You're up, and then you're down.

87
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,360
 And then you're up, and then you're down.

88
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,000
 You throw yourself to the ground,

89
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,960
 and then you pick yourself up back up off the ground.

90
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,520
 I'm convinced that if ever I get into a fist fight,

91
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,720
 all I need to do is throw that person to the earth

92
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,640
 and have them get up, and then throw them to the earth

93
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,720
 and have them get back up.

94
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,920
 Because it is exhausting.

95
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:52,440
 There's nothing quite like this form of conditioning.

96
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:55,320
 And the thing is, you do them until either your coach

97
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,920
 tells you to stop or you die.

98
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,320
 It's kind of the way that this sort of conditioning works.

99
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,760
 And for whatever reason, my coach was nowhere close

100
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,400
 to blowing the whistle in this moment.

101
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,600
 He just continued to whistle over and over and over

102
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,440
 and over and over again, calling us to continue

103
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,540
 in this form of conditioning until the sun had gone down,

104
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:16,080
 guys had lost their lunch, and I was convinced

105
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,240
 this is the place that the Lord was gonna call me home.

106
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,540
 All hope seemed lost.

107
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:23,080
 That is, until a guy standing one row in front of me,

108
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,320
 where the captain's always stood, decided to yell out,

109
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,720
 "We want more, coach!"

110
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:35,140
 I know you're captain, but that's not in fact true

111
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,960
 for the rest of us.

112
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,000
 "We're hungry, coach!"

113
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,640
 It is past dinner time, but I don't think

114
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,220
 that's what you mean.

115
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,440
 "We ain't tired!"

116
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,720
 If you're not looking around you,

117
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,180
 perhaps you've missed the fact that we are exhausted.

118
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:52,600
 That guy hasn't been up for the last 15 minutes.

119
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,280
 He's laid out flat.

120
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,640
 "We want more!"

121
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,640
 Dude, I think you think this looks cooler

122
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,800
 than it actually is, but it is not cool at all.

123
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,840
 At least that's what I thought, until the guys around me

124
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,440
 started agreeing with him, joining him,

125
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,920
 chanting alongside him, "More, more, more, more,"

126
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,080
 and I felt like a man on an island all by himself.

127
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,720
 Because I did not want more, but what I noticed

128
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,080
 in this moment, as we all collectively unified

129
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,000
 around this common cry for more, stirred about

130
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,280
 by a great movement within our heart,

131
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,000
 something moved within my coach's heart.

132
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,600
 I could see it in his face.

133
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,400
 I looked at him very specifically,

134
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,760
 and what I saw was a look of pride cast across his gaze,

135
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,520
 as we gave him exactly what he wanted.

136
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,440
 We played right into his hand.

137
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,240
 He was looking for his team to become united

138
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:47,380
 under the common bond of a unifying desire.

139
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:50,880
 Now, why do I tell you all of that?

140
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,560
 Because when it comes to revival,

141
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,160
 God often works through a people

142
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,800
 found not in the expected places,

143
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,820
 not in massive stadiums with packed out crowds

144
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:05,760
 and star-studded lineups and all the high drama

145
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,920
 of an amazing event.

146
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,960
 He can work in that space, yes,

147
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,360
 but where he most often works

148
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,120
 is he works in the unexpected places,

149
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,600
 the proverbial equivalent of off-season.

150
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,020
 He works in the ordinarity, the simplicity,

151
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:22,440
 the mediocrity of life, and it's in those places

152
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,440
 that he is looking for a very specific group of people.

153
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,920
 He's looking for a group of people

154
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,480
 that, like my teammates and I,

155
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:33,480
 were united by a common bond and cry for something more,

156
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,280
 which begs the question,

157
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,360
 "What more, Kylan, should I want for?"

158
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:42,640
 You should want for more of him.

159
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,300
 You see, God is looking for a people

160
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,100
 that are looking for him,

161
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,480
 that are hungry for his presence,

162
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,360
 that are longing for his power,

163
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,260
 that are seeking after his person.

164
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:59,500
 You see, the degree of our desire for God,

165
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:04,500
 not always, but often, determines his response to us.

166
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:10,480
 So how do we deepen our desire, our longing?

167
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:15,240
 How do we stir up our yearning for more of God?

168
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,480
 How do you cultivate hunger?

169
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,840
 That's what I wanna talk to you about tonight.

170
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,760
 And the way that we're gonna do it

171
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,800
 is we're gonna work through a few verses

172
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,160
 in Isaiah chapter 55.

173
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,480
 So if you have a Bible, you can grab it,

174
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,480
 you can turn with me to Isaiah 55.

175
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,720
 If you don't have a copy of the scripture, don't worry.

176
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:33,040
 It's all gonna be on the screens behind me.

177
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,220
 We're in the middle of a new series called Revive,

178
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:37,640
 where we're exploring all of the concepts

179
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,660
 that surround this idea of revival.

180
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:41,640
 I don't know if you're aware,

181
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,500
 we unpacked it a little bit last week,

182
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,280
 but we're standing in the middle

183
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:48,720
 of a really interesting and unique moment of history

184
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,680
 where there's a surge of spirituality

185
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,120
 that is spreading across not just our country,

186
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,720
 but really the globe.

187
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,980
 I won't unpack all of the data for you again,

188
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,160
 but what's being called the quiet revival

189
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,600
 has been distinguished by a particular rise

190
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,740
 in commitments to Christ, church attendance abroad,

191
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:09,520
 higher levels of satisfaction within those

192
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,240
 that claim Christ as opposed to those

193
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,880
 that do not claim Christ,

194
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,360
 lower levels of anxiety and depression,

195
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,480
 and young men outpacing women in their return to the faith,

196
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,840
 which is just wild.

197
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,320
 Ladies, take this as an encouragement.

198
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,720
 If you haven't met him yet, he might in fact be on his way.

199
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,880
 Gentlemen, take this as a word of warning.

200
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,680
 The competition's about to get stiff.

201
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,920
 So if you haven't made your move, they're coming.

202
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,260
 I don't know if you've seen, but the tide has turned

203
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:36,600
 and the men are on the return.

204
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,600
 You need to make your move, take your shot

205
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,260
 as soon as I speak.

206
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:44,340
 We are in the early phases of a new move of God.

207
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,460
 And here's the thing.

208
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:51,100
 I desperately do not want us to miss it.

209
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:55,340
 Now let me be very, very clear,

210
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:57,200
 because this was a great concern of mine

211
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,200
 as I knew we were going to kind of engage this topic.

212
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:06,540
 I am not angling for us to be the apex moment

213
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,380
 in awakening history,

214
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:14,780
 but I am aiming for us to be a part of awakening history.

215
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:20,500
 Like, I want God to do in here what he's doing out there.

216
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:26,100
 I'm asking the Lord, begging him still to actually move,

217
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:30,060
 not just in our day, but in this room and in your lives.

218
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:33,100
 I'm praying that God would give us greater intimacy

219
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,300
 with Jesus, that we would see conversions

220
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,740
 of the least likely, that he would release you

221
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:40,780
 into your destinies, that we would see generational sin

222
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:44,220
 broken on the anvil of what Christ has come to accomplish,

223
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,420
 that we would see his kingdom come here to Dallas

224
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:50,660
 and wherever it is you're tuning in, as it is in heaven.

225
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,720
 That's what I'm praying he would do.

226
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,540
 But here's the thing that we have to know.

227
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,660
 Though we would unapologetically want

228
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:59,900
 to see more of God move,

229
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:03,260
 the way he moves in meaningful change

230
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:07,700
 at a broader level comes through meaningful change

231
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,780
 at an inner level.

232
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:13,600
 You do not find revival by seeking revival.

233
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,460
 You find revival by seeking renewal.

234
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,540
 At least that's the way that Mark Sayers,

235
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:23,180
 who's been a great influence to me on this topic

236
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,580
 as I've been studying, puts it.

237
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:27,020
 I like the way that he actually writes this

238
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,540
 in his book, "Reappearing Church."

239
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:33,540
 He says, "Revival is when renewal occurs on a large scale,

240
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,920
 "bringing significant advancement, growth,

241
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,660
 "and kingdom fruit to a city, a people group,

242
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:41,780
 "a movement, region, or nations."

243
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:46,380
 He says, "Revival is renewal gone viral."

244
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:49,100
 If we want to see a widespread change,

245
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,940
 then there needs to be an individual change.

246
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:52,860
 Do you get that?

247
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,980
 And so what we're trying to walk through in this series

248
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,520
 is what do those steps look like?

249
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,900
 How do we produce personal renewal?

250
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,780
 How do we change what's happening in the inner man

251
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:04,140
 or inner woman so that way God might change

252
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,740
 what's happening in the outer world?

253
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:08,340
 We can't move his hand in terms of how it affects

254
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:13,340
 everyone here, but we can change what's happening in here.

255
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:16,140
 And the history books would agree with this philosophy.

256
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,540
 Like by and large, outpourings of the spirit

257
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:21,740
 or moments of awakening or revival or revolution

258
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,140
 or renewal, whatever you want to call it,

259
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,300
 whatever your preferred terminology is

260
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:28,100
 when it comes to this topic, all throughout history,

261
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,460
 they have been marked first and foremost,

262
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:34,080
 not by technique, not by charisma,

263
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:39,080
 they have been marked by two things, humility and hunger.

264
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,180
 Humility and hunger.

265
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:44,700
 In the Welsh Revival, which saw 90,000 people

266
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,980
 come to Christ in just one year,

267
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:51,260
 its origins can be traced back to a small prayer gathering

268
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:55,460
 of one coal mining preacher named Evan Roberts

269
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:59,340
 and 16 teenagers who wanted God.

270
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:01,820
 And the social impact was crazy.

271
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,240
 Like just to give you some perspective

272
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,940
 of what happened there in Wales,

273
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,580
 like crime rates plummeted to the point

274
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:09,100
 that there was no one for the magistrates to try.

275
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:12,180
 In court, police officers, they ran out of work to do,

276
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,300
 that they started creating singing quartets

277
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,100
 to perform in pubs.

278
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:19,460
 They found that alcohol sales dropped so dramatically

279
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:21,140
 as thousands gave up drinking.

280
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:23,260
 And in one instance, some of the coal miners

281
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:26,380
 who used pit ponies to resource their sort of materials

282
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:29,260
 in and out of the mines could not actually communicate

283
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:32,700
 with the horses because, well, the horses were so accustomed

284
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,640
 to really vile language.

285
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:39,520
 They were used to expletives and cursory language.

286
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,080
 And these coal miners had stopped speaking

287
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,280
 in such an inappropriate way

288
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,560
 that the animals couldn't even understand them.

289
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,880
 That's how massively God moved in the Welsh Revival.

290
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,680
 In the Ulster Revival, there were 100,000 people

291
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,200
 that came to faith.

292
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,080
 And guess where it originated?

293
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,780
 Within four Sunday school teachers

294
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,960
 that agreed to pray together in Ireland.

295
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:03,220
 It started in the humble place.

296
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:06,340
 The Hebrides Revival was an outpouring of the spirit

297
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:11,060
 that struck the Scottish Hebrides after two sisters,

298
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:13,020
 one 82-year-old named Peggy

299
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:16,580
 and one 84-year-old named Christine Smith

300
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,660
 started praying for God to move in their parish.

301
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:19,500
 They looked around their church

302
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,540
 and they saw no young people

303
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:22,980
 and they felt a deep need for God to move in

304
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:25,260
 and bring young people to their church.

305
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,560
 And what they found as they began to pray

306
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:30,680
 is that an awakening would come to the Hebrides,

307
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,620
 the likes of which people could not explain.

308
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,980
 There were spontaneous outpourings of the spirit

309
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:37,140
 where entire villages would awaken in the morning

310
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:40,300
 and men and women would be on their knees in repentance.

311
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,620
 You would drive down the road

312
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,380
 and the roadsides would be filled with people

313
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:46,660
 on their knees crying out to God in mercy.

314
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,740
 One famous story recalls a dance hall

315
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,880
 where a group of young adults like you and I

316
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,940
 were gathered together

317
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,740
 and yet they felt such conviction from the spirit

318
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,000
 that they all left the dance hall

319
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,740
 and they went to the church to pray instead.

320
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:01,180
 This was the Hebridean revival, the businessman's revival.

321
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,460
 10,000 to 30,000 people

322
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:05,100
 began attending regular prayer meetings in New York

323
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,420
 because one businessman organized

324
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:08,940
 weekly noontime prayer meetings

325
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:11,080
 for anyone that would want to attend.

326
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:15,880
 And this led to hundreds of thousands of converts

327
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:20,540
 in only one year's time as estimated by historians.

328
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:24,100
 The English revival was John Wesley famous, his companions.

329
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,460
 They prayed until the entire country

330
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,420
 was aroused by the gospel again.

331
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:29,880
 And the Moravian revival,

332
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:34,880
 which began as a 24/7 prayer movement by refugees,

333
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,700
 ultimately was moved so powerfully by the spirit of God

334
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,500
 that what was originally just a week long's worth of prayer,

335
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,580
 24/7 within a week's time,

336
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:47,380
 extended to 110 years nonstop 24/7.

337
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,560
 This is what God does

338
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,780
 when the humble and the hungry seek after him.

339
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:56,380
 Why would God use teenagers and old ladies

340
00:15:56,380 --> 00:16:00,020
 and refugees and coal miners and business people

341
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,340
 to produce revival?

342
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:03,060
 Why would he do this?

343
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:05,820
 Because they want for him.

344
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:09,380
 We should want for him too.

345
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:13,220
 What do you think God might do in your spheres of influence

346
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:17,300
 if you actually want for him in a very similar way?

347
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,700
 God cares about the level of your longing.

348
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,100
 And so for the rest of our time,

349
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,860
 I want to talk to you about how you deepen it.

350
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:27,100
 There are three things that you need to know specifically.

351
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:30,860
 The first of which is we are creatures of desire.

352
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:33,620
 We are creatures of desire.

353
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:36,140
 That's at least how Isaiah begins to unpack it

354
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:38,220
 when he gets into verse one.

355
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,940
 He says this, talking about creatures of desire,

356
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:44,940
 "Come, everyone who thirsts, come to the waters.

357
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:47,520
 "And he who has no money, come buy and eat.

358
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,540
 "Come buy wine and milk without money and without price."

359
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:51,980
 Don't you hear it in the text?

360
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:55,260
 God is speaking to a people who hunger and who thirst,

361
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,780
 which are representative of a people

362
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:59,740
 that long for something, that want for something,

363
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:03,220
 that yearn for something, that are seeking after something.

364
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:06,460
 And the reason for that is intrinsic within the heart

365
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:11,460
 of all people is that quality which bases its decisions

366
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:15,940
 on an internal desire.

367
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:18,140
 Like every decision you make in life

368
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:20,420
 is rooted in what you desire most,

369
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:22,700
 not in what you've disciplined yourself for

370
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,700
 or what you feel called to be dutiful in.

371
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,180
 You may hear that and think, "Kylin, no,

372
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:30,260
 "I make plenty of decisions where discipline and duty

373
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,780
 "are the primary motivating forces

374
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,060
 "behind why I do what I do.

375
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,900
 "I don't wanna pay my bills."

376
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,780
 You think I desire to do that?

377
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,700
 "I don't wanna get up and go to the gym."

378
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,300
 No way.

379
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,340
 Blind date?

380
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:44,180
 That's not exactly fun when a friend wants to set me up.

381
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,780
 You think I wanna mow my grass?

382
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,380
 There are plenty of areas of your life

383
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:51,100
 where you may look and think, "I don't desire that thing.

384
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:54,020
 "I am disciplined for it and I feel a duty to it."

385
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:57,180
 And yet, though you may not desire the object itself,

386
00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:00,500
 you desire what it produces.

387
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,820
 You may not wanna mow the grass,

388
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:06,300
 but you do want to avoid the watchful HOAI

389
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,620
 or that nosy neighbor living next door.

390
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,300
 You may not necessarily wanna go to the gym,

391
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:13,600
 but you really do desire the benefits that the gym produces,

392
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,760
 the kind of body that it actually creates.

393
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,140
 You may not wanna pay your bills,

394
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:20,200
 but you like the comfort that paying your bills produces.

395
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,520
 Blind dates are tough.

396
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,140
 You don't know who you're sitting across the table from,

397
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,940
 and yet we all wanna find love.

398
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:28,140
 You are driven by desire when you boil it down

399
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:31,980
 to its most essential place.

400
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,500
 You see, every decision we make,

401
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,980
 every action we take, every word we speak

402
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:39,940
 is all driven by your greatest desire in that moment.

403
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:41,580
 And it's the reason why.

404
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:42,680
 All throughout the Gospels,

405
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,620
 whenever Jesus engages with people,

406
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:48,340
 he does so on the basis of their desire.

407
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,740
 You ever notice this?

408
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:52,160
 It's fascinating, because when you study the Scripture,

409
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,980
 not every interaction,

410
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:58,300
 but any time someone approaches Jesus,

411
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:01,940
 most often he is engaging them

412
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:06,860
 with some sort of interaction that is testing their desire.

413
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,180
 If they come to him,

414
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,620
 he may confront them with a question about their desire,

415
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:13,860
 or he may commend them with some encouragement

416
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,860
 for their desire.

417
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:19,900
 In Mark 10, he talks to a guy named Blind Bartimaeus.

418
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:23,300
 Bartimaeus, being blind, wants what a blind man would want.

419
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,500
 Give me my sight, Jesus.

420
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,900
 And yet Jesus looks at Bartimaeus and says,

421
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,260
 "What do you want?"

422
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,780
 Jesus says, "Obvious."

423
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,620
 He wants to see.

424
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:37,020
 And yet Jesus wants to know what Bart desires.

425
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,940
 When Jesus encounters the first disciples

426
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:41,340
 in the first chapter of John,

427
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,460
 he looks at them and he asks them the question,

428
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:45,140
 "What are you seeking?"

429
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:45,980
 Do you hear it?

430
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:48,260
 That's a question testing desire.

431
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:51,060
 When James and John want to sit at the right hand of Jesus,

432
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:53,120
 he looks at them and he asks them,

433
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,240
 "What do you want me to do for you?"

434
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,640
 Another question of desire.

435
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,300
 When he finds Mary at the tomb following his resurrection,

436
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:03,220
 weeping, he comes to her and he asks, "Whom do you seek?"

437
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,460
 Well, it's obvious.

438
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:06,420
 She's at your tomb.

439
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:09,900
 He wants to know what it is she desires.

440
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,540
 Zacchaeus, that wee little man,

441
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:12,820
 he climbed up into a tree.

442
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:13,660
 Why?

443
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,940
 Because he sought to see him.

444
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:19,080
 He wanted to see Jesus, the Canaanite woman

445
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:23,180
 that wanted a few morsels of crumbs from Jesus's table.

446
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,580
 What did he do?

447
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:28,380
 He kind of dodged her for a minute until she pursued him.

448
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:31,460
 And then what he realized is her desire was so great

449
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:33,900
 that he had not seen a faith like hers.

450
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,900
 Whenever you get to the two men

451
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,780
 that were both blind seeking after Jesus,

452
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:41,240
 they cry out, "Son of David, have mercy."

453
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,500
 And yet Jesus, he dodges them as well

454
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,500
 because then they seek him more.

455
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,180
 And he realizes these men, they want,

456
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:53,360
 not just for the blessing, they want the blessed sir.

457
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,100
 The rich ruler, what did he do?

458
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,200
 He comes to Jesus and Jesus looks at him and says,

459
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,460
 "Hey, give everything away and follow me."

460
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,300
 Why?

461
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:06,820
 "I want to test the depth of your desire to be with me."

462
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,820
 Bleeding woman pushes through a crowd.

463
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,380
 Jesus could have moved on.

464
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,780
 He had given power plenty of times before.

465
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,720
 And yet in that moment, he engages with her.

466
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,560
 Why?

467
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,020
 To commend her faith.

468
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:19,800
 People that brought their paralytic friend to Jesus

469
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,800
 and they dug through the roof

470
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,460
 and they lowered him on a mat.

471
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:24,260
 Have you ever thought about that?

472
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:26,660
 Like Jesus, he says he saw their faith.

473
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,840
 What does that mean?

474
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,400
 They didn't show up with shovels

475
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,900
 and excavation tools at hand thinking,

476
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:31,740
 "You know what?

477
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,640
 We're gonna have to lower this guy through the roof."

478
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,480
 No, they showed up thinking,

479
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,460
 "We're gonna just bring him to Jesus."

480
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,460
 And yet they couldn't get to Jesus

481
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,860
 until they decided to hop up on the roof

482
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,900
 and start clawing their way through

483
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,460
 until they could get their friend down.

484
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:45,180
 They had a deep desire to get to Jesus.

485
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:48,420
 What is the point in all of those explanations?

486
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:51,780
 All of which are not actually cumulative.

487
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:55,660
 Jesus responds to the degree of our desire.

488
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:56,900
 And based on verse one,

489
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:01,260
 he gives us a really good reason to desire to be near to him.

490
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,980
 He gives you three incentives.

491
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:06,020
 As he unpacks it, he offers water, milk, and wine,

492
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,980
 which at first glance may not stand out.

493
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,740
 But those three things are very different

494
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:10,620
 from one another.

495
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:13,100
 And so too is that which they offer.

496
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,460
 If you think about it, water does what?

497
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:16,900
 Water provides refreshment.

498
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:22,120
 If you're thirsty, you don't want a tall glass of milk.

499
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:25,660
 Ron Bergen, he said so himself.

500
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:27,060
 Milk was a bad choice.

501
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:29,140
 You don't want milk, you want water.

502
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:29,960
 Why?

503
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:30,900
 Because it's refreshing.

504
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,300
 It's reviving.

505
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:35,260
 It's restoring to a person.

506
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,980
 Ever be outside on a really hot day,

507
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:40,020
 take a drink of cold water and feel it

508
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:43,380
 move from your mouth down your throat and into your stomach?

509
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:45,460
 It is the greatest feeling in the world.

510
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:46,540
 Try it sometime.

511
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:48,100
 But he doesn't just simply decry milk.

512
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,340
 He also says, no, milk serves a different purpose

513
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,500
 because where water serves for your refreshment,

514
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,620
 milk serves for your nourishment.

515
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:56,220
 Just last week, my wife and I,

516
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:59,380
 we took our newborn son, Cash, six months,

517
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,820
 and he had his six month checkup.

518
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:03,580
 What we found out from that meeting

519
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:06,720
 is that he's north of the 90th percentile

520
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,260
 in both weight and height,

521
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:12,420
 which just means he's a very big boy.

522
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:14,060
 Why is he so big?

523
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:17,340
 Because he's never missed a meal in his life.

524
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:22,700
 Some of you are not growing

525
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,820
 because you are spiritually malnourished.

526
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:29,740
 You are not feeding on that which will actually

527
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:32,260
 provide for your nourishment.

528
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:36,180
 Instead of taking in more of God's word,

529
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,840
 you're focused on taking in season three

530
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:41,280
 of the White Lotus.

531
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,960
 Not condemning your favorite show,

532
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,700
 but what I am saying is you are starving your spirituality

533
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:49,820
 when you mistake entertainment for nourishment.

534
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:53,840
 You have to take in the milk that he offers.

535
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,080
 And then the last one that he offers is wine.

536
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,680
 And he's certainly not talking about the cheap stuff

537
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,560
 that comes in a box.

538
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,960
 Water is for your refreshment.

539
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,920
 Milk is for your nourishment.

540
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,920
 Wine is for your enjoyment.

541
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,280
 Have you ever thought about this?

542
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:10,300
 Christianity is supposed to be fun.

543
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:13,760
 Like in the sense that it should free you

544
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:18,660
 from living a solitary life of pragmatism,

545
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:21,240
 stoicism, and chillness.

546
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,720
 Like you should actually feel a deep sense of delight

547
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,640
 in the world.

548
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,480
 Like it should free you to a childlike wonder

549
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,840
 where you adventure things the way that God intended

550
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,960
 for them to be experienced.

551
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:35,320
 Like it should catapult you to actually see in the world

552
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,320
 all the goodness that God has imbued

553
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:40,480
 within every single individual element.

554
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,440
 You're supposed to enjoy life

555
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,680
 in a godly way to be very clear.

556
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:50,240
 Friends, we are creatures of desire and Jesus knows it.

557
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,480
 And so he has given us every reason to desire him.

558
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,920
 As C.S. Lewis puts it,

559
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,560
 "If I find in myself a desire which no experience

560
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,960
 in the world can satisfy,

561
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,400
 the most probable explanation is that I was made

562
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,920
 for another world.

563
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,560
 If none of my earthly pleasures satisfy it,

564
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,400
 that does not prove that the universe is a fraud.

565
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,740
 Probably, earthly pleasures were never meant to satisfy it,

566
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:15,760
 but only to arouse it to suggest the real thing."

567
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:20,320
 You see, your desire points to a greater satisfier.

568
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,160
 And all of our satisfaction is found in Christ.

569
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,960
 If you want to cultivate your hunger for more of God,

570
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,440
 to see where it is,

571
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,160
 you have to see where it is you're wanting

572
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,160
 and realize he's the answer for it.

573
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,600
 So if you feel weary,

574
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,960
 like if you're looking into your life

575
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,360
 and you feel a deep sense of weariness

576
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,880
 over the fact that, man, you can't keep a job,

577
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,520
 or you're facing chronic illness,

578
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:43,320
 or you're stuck when everyone else seems to be racing ahead,

579
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,240
 you should know where you're weary.

580
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,800
 He has water.

581
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,720
 He can refresh you.

582
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:53,280
 Where you feel weak, tired of your singleness,

583
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,880
 wondering why God has left you

584
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,880
 in this specific relationship status

585
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,400
 when everyone else seems to be moving forward,

586
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,640
 overwhelmed by how behind you feel.

587
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:08,160
 If you feel weak, he has milk for you,

588
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,320
 that which will strengthen you.

589
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,800
 If you feel waned,

590
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:15,600
 just discouraged by where you're at in life,

591
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,360
 apathetic on your best day,

592
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:21,720
 coping nightly just to get through the week,

593
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,040
 he looks at you and he says, "Hey, I have wine for you.

594
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,440
 I have enjoyment for you.

595
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,240
 I can give you delight,

596
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,440
 the likes of which this world cannot provide you."

597
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:33,160
 This is the heart of Jesus towards you.

598
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,400
 He has everything you want and more.

599
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,840
 We're creatures of desire,

600
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:40,280
 and all of our desire should drive us deeper into God,

601
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:43,640
 and yet often, they do not drive us deeper into God,

602
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,960
 do they?

603
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,280
 Often, our desire leads us further from God

604
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:52,320
 rather than near to God.

605
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,640
 That's what Isaiah says.

606
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,120
 He moves into verse two, and he says,

607
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:59,200
 "Why do you spend your money for that which is not bread

608
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,120
 and your labor for that which does not satisfy?

609
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,920
 Listen diligently to me and eat what is good.

610
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,800
 Delight yourselves in rich food."

611
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:11,240
 I think this verse paints a really profound picture

612
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,560
 when you inspect it for what it's saying.

613
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,120
 Like what you see in this verse,

614
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,360
 it's not a picture of an angry judge banging a gavel

615
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,440
 and casting his verdict.

616
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:23,360
 You don't see someone that is muttering under his breath,

617
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,560
 disappointment, "Oh my gosh,

618
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,000
 when are they just gonna finally realize

619
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,920
 that I am the one that gives all satisfaction?"

620
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:31,160
 You don't see in this verse a picture of God

621
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,200
 clasping his hands and begging you to believe

622
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,280
 that he's the source of all your joy.

623
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,120
 That's not what you see.

624
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:40,960
 What you see is a picture of an inquirer.

625
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,980
 You see God ask a question.

626
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:45,440
 He just asks why.

627
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:50,380
 Like why is it that you spend your money

628
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:54,200
 on that which is not bread yet want to be filled?

629
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:57,280
 Why is it that you work, you labor

630
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:01,880
 in an area that does not produce your satisfaction?

631
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,600
 You see, he doesn't make an emotional appeal to you.

632
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,440
 He makes a logical appeal.

633
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,180
 He's looking at you and he's saying,

634
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:10,600
 "Hey, why are you doing that which is really unproductive?"

635
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,240
 Anybody in here hate getting to the end of your day

636
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,360
 and feeling like, "Man, this was just

637
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,680
 the most unproductive day."

638
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,760
 He's looking at you and he's saying,

639
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,400
 "Hey, come on in.

640
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,000
 Why don't you take a seat?

641
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,480
 Why don't we talk about what's been happening here?

642
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,560
 It seems like you're spinning your wheels

643
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,680
 and you're not making the kind of progress

644
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:31,780
 you want to be making when it comes to your satisfaction."

645
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:34,820
 I remember in my first job right out of college,

646
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:37,720
 there was a guy in the company,

647
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,040
 who he was a mid-level management.

648
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,480
 He'd been around for a really long time.

649
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,080
 He's kind of grandfathered in.

650
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,700
 That just sort of meandered around the office space

651
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,400
 every single day.

652
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,680
 Full of activity, but not a lot of productivity.

653
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:52,280
 Like to the point that everyone noticed

654
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:55,360
 and so we just started making wagers

655
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,240
 on what he was gonna do next.

656
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:02,240
 Like it sort of became this kind of spectator sport.

657
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,460
 So we'd look at him and we'd wonder.

658
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:07,640
 Maybe he's going to the kitchen

659
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,140
 to grab another cup of coffee.

660
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:11,420
 You know what, perhaps he's going by HR

661
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,380
 because he really likes the girl

662
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:14,360
 that works at the front desk.

663
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,560
 You know what, no, maybe he's gonna swing

664
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,400
 by product development because he just wants to test

665
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,760
 whatever the newest, latest, greatest thing is

666
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,880
 that they've been cooking up.

667
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,920
 We would always wager because this guy,

668
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,360
 he was really accustomed to being,

669
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,580
 he was full of movement,

670
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:28,200
 but he really wasn't going anywhere.

671
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,840
 He was full of activity, but not a lot of productivity.

672
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,240
 God is looking at you when it comes

673
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,680
 to your pursuit of desire and he's saying,

674
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:39,680
 hey, it looks like maybe you and he have something in common.

675
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:45,020
 There's a lot of busyness, but not a lot of traction.

676
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:48,400
 You seem like you're seeking satisfaction,

677
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,720
 but you're not really accomplishing it.

678
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,880
 You see, God is not making an emotional appeal

679
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,840
 in this moment because he doesn't need

680
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:55,680
 to make an emotional appeal.

681
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,240
 He's making a logical appeal.

682
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,920
 Why doesn't God need to make an emotional appeal?

683
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,760
 Because we don't need to be emotionally convinced

684
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,040
 that the things of this world will not satisfy

685
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,840
 because we feel that in our inner being.

686
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,120
 It doesn't matter if you believe in Jesus

687
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,920
 or you don't believe in Jesus.

688
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:15,680
 Go out with friends, black out drunk, you feel shame.

689
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:20,260
 You want to feel something nice,

690
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:22,840
 you look at porn, but it leaves you feeling empty.

691
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:25,560
 You want to find some success,

692
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,720
 measure up in the eyes of others,

693
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,280
 so you work really hard at the office

694
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:31,320
 and yet it leaves you feeling exhausted.

695
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:34,120
 You want desperately to be accepted by other people

696
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,600
 and so you'll go out and you'll do whatever it takes

697
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,520
 to be accepted by them,

698
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,400
 and yet it leaves you feeling compromised.

699
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,720
 You see what I'm saying here?

700
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:43,120
 Like we know that often when we try to seek satisfaction

701
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,180
 in the things of this world,

702
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:46,640
 it doesn't necessarily move us to a place

703
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,000
 where we feel great about it.

704
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,420
 But here's the thing, why then do we do it?

705
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:52,720
 Because although we don't feel great about it,

706
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,980
 we also don't feel bad enough about it.

707
00:30:55,980 --> 00:31:01,120
 You see, in fact, oftentimes when we do this,

708
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,760
 when we satisfy ourselves through sin,

709
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:07,300
 it still feels good.

710
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:09,100
 Like if you think about it,

711
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:14,100
 sin wouldn't really be that useful of an obstacle

712
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:18,860
 from the enemy if it didn't evoke some pleasure,

713
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:20,620
 garner some satisfaction,

714
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:22,700
 leave you feeling some kind of way.

715
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:25,220
 You would just look at it and be like, I'm good, thanks.

716
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:26,700
 Satan doesn't come up to Eve

717
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,100
 in the very beginning of the Bible

718
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,620
 with a smoking vial of poison.

719
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:30,740
 Mm, doesn't this look yummy?

720
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:31,900
 That's not what he does.

721
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,380
 He approaches her with what?

722
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:39,340
 Fruit from the tree that was quote, a delight to the eyes.

723
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:43,020
 That which looked desirable probably was even enjoyable

724
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:46,820
 and yet ultimately was wasteful.

725
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:49,020
 You see, if you wanna cultivate a hunger for God,

726
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:51,460
 then you need to know that pursuing the wrong desire

727
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:52,940
 is wasteful.

728
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:56,820
 Pursuing the wrong desire is wasteful.

729
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:59,220
 That's why God is appealing to our logic here.

730
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:01,500
 Like he wants us to reason to the reality

731
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,740
 that while the things we often seek our happiness

732
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:06,160
 and feel good, they're not good.

733
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,820
 Like only in him is there that which is good

734
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:10,740
 and rich to the soul.

735
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:12,660
 That's how James, Jesus' brother,

736
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:14,620
 recalls it in his first chapter.

737
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:17,740
 He says, "Every good and perfect gift is from above,

738
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:19,460
 "coming down from the Father of lights

739
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:22,880
 "with whom there's no variation or shadow due to change."

740
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,460
 Now you may hear that and think to yourself,

741
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:26,060
 Kylan, I get it, man.

742
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:30,620
 But listen, I'm not openly sinful.

743
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:32,740
 Like yeah, man, I struggle with pride

744
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:34,200
 and I want the acceptance of others,

745
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:38,100
 but I'm not just like egregiously addicted to something.

746
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:41,540
 Like it's not like I'm sexually deviant.

747
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:42,900
 I'm doing pretty good.

748
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,460
 Like I'm not bottling out,

749
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:47,100
 I'm not bottoming out at the bottom of a bottle

750
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,580
 every single weekend.

751
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:50,460
 That's not who I am.

752
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:51,700
 And yet here's what I would say,

753
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,500
 though you think you're in the clear,

754
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,320
 you would be mistaken.

755
00:32:55,320 --> 00:33:00,940
 Satan's greatest scheme isn't to get you

756
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:03,820
 focused on the worst thing.

757
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:07,140
 His greatest scheme is to get you

758
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:09,660
 focused off of the best thing.

759
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:12,700
 That's what he wants to do.

760
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,220
 He doesn't need you to

761
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:20,540
 get hooked on meth and sell kidneys on the black market.

762
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:23,700
 Like that's not his goal.

763
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:26,940
 His goal is to lead you to a place

764
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:29,820
 where you find more happiness in your job

765
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:31,560
 than you do in Jesus.

766
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,980
 Because then your focus will be more focused on your job

767
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:35,980
 and will be on Jesus.

768
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:38,660
 His goal is to get you to a place

769
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:42,620
 where you have deeper happiness in your relationship,

770
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:44,500
 that guy, that girl, than you do in Jesus.

771
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,100
 Because as you're more focused on them,

772
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:48,060
 you will be less focused on him.

773
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:51,520
 His goal is to get you so happy in your social status

774
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:54,040
 that your focus is fully set on your friends

775
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,380
 and your fans and your followers,

776
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:57,780
 more so than it is on Jesus.

777
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:02,300
 You see, this is the danger of Dallas, Texas.

778
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:08,300
 We are at risk of comfort, materialism, status,

779
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:15,460
 acceptance, approval.

780
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:20,960
 And it's not just in our city, it is for our generation.

781
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:27,300
 Satan would love to lull you to sleep

782
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:29,960
 with the meager pleasures of a nice life

783
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:32,980
 so that you never awake to the major pleasure

784
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:34,260
 of a godly life.

785
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:36,960
 He wants to keep you asleep.

786
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,240
 He doesn't need to drown you out.

787
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,980
 He just needs to quiet you down.

788
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:48,540
 John Piper said this in his book, "Hunger for God."

789
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:50,620
 "The greatest enemy of hunger for God

790
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:52,560
 "is not poison, but apple pie.

791
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,240
 "It is not the banquet of the wicked

792
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,620
 "that dulls our appetite for heaven,

793
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:59,120
 "but endless nibbling at the table of the world."

794
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:01,640
 That's not the X-rated video,

795
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:04,860
 but the prime time dribble of triviality

796
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:07,120
 that we drink in every night.

797
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,580
 The greatest adversary of love to God

798
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:12,580
 is not his enemies, but his gifts.

799
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:15,260
 And the most deadly appetites are not for the poison of evil

800
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:17,580
 but for the simple pleasures of earth.

801
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:19,960
 For when these replace an appetite for God himself,

802
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:24,840
 the idolatry is scarcely recognizable and almost incurable.

803
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:30,160
 That's why God is trying to reason with you here.

804
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,640
 He knows you're already well acquainted

805
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:36,560
 with the dissatisfaction this world actually has to offer.

806
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:40,740
 He just wants you to wake up to the realization

807
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:43,120
 that you deserve more than dissatisfaction,

808
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:46,300
 for he has come to give you more in Christ himself.

809
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:49,120
 That's why he continues as he moves into verse three.

810
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,960
 He says, "Incline your ear and come to me.

811
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,400
 "Hear that your soul may live,

812
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,560
 "and I will make with you an everlasting covenant,

813
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,380
 "my steadfast, sure love for David."

814
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:59,260
 Like notice throughout this passage

815
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:01,440
 that God doesn't dismiss our desire.

816
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,620
 He doesn't belittle the fact that we want for happiness,

817
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:05,620
 that we long for some kind of fulfillment,

818
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:07,140
 that we seek after satisfaction.

819
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:09,860
 He just tells us where those things are found.

820
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:13,140
 He says, "They're found in me,"

821
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:16,620
 which is why we have to cultivate a greater hunger for God

822
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:20,660
 because Jesus is the only one worthy of wanting.

823
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:22,900
 He's the only one worthy of wanting.

824
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,140
 Like it's interesting.

825
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,420
 After bringing us to a place where we've already answered

826
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:29,260
 why we seek after that which will not satisfy,

827
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:31,880
 he moves us to a place where he answers why

828
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,880
 or where we can seek that which will satisfy,

829
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,500
 which is in him.

830
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:40,180
 He says, "Seek me that your soul may live."

831
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:41,580
 Now to be abundantly clear,

832
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:44,100
 that's certainly talking about salvation,

833
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:46,220
 but it's also talking about so much more.

834
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:48,780
 Like the promise that your soul may live

835
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:51,660
 is not just so you can get eternal life one day,

836
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:53,980
 but so that you can have fullness of life right now.

837
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:56,700
 Like that's what he's trying to pull you into.

838
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,780
 And yet as I was thinking through that,

839
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:02,380
 I cannot help but wonder in a room this size,

840
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:05,220
 how many of us actually think we're already living?

841
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:09,460
 Like you got the great job,

842
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:11,940
 the fancy position.

843
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:14,700
 You've got someone that loves you.

844
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:17,660
 You've got a million followers that want to be like you.

845
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:19,980
 You're the object of all of your friends' envy.

846
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:22,260
 You've got time every single weekend to get out there

847
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:23,380
 and play golf with the boys.

848
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:25,940
 And you've really dialed in your swing.

849
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:27,540
 You've found the perfect place to live

850
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:29,240
 and the perfect people to live with.

851
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,820
 Like life according to you

852
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:32,620
 is everything that it should look like.

853
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:33,980
 You have actually found that,

854
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:35,700
 which will bring your soul to life.

855
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:38,020
 But if you actually drill down

856
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:39,980
 and you look deep within yourself

857
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:43,580
 into the inner recesses of who you are at a soul level,

858
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:47,180
 I would reckon, nay, I would actually wager

859
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:49,660
 that many of us are sitting here thinking to myself,

860
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:52,300
 is this all there is?

861
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,420
 Is this it?

862
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:58,820
 No, there's more.

863
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:02,500
 There is more on the table for you.

864
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:06,940
 Like the beauty of revival is this idea

865
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:09,660
 that Jesus has actually come to set you free

866
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:14,300
 to a life that is so much bigger than we often settle for.

867
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:18,300
 He's just trying to wake us up so we actually realize it.

868
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:20,540
 He wants to bring you to a place

869
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:23,380
 where you know there is one worthy of wanting

870
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:26,660
 that surpasses everything else I've ever wanted.

871
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:28,860
 Psalm 63, three says,

872
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:32,940
 "Because your steadfast love is better than life,

873
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:34,500
 "my lips will praise you."

874
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:38,520
 You see, there's one that you can have

875
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,620
 which will not cost you,

876
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:41,500
 one you can have which will never fail you,

877
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:44,020
 one you can have that will satisfy you forever.

878
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:45,820
 He has come that your soul can live.

879
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:47,940
 The question is, will you come to him

880
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:51,020
 so your soul might?

881
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:57,460
 Just a couple of weeks ago, not even two full weeks,

882
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:01,940
 2.1 million people gathered on Copacabana Beach

883
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:06,060
 in Rio de Janeiro for a Free Lady Gaga concert.

884
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:07,740
 Y'all heard about this?

885
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:11,300
 The pictures are insane to look at

886
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:13,700
 because it is a crowd the likes of which

887
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:16,020
 I could never imagine myself being numbered,

888
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,780
 not because I don't like her music,

889
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:19,940
 but because it is insanely crowded.

890
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,540
 Like, can you think about what it took

891
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:24,220
 to be a part of these photos?

892
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:28,380
 Massive inconvenience,

893
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:32,740
 people waking up at the crack of dawn to get a good seat,

894
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:34,100
 though the concert would not begin

895
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:37,500
 until 10 p.m. later that night.

896
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:41,640
 2.1 million people, twice the size of Dallas, Texas,

897
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,240
 showed up for this thing.

898
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:46,900
 One spectator recalling the event,

899
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:49,300
 remembered it as religious.

900
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,900
 What would compel people to do this,

901
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:54,620
 to suffer the inconvenience, to fight the massive crowd,

902
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:56,340
 to endure all the problems

903
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:58,300
 you know this had to have produced?

904
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:04,540
 They saw one worthy of wanting.

905
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:07,700
 As I was reading the article,

906
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:10,900
 trying to understand what could compel people to this place,

907
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:15,900
 what was remembered about this crowd

908
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:21,900
 is they cried together.

909
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:26,220
 She came, she came, she came,

910
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:27,740
 talking about Lady Gaga.

911
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:33,180
 You see, they came because she came.

912
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:38,140
 Friends, how convicting is it for us

913
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:40,420
 that we have one so much worthy of wanting

914
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:41,900
 that has in fact come,

915
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:45,140
 yet we will not come to him?

916
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:51,140
 Jesus is so worthy, so deserving of our desire.

917
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:55,820
 And the beauty of him

918
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:59,020
 is that he has produced no cost to come near.

919
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:01,100
 Like in fact, he has removed the cost

920
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:02,780
 by bearing it in himself,

921
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:06,100
 by dying your death upon the cross.

922
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:07,340
 Like there's no waiting to be done.

923
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:09,100
 You don't have to wake up and stay late.

924
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:11,500
 No, you can have him right now in this room,

925
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,620
 in this moment, here today.

926
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:16,860
 And there's no inconvenience to be his.

927
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:18,260
 That greatest inconvenience

928
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:20,500
 that stood in the way of you belonging to Jesus,

929
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:21,820
 he has removed.

930
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:23,340
 And to call it an inconvenience

931
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:25,820
 is to grossly underestimate what it was,

932
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:27,700
 because it was sin.

933
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:31,500
 It was a massive blasphemy against the God of the universe,

934
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:34,380
 a perfect, holy, and right God that said,

935
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:36,860
 "We don't want you, we want ourselves."

936
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:39,660
 And yet what he did is he removed that inconvenience

937
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:42,540
 from his presence by bearing the full weight of it

938
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:43,980
 in his own death,

939
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:45,900
 so that way you would never feel inconvenienced

940
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:46,820
 to be near to him.

941
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:49,620
 You can be near to him right now.

942
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:50,700
 Isn't that crazy?

943
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:54,020
 Golly, this is something that I just have been begging God.

944
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:57,460
 Like I want us to wake up to the reality

945
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:59,140
 that this is all real.

946
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:03,220
 Like that's why I yell at you every single Tuesday,

947
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:06,140
 because I just want you to get it.

948
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:16,300
 There is something realer than reality in this space,

949
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:19,780
 and it's God.

950
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:22,300
 He is not distant.

951
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:24,340
 He is not dormant.

952
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:25,500
 He is not dead.

953
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,500
 He is not a concept to study

954
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:30,820
 or something to intellectually fascinate about.

955
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:34,300
 He is not one to emotionally feel good over

956
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:35,820
 and solely feel good over.

957
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:38,180
 No, he is one to experience,

958
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:40,300
 to engage with, to encounter.

959
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:46,580
 And the way you find that is you hunger for more of him.

960
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:50,100
 You are a creature of desire.

961
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:52,540
 He is the fulfiller of your desire.

962
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:56,540
 We often desire that which is wasteful,

963
00:42:56,540 --> 00:43:00,220
 but he desires that which is worthwhile

964
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:03,900
 to be with you forever.

965
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:10,700
 And we, my dear friends, are so unworthy of wanting,

966
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:13,980
 but he, the only one worthy of wanting,

967
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:16,420
 he wants you.

968
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:19,020
 Do you want him?

969
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:24,020
 Cultivate your hunger and have him beginning tonight.

970
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:25,700
 Let me pray for us.

971
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:27,380
 Father, we love you.

972
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:29,380
 We wanna be with you.

973
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:32,180
 I just, God, in my sincerity,

974
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:36,940
 as I was sitting in service earlier tonight,

975
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:40,340
 I'm just looking for you.

976
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:42,580
 I'm just wanting for you.

977
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:45,380
 I'm trusting God, the plan we've created.

978
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:48,260
 I'm believing God and the program we've crafted,

979
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:50,620
 but Lord, this whole room,

980
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:53,060
 all these people in what we do,

981
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:55,660
 now it is yours.

982
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:58,140
 We follow you.

983
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:01,300
 That means, God, we sing all night.

984
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:02,140
 We'll sing all night.

985
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:05,020
 That means we pray until we lose our voices.

986
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:07,620
 We will pray until we lose our voices.

987
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:10,060
 That means, God, we must confess that final 1%,

988
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:12,780
 the very thing that we have held on for so very long, God,

989
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:13,740
 that we will do it.

990
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:16,460
 We want to go where it is you are

991
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:18,620
 because it is you, Jesus, that we want.

992
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:19,660
 We don't want from you.

993
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:21,300
 We want more of you.

994
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:22,940
 We want more of you.

995
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:24,860
 And so we wanna sing to you now

996
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:27,100
 in an honest declaration that that is true.

997
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:29,180
 Some of us, we need to sing until we believe,

998
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:31,460
 and we gotta sing until we start singing.

999
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:33,380
 Some of us, we need to pray until we start praying.

1000
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:35,820
 We've gotta get ourselves to a place where we believe,

1001
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:36,740
 and often we have to believe

1002
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:38,540
 until we start believing, God.

1003
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:40,300
 We must labor.

1004
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:42,060
 We must seek.

1005
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:43,500
 We must strive.

1006
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:46,780
 We must desire because you are worthy.

1007
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:48,780
 And it's to you we pray right now.

1008
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:49,780
 In Jesus' name, amen.
