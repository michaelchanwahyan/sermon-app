[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.980]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:27.160]   What's up, Forge?
[00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:27.720]   How we doing?
[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.920]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.880]   If we haven't met, my name is Jonathan Picluda.
[00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.400]   It is a privilege to be with you here tonight
[00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.200]   to teach from God's word.
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.720]   And man, yesterday I was online and was just kind of--
[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.200]   there was an article that caught my eye.
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.040]   It was this-- 15 things you're doing wrong.
[00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.280]   That's clickbait, right?
[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.800]   15 things you're doing wrong.
[00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.680]   That's like, hey, click on me and waste
[00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.360]   seven minutes of your life so that you can see what somebody--
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.000]   but you know, so what did I do?
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.200]   I clicked on it and wasted seven minutes of my life.
[00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.840]   And so it was these 15 things.
[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.400]   And it was actually pretty interesting and fairly
[00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.000]   compelling.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.960]   And so it just started out a little bit lame.
[00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.800]   It was talking about like pronunciation.
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:10.280]   OK?
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.960]   So these 15 things we're doing wrong, one was pronunciation.
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.960]   And so it gave some specific examples of words.
[00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.040]   This didn't surprise me.
[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.800]   I know there's words we pronounce wrong.
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.920]   But here was one of them, for example.
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:21.400]   OK?
[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.800]   So what word is that?
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:24.360]   OK.
[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.080]   Sure bet.
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.680]   Sure bet.
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.120]   There's no R here.
[00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.360]   OK?
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.520]   So the right way to say that word is sure bet,
[00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.880]   like your English.
[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.960]   Sure bet.
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.480]   And so yeah, it was interesting.
[00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:38.760]   I always say sherbert.
[00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.960]   You know, give me the rainbow sherbert.
[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.040]   But it's sure bet.
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.880]   So now you know.
[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.440]   Here was another word.
[00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.280]   What is this word?
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.880]   You all got that one wrong.
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.000]   OK?
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.480]   It's brew skedda.
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:53.320]   Brew skedda.
[00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.560]   OK, you got it right.
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.480]   Everyone else got it wrong.
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.560]   Brew skedda, not brew shedda, which I've always said.
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.880]   So you have been ordering your appetizers
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.560]   at Italian restaurants wrong all your life.
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:06.600]   And now you know.
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.200]   And so here was another one they said.
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.360]   What is this word?
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.640]   All right, let's solve this mystery right now.
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.080]   I don't want it to go any further.
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.800]   We're done with this right now.
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.480]   If you think it's gif, raise your hand.
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.920]   Gif.
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.240]   OK, some of you are just real sure.
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.760]   I hear you.
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:24.520]   You're angry.
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.440]   Stop it.
[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.920]   OK, if you think it's gif, raise your hand.
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:34.280]   OK, if you just kind of glized over it real fast
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.120]   because you don't know what it is, raise your hand.
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.680]   OK.
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.360]   It is.
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.960]   Are you ready?
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.880]   Drum roll, please.
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.760]   It's gif.
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.160]   Gif.
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.680]   Gif.
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.680]   Oh no, I see you saying I'm wrong.
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:49.600]   Shaking your head.
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:50.640]   You're wrong.
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.760]   OK, this was a question on Jeopardy.
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.520]   And they went back to the founder of the word.
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.880]   And he said it's gif.
[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.320]   So now we know everyone for the rest of your life
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.440]   can say that word correctly.
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.480]   All right, so this is just how the article starts.
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.040]   We're still on the first one.
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.400]   It was pronunciation.
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.920]   I'm not going to tell you, just go into detail
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:14.360]   on the other ones.
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.480]   But here's what they were.
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.280]   Ready?
[00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.520]   Breathing.
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.920]   I'm like, I'm breathing wrong.
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:19.640]   Are you serious?
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:25.880]   Showering, working out, going to the bathroom,
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:31.240]   washing hands, sleeping, eating, brushing your teeth,
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.200]   and shaving.
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.040]   There were several.
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.040]   There were 15 of them.
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.200]   Those are some of them.
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.520]   All of these things you're doing wrong.
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.400]   And as I was reading it yesterday,
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.560]   I was thinking about, you know, there's
[00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.360]   something that I'm certain we're doing wrong
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.480]   that didn't make the list.
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.920]   And the article went on to talk about some
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.000]   of the consequences to doing these things wrong,
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   like sleeping, and eating, and breathing,
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.920]   have real physical consequences.
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.320]   But this particular thing that didn't make the list, I think,
[00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:04.960]   has one of the greatest consequences,
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.320]   most relevant to us.
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:09.560]   And so we're in this series, Asking for a Friend,
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.080]   questions you wish the church would answer.
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.580]   And tonight, we're going to look at,
[00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:18.040]   what does the Bible have to say about sex?
[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.440]   What does it actually have to say about sex?
[00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.280]   You've probably heard some murmurings here and there.
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.240]   But what does it actually have to say about sex?
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:31.000]   And even more specifically, sex before marriage.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.400]   And so as I said, that I think this
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.360]   is the thing that is going to be, or cause,
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.360]   some of the greatest regrets in our lives.
[00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.200]   So let's just say, fast forward the tape to when you're 40,
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.160]   45.
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.800]   And let me just say this from personal experience.
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.800]   This is the thing that has caused the greatest regrets
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.240]   in my own life.
[00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.160]   This has had a bigger impact on my own marriage than anything.
[00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.960]   So just in case you're a guest with us,
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.120]   and you're like, oh, great, another pastor telling me
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.200]   I can't have sex before I'm married.
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.000]   What does he know?
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.240]   I'm sure he's saving himself.
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.320]   No.
[00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.600]   I have a scandalous past.
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.240]   Sexual addiction is a huge part of my story.
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.280]   Pornography, tremendous part of my story.
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:16.280]   And so I've traveled and have the privilege and the honor
[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.680]   of speaking on this topic in a lot of different places.
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.600]   And I'm really grateful to be home tonight
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.320]   to talk with you about it.
[00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:26.880]   And it's not something that I'm just--
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.120]   I'm not trying to scare you.
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.320]   I'm not putting things up here just to kind of condemn you.
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:37.040]   I don't want you to leave feeling guilty or full of shame.
[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.960]   I want you to know that I found forgiveness,
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.400]   the same forgiveness that is available to you.
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.200]   And there's tremendous hope.
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.680]   And the scripture is really clear.
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.320]   And so I'm not trying to pull anything over your eyes.
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.720]   I want to show you what God's word has to say.
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:57.520]   Because the way you find out how to pronounce jif
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.080]   is you go to the creator.
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.320]   And the way that you find out how to have sex
[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.440]   is you go to the inventor, the creator of sex.
[00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.360]   You can go into the grocery store,
[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.680]   to the tabloids in the aisle, and there'll
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:14.400]   be a lot of people that will tell you 13 tips and tricks
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.240]   to how to have an amazing sex life.
[00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:20.160]   And they've dumbed it down to penetration.
[00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.600]   They've dumbed it down to something
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.440]   that dogs do on the side of the road.
[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.760]   And the creator of the heavens and the Earth
[00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.920]   has said it's so much more.
[00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:32.160]   And you're missing out on it if you would just
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.680]   look at why he created this.
[00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:38.000]   God loves sex.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.400]   It's his brainchild.
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.160]   He thought of it.
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.280]   He invented it.
[00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:43.640]   I've said it many times.
[00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:45.440]   He made the parts.
[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.040]   He made them function the way that they do,
[00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.000]   fit together the way that they do,
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.280]   that a man would take his seed and place it inside a woman,
[00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:56.000]   and life would be born.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.400]   This is beautiful and amazing and one of the greatest
[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.360]   miracles of our lives.
[00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:05.160]   But we don't think about it that way.
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.320]   Most of the time when we're thinking about sex,
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:11.560]   we're thinking about pleasure and really stripping away
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:14.720]   what we would call the consequences.
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.840]   How do we enjoy a moment of pleasure?
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:22.480]   And this is something that I think we've come so far on
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:25.520]   that I need you to have an open mind tonight
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:28.840]   and start from the place like what if we've gotten this
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:32.200]   really, really, really wrong?
[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:35.640]   And what if the consequences are so grave that we're just
[00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:39.920]   swimming in them and we don't even realize it?
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:42.200]   Like they have tremendous impact on the world
[00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:45.240]   that we live in and we don't even realize it.
[00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:48.560]   And so we're gonna look at three questions tonight.
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:52.120]   The first one is what does the Bible really say about sex
[00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:55.940]   and why it's wrong and why isn't it more obvious?
[00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:59.960]   The second one is how far is too far?
[00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:01.720]   And then before you leave here this morning,
[00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:03.480]   I wanna address the question what do I do
[00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:05.240]   if I've already gone too far?
[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:07.840]   And the temptation I face is just to give up
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:10.720]   and to say hey, who cares, let's just go all in.
[00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:12.080]   And so the first question is this,
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:14.320]   where does the Bible explicitly say
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:16.640]   that sex before marriage is wrong?
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:19.000]   Let me tell you a story.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.040]   I was one of these kids,
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:23.160]   and I'm sure you've heard about these boys.
[00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:26.640]   I was one of these boys that I went to a Bible study.
[00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:28.240]   It was actually at my girlfriend's house,
[00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:30.640]   my girlfriend's parents' house, okay, in high school.
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:32.540]   My girlfriend in high school's parents' house.
[00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:33.660]   So you got the setting.
[00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:34.800]   We're sitting there in the living room.
[00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:37.520]   There's a Bible school teacher
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:39.280]   and they're talking about this
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:40.920]   and then telling us how we shouldn't have sex.
[00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:43.440]   And I just kind of raised my hand and said hey,
[00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:44.480]   I've read the Bible.
[00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.240]   It's not in there.
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:49.740]   It doesn't say don't have sex before marriage.
[00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:52.520]   And you can't show me, and there's some things going on,
[00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:54.680]   and you don't understand the Greek word
[00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:55.720]   that I've looked into,
[00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:58.680]   because every boy who wants to get his girlfriend naked
[00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:01.120]   all of a sudden becomes a Greek scholar, okay?
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:03.040]   That's just kind of how that works.
[00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:05.160]   And so I'm like hey, listen,
[00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:06.800]   now this is, keep in mind where I'm at.
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:09.200]   And so my girlfriend's dad walks in
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.360]   and he's like wait, who's asking this question
[00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:12.280]   and what's he saying?
[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:13.720]   And I'm like I don't know, who is?
[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:14.640]   Which one?
[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:17.360]   And he's like that dude is not going
[00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:20.920]   anywhere near my daughter.
[00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:21.920]   And but here's what you need to know.
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:22.760]   I was wrong.
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:25.120]   And if that's you here tonight,
[00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:26.380]   I empathize with your stance.
[00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:28.220]   I understand why you're there.
[00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:30.260]   You're trying to justify what you want to do.
[00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.120]   And you're also wrong.
[00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:35.320]   And so we'll get to look at what God's word actually says,
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:36.920]   because the first thing Satan says,
[00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:39.800]   one of the first things Satan says to humanity is this.
[00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:41.340]   Did God really say?
[00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:43.960]   Did God really say?
[00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:45.320]   And if you're one of those people,
[00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:47.960]   as it comes to sex, you're saying did God really say?
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:48.800]   Here's what you need to know.
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:50.360]   You're getting duped by the enemy.
[00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:52.500]   He's eating your lunch.
[00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:55.040]   You're getting sold by Satan.
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:57.160]   You are believing his lie
[00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:59.600]   and he is getting the best of you.
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.240]   And so let's just walk through the Bible
[00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:02.920]   and kind of talk about different areas
[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:05.360]   that talk about different kinds of sex really quick.
[00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:08.720]   And so the first one is the Old Testament, right?
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:11.880]   The Old Testament is about 75% of the Bible.
[00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:13.520]   And as we get to the first five books,
[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:15.800]   it has a lot to do, a lot to say about sex.
[00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:18.840]   You have the invention of man and woman
[00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:20.520]   right at the beginning.
[00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:22.400]   And God says, "Be fruitful and multiply,
[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:24.000]   "fill the earth and subdue it."
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.640]   And so here, it says this in Deuteronomy chapter 22.
[00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:32.840]   The context of this verse is that if someone gets married
[00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:34.320]   and someone raises the point
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:37.260]   that who he married was not a virgin,
[00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:40.440]   then he has to prove that she was a virgin.
[00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:43.300]   And the way that he would prove that she was a virgin
[00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:45.640]   is he would have to present the bedsheet
[00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:49.060]   from their honeymoon and have to show
[00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:50.800]   that there was blood on the bedsheet
[00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:53.080]   from their honeymoon to prove that she was a virgin.
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:54.180]   I know that's graphic.
[00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:55.900]   If you have kids here tonight,
[00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:58.760]   we typically don't let children in the porch.
[00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:00.800]   (congregation laughing)
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:04.640]   And so just know that I'm speaking to adults tonight.
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:07.280]   And so I know that's really graphic.
[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:10.360]   This is Deuteronomy chapter 22, verse 13.
[00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:12.960]   It says, I'm sorry, verse 20.
[00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:15.080]   It says, "If, however, the charge is true
[00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:18.200]   "and no proof of the young woman's virginity can be found,
[00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:21.140]   "she shall be brought to the door of her father's house
[00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:24.640]   "and there the men of her town shall stone her to death."
[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:28.660]   Ouch, okay, that's crazy.
[00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:30.340]   That's crazy.
[00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:32.060]   Here's what I just said.
[00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:35.000]   If someone gets married and someone raises the case,
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.880]   hey, that they're not a virgin,
[00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:39.940]   they literally had the right, according to the Bible,
[00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:44.940]   according to the law of that time, to kill them by rocks.
[00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:48.700]   This is really graphic and really heavy,
[00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:52.460]   but you need to know this is how the Bible starts out,
[00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:55.540]   that God really, really cares about this.
[00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:56.900]   Now, I know where your mind's going,
[00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:58.460]   a thousand different places,
[00:11:58.460 --> 00:11:59.700]   and you're like, what about the guy?
[00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:02.740]   Here's what it says about the guy in Exodus chapter 22.
[00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:05.500]   It says that if he has sex with a girl,
[00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:07.400]   if he convinces a girl to have sex with him,
[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:10.060]   then they are married and they cannot get divorced.
[00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:12.900]   I'm not talking about married in God's eyes.
[00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:15.100]   I'm talking about they are married,
[00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:16.580]   he can't marry anyone else,
[00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:18.900]   and they have to stay married forever.
[00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:21.460]   And he has to pay to be married to her.
[00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:24.100]   He has to pay her father a dowry.
[00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:26.440]   And so this is how the Scripture just kinda starts out,
[00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:30.100]   saying, hey, sex is a really, really big deal,
[00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:31.380]   and you're like, man, this is crazy.
[00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:32.220]   Keep in mind a couple things.
[00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:35.260]   One, that was written 3,000 years ago
[00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.780]   into a cultural context very different
[00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:39.700]   than the one that we live in.
[00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:41.460]   In this cultural context,
[00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:44.500]   sex was held in the highest regard,
[00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:47.540]   and purity wasn't even something you'd question.
[00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:49.580]   Like, everyone, no one would wonder,
[00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:51.180]   can I have sex before I'm married or not?
[00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:52.780]   No way, you might, you would die.
[00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:54.300]   It would cost you your life.
[00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:58.060]   No one's even thinking about that, okay?
[00:12:58.060 --> 00:12:59.780]   And you say, man, but that's still crazy.
[00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:01.940]   Let me tell you a story from my hometown.
[00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:06.300]   In my hometown, a dad, a father,
[00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:11.300]   walked up on a man having sex with his underage daughter.
[00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:12.580]   True story.
[00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:14.740]   And that dad beat that man to death.
[00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:16.380]   He killed him.
[00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:17.220]   Right there on the spot.
[00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:19.300]   He appeared before the judge,
[00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:22.780]   and the judge, in a matter of minutes, let him off.
[00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:25.260]   Said, you're free.
[00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:26.340]   I hold nothing against you.
[00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:27.660]   You've committed no crime here.
[00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:30.940]   I understand why you did what you did.
[00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:33.820]   And I remember reading that article and thinking, yeah.
[00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:35.780]   I mean, we're human beings.
[00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:37.180]   He's filled with passion and rage.
[00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:39.620]   He sees this happening.
[00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:40.460]   Of course.
[00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:43.260]   Now consider that every young lady
[00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.020]   that has ever been born and created
[00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:49.380]   is the creation of God.
[00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:51.460]   Like, God brought her into existence
[00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:53.180]   and formed her body and knows everything about her
[00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:55.220]   and loves her more than her father does.
[00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:59.580]   And when you take advantage of that girl, men,
[00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:02.660]   the scripture, 1 Thessalonians 4 says,
[00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:06.180]   God is the avenger of these matters.
[00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:10.100]   That it really, really matters to him.
[00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:11.420]   And I'm not trying to scare you.
[00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:15.180]   I'm just reading the scripture to you.
[00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:17.300]   And so you're like, but wait, okay.
[00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:19.340]   I thought we were talking about sex being wrong.
[00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:20.660]   The Old Testament, like,
[00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:22.780]   we don't follow the Old Testament, right?
[00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:24.860]   We eat shellfish and pork.
[00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:26.260]   And so we're not following those rules.
[00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:27.700]   And I've heard something about, you know,
[00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:31.340]   there being moral laws and ceremonial laws.
[00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:33.220]   And so what does this mean?
[00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:34.140]   How does this matter?
[00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:36.380]   Well, let's move to the New Testament,
[00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:39.460]   but let's agree that 75% of the Bible
[00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:42.380]   says sex before marriage is explicitly wrong.
[00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:44.180]   75%, that's the Old Testament.
[00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:45.940]   75% of the Bible's like, oh yeah, absolutely.
[00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:48.300]   You could get killed for doing that.
[00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:50.980]   Okay, so let's move into the New Testament.
[00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:52.420]   And let's just look at different kinds of sex.
[00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:54.620]   We'll start with sex with prostitutes.
[00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:55.740]   Can I have sex with prostitutes?
[00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:57.260]   First Corinthians six, verse 14.
[00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:58.220]   Do you not know that your bodies
[00:14:58.220 --> 00:14:59.700]   are members of Christ himself?
[00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:01.140]   Shall I then take members of Christ
[00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:02.740]   and unite them with a prostitute?
[00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:04.420]   Never, okay?
[00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:06.860]   So I can't have sex with prostitutes, all right?
[00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:07.980]   That is out.
[00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:08.980]   Old Testament, out.
[00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:11.340]   Sex with prostitutes, also out.
[00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:12.420]   That is not allowed.
[00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:13.780]   And you say, well, why does that matter?
[00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:14.620]   Here's why it matters.
[00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:16.420]   Because there's only certain labels
[00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:18.620]   that girls carried in the New Testament.
[00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:20.580]   So when you think about categories,
[00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:22.900]   there is no girlfriend category.
[00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:25.500]   It did not exist in the New Testament.
[00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:30.220]   You had mom, sister, adulterer, prostitute, or wife.
[00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:32.500]   Those were the labels that you'd have.
[00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:34.140]   You could be a relative.
[00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:37.540]   You could be an adulterer.
[00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:39.520]   You could be a prostitute.
[00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:40.500]   Or you could be a wife.
[00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:42.020]   There was no girlfriend.
[00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:44.500]   There was no dating category.
[00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:45.820]   And so let's talk about something
[00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:47.240]   that you know the Bible condemns.
[00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:48.460]   It's adultery.
[00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:49.700]   We'll talk about adultery.
[00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:50.780]   It's married people.
[00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:52.600]   This is having sex with a married person
[00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:55.260]   or going outside of your marriage to have sex.
[00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:56.940]   In Romans 7, verse three says,
[00:15:56.940 --> 00:15:59.620]   so then if she has sexual relations with another man
[00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:01.220]   while her husband is still alive,
[00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:02.900]   she is called an adulteress.
[00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:06.340]   But if her husband dies, she is released from that law
[00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:09.460]   and is not an adulteress if she marries another man.
[00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:11.660]   And so the Bible says you cannot go outside
[00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:13.060]   of your marriage to have sex,
[00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:14.580]   and you cannot have sex with someone
[00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:16.620]   who is married to someone else.
[00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:18.580]   And we say, absolutely, we know that.
[00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:20.900]   The Bible's really explicit about this.
[00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:23.900]   In the New Testament, it says this seven times,
[00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:25.100]   that you cannot do this.
[00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:27.740]   This is condemned seven times in the New Testament.
[00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:30.720]   When something's important, it's repeated in the Scripture.
[00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:33.260]   And so we see that this is wrong.
[00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.180]   It's like God is saying something.
[00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:39.020]   He's saying, hey, marriage is a really sacred fence,
[00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:41.340]   and sex is for marriage.
[00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:44.500]   And you can't go outside of that marriage
[00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:47.340]   to have sex with anyone else, okay?
[00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:48.780]   You don't wanna have sex with anyone
[00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:51.260]   who's in that fence with somebody else.
[00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.420]   And he's about to tell us, and you don't have sex
[00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:55.200]   before you get in that fence.
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:58.700]   You say, where?
[00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:00.760]   Before I go there, Hebrews 13, four,
[00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:02.700]   just this idea that marriage is a sacred fence.
[00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:05.380]   Marriage should be honored by all,
[00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:07.620]   and the marriage bed kept pure,
[00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:11.860]   for God will judge the adulterer and the sexually immoral.
[00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:14.520]   There's two terms there, adulterer,
[00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:18.420]   and then another term, the sexually immoral.
[00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:20.080]   This word is really important
[00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:22.700]   in understanding what the Scripture says.
[00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:25.180]   So let's talk about sexual immorality.
[00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:27.660]   First Thessalonians chapter four, verses three through five
[00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:30.740]   says, it is God's will that you should be sanctified,
[00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:33.060]   that you should avoid sexual immorality,
[00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:35.940]   that each of you should learn to control your own body
[00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:38.140]   in a way that is holy and honorable,
[00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:41.660]   not in passionate lust like the pagans who do not know God.
[00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:45.960]   And so whatever sexual immorality is, it is forbidden.
[00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:49.520]   And it says that we're to learn to control our own body.
[00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:53.040]   And so here is a word that encompasses
[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:55.680]   sex before marriage, okay?
[00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:58.640]   And you say, well, why doesn't it say sex before marriage?
[00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:01.160]   Keep in mind the context that it's written in
[00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:04.000]   is that people aren't, they know,
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.800]   they know that you can't have sex before marriage.
[00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:08.560]   Remember the woman who was caught in sexual sin
[00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:10.080]   in John chapter eight?
[00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:11.940]   They come around her and they pick up rocks
[00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:15.080]   and they're about to kill her right there.
[00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:16.900]   And Jesus intervenes.
[00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:20.440]   That's them living out the law in Deuteronomy 22.
[00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:22.720]   This is the context that this is written in.
[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:23.920]   And so everybody comes up,
[00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:25.480]   this is where you become a Greek scholar,
[00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:27.280]   say, well, that's the word porneia.
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:28.960]   And porneia can mean, you know,
[00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:29.960]   all of these different things.
[00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:34.200]   No, porneia means any sexual activity
[00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:36.600]   outside of the context of a man and a woman
[00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:38.560]   who are married together.
[00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:40.120]   That's what porneia means.
[00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:43.400]   You can look up the definition anywhere you want.
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:45.280]   It's like, well, how do you know what it means?
[00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:46.440]   How do I know what up means?
[00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:47.840]   How do I know what down means?
[00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:49.560]   How do I know what any word means?
[00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:52.600]   I can look it up and we know without a doubt,
[00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:56.560]   without any question, what porneia means.
[00:18:56.560 --> 00:19:00.760]   Sex outside of God's covenant of marriage.
[00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:02.960]   Sexual activity.
[00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:05.500]   Any kind of sex.
[00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:10.080]   And so the problem is we all wanna decide
[00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:11.200]   what this word means.
[00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:16.460]   And we all agree that there's some forbidden sex.
[00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:19.320]   Right, like I'm just gonna go on a limb
[00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:21.360]   and I'm gonna assume that everyone here
[00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:23.720]   would say like sex with children, that's wrong.
[00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:25.980]   That's forbidden.
[00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:29.200]   Let's just assume we all agree that that's wrong.
[00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:30.920]   But you know there's people that don't agree with you,
[00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:33.000]   right, there's NAMBLA,
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   which stands for North American Men Boy Love Association.
[00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:41.360]   And it's as outrageous as it sounds.
[00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:43.080]   And they advocate pedophilia.
[00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:45.860]   They say that it should be legal, right.
[00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:47.800]   But we would say no, that's forbidden.
[00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:48.800]   Why would you say that?
[00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:50.960]   Where does that come from?
[00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:54.120]   Well, just a feeling I have.
[00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:57.480]   Or we could listen to the one who created sex
[00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:59.760]   and says this is what sex is for.
[00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:03.720]   We don't get to decide what is right and what is wrong.
[00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:07.240]   He does and he's made it really clear.
[00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:10.140]   Remember I said adultery was condemned seven times?
[00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:16.040]   Pornia, fornication is translated in some Bibles,
[00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:18.660]   which is a more direct sex before marriage,
[00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:24.040]   is condemned 26 times in the New Testament.
[00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:26.900]   26 times.
[00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:33.360]   And so you think, but why does God say,
[00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:36.600]   why does he not say thou shalt not have sex before marriage?
[00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:38.800]   It's like this.
[00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:41.960]   It's like God says, there's a building,
[00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:45.100]   and God says, hey, don't go on the roof.
[00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:47.400]   Under any circumstance, don't go on the roof.
[00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:48.480]   That's this word, pornia.
[00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:49.680]   It's all encompassing.
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:51.800]   It's all kinds of sexual immorality,
[00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:53.320]   which includes sex before marriage.
[00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:54.900]   And God says, don't go on the roof.
[00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:56.580]   Whatever you do, don't go on the roof.
[00:20:56.580 --> 00:20:58.240]   Let me tell you 26 times,
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:01.880]   do not under any circumstance go on the roof.
[00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:04.600]   And we show up and we say,
[00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:06.840]   well, God didn't say don't jump off the roof.
[00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:10.960]   Why did he never say don't jump off the roof?
[00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:11.840]   He's like, no, no, no, you don't say,
[00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:13.200]   he put the line way before that.
[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:15.600]   He said, don't even go up on the roof.
[00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:18.400]   I'm like, yeah, but he never said don't jump off the roof.
[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:19.240]   Did he, really?
[00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:21.000]   I mean, where, 'cause it's a Greek word.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:27.360]   It's like God, it's like God didn't say
[00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:29.760]   don't shoot someone at point blank range
[00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:34.160]   16 times in the chest with an AR-15 .223 caliber.
[00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:35.440]   Where did he say that?
[00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:38.400]   Well, he said, don't murder.
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:41.000]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, but I mean, but where does he say?
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.320]   No, no, his rule is even bigger than that.
[00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:48.760]   But does it include absolutely right in the middle of that?
[00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:51.840]   Of course, it includes that.
[00:21:51.840 --> 00:22:00.720]   And you say, well, I'm not convinced, 1 Corinthians 7, 2,
[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:03.720]   but since sexual immorality is occurring,
[00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:07.320]   the only thing I know to do is that each man
[00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:10.480]   should have sexual relations with his own wife
[00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:12.920]   and each woman with her own husband.
[00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:15.220]   This is the only place that this should occur.
[00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:18.600]   And so the only solution to sexual immorality
[00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:23.600]   is abstinence or marriage if someone's seeking release.
[00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:28.040]   And you say, well, I'm not convinced yet.
[00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:29.480]   And so let's just go one more.
[00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:31.820]   We got the topic of lust.
[00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:35.880]   Lust in Matthew 5, this is the words of Jesus now.
[00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:37.560]   He says, you have heard it was said,
[00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:39.320]   you shall not commit adultery,
[00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:41.600]   but I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:45.340]   has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
[00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:50.340]   And so Jesus says, hey, I know you've heard adultery
[00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:54.780]   condemned, but I'm condemning you looking at someone
[00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:55.920]   and desiring her.
[00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:59.600]   Lust is sexual desire, and that's what this is.
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:01.600]   And so he says, that's not, even that,
[00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:03.600]   even to have sexual desire for someone
[00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:06.440]   that you're not married to, that is not allowed.
[00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:09.240]   And you say, well, that's not a reality, right?
[00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:12.280]   That's not anything that I can do.
[00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:14.080]   And I would say, you're absolutely right,
[00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:18.200]   unless the trajectory, the entire trajectory of your life
[00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:20.840]   and your heart and your mind is to pursue Jesus
[00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:23.120]   with all you can to love the Lord, your God,
[00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:25.520]   with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength,
[00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:27.640]   that that is actually the goal,
[00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:29.960]   that you're not just trying to not have sex,
[00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:31.300]   you're trying to love God.
[00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:34.280]   In fact, your problem is not that you love sex too much,
[00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:36.440]   it's that you don't love God enough.
[00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:40.980]   That you, that he would be the biggest thing about you.
[00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:44.520]   That anybody that you would even think about
[00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:47.600]   dating or spending time with or desiring to marriage,
[00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:50.440]   that right at the center of that relationship
[00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:53.240]   would be Jesus.
[00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:55.920]   And that anywhere you'd go with her or him
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:58.840]   would be the Holy Spirit.
[00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:03.860]   And what it would be marked by is not just purity,
[00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:05.860]   but holiness.
[00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:09.980]   That the world would look on and say, man,
[00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:13.180]   what they have for each other, it's holy.
[00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:15.460]   It's godly.
[00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:18.140]   It's God-honoring.
[00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:23.160]   The Bible says sex is for marriage
[00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:25.620]   in 1 Corinthians chapter seven, verse nine.
[00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:27.740]   But if they cannot control themselves,
[00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:29.600]   they should masturbate.
[00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:30.680]   Oh no, that's not what it says.
[00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:32.280]   It says, but if they cannot,
[00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:36.120]   but if they cannot control themselves,
[00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:37.680]   they should have oral sex.
[00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:39.280]   That's not what it says.
[00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:42.120]   But if they cannot control themselves,
[00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:43.080]   they should make out.
[00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:44.240]   That's not what it says.
[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:47.540]   But if they cannot control themselves, they should marry.
[00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:49.320]   That's really their only option.
[00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:52.040]   Exclusively their only option.
[00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:56.260]   For it is better to marry than to burn with passion.
[00:24:56.560 --> 00:25:01.560]   And so we see is sexual activity outside of marriage
[00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:05.320]   is wrong, that's oral sex, anal sex, sexting,
[00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:08.640]   any kind of sex that you would have
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:11.200]   outside of marriage is wrong.
[00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:14.880]   And so how far is too far, second question.
[00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:16.040]   How far is too far?
[00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:19.920]   Let's just acknowledge up front that this question
[00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:23.560]   is asked by someone wanting to cross the line.
[00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:27.500]   To cross the line, I mean that we all have a desire
[00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:29.040]   to go too far.
[00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:32.060]   That inside of us is an urge to go too far.
[00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:35.000]   And so if someone comes to me and they say,
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:39.160]   on a building, they say, well how close to the edge
[00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:41.900]   can I get, how close to the edge of the building can I get?
[00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:43.540]   The first thing that I'm gonna ask them,
[00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:45.420]   well let me ask you a question.
[00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:47.880]   Do you desire to jump off the building?
[00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:51.540]   Because if you desire to jump off the building,
[00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:54.200]   stay on the ground.
[00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:57.560]   Don't even get on the elevator.
[00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:00.020]   And when it comes to sex, we all need to acknowledge
[00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:01.280]   that there is a desire in us,
[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:02.900]   especially if we're spending time with someone
[00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:06.380]   that we're attracted to, to jump off the building.
[00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:09.520]   And so Matthew five goes on to say this,
[00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:12.000]   he says, if your right eye causes you to stumble,
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:13.600]   gouge it out and throw it away,
[00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:15.720]   it is better for you to lose one part of your body
[00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:18.440]   than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.
[00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:20.160]   And if your right hand causes you to stumble,
[00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:21.340]   cut it off and throw it away.
[00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:23.520]   It is better for you to lose one part of your body
[00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:25.680]   than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.
[00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:28.300]   Talking about in the context of lust,
[00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:32.280]   Jesus is using a hyperbole, an exaggeration.
[00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:34.240]   He doesn't literally want you to gouge out your eye
[00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:36.640]   or cut off your hand, but he is trying to say
[00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:39.320]   to the religious people there, you need to do
[00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:43.440]   whatever it takes to abstain from sexual immorality
[00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:45.160]   and to not lust.
[00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:46.960]   And it's interesting that when he talks about lust,
[00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:49.000]   he's saying, hey, your eye causes you to lust
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:50.840]   because you look at something.
[00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:55.840]   And he says, your right hand also causes you to lust.
[00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:59.120]   And I believe that is a reference to masturbation.
[00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:03.320]   And so if you wanna, hey, how far is too far?
[00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:08.320]   Lusting is too far, masturbation is too far.
[00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:13.320]   And so let me just break it down very clearly for you.
[00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:17.880]   Because I know how this works, right?
[00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:20.680]   Hey, you wanna come over to my apartment
[00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:22.280]   and watch a movie?
[00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:24.680]   Sure.
[00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:25.640]   Is there gonna be popcorn there?
[00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:26.480]   Yeah, okay.
[00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:28.960]   And so you go over and hang out,
[00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:30.800]   watch this romantic comedy, you know,
[00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:34.240]   oh, so funny, it's Jennifer Aniston, I love her.
[00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:37.920]   And we're just having a good time.
[00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:40.400]   Hell, I'm tired, I'm gonna, you okay if I lay down?
[00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:41.720]   Yeah, I'll lay down too.
[00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:44.080]   Okay, now we just went horizontal.
[00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:48.040]   Okay, but it's cool 'cause we're just watching a movie.
[00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:49.400]   Right?
[00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:51.920]   And then, you know, one hand touches the other hand,
[00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:54.800]   sparks start flying, move closer, okay?
[00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:58.360]   Bodies up against each other, there's some rubbing going on.
[00:27:58.360 --> 00:27:59.760]   Okay, you uncomfortable yet?
[00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:02.920]   Right?
[00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:04.240]   Okay, and then all of a sudden,
[00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:07.000]   hands start going places, somebody turns over,
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.680]   you're making out now, right?
[00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:12.040]   This is how this goes, right?
[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:13.680]   Okay, but we're gonna stop.
[00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:15.720]   We're just enjoying each other.
[00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:17.040]   Here's what you just did.
[00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:20.760]   You just got on a moving sidewalk.
[00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:23.520]   You've seen these things in the airport,
[00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:24.880]   the moving sidewalks?
[00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:28.440]   You know, you get on 'em, they take you places.
[00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:30.960]   I got on a moving sidewalk once.
[00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:33.440]   It was, you know, one that went all the way down
[00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:34.280]   the terminal.
[00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:39.640]   I got halfway there with my suitcase, it was full of people,
[00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:41.480]   and I realized it wasn't the right terminal,
[00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:43.720]   wasn't going to the right gate, I needed to get off,
[00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:46.840]   but it's just slowly moving me down, you know?
[00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:48.920]   And so I started thinking I'm gonna climb over the side,
[00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:51.840]   but there was actually two of 'em right beside each other.
[00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:53.920]   So I'm thinking, okay, I gotta get them to move,
[00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:55.680]   climb over that one, then climb over the next,
[00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:57.840]   and then somehow, hey, will you hand me my bags?
[00:28:57.840 --> 00:28:59.440]   Like, how am I gonna do this?
[00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:01.600]   Because it's just taking me somewhere, right?
[00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:03.640]   It just keeps moving me on.
[00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:05.440]   That's what you did.
[00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:08.680]   It's leading to two destinations.
[00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:13.080]   One full of regret, and the other full of regret.
[00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:16.160]   Right, you either finish,
[00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:20.520]   or you leave really, really frustrated.
[00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:23.440]   But it ain't going anywhere good.
[00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:26.120]   And you stepped on that sidewalk,
[00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:29.240]   and it just started taking you, right?
[00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:32.280]   One thing leads to another, and you just keep going.
[00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:33.680]   So how far is too far?
[00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:35.280]   Here's the really clear answer, you ready?
[00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:37.720]   Really clear, it's transferable, you can tell your friends.
[00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:39.120]   Here's how far is too far.
[00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:43.040]   When your body begins to prepare itself for sex,
[00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:44.360]   you've gone too far.
[00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:47.480]   Now, do I need to get some,
[00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:50.800]   I mean, some like, what am I trying to say,
[00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:53.200]   pictures up here to explain what I mean by this?
[00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:55.560]   That's not what I was talking about.
[00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:57.920]   (congregation laughing)
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:00.200]   Let me just say this really clearly.
[00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:04.480]   When your body, in the way that God designed it to work,
[00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:07.160]   and operate, and function, and it's an amazing design,
[00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:10.800]   whether you're male or female, it's an incredible design.
[00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:13.640]   When your body begins to prepare itself for sex,
[00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:16.120]   you've already crossed the line.
[00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:19.720]   And you say, JP, man, gosh,
[00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:22.080]   then I can't even be in the same room with her.
[00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:27.660]   Then you can't be in the same room with her,
[00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:28.720]   at least not alone.
[00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:30.920]   And for some of you, that's gonna be like,
[00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:32.200]   well, but then we can't even hold hands.
[00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:34.600]   Well, then you can't even hold hands.
[00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:38.360]   Okay, because your body was made to prepare itself for sex.
[00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:39.800]   And that's a great thing.
[00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:41.320]   Like, that's your body working
[00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:43.520]   the way that it's supposed to work.
[00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:48.360]   But why would you start your body only to shut it off
[00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:51.040]   in a way that it's not supposed to work?
[00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:53.400]   Why would you train your body to do something
[00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:56.240]   that it wasn't wired to do, it wasn't meant to do?
[00:30:56.240 --> 00:31:01.240]   Do you see God's incredibly genius design here?
[00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:03.240]   It's an amazing design.
[00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:11.740]   First Corinthians chapter six, verse 18 says this.
[00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:14.080]   Flee sexual immorality.
[00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:17.180]   All other sins a person commits are outside the body.
[00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:19.760]   But whoever sins sexually sins against their own body.
[00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:21.520]   Do you not know that your bodies are temple
[00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:23.480]   of the Holy Spirit who's in you,
[00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:25.300]   whom you've received from God?
[00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:26.880]   You are not your own.
[00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:29.840]   Therefore, honor God with your body.
[00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:31.740]   And so we flee sexual immorality.
[00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:33.240]   The way that we flee sexual immorality
[00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:34.820]   is we run toward Christ.
[00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:36.080]   If you're running toward Christ,
[00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:38.020]   you're running from sexual immorality.
[00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:40.140]   If you're running toward Christ as fast as you can,
[00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:42.080]   sexual immorality, I promise you,
[00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:43.560]   is going to be behind you.
[00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:46.600]   Jesus and sexual immorality will never be side by side.
[00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:49.600]   You will never be pursuing Jesus and sexually immoral.
[00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:52.880]   It will not happen.
[00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:54.960]   And so you can stop playing defense.
[00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:57.440]   Don't, don't, don't, thou shalt not stop.
[00:31:57.440 --> 00:31:58.900]   And you can start playing offense.
[00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:01.000]   Pursue Jesus with reckless abandonment
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.080]   and begin to live out your purpose.
[00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:08.180]   And when you do that, you will not fall into sexual sin.
[00:32:08.180 --> 00:32:10.860]   You will avoid sexual sin.
[00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:13.020]   The problem is not that you love sex,
[00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:16.540]   it's that you're not pursuing Christ.
[00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:24.860]   And so here's what I would tell you.
[00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:29.340]   I know some folks are like, well, but it's just sex.
[00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:31.220]   It's never just sex.
[00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:37.900]   You go on Twitter and search #metoo,
[00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:42.820]   and you're gonna see that it's never just sex.
[00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:45.740]   Somebody comes up and they talk to me every Tuesday,
[00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:46.580]   right up here.
[00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:48.180]   They can't look me in the eyes.
[00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:49.100]   They're broken.
[00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:52.340]   Some of the most broken people that I've ever met with
[00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:54.660]   are someone who has sinned sexually
[00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:56.940]   or been violated sexually in some way.
[00:32:56.940 --> 00:33:00.900]   And it is a, it's a sin against the self,
[00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:01.760]   the scripture says.
[00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:03.460]   It's a unique sin.
[00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:05.740]   It impact, I'm not saying them being violated is a sin.
[00:33:05.740 --> 00:33:08.840]   I'm saying that that, the person who sinned against them
[00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:11.440]   hurt them in a unique way.
[00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:14.020]   It was against themselves.
[00:33:14.020 --> 00:33:17.060]   The scripture puts it in all, you know,
[00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:18.820]   its own category.
[00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:22.580]   It says, hey, this one is unique when you do this.
[00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:25.100]   And this is why you can't get over your ex?
[00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:28.120]   This is why you wanna get drunk
[00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:30.000]   and have an excuse to call them?
[00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:35.220]   We wanna drink too much as an excuse to make a mistake?
[00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:38.760]   Because you gave yourself to them
[00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:44.120]   in a way that you weren't supposed to.
[00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:48.320]   And now they have your heart in a unique way,
[00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:49.960]   male or female.
[00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:53.160]   And I know it's true.
[00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:55.180]   And you know it's true.
[00:33:55.180 --> 00:33:58.520]   Because the way that God made sex,
[00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:01.640]   it's the highest levels of dopamine
[00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:04.220]   that someone can experience naturally.
[00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:08.020]   And what happens during sexual release
[00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:10.060]   is your brain creates a synapse.
[00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:12.440]   A synapse is like a muscle in the brain.
[00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:15.040]   It creates a synapse that bonds your five senses
[00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:17.020]   to your surroundings.
[00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:21.660]   Okay, this is where sexual perversions come from.
[00:34:21.660 --> 00:34:23.820]   This is where fetishes come from.
[00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:27.420]   You think, man, why, you know, is there foot porn out there?
[00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:31.060]   It's because some dude or some person
[00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:33.260]   has bonded themselves to feet.
[00:34:33.260 --> 00:34:37.500]   And that's what the epitome of sexual attraction
[00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:38.560]   is for them.
[00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:39.540]   That's what happened.
[00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:41.780]   The reason that God made us this way
[00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:44.400]   is so that when we would experience sexual release
[00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:46.820]   with our spouse for a lifetime,
[00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:49.640]   they would remain the epitome of attraction to us.
[00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:52.840]   It's an unbelievable, beautiful design.
[00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:54.000]   It's why the scripture says,
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.020]   "For this reason, a man will leave his father and mother
[00:34:56.020 --> 00:34:57.160]   "and be united to his wife,
[00:34:57.160 --> 00:35:00.340]   "and the two will become one flesh."
[00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:03.380]   And today, secular psychologists and scientists
[00:35:03.380 --> 00:35:06.220]   call this phenomenon sex glue.
[00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:09.600]   That people during sex are bonded to each other.
[00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:11.740]   And what happens when you bond
[00:35:11.740 --> 00:35:13.940]   to multiple two-dimensional images
[00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:17.080]   in a pornography struggle or addiction
[00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:20.140]   is you're rewiring your body not to bond.
[00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:22.740]   And what happens is when you've been promiscuous
[00:35:22.740 --> 00:35:25.660]   with multiple partners is you're teaching your body
[00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:28.780]   not to bond, not to stick.
[00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:31.800]   And you're training yourself for variety.
[00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:36.800]   You are growing an addiction not to sex, but to variety.
[00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:41.860]   You are not training yourself for monogamy,
[00:35:41.860 --> 00:35:44.600]   but polygamy and adultery.
[00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:49.820]   And for many of you, you just had a light bulb moment
[00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:51.980]   'cause you look at our world, you see the divorce rate,
[00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:55.160]   you see how adultery is at an all-time high.
[00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:56.920]   Divorce rate's at an all-time high.
[00:35:56.920 --> 00:35:58.540]   Marriage at an all-time low.
[00:35:58.540 --> 00:36:00.420]   And can I just say something here?
[00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:02.580]   We are not getting better at this.
[00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:05.180]   We've got more tips and tricks and techniques
[00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:07.140]   in the grocery store than we've ever had
[00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:08.540]   in the history of history.
[00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:12.940]   And we stink at this in the biggest way.
[00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:16.140]   Your generation is the worst at sex
[00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:19.000]   and the worst at marriage than any other generation
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.160]   that has ever lived.
[00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:22.620]   And what's the solution?
[00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:24.980]   You.
[00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:27.560]   Pursuing Jesus.
[00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:31.280]   Being an example of what should be,
[00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:34.160]   displaying the kingdom, redeeming it.
[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:38.760]   And I know that right about now,
[00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:41.960]   the condemnation is at an all-time high
[00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:45.880]   'cause you feel like you've blown it in a major way.
[00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:49.080]   And the Rolodex is spinning.
[00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:52.480]   And you know that last night you were on your iPhone.
[00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:55.020]   You know on Instagram you clicked those hashtags.
[00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:59.820]   You know you went down that path.
[00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:02.460]   You know just this past weekend you drank a little too much,
[00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:04.900]   you called the ex and said, hey, you wanna come over
[00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:05.900]   and watch a movie?
[00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:13.420]   And I want you to know that the enemy's real.
[00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:15.740]   He hates you, he hates your children,
[00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:17.320]   he hates your marriage long before
[00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:18.820]   you've ever met your spouse.
[00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:20.740]   He hates you.
[00:37:20.740 --> 00:37:22.840]   He hates creation.
[00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:25.840]   The reason that he hates creation, this is really important,
[00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:29.900]   he uniquely targets sex.
[00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:34.160]   And here's why, because the first Great Commission,
[00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:37.520]   God's plan to fill the earth with his followers
[00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:40.280]   was to be fruitful and multiply,
[00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:42.640]   fill the earth and subdue it.
[00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:44.720]   God literally looks at man and woman and says,
[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:48.000]   hey, have lots of sex and have lots of babies.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.960]   And raise them up to know me.
[00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:52.680]   And that's how I'm gonna fill the world with my followers.
[00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:56.160]   And so Satan, who it's one kingdom after another,
[00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:57.680]   he doesn't want God's kingdom to grow,
[00:37:57.680 --> 00:38:00.960]   he wants his kingdom to grow, he targets sexuality
[00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:03.840]   and he tries to pervert it in a very unique way.
[00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:06.300]   The last thing the enemy wants is for you to be
[00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:08.700]   in a healthy marriage where you have children
[00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:10.300]   and raise them to know the Lord.
[00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:12.760]   That's what he's after.
[00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:15.700]   He is targeting you.
[00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:19.260]   And so what do I do if I've gone too far?
[00:38:20.260 --> 00:38:22.020]   What do I do if I've gone too far?
[00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:24.220]   You need to know there's grace and forgiveness.
[00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:26.260]   You do not have to leave here tonight
[00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:29.940]   feeling guilty or shameful or condemnation.
[00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:35.180]   So you think, well, I might as well keep on going, right?
[00:38:35.180 --> 00:38:36.260]   I've already blown it.
[00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:38.900]   What do I do if I've gone too far?
[00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:41.080]   What do you ever do if you've gone too far?
[00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:43.300]   Let's just think about this for a minute, right?
[00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:45.700]   I do this a lot because sometimes when I drive,
[00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:47.420]   I just kind of daydream, my mind wanders,
[00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:48.340]   you know, anybody else?
[00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:51.700]   And so I'm driving and I'll just like miss my turn,
[00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:53.620]   especially if my wife's not in the car to tell me
[00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:54.620]   'cause she's good at directions,
[00:38:54.620 --> 00:38:56.720]   but I'll just be thinking about a sermon
[00:38:56.720 --> 00:38:58.980]   and what I'm gonna talk with you guys about
[00:38:58.980 --> 00:38:59.880]   and I'll just keep driving.
[00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:02.460]   I'll miss my turn or I'll miss my destination
[00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:04.500]   and I'll get down the road and I'll realize that,
[00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:06.660]   oh, it's back that way, what do I do?
[00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:08.780]   The first thing I do is I stop.
[00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:12.660]   I stop progressing 'cause I realize I'm going the wrong way
[00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:15.860]   so I don't wanna go any further, so I stop.
[00:39:15.860 --> 00:39:18.500]   And then I turn around and I reorient myself,
[00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:20.460]   I look at the destination I wanna be at
[00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:21.940]   and I move toward it.
[00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:26.060]   And that's what you do if you've already blown it.
[00:39:26.060 --> 00:39:30.580]   You stop, no more, I'm done.
[00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:34.060]   I'm not gonna go any further, okay?
[00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:36.460]   I'm gonna turn around, that's called repentance.
[00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:39.540]   I'm moving from my sin and I'm turning toward Christ.
[00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:41.860]   That's repentance, turning from your sin,
[00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:45.100]   turning toward Jesus, Bible study, community group,
[00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:47.900]   church, that these things would consume your life.
[00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:50.260]   All right?
[00:39:50.260 --> 00:39:54.380]   You confess, guys, this is what I did.
[00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:57.020]   This is where my boyfriend and I are right now.
[00:39:57.020 --> 00:39:58.580]   This is where my girlfriend and I are right now.
[00:39:58.580 --> 00:39:59.820]   This is what we've done.
[00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:01.380]   Hey, I need to say this out loud.
[00:40:01.380 --> 00:40:04.340]   Would y'all pray for me in a James 5:16 kind of way
[00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:06.100]   so that I can experience healing?
[00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:09.100]   I wanna confess it out loud, all of it, the whole truth.
[00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:10.360]   This is what I've done.
[00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:13.740]   You confess it, you bring accountability.
[00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:15.300]   Hey, guys, would you help me?
[00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:16.900]   This is a temptation to me.
[00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:18.460]   Would you text me at this time?
[00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:20.820]   Hey, I'm going here, would you reach out to me?
[00:40:20.820 --> 00:40:22.280]   Hey, would you pray for me at this time?
[00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:24.060]   Would you follow up with a question
[00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:26.780]   and you invite accountability into your life?
[00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:32.600]   Some of you, you're in a toxic relationship
[00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:34.900]   and what you need to hear tonight is break up.
[00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:39.180]   Others of you, you have addictions in your life
[00:40:39.180 --> 00:40:41.340]   as it relates to sex and what you need to hear tonight
[00:40:41.340 --> 00:40:42.840]   is pursue healing.
[00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:45.520]   It's been there since the fifth grade.
[00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:48.720]   It's not gonna go away until you say, I need help.
[00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:50.940]   I gotta pursue healing.
[00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:56.360]   My wife and I, this is a part of our story.
[00:40:56.360 --> 00:40:58.000]   We met as nonbelievers.
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.120]   We trusted Christ together.
[00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:03.200]   Our relationship was a train wreck, manic highs and lows.
[00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:04.800]   I love you, I hate you.
[00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:07.040]   Get out of my car, I can't wait to see you again.
[00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:08.340]   It was just a mess.
[00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:11.880]   We come in, Jesus enters our life.
[00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:14.360]   We're like, whoa, where have you been all our life?
[00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:16.720]   We realize instant the conviction of the Holy Spirit,
[00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:18.320]   we gotta cut this out.
[00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:20.880]   We pulled the parking brake on all things physical,
[00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:21.920]   but it was hard.
[00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:23.920]   It was very, very difficult.
[00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:26.480]   What we needed to do is to create new lines
[00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:28.520]   of accountability that had nothing to do with sex,
[00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:31.320]   like how we spent time together.
[00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:33.960]   She couldn't stay at my place anymore, obviously.
[00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:37.180]   We couldn't be alone.
[00:41:37.180 --> 00:41:41.320]   We had to change up the rules for us to make it to,
[00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:42.200]   and you know what happened?
[00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:43.800]   You know what I did?
[00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:44.880]   Call me crazy, you know what I did?
[00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:46.560]   It took me about a month, and I proposed.
[00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:48.720]   I bought a ring, I'm like, this isn't any fun, man.
[00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:50.920]   We gotta, you know.
[00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:52.520]   And we were married four months later.
[00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:53.480]   That's the truth.
[00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:55.440]   That's the truth.
[00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:58.760]   And I didn't get off scot-free.
[00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:02.080]   Like, I didn't escape all the consequences.
[00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:04.600]   I brought the consequences into my marriage.
[00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:08.360]   It took about two and a half years of serious recovery
[00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:09.840]   to take place in my marriage.
[00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:12.800]   But God has done such a redemptive work.
[00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:15.240]   Such an incredible redemptive work.
[00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:17.320]   But can I be honest with you?
[00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:19.680]   It was a lot of work.
[00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:22.760]   It was a lot of work.
[00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:26.600]   And some of you, you're gonna leave here,
[00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:29.340]   and this is my last word of warning for you.
[00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:31.600]   You're gonna keep moving the wrong direction.
[00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:34.320]   And I hate that for you.
[00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:37.360]   'Cause I know firsthand how costly that is.
[00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:42.120]   I grew up painting.
[00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:44.760]   I'm an artist, I guess.
[00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:46.680]   You know, like some of you guys are football players
[00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:49.160]   and athletes and whatnot.
[00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:51.840]   Art was kind of my thing.
[00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:54.800]   And so I would go to this lady that grew up in a small town.
[00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:57.000]   It was Miss Talbert's art studio.
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:58.680]   And it was this elderly lady.
[00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:00.040]   She's since passed away.
[00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:01.600]   But she would teach us to paint.
[00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:03.040]   And so there was just kids in there,
[00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:06.920]   and we would paint on like glass canvases, if you will,
[00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:08.840]   China, oil on China.
[00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:10.160]   And so oil painting.
[00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:13.720]   And whenever you would paint, she would teach you how.
[00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:16.600]   If you'd ever mess up, you just raise your hand.
[00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:19.600]   Okay, 'cause there's no way to like erase oil paint,
[00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:21.480]   you know, and so you just have to raise your hand.
[00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:23.280]   And this lady, this elderly lady,
[00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:25.920]   who was an amazing artist, she'd come behind you,
[00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:28.380]   and she'd put her hand on your hand.
[00:43:28.380 --> 00:43:33.660]   And she would guide your hand on the canvas
[00:43:33.660 --> 00:43:35.860]   to make something beautiful of your mistake.
[00:43:35.860 --> 00:43:38.120]   And some of my favorite paintings
[00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:39.560]   were the ones that I really messed up,
[00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:41.720]   because she was so much better than me of an artist.
[00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:43.920]   And so, you know, when she would get involved,
[00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:45.320]   it would always end up beautiful.
[00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:47.560]   And so there would be this brush stroke out of bounds
[00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:49.640]   that, you know, it was supposed to be a flower.
[00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:52.500]   And it was just, it was nothing that you could see
[00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:54.160]   or notice, realize what it was.
[00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:56.680]   And she'd come behind me, put her hand on mine,
[00:43:56.680 --> 00:43:58.240]   and she'd make the most beautiful flower
[00:43:58.240 --> 00:44:00.040]   you can imagine out of that mistake.
[00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:02.800]   And this is what God does.
[00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:04.360]   You stop.
[00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:06.440]   I'm not gonna go any further.
[00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:07.560]   I'm gonna turn around.
[00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:10.000]   God, can you help?
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.160]   Can you help me?
[00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:13.200]   Can you drive from here?
[00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:16.840]   And he comes in your life,
[00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:19.160]   and he can make something beautiful
[00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:21.840]   out of what you've done wrong, okay?
[00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:28.040]   He makes amazing fathers out of fornicators.
[00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:32.840]   He makes awesome moms out of abortionists.
[00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:36.320]   He makes pastors out of pornographers.
[00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:39.800]   He makes saints out of the sexually immoral.
[00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:42.720]   He makes beauty from ashes.
[00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:45.260]   That's what he does.
[00:44:45.260 --> 00:44:49.060]   I'll give you two examples, and then we'll wrap up.
[00:44:49.060 --> 00:44:52.920]   In 1 John chapter eight, I told you there's this woman,
[00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:55.040]   she's caught in sexual sin.
[00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:57.840]   And so all these guys surround her, and they pick up stones.
[00:44:57.840 --> 00:44:59.480]   Can you imagine being this woman?
[00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:02.200]   Like she feels guilty, she feels shame,
[00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:03.640]   and now she's about to die
[00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:05.740]   because they know Deuteronomy 22.
[00:45:05.740 --> 00:45:07.760]   They've read it, they know what they gotta do now.
[00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:11.040]   She was sexually immoral, and they gotta kill her.
[00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:13.040]   To follow the law, they're gonna kill her.
[00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:15.820]   They're gonna throw rocks at her till she stops breathing,
[00:45:15.820 --> 00:45:17.240]   except Jesus shows up.
[00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:20.920]   He steps in between the woman and the men,
[00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:22.060]   holding the rocks.
[00:45:22.060 --> 00:45:25.480]   He says, hey, let me ask you guys a question.
[00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:31.380]   Whoever, which of you hasn't sinned?
[00:45:32.840 --> 00:45:35.900]   Whoever hasn't sinned, you throw the first stone, okay?
[00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:42.260]   And what you hear is the sound of rocks hitting the ground.
[00:45:42.260 --> 00:45:45.580]   And these men walking off.
[00:45:45.580 --> 00:45:48.140]   And he looks at her and he says,
[00:45:48.140 --> 00:45:49.840]   no one's here to condemn you, huh?
[00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:57.100]   No, sir.
[00:45:57.100 --> 00:45:59.460]   Then neither do I.
[00:46:01.620 --> 00:46:03.560]   Go and sin no more.
[00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:05.800]   He doesn't say, neither do I.
[00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:08.680]   Keep going, keep moving down the sidewalk,
[00:46:08.680 --> 00:46:10.080]   keep doing your thing, lady.
[00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:11.880]   He says, stop it.
[00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:16.600]   Go and sin no more.
[00:46:16.600 --> 00:46:19.520]   And I'll tell you another story
[00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:20.600]   because that one was for the women,
[00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:22.400]   but there's another story about a guy
[00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:24.360]   who goes to his dad and says,
[00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:26.240]   hey, Dad, I wish you would die.
[00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:28.320]   The reason I wish you'd die is 'cause you got some money
[00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:29.640]   and I'd like to have your money,
[00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:31.920]   and there's lots of things that I'd love to do.
[00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:33.040]   And his dad says, oh, well,
[00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:34.580]   you don't have to wait till I die here.
[00:46:34.580 --> 00:46:36.620]   Why don't you take half your inheritance?
[00:46:36.620 --> 00:46:38.600]   He takes it, he goes to Vegas,
[00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:40.680]   and he blows it on prostitutes.
[00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:45.100]   He blows all the money on prostitutes.
[00:46:45.100 --> 00:46:46.960]   He gets the expensive ones,
[00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:50.040]   has some of the wildest, most crazy best sex
[00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:51.280]   that you can imagine.
[00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:55.640]   And he wakes up from a hangover,
[00:46:55.640 --> 00:46:58.580]   got cocaine hanging out of his nose.
[00:46:58.580 --> 00:47:01.240]   He's hungry, he has no more money.
[00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:03.400]   The tables weren't good to him.
[00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:04.560]   And he says, you know what I'll do?
[00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:06.280]   I'll go back to my dad and I'll ask him
[00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:10.280]   if I can be his slave because his slaves can eat.
[00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:12.960]   And I can't and his slaves can eat,
[00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:15.820]   so I'll go and ask him if I can be his slave.
[00:47:15.820 --> 00:47:18.000]   And it says, so he got up and went to his father,
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:19.680]   but while he was still a long way off,
[00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:23.000]   his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him.
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:26.580]   He ran to his son, threw his arms around him,
[00:47:26.580 --> 00:47:28.200]   and kissed him.
[00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:29.560]   The son said to him, father,
[00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:31.240]   I've sinned against heaven and against you.
[00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:33.540]   I am no longer worthy to be called your son.
[00:47:33.540 --> 00:47:35.320]   But the father said to his servants, quick,
[00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:37.840]   he interrupted him, quick, quick,
[00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:40.000]   bring the best robe and put it on him.
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:42.720]   Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet.
[00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:44.720]   Bring the fattened calf and kill it.
[00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:46.400]   Let's have a feast and celebrate.
[00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:49.000]   For this son of mine was dead and is alive.
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.000]   He was lost and is found.
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:52.520]   So they began to celebrate.
[00:47:52.520 --> 00:47:55.240]   And if you're here and you're ready to be done
[00:47:55.240 --> 00:47:58.040]   with the things that you've done and gotten caught up on,
[00:47:58.040 --> 00:47:59.960]   you're ready to stop, you say, I'm done.
[00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:01.840]   I realize there's pain in my life.
[00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:03.680]   I realize there's hurts and addictions
[00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:05.200]   and things that I can't stop.
[00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:07.440]   And I'm calling that boy like I'm crazy
[00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:10.460]   and I'm stuck on her like I'm crazy, but I'm done.
[00:48:10.460 --> 00:48:12.440]   There's a party.
[00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:14.940]   There's a party.
[00:48:14.940 --> 00:48:17.400]   A party that awaits you,
[00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:19.920]   that God wants to celebrate with you.
[00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:21.680]   He's not like, well, hold on before you,
[00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:24.160]   hey, let's talk about all these things.
[00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:25.760]   So tell me about Vegas.
[00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:28.840]   Give back.
[00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:30.640]   I've been waiting on you.
[00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:32.760]   He saw him from a long way off and ran,
[00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:34.580]   picked up his robe and ran.
[00:48:34.580 --> 00:48:37.400]   That's the God that is pursuing you.
[00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:39.120]   You say, how do I know he's pursuing me?
[00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:41.240]   Where are you right now?
[00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:44.900]   On Tuesday, you're hearing this.
[00:48:44.900 --> 00:48:50.080]   The Bible is clear in summary.
[00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:51.860]   The Bible is clear that sex before marriage
[00:48:51.860 --> 00:48:55.500]   is a sin against God because it is hurtful to his creation
[00:48:55.500 --> 00:48:56.780]   and against his design.
[00:48:57.620 --> 00:48:59.620]   How far is too far is the wrong question.
[00:48:59.620 --> 00:49:03.380]   How holy can you be in your pursuit of a spouse,
[00:49:03.380 --> 00:49:04.620]   in your pursuit of Christ?
[00:49:04.620 --> 00:49:08.420]   And there is forgiveness and restoration available
[00:49:08.420 --> 00:49:10.420]   to anyone who repents.
[00:49:10.420 --> 00:49:13.660]   The old illustration
[00:49:13.660 --> 00:49:17.580]   that is still very appropriate
[00:49:17.580 --> 00:49:19.380]   is just that sex is like a fire.
[00:49:19.380 --> 00:49:22.100]   The fire is powerful.
[00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:25.260]   The fire is helpful.
[00:49:25.260 --> 00:49:29.180]   The fire is one of, or arguably,
[00:49:29.180 --> 00:49:31.980]   the greatest discovery in humanity.
[00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:35.420]   It provides warmth and protection from the cold.
[00:49:35.420 --> 00:49:37.500]   It provides light.
[00:49:37.500 --> 00:49:40.440]   It provides energy.
[00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:43.260]   A fire contained in the right place,
[00:49:43.260 --> 00:49:45.200]   it makes your car go down the road.
[00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:50.900]   But yesterday, I read about a family of four
[00:49:50.900 --> 00:49:54.380]   who all died because in the middle of a night,
[00:49:54.380 --> 00:49:56.460]   a log fell out of their fireplace
[00:49:56.460 --> 00:49:58.700]   and it burned their house down.
[00:49:58.700 --> 00:49:59.700]   And all of them died
[00:49:59.700 --> 00:50:02.820]   because the fire moved outside the place
[00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:05.540]   that it was supposed to be and it became destructive.
[00:50:05.540 --> 00:50:12.740]   Buddy, there's wildfires going on in Colorado,
[00:50:12.740 --> 00:50:15.260]   or has been, and he sent me this picture.
[00:50:15.260 --> 00:50:16.820]   His family's house is right around the corner.
[00:50:16.820 --> 00:50:19.200]   That's a Whole Foods that you can see right there.
[00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:21.260]   And in the background, you see the wildfire.
[00:50:21.260 --> 00:50:22.660]   And I would just commend to you
[00:50:22.660 --> 00:50:24.500]   that this is our culture right now.
[00:50:24.500 --> 00:50:29.620]   Our whole culture is being burnt up on your watch.
[00:50:29.620 --> 00:50:31.800]   And some of you, you've experienced this fire
[00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:33.620]   because you know your house burned down.
[00:50:33.620 --> 00:50:35.760]   Your mom and your dad, they couldn't keep sex
[00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:37.860]   where it was meant to be, and your house was torn apart,
[00:50:37.860 --> 00:50:39.860]   and it was burned down, and that's a part of your childhood.
[00:50:39.860 --> 00:50:41.540]   And you can't tell me that it didn't have
[00:50:41.540 --> 00:50:45.140]   a tremendous impact on who you are and what you've done.
[00:50:45.140 --> 00:50:47.540]   And some of you, you've already burnt your house down
[00:50:47.540 --> 00:50:49.580]   long before you met your spouse.
[00:50:49.580 --> 00:50:51.060]   And not because you've done something
[00:50:51.060 --> 00:50:53.100]   that is unforgivable or that you can't,
[00:50:53.100 --> 00:50:55.320]   or that God can't fix, but because you know
[00:50:55.320 --> 00:50:58.320]   you're gonna leave here and you're not gonna change anything.
[00:50:58.320 --> 00:51:04.980]   50% of sexually active people will contract an STD
[00:51:04.980 --> 00:51:08.800]   before the age of 25, half, one in two.
[00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:11.680]   The CDC estimates that STDs cause infertility
[00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:13.700]   in tens of thousands of women.
[00:51:13.700 --> 00:51:17.800]   I told you, Satan hates creation, procreation.
[00:51:19.340 --> 00:51:21.300]   Statistics from the CDC would suggest
[00:51:21.300 --> 00:51:23.900]   that one in four people in this room tonight,
[00:51:23.900 --> 00:51:25.620]   or in any room listening to this,
[00:51:25.620 --> 00:51:27.580]   have a sexually transmitted disease.
[00:51:27.580 --> 00:51:32.540]   Nearly half of all births in the United States
[00:51:32.540 --> 00:51:33.640]   are to unmarried mothers.
[00:51:33.640 --> 00:51:36.540]   Nearly half of the children born here
[00:51:36.540 --> 00:51:38.220]   are not born into a family.
[00:51:38.220 --> 00:51:46.000]   This is responsible for millions, over a million abortions.
[00:51:47.140 --> 00:51:49.700]   The divorce rate amongst couples
[00:51:49.700 --> 00:51:51.860]   who have been sexually active before marriage
[00:51:51.860 --> 00:51:56.860]   is significantly higher than those who have waited.
[00:51:56.860 --> 00:52:02.180]   And if you could put sex anywhere, where would you put it?
[00:52:02.180 --> 00:52:06.920]   All of these problems would go away
[00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:09.260]   if we just had sex in the context
[00:52:09.260 --> 00:52:10.500]   of what it was created for.
[00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:11.700]   All of them would go away.
[00:52:11.700 --> 00:52:13.580]   The divorce rate among couples who waited
[00:52:13.580 --> 00:52:17.660]   is less than 5%, less than 5%.
[00:52:17.660 --> 00:52:19.820]   From the Journal of Family Psychology,
[00:52:19.820 --> 00:52:22.020]   who studied hundreds of couples who had sex,
[00:52:22.020 --> 00:52:23.660]   those who waited and those who didn't,
[00:52:23.660 --> 00:52:25.100]   they found that couples who waited,
[00:52:25.100 --> 00:52:27.780]   both men and women said they had better communication
[00:52:27.780 --> 00:52:28.820]   than those who didn't wait,
[00:52:28.820 --> 00:52:31.300]   they had better sexual quality than those who didn't wait,
[00:52:31.300 --> 00:52:33.160]   they had better relationship satisfaction
[00:52:33.160 --> 00:52:34.060]   than those who didn't wait,
[00:52:34.060 --> 00:52:35.940]   they had better perceived stability
[00:52:35.940 --> 00:52:37.300]   than those who didn't wait.
[00:52:37.300 --> 00:52:42.580]   So if you are God, if you are creator,
[00:52:43.420 --> 00:52:48.340]   and you could put sex anywhere, where would you put it?
[00:52:48.340 --> 00:52:55.620]   And what he did is he put it in the confines of a covenant
[00:52:55.620 --> 00:53:01.180]   between a man and a woman who say crazy things
[00:53:01.180 --> 00:53:04.020]   to each other, they look each other in the eyes.
[00:53:04.020 --> 00:53:07.260]   And I've been there, I've had a front row seat
[00:53:07.260 --> 00:53:09.640]   dozens of times.
[00:53:11.460 --> 00:53:13.780]   I promise to love you for the rest of my life.
[00:53:13.780 --> 00:53:16.980]   In sickness and health.
[00:53:16.980 --> 00:53:22.420]   For richer or for poorer.
[00:53:22.420 --> 00:53:26.080]   Until death do us part.
[00:53:26.080 --> 00:53:31.420]   May the Lord deal with me, be it ever so severely,
[00:53:31.420 --> 00:53:36.220]   if anything but death separates me from you.
[00:53:36.220 --> 00:53:38.640]   (soft music)
[00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:43.940]   God says that's the place.
[00:53:43.940 --> 00:53:49.780]   He says in First Thessalonians to learn
[00:53:49.780 --> 00:53:53.020]   to control your body in a way that's holy and honorable.
[00:53:53.020 --> 00:53:57.500]   He says learn to, like it's gonna be challenging,
[00:53:57.500 --> 00:53:59.720]   it's something you've gotta learn to.
[00:53:59.720 --> 00:54:02.780]   You're gonna have to apply some effort.
[00:54:02.780 --> 00:54:05.700]   Discipline yourself for godliness.
[00:54:05.700 --> 00:54:08.740]   It's a challenge, you got natural urges.
[00:54:08.740 --> 00:54:12.020]   They wanna take you down the conveyor belt,
[00:54:12.020 --> 00:54:14.280]   the enemy's gonna work with that.
[00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:17.940]   God says I have something better for you.
[00:54:17.940 --> 00:54:20.740]   I'm not trying to rip you off, I'm trying to set you free.
[00:54:20.740 --> 00:54:22.780]   I'm trying to give you life so that you might have it
[00:54:22.780 --> 00:54:23.980]   to the fullest.
[00:54:23.980 --> 00:54:26.880]   Your only problem is that you believed a lie.
[00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:32.300]   I pray tonight that you believe the truth.
[00:54:33.420 --> 00:54:37.820]   If you're not convinced, don't leave.
[00:54:37.820 --> 00:54:39.660]   You read some article somewhere,
[00:54:39.660 --> 00:54:43.020]   your cousin sent you who's a staunch atheist,
[00:54:43.020 --> 00:54:46.580]   come up, we'd love to have the conversation.
[00:54:46.580 --> 00:54:48.020]   We'd love to talk with you.
[00:54:48.020 --> 00:54:49.980]   I challenge you, I challenge you.
[00:54:49.980 --> 00:54:53.340]   If you don't believe, if you're not there yet,
[00:54:53.340 --> 00:54:54.460]   you're not convinced, don't leave.
[00:54:54.460 --> 00:54:55.860]   Let's have a conversation.
[00:54:55.860 --> 00:54:57.200]   Let me pray for you.
[00:54:57.200 --> 00:54:59.620]   Father, thank you for just all of these texts,
[00:54:59.620 --> 00:55:01.700]   these scriptures, these truths
[00:55:01.700 --> 00:55:06.220]   that instruct us in the way of life.
[00:55:06.220 --> 00:55:13.980]   Father, we are the enemy, the accuser, you call him.
[00:55:13.980 --> 00:55:20.100]   He speaks lies and he's after us tonight.
[00:55:20.100 --> 00:55:23.580]   As we worship, would you move our hearts
[00:55:23.580 --> 00:55:25.000]   toward affection for you?
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:29.260]   Would you remind us that there's nothing that we've done
[00:55:29.260 --> 00:55:31.420]   that's going to stop you from loving us?
[00:55:32.060 --> 00:55:35.980]   Pursuing us, chasing us and wooing us.
[00:55:35.980 --> 00:55:39.940]   And Father, would you turn our hearts back to you?
[00:55:39.940 --> 00:55:42.080]   In the name of Jesus, amen.
