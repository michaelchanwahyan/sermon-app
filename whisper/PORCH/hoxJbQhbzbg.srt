00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:25,920
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,880
 Well, what's up, Porch?

3
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,480
 How are we doing tonight?

4
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,960
 Hey, it's so good to see you.

5
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,080
 If this is your first time ever at the Porch,

6
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,320
 thank you for trusting us with your Tuesday night.

7
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,240
 I'm so glad that you joined us.

8
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,880
 I do want to give a special shout out to all the Porch

9
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,360
 Live locations watching tonight.

10
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,000
 Want to say a special hello to Porch Live Fort Worth,

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,960
 and Porch Live Des Moines, Porch Live Boise.

12
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,280
 Thank you for tuning in with us.

13
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,280
 So here's the deal.

14
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,560
 I've got three boys, and I've mentioned them here

15
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,480
 at the Porch before.

16
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,120
 But they are 13, 11, and 5.

17
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:07,600
 Last September, my oldest son Noah turned 13.

18
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,240
 And this was a big deal, because we had just moved to Dallas

19
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,600
 not long before that.

20
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,480
 And so his 13th birthday was kind of a big opportunity

21
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,480
 to invite some new friends over to our house

22
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:24,000
 and for Noah to kind of have a win with some new people.

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,400
 Well, my wife and I, we totally failed our son,

24
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,960
 because we were like, you know what?

25
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,640
 Why don't you have some kids over,

26
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,840
 and we'll get some pizza, and y'all can watch a movie.

27
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,520
 And so our house was full.

28
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:43,600
 I mean, there was a bunch of kids hitting puberty,

29
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,680
 all gathered together.

30
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,240
 And we thought it would be enough to just give them

31
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,400
 pizza and push play on Napoleon Dynamite.

32
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:57,080
 Like 15 minutes into the movie, these kids

33
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,280
 start getting bored.

34
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,760
 And I'm like, oh my gosh, it's social suicide.

35
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,000
 We have failed our son.

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,640
 All of these kids, they're standing up,

37
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,880
 they're moving around, they're going outside.

38
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,240
 They've had enough of Napoleon Dynamite, which

39
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,480
 was super offensive to me.

40
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:18,040
 But anyway, so in the moment, literally, my wife, Kat,

41
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:21,120
 and I, we are in the kitchen like, what do we do?

42
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,040
 Do you know what to do?

43
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,480
 What do we do?

44
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,000
 This is a big moment.

45
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,160
 We have failed our son.

46
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,280
 This is the end.

47
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,480
 Like, he's never going to recover from this.

48
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:38,400
 And then everything changed, because I had an idea.

49
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,240
 I'm going to start giving out money to these kids.

50
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,280
 So that's what I did.

51
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,720
 I reached into my wallet, and I was like, all right,

52
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,560
 who wants to play some games with a chance

53
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,960
 to earn some money?

54
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,440
 And like, every kid was like, yeah, I want some money.

55
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,520
 And so I just pulled out all of the cash

56
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,200
 that we had in the house.

57
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,320
 I was like, we're going to be playing games for cash

58
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,480
 for the rest of the evening, and we're

59
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,840
 going to save this thing.

60
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,080
 Like, that party went to a 10 in no time.

61
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,560
 In the game that I played--

62
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,600
 I'm going to bring Grace.

63
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,800
 Grace, go ahead and come up here.

64
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,640
 This is a game that you and your roommates

65
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,040
 can play later on tonight.

66
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,800
 This is a $100 bill that I want to give Grace an opportunity

67
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,440
 to earn.

68
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,520
 All she needs to do is--

69
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,920
 put your fingers like that, OK?

70
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,280
 I'm going to drop it.

71
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,520
 And when I drop it, all you have to do is catch it.

72
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,360
 Now, I know Grace, and she's super competitive.

73
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,760
 She was a college athlete.

74
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,120
 So I know how badly you want this, right?

75
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,200
 So I just need you to--

76
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,080
 OK.

77
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,480
 That was just-- that was bad.

78
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,400
 OK, bad drop.

79
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:44,900
 Here we go.

80
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,160
 Are you ready, Grace?

81
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,280
 OK, that's fine.

82
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,080
 All right, now are you warmed up yet?

83
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:49,800
 I'm ready.

84
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,880
 OK, she's ready.

85
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,000
 No, you-- OK.

86
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,040
 This is the game.

87
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,920
 All right, are you ready?

88
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,720
 Catch it.

89
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,840
 It's so frustrating, isn't it, Grace?

90
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,240
 You want to try one more time?

91
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:01,880
 One more time.

92
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,400
 You've got it.

93
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:02,960
 I promise.

94
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,000
 You've got this.

95
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,960
 Oh, you were so close.

96
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,960
 Thanks, Grace.

97
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:14,480
 [APPLAUSE]

98
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:19,000
 That game killed with a bunch of 13-year-old boys that night.

99
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,320
 But the reason that I show you that is how many of you

100
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:26,600
 were sitting there like, I bet I could do it?

101
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,520
 It's like natural.

102
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,840
 Everyone's like, you know what?

103
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,720
 I bet I could do it.

104
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,040
 No, if Grace can't do it, I assure you you can't do it.

105
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,320
 Like, she is one of the more competitive people

106
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,280
 I've ever met.

107
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,920
 She would crush you in most things, all right?

108
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,460
 And I don't need to know you to know that she would probably

109
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:44,560
 win, whatever the game is.

110
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,760
 So here's the reality.

111
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:51,200
 Money is a very powerful motivator.

112
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,280
 Like, if I were to say, you have a chance to earn $100,

113
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,200
 some of you would be like, that would double

114
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,800
 how much I have right now.

115
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,640
 Like, that would be incredible.

116
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,800
 But what I saw with these 12-year-old boys,

117
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,940
 13-year-old boys, is when money was introduced into the mix,

118
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,880
 it's a very powerful motivator.

119
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,280
 But then what happened was this group

120
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,160
 of 12-year-olds, 13-year-olds, they all lined up

121
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,800
 like they got in a line.

122
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,320
 And one after another tried to grab the money,

123
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,800
 and one after the other failed.

124
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,040
 But the amazing thing was that everyone in line was like,

125
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,200
 you know what, I bet I can get it.

126
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,400
 It was like, the guy that went before him, yeah,

127
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:37,800
 he's not coordinated enough, but I believe that I will get it.

128
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,480
 And no one could get it.

129
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:44,040
 And the reality is that when that bill drops,

130
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,600
 and you squeeze your fingers, and you know

131
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,560
 that you've missed it, that feeling of frustration

132
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,520
 that it was right there, but you don't have it,

133
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,300
 that is what King Solomon is getting at

134
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,840
 in the book of Ecclesiastes.

135
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,960
 All throughout the book of Ecclesiastes,

136
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,620
 which we have been journeying through

137
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:08,680
 for the last several weeks, he uses this word,

138
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:12,240
 in the Hebrew is the word hevel,

139
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,340
 which in the English is translated as vanity.

140
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:19,640
 What you need to know about hevel is it's the idea,

141
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,160
 if you're talking about a physical substance,

142
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,080
 it's the idea of a mist or a vapor.

143
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,800
 But when you're talking about something metaphorical,

144
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:32,200
 you're talking about something meaningless or empty.

145
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:36,700
 It is the feeling you feel when the bill drops,

146
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,040
 and you barely miss it.

147
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:42,080
 That squeeze of the hand with nothing to show for it,

148
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,000
 it's frustratingly empty.

149
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,800
 So we've been looking at Ecclesiastes,

150
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,240
 and we've been learning from King Solomon,

151
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,680
 and all throughout the book,

152
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,320
 King Solomon is addressing different things,

153
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,720
 and he's just pointing to various things in life,

154
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,120
 and he's like, yeah, that's hevel.

155
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,640
 That's frustratingly empty.

156
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:07,840
 And now we get to Ecclesiastes chapter five and six,

157
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,520
 and King Solomon talks about money.

158
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,920
 And the interesting thing is that money

159
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,840
 is a major motivator.

160
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:21,420
 It is, like people in this room, I guarantee you,

161
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:24,160
 every person needs to hear a message about money.

162
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,000
 Why?

163
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,240
 Because money is applicable to all of us.

164
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:32,120
 Everyone needs money to operate in this life.

165
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,760
 Like money determines whether you will eat or not.

166
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:40,240
 Money determines where you live and where you don't live.

167
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,480
 Money is the reason that some of you posted

168
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,800
 that perfect picture from Europe this summer.

169
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,040
 Money is the reason that many of you were bitter

170
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,080
 at the people posting the perfect pic

171
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,360
 from Europe this summer.

172
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,800
 It's a powerful motivator.

173
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,560
 And what Solomon is going to get at

174
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,560
 is when you look to money to not just be important,

175
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,480
 but ultimate, when you make money

176
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,360
 the source of your fulfillment

177
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,560
 and the source of your satisfaction,

178
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,880
 it's gonna be like that bill dropping

179
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,520
 and you squeezing your fist and then opening it

180
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,960
 to see that there is nothing there.

181
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,200
 Even if you, in a sense, grab hold of the money

182
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:26,000
 and you become extremely successful in this world,

183
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,340
 you need to know that in the end,

184
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:32,820
 if money is ultimate to you,

185
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:38,080
 in the end, it will be frustratingly empty.

186
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,540
 So if you have a Bible, I wanna invite you

187
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:44,540
 to turn tonight to Ecclesiastes chapter five.

188
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,340
 Ecclesiastes chapter five.

189
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:48,040
 Now, as you're turning there,

190
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,780
 I do think that it's important

191
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:53,260
 to just make some caveats about money.

192
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:56,120
 Like it's important for us to just state from the beginning

193
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,300
 money is morally neutral.

194
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,000
 It's a morally neutral thing.

195
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,900
 The Bible doesn't say that money is the root of all evil.

196
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:10,020
 The Bible says that the love of money

197
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:12,500
 is the root of all evil.

198
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,820
 So money itself is morally neutral.

199
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,020
 It's what you do with money

200
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:22,020
 that can actually become something good or bad.

201
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:25,740
 But money is relevant to every person in this room.

202
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,620
 And money was really important to Jesus.

203
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:33,500
 Jesus talks about money in 16 of his parables,

204
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,900
 which is about a third of all of his parables.

205
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,200
 He talked about money.

206
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:42,860
 Jesus talks about money more in the New Testament

207
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:45,520
 than he talked about heaven and hell combined.

208
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:49,660
 The Bible talks about,

209
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:53,900
 has about 500 verses on prayer.

210
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:57,220
 The Bible has less than 500 verses on faith.

211
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:59,480
 And there are over 2000 verses

212
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,440
 dealing with money and possessions.

213
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:06,980
 Money is referenced in one out of each 10 verses

214
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:11,140
 in the Gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.

215
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:13,500
 Money was very important to Jesus.

216
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,860
 Jesus goes so far as to say that

217
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:18,800
 wherever your treasure is,

218
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,740
 that's where your heart will be also.

219
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,980
 What does he mean when he says that?

220
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,940
 All he's basically saying is,

221
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:27,100
 hey, there is a collision point

222
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:30,640
 between what your affections are stirred for

223
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,220
 and where your passion is,

224
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:34,500
 and where your money is.

225
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,980
 Like your affection, your passion, and your money,

226
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:40,620
 they're gonna go in the same direction.

227
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,780
 That's how important money is.

228
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:46,140
 So the question that you need to answer tonight

229
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:48,460
 is will you have your money,

230
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,540
 or will your money have you?

231
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:53,640
 What I'm really getting at is,

232
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:57,480
 is will you operate like money is a gift,

233
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,740
 or is it a God?

234
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,400
 'Cause that will determine

235
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,620
 whether you're able to enjoy money,

236
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:09,380
 or whether money will be a source of great stress

237
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:13,620
 and anxiety and fear and a need for control.

238
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:16,880
 So that's where we're going tonight.

239
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,220
 Remember, we're learning from King Solomon.

240
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:23,380
 Okay, Solomon is most likely the wisest man

241
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,220
 to ever walk on the earth besides Jesus,

242
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:27,280
 and he was probably the richest man

243
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,320
 to ever walk on the planet.

244
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,680
 Okay, people estimate that his yearly income

245
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,820
 was over $1 billion.

246
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:40,820
 He saw nine zeros when he checked his bank account balance.

247
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:43,040
 He never had to keep a budget.

248
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,340
 He never had debt.

249
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:47,200
 He never had to eat at home to save money.

250
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,660
 He never had to say no to himself.

251
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:52,500
 If he wanted something, he bought it.

252
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:56,860
 Money was in Solomon's wheelhouse.

253
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:59,540
 So if he has something to say about it,

254
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:02,900
 it'd be worth us listening to him on it.

255
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:06,260
 And here's what he says in Ecclesiastes 5, verse 10.

256
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,520
 This is his thesis on money.

257
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,500
 Don't miss it.

258
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,580
 Here's what he says.

259
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:14,100
 He says, "He who loves money

260
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,440
 "will not be satisfied with money,

261
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,180
 "nor he who loves wealth with his income.

262
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:22,300
 "This also is vanity."

263
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,740
 Look at what he's saying when he says,

264
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,820
 "He who loves money."

265
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:28,060
 The idea of that word love there,

266
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:33,060
 it's the idea of a cultivated appetite.

267
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:36,380
 So what he's saying is if the appetite

268
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:40,000
 of your heart and soul is cultivated for money,

269
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,400
 meaning if money becomes the thing

270
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:46,780
 that your soul needs most in order to be fulfilled,

271
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:47,860
 do you hear what he's saying?

272
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:49,980
 He's saying, "He who loves money,

273
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:52,280
 "he whose soul craves money,

274
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:55,420
 "he who longs to be satisfied with money,

275
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:59,600
 "he that looks and says, 'The thing that I need most

276
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,180
 "'in order to be happy in this life is more money,'"

277
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:06,760
 he says, "that person will not be satisfied."

278
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:11,020
 You are looking to money to do what it cannot do.

279
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:13,300
 Won't be satisfied.

280
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:17,980
 "He who loves wealth with his income,"

281
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:20,460
 he says, "this also is vanity, this also is hevel.

282
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:23,900
 "It will be frustratingly empty."

283
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:27,540
 Because even if you get your hands around money,

284
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:31,720
 in the end, in your hopes to feel full,

285
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:35,480
 you are still going to feel empty.

286
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:39,660
 Money can do a lot of things.

287
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,620
 It can, it can do a lot of things.

288
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:46,580
 Like it can make you feel temporarily secure.

289
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,260
 Like if you look at your bank account

290
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:52,180
 and there's money in it, you might feel secure.

291
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:55,220
 Okay, some of you ladies right now are like,

292
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:59,140
 one of the hundred reasons I don't need a man right now

293
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,900
 is because I'm making my own money.

294
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,260
 I don't need the whole thing of,

295
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,780
 I need a guy to provide for me.

296
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,300
 No, you're providing for yourself,

297
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,380
 so you feel really secure in that.

298
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,780
 Some of you guys are like,

299
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,700
 if those girls could raise their hand real quick,

300
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,280
 that would be super helpful.

301
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:18,840
 But money can make you feel temporarily secure.

302
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:23,260
 Money can make you feel temporarily significant.

303
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:27,720
 Like if you can afford to pick up the tab at happy hour,

304
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,880
 or you've got all the Voriath leisure,

305
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:35,040
 or you're living in that bougie apartment complex,

306
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,960
 I don't know what it is for you.

307
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,600
 If you've got the Tesla,

308
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,960
 like if you have what others don't

309
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,960
 and it makes you feel great about you,

310
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:47,200
 money can have that effect.

311
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,700
 It can make you feel temporarily significant.

312
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:54,280
 Money can temporarily relieve you from pain.

313
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,360
 Why?

314
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,840
 Because you go out and spend money

315
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,040
 that you don't even have,

316
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,580
 but you know what, it's a distraction,

317
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,940
 and it can numb some pain.

318
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,680
 But did you notice the recurring word that I used,

319
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,420
 the word temporarily?

320
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:11,500
 It can do a lot of things temporarily,

321
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,680
 but it cannot do anything lasting.

322
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:17,700
 You either have to keep accumulating more,

323
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,740
 or you have to keep spending more

324
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:22,920
 in order to be satisfied with money.

325
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,360
 It can't satisfy the deepest longings of your soul.

326
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,200
 Some of you are like, well, let me just at least try.

327
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,720
 And if that's you, you're like that 12 year old boy

328
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,320
 waiting in line, like, I can get it though.

329
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,560
 It'll be different for me.

330
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,540
 No, it won't.

331
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:42,220
 How many unhappy rich people

332
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:44,240
 do I need to put in front of you?

333
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:49,400
 Before you say, it wouldn't be any different for me.

334
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:54,460
 John D. Rockefeller was considered one of,

335
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:59,460
 if not the most wealthy American of all time.

336
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:02,060
 And y'all know the story.

337
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:05,380
 I mean, the story goes that someone asked him,

338
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,500
 how much money is enough?

339
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,640
 And what did he reply?

340
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,080
 Just a little bit more.

341
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:13,120
 How much money is enough?

342
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,920
 To a guy who has more money

343
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,060
 than any of us will probably ever see?

344
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,980
 Just a little bit more.

345
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,060
 See, the more money you have, the more you want.

346
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:25,500
 And the more you spend, the more you wanna spend.

347
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:29,020
 And so that's Solomon's point.

348
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:31,260
 That's why he says, he who loves money

349
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,540
 will not be satisfied.

350
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,500
 The more you have, the more you want.

351
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,540
 The more you spend, the more you wanna spend.

352
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:39,860
 What is Solomon's thesis?

353
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:44,860
 His thesis is this, money is a terrible God.

354
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:48,940
 It's a terrible God.

355
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:53,920
 When I say our tendency is going to make money a God,

356
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,400
 all I'm saying is our tendency is going to be

357
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:00,040
 to look to money to do what only God can do,

358
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:03,760
 which is satisfy the deepest longings of our souls.

359
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,120
 If you're here tonight and you're thinking,

360
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,520
 like one of the questions that have come up recently,

361
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,720
 like Cat and I will ask each other on date night,

362
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,240
 if you got a million dollars right now,

363
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,060
 what would be the first thing you'd buy?

364
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,400
 If you wanna know my answer,

365
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,700
 it'd be a top of the line,

366
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,780
 super aeronautique, wakeboard boat.

367
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,160
 If you wanna buy it for me,

368
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,320
 I won't have to get that million dollars.

369
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,820
 But anyway, different story.

370
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:28,960
 We ask that question to each other just for fun.

371
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,640
 Because the reality is, is if someone gave us a million

372
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,780
 dollars, it wouldn't solve our problems.

373
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,200
 If I got that wakeboard boat,

374
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,000
 it wouldn't solve my problems.

375
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,700
 It wouldn't satisfy my soul.

376
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,320
 I would get that boat and I'd be like, yeah,

377
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:44,280
 but it'd also be really nice to get a new car.

378
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,360
 And you know what?

379
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,340
 Now that we have the money,

380
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:48,960
 I think I kind of feel like we need a bigger house.

381
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,800
 And now that we have a bigger house,

382
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,760
 it feels like we should put in a pool.

383
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,480
 And now that we have a pool, you know what?

384
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,760
 But we don't have a covered path.

385
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,820
 And it's just like one thing after the other.

386
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,320
 The more you have, the more you want.

387
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,560
 The more you spend, the more you wanna spend.

388
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,760
 But if I were to say to you,

389
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,200
 if someone were to give you a million dollars

390
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:10,080
 and some of y'all just like, you just feel instant peace.

391
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,520
 It's like, is that an option?

392
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,240
 It's just instant peace.

393
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,640
 Like it's the answer.

394
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,580
 It's the answer for your soul.

395
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:22,040
 And that's the wrong answer.

396
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:26,600
 Only Jesus can do what you're looking for.

397
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,320
 So that's his thesis.

398
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,380
 Money is a terrible God.

399
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:33,520
 And then the rest of the passage is just

400
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:38,140
 Solomon explaining what makes money a terrible God.

401
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:42,100
 So look at what the first reason is

402
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:46,220
 that money is a terrible God because it has side effects.

403
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,680
 It has side effects.

404
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:52,120
 You know, those commercials that come on TV and I get it.

405
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:55,320
 No one watches live TV for the most part.

406
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,360
 But when you do watch live TV,

407
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,000
 you know those medicine commercials where people are like,

408
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,120
 like there's really inspirational music

409
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,520
 and people are like running with their dog

410
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,020
 or like having a barbecue with people

411
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:11,240
 and like giving their dog a noogie

412
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:15,160
 or like they're sitting on a beach in a bathtub

413
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,840
 next to a significant other.

414
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,520
 And you're like, where'd those bathtubs come from?

415
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,680
 Like, did you bring those?

416
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,960
 Did you just like find them?

417
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,820
 It's like, I know what's a good idea.

418
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:27,600
 Let's get into these random public bathtubs.

419
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,420
 I don't know what I'm talking about right now,

420
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:32,620
 but you know, those medicine commercials

421
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,840
 where at the end there's that soft, soothing voice

422
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,600
 that comes on to tell you the side effects.

423
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,600
 It's like, talk to your doctor before trying this medicine.

424
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:45,440
 Taking this medicine can cause nausea, diarrhea, vomiting,

425
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,920
 demon possession, or even death.

426
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:52,440
 It's like, wow, I should probably still take it.

427
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:58,720
 Like, I just want to be the soft, soothing voice

428
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,420
 that just speaks in, it's like, you just need to know.

429
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:06,440
 Money, not money, but the love of money

430
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:10,560
 can have serious side effects.

431
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,120
 Money is a terrible God.

432
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,960
 It has side effects.

433
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,360
 And Solomon says, you want to know

434
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,540
 what the first side effect is of loving money?

435
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:24,460
 Is it increases friends.

436
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:29,840
 Having more money, it gets you more friends.

437
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,200
 Look at what he says in verse 11.

438
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,080
 He says, when goods increase,

439
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,280
 meaning when you have more money,

440
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:39,320
 they increase who eat them.

441
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,840
 And what advantage has their owner

442
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,480
 but to see them with his eyes?

443
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,320
 You know what he's saying?

444
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:46,080
 He's like, look, when you get more money,

445
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,440
 it's going to be interesting.

446
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,560
 You're going to naturally have more friends.

447
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,040
 Why?

448
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:54,100
 Because people are going to begin to see you for your money.

449
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:57,540
 And people are going to want to be around you

450
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:00,880
 because they're going to want something from you.

451
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,880
 One source said that by the late 1880s,

452
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:09,320
 John D. Rockefeller was receiving thousands of letters

453
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:12,520
 a week asking for charitable donations.

454
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:17,160
 One historian said that he was stalked, badgered, harassed,

455
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,600
 and followed wherever he went.

456
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,680
 He couldn't walk down the aisle at church

457
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,640
 without people asking for some money.

458
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:27,920
 Bernie Kosar, who was a quarterback

459
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:31,400
 for the Cleveland Browns decades ago,

460
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,320
 he made millions playing in the NFL.

461
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,440
 And then he was in a 30 for 30 episode on ESPN.

462
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,520
 He had to declare bankruptcy.

463
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,240
 But one of the things that came out

464
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,840
 about this quarterback who had made millions in the NFL

465
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,040
 is at one point he was paying

466
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:52,920
 60 different cell phone plans.

467
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:53,760
 60!

468
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,080
 60 different cell phone plans.

469
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:57,920
 Why?

470
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,320
 The more money you have, the more friends you get.

471
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:06,280
 I mean, think about the old sage, Kanye West.

472
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:11,900
 And his classic song, "Gold Digger."

473
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:17,300
 There's a lot of wisdom.

474
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:21,280
 He talks about having to take his girls,

475
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,460
 four kids, to showbiz pizza.

476
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:24,800
 And what does he say?

477
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,560
 He says, "Okay, get your kids.

478
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:30,240
 "And then they've got their friends.

479
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,820
 "I pulled up in the bins, they all got up in.

480
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:35,600
 "We all went to den.

481
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:40,000
 "And then I had to pay."

482
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,420
 What's his point?

483
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:44,680
 The more money you have, the more friends you get.

484
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:49,760
 Somebody like, "Did he really just quote 'Gold Digger'?"

485
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:54,020
 Send me the email, that's fine, that's fine.

486
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:57,500
 (audience laughing)

487
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,900
 I mean, I wouldn't be surprised

488
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:02,820
 if some of my wealthier friends get asked weekly

489
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:05,500
 to consider investing in a new business venture

490
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,900
 or to support the work of a non-profit.

491
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:08,740
 Why?

492
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,500
 Because people see them for their money.

493
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,300
 The more money you have, the more friends you will have.

494
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,700
 People will see you for your money.

495
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,020
 And here's the deal.

496
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:20,780
 That's just a part of reality.

497
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:24,040
 That doesn't mean that you don't go out and make money.

498
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,380
 But here's the issue.

499
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:29,240
 When money is your God,

500
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:34,180
 and you sniff out that anyone is seeing you for your money,

501
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,320
 do you know what's gonna happen?

502
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,900
 You're gonna get bitter, you're gonna get angry,

503
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,980
 you're gonna withdraw from people,

504
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:42,860
 you're gonna see everyone through a skeptical eye,

505
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:46,560
 and you might even give less because you don't trust anyone.

506
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:53,500
 The second side effect, in addition to increasing

507
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:57,060
 your friends, is money increases complexity.

508
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,180
 Look at what Solomon says in verse 12.

509
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:03,300
 He says, "Sweet is the sleep of a laborer,

510
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,060
 "whether he eats little or much,

511
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:09,620
 "but the full stomach of the rich will not let him sleep."

512
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:10,480
 Do you hear what he's saying?

513
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,120
 He's saying money doesn't just buy you what you want

514
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,200
 and empower you to take the most elaborate

515
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,100
 and extravagant vacations.

516
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:21,660
 It also increases complexity and responsibility.

517
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:25,420
 So Solomon contrasts a really rich guy

518
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:28,740
 who has a lot of stuff with a day laborer

519
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:31,060
 who just has enough to get by, and what's his point?

520
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:34,020
 He's like, "The guy who just has enough to get by,

521
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,900
 "like he wakes up, he goes to work,

522
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:38,060
 "he makes enough money to eat,

523
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:39,600
 "and then he goes to sleep and wakes up

524
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,100
 "and does the same thing over again,

525
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,820
 "that guy sleeps really peacefully at night

526
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:47,540
 "because there's nothing to lay awake and think about."

527
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:48,740
 But the more money you have,

528
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:51,800
 the more complexity that is introduced into your life.

529
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:56,660
 The bigger the house, the more there is to clean.

530
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:59,680
 Like it's nice to have that beautiful landscape,

531
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,860
 but somebody's gotta keep it up.

532
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:04,920
 It's amazing to have the lake house or the ranch house,

533
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,540
 but someone has to manage those properties.

534
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:10,660
 And you're like, "Well, I'll just pay someone to do that."

535
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,480
 Yeah, but you gotta find the right people to do it,

536
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,100
 and then you have to make sure that they're actually

537
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,500
 doing a good job at it.

538
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:18,260
 Don't hear me saying, "Don't be successful,"

539
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:20,460
 or "Don't buy the ranch house," go buy it,

540
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:23,060
 and then let the porch team use it for a staff retreat.

541
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:24,420
 We would love to do that.

542
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:29,980
 My point is that it just brings more complexity.

543
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:33,260
 I was talking to a friend, and his parents built

544
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:37,500
 this massive house on a peninsula in Lake LBJ

545
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,560
 outside of Austin, and he was like,

546
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:44,560
 "This house has eight different air conditioning units

547
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:49,640
 "and 100 different sprinkler heads.

548
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:53,560
 "Can you imagine 100 sprinkler heads?"

549
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,800
 Like there's a leak in the yard, good luck.

550
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:59,940
 Just introduces complexity.

551
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:06,180
 So there's more of a temptation to lay awake at night,

552
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:08,980
 just thinking about everything that you're having to manage

553
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,340
 and what isn't working right,

554
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:12,100
 and who's gonna take care of that.

555
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:18,860
 And so sometimes you can't enjoy yourself.

556
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:21,940
 If money is your God, you won't be able to enjoy yourself

557
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:25,580
 because you have to control all your stuff,

558
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:27,420
 and you won't be able to watch other people

559
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,700
 enjoy your stuff for fear of them breaking it

560
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:30,660
 or ruining it.

561
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:39,340
 Next, money is a terrible God because it can be lost.

562
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:44,100
 So if you're tracking, Solomon's thesis

563
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,820
 is money is a terrible God.

564
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:47,020
 So he starts out and just says,

565
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:48,220
 "Look, money is a terrible God

566
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:50,340
 "because it has terrible side effects.

567
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:53,580
 "It increases your friends and it increases complexity."

568
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:55,860
 Now he's making the point money is a terrible God

569
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:58,580
 because it can be lost.

570
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:01,520
 There's no guarantee that you will always have it.

571
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,860
 So look at the story he tells in verse 13.

572
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:08,220
 He says, "There's a grievous evil

573
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:09,600
 "that I've seen under the sun.

574
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:13,700
 "Riches were kept by their owner to his hurt,

575
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:17,880
 "and those riches were lost in a bad venture.

576
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:21,860
 "And he and his father, and he is a father of a son,

577
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:24,320
 "but he has nothing in his hand.

578
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,920
 "As he came from his mother's womb, he shall go again,

579
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:30,220
 "naked as he came, and shall take nothing for his toil

580
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:32,420
 "that he may carry away in his hand.

581
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:34,440
 "This also is a grievous evil

582
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:37,220
 "that just as he came, so shall he go.

583
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:41,320
 "And what gain is there to him who toils for the wind?

584
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,680
 "Moreover, all his days he eats in darkness

585
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,940
 "and much vexation and sickness and anger."

586
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,680
 Do you see the picture he's painting?

587
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,560
 He's like, "Look, here's a guy who had a bunch of money

588
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,420
 "and then things went really bad.

589
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:54,480
 "There was a bad venture and he lost everything,

590
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,860
 "but he's got a kid and he's got nothing now

591
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:58,420
 "to take care of his kid with."

592
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:02,860
 So he's gonna die in a similar way that he was born.

593
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:04,320
 He brought nothing into this world,

594
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,420
 he gets to take nothing out of it.

595
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,540
 He was empty-handed on the day of his birth,

596
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:11,140
 he's gonna be empty-handed on the day of his death.

597
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:14,300
 And because he's lost everything,

598
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:16,080
 because money has been his God,

599
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,980
 he's gonna live his life in darkness

600
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:22,920
 and in much vexation and sickness and anger.

601
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:29,820
 So this is just a picture of guy who's lost everything.

602
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:31,740
 This is why money is a terrible God.

603
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:34,820
 There's no guarantee that you will always have it.

604
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:39,860
 But when money is your God, that can wreck you.

605
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:44,860
 I mean, isn't that the plot line to that TV show, "S Creek"?

606
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:46,800
 I'm not gonna say the first name,

607
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,800
 even though it's just a person's last name,

608
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,660
 but some of y'all will email me about it still.

609
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:52,100
 But what's the plot of that show?

610
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:54,860
 I mean, you've got Alexis, you've got David,

611
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:58,480
 you've got Myra, Moira, and Johnny.

612
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,660
 They've lost everything,

613
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:01,980
 and it's like their lives are over

614
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,860
 because they've lost all their money.

615
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:07,060
 And that might be you.

616
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:09,900
 If money is your God and you lose it all,

617
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:13,900
 it can be devastating.

618
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:18,900
 I was reading this article that was written

619
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:22,740
 by a guy who went from riches to rags.

620
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:24,640
 So when I was growing up, when I was a kid,

621
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:28,980
 there was this TV show on, I didn't really watch the show,

622
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:31,580
 but it was a famous TV show.

623
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:32,660
 It was called "Roseanne."

624
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:34,220
 I'm not telling you to go watch it.

625
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:36,620
 Like, I didn't watch it, but it was a very,

626
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:40,500
 it was a famous show for probably about 10 seasons.

627
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,260
 And one of the writers for the show

628
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:45,620
 wrote an article about his life.

629
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:48,380
 And he basically is a modern-day version

630
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:51,460
 of what Solomon just talked about.

631
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:54,620
 He's a guy who lost everything

632
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:58,520
 and went from a cushy life to being homeless.

633
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,980
 Here's what he writes in the article.

634
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:02,140
 He says, "On Christmas Day, 2001,

635
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:07,140
 I sat down at my Yamaha G2 Grand Piano.

636
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:09,940
 It was late afternoon,

637
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:12,560
 and the warm orange light of the fading day

638
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:16,140
 poured into my five-bedroom house,

639
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:19,620
 paid for by my $300,000 a year income

640
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:24,620
 as a Hollywood comedy writer in San Marino, California,

641
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:26,660
 a wealthy suburb of Los Angeles.

642
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:29,100
 My wife Marina was cooking dinner for me

643
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,700
 and our eight children,

644
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,820
 and it was as happy a Christmas afternoon

645
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:35,120
 as I would ever have.

646
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:38,500
 On Christmas morning, 2008,

647
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:42,780
 I woke up on the floor of the 1997 Chrysler minivan

648
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:47,180
 I lived in, parked behind the Kinko's

649
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:50,580
 just two miles from my old house in San Marino.

650
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:53,440
 It was raining, and I was cold,

651
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,940
 even though I had slept in three layers of clothes."

652
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:01,340
 This is a guy who graduated from college with honors.

653
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:06,300
 He became a successful writer and made tons of money.

654
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,260
 But the TV show that he was working for

655
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:10,120
 is taking a toll on his family.

656
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:15,820
 So he had saved up, he had about $500,000 in savings,

657
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:18,220
 and so he stepped away from the show

658
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:20,100
 just to devote more time to his family,

659
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,720
 and he took about two years off from work

660
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,060
 to invest in his family.

661
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:24,740
 And after those two years,

662
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:26,360
 he tried to go back and get a job,

663
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,780
 and he couldn't land a job.

664
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:30,360
 And he began looking and searching

665
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,380
 and applying and applying.

666
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:33,140
 This guy didn't become an alcoholic,

667
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:34,540
 he didn't become a drug addict,

668
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:37,340
 this was simply a guy who couldn't get a job,

669
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:39,620
 and then the market crashed in 2008.

670
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:41,120
 He lost everything,

671
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:44,360
 and he ended up homeless.

672
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:48,700
 And the reality is,

673
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:54,300
 the reality is, is here is a guy

674
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:58,960
 who was trying to do what was right,

675
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,760
 and yet he still lost everything.

676
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:05,980
 And it's just a good reminder that money can be lost.

677
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:07,100
 That's why it's a terrible guy,

678
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,780
 because there's no guarantee

679
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:11,220
 that you will always have it.

680
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,220
 But if money becomes your God,

681
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,460
 and then you lose all of it,

682
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:16,900
 you're gonna go through life angry and bitter,

683
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:19,100
 and you're gonna play the victim.

684
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:21,940
 You're gonna go through this life wishing

685
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:25,900
 that you could go back to the glory days of your past.

686
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:29,140
 What I appreciated about this guy in the story

687
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:32,740
 is his life, like now, the money he makes,

688
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:35,700
 it's from contract jobs he finds on Craigslist.

689
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:39,220
 Like, there hasn't been this major recovery story

690
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:40,820
 where his riches have been restored,

691
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:44,700
 but here's a guy, there was no bitterness in the article.

692
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,780
 He didn't blame anyone.

693
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:48,860
 He's content in life,

694
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:52,660
 and survives off of what he makes off of Craigslist,

695
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,460
 because he has realized that money

696
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:56,920
 isn't the thing that can satisfy.

697
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:59,140
 And so I just tell you that,

698
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:01,420
 and some of y'all are like, you know what?

699
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:03,940
 You're in your early to mid-20s,

700
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,100
 or maybe you're late 20s, early 30s,

701
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:11,100
 and you just haven't lived enough life to reach this point.

702
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:14,700
 But the reason we're talking about it now

703
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:20,300
 is who you are now, and how you view money now

704
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:23,380
 will determine how you respond later.

705
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:25,540
 And so what I'm trying to do

706
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:29,060
 is I'm just trying to help you believe from now

707
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,860
 that money is a terrible God,

708
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:33,820
 because if you believe from now that money is a terrible God,

709
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:36,660
 and you never look to money to be your God,

710
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:39,900
 then you can have it, or you can lose it,

711
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:42,060
 and your life will not depend on it.

712
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:45,180
 And so what would it look like

713
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:49,340
 for there to be 2,000 young adults who leave tonight

714
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:50,780
 saying, look, money is important,

715
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:52,380
 we have to have money to live,

716
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:58,320
 and yet I won't live for money.

717
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,420
 There's a major difference.

718
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:07,420
 What if we were people who embodied Hebrews 13 five?

719
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:12,820
 Hebrews 13 five says,

720
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:16,180
 "Keep your life free from the love of money,

721
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:19,000
 "and be content with what you have,

722
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,080
 "for he," that's God, has said,

723
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:24,860
 "I will never leave you nor forsake you."

724
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,140
 The good thing about God

725
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:27,540
 is that you might lose all your money,

726
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:30,860
 but God will never lose you, never.

727
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:33,020
 (silence)

728
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:37,060
 The next reason Solomon gives

729
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:38,740
 for money being a terrible God is this,

730
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:39,740
 money is a terrible God

731
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:43,900
 because its intended purpose is to be a gift.

732
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,260
 That's a really long point,

733
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:50,140
 but I needed all those words in it to make sense.

734
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:51,200
 Money is a terrible God

735
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:55,100
 because its intended purpose is to be a gift.

736
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:58,460
 Money can't do what you want it to do,

737
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:00,860
 which is satisfy the deepest longings of your soul.

738
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:01,700
 Why?

739
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,700
 Because money has been created

740
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:05,900
 simply to be a gift from God,

741
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:09,200
 but it was never made to be your God.

742
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,380
 That's why Solomon says in verse 18,

743
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:15,960
 he says, "Behold what I've seen to be good."

744
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,420
 Now watch this,

745
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:18,640
 because up until this point,

746
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,420
 he's talked really negatively about money,

747
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:24,340
 but now he spins it and talks positively.

748
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:26,860
 He says, "Behold what I've seen to be good

749
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:30,740
 "and fitting is to eat and drink and find enjoyment

750
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:34,600
 "in all the toil with which one toils under the sun,

751
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,580
 "the few days of his life that God has given to him,

752
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:40,080
 "for this is his lot.

753
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,440
 "Everyone also to whom God has given wealth

754
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,260
 "and possessions and power,

755
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:48,600
 "to enjoy them, to accept his lot and rejoice in his toil.

756
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,780
 "This is the gift of God."

757
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,060
 Do you see what Solomon is saying?

758
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:54,080
 He's saying, look,

759
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:57,140
 hey, first off, Solomon is just saying,

760
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:59,820
 look, all of life is a gift from God.

761
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:01,660
 Like the fact that you have breath in your lungs,

762
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:04,360
 that is a gift from your maker.

763
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:08,260
 And everything you have in your life

764
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:10,400
 has been given to you by God.

765
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,380
 Any money that you make,

766
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,260
 you might be like, no, it's because I went out

767
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,260
 and I worked really hard,

768
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:20,300
 but how were you able to work hard?

769
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:23,380
 It's because God gave you a brain.

770
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:25,220
 You're like, no, but I'm super creative

771
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,740
 and I'm a strategic thinker.

772
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:28,940
 How did you get that way?

773
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:30,180
 God gave you that brain.

774
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,660
 You're like, no, I got it from my parents.

775
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:34,300
 Okay, well, where did they get it from?

776
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:37,620
 Just trace it back as far as you wanna go.

777
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:40,360
 And at some point, it's gonna start with God.

778
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:44,520
 Everything you have is a gift from God.

779
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,820
 So what is his point?

780
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:48,220
 His point is enjoy it.

781
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:51,480
 Glorify God by enjoying the life that you've been given,

782
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,880
 the job that you have,

783
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,740
 enjoy doing it to the glory of God.

784
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:59,960
 The money that you have, enjoy the money that you have.

785
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:03,080
 Go eat a nice meal sometimes.

786
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,960
 If you have it, go on a nice vacation.

787
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:08,360
 And at the same time, tap into the joy

788
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,960
 of blessing other people with your money.

789
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:14,480
 Experience the joy of giving your money away

790
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:18,040
 to God's purposes being fleshed out throughout the earth.

791
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:22,460
 But enjoy what God has given to you.

792
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:24,280
 Let it be a gift.

793
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,200
 That's why in verse 20, Solomon says,

794
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,680
 "For he will not much remember the days of his life,"

795
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:32,600
 because God keeps him occupied with joy in his heart.

796
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,200
 He's like, look, if you get to a place

797
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:38,480
 where money is what it is, it's simply a gift,

798
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,000
 then you know what?

799
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,600
 You can just go from day to day,

800
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,000
 and you don't have to sit there

801
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,860
 and think really hard about today,

802
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:52,720
 because you're just filled with joy.

803
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,160
 You're just moving along,

804
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:57,960
 enjoying God and all he has given to you,

805
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:00,260
 and you can be satisfied today.

806
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:03,280
 And so let me just tell you,

807
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,060
 if you want to experience the joy in your heart

808
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:08,380
 that Solomon is talking about,

809
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:10,180
 then what does it look like for young adults

810
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:12,400
 in Dallas, Texas to do something with this?

811
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,380
 Well, I would encourage you,

812
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:16,740
 thank God for what you do have

813
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:19,560
 instead of complaining about what you don't have.

814
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:24,740
 Okay, stop waiting to get more stuff

815
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:27,960
 to finally be satisfied in Jesus,

816
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:32,360
 because we don't seek Jesus for Jesus's stuff.

817
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:35,660
 We seek Jesus for Jesus,

818
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:38,240
 and Jesus is far more satisfying

819
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:41,920
 than anything that this world could offer.

820
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,400
 So thank God for what you do have

821
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,380
 instead of complaining about what you don't have.

822
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:47,440
 And then number two,

823
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,760
 view yourself as a steward instead of as an owner.

824
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:54,400
 View everything that you have as a gift from God,

825
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,380
 so steward it, don't own it.

826
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:58,980
 I shared this in the main service on Sunday morning

827
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:00,040
 just a few weeks ago,

828
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,940
 so if it's a repeat for some of you, my apologies,

829
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:05,040
 but I know a lot of people don't come to Watermark here.

830
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,520
 We'd love for you to come to Watermark

831
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,800
 if you don't have a church home.

832
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,280
 But one of the best examples I've ever seen

833
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,240
 of this idea of stewarding what has been given to you

834
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,120
 is by my friend David.

835
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:19,120
 And what I shared on that Sunday is several years ago,

836
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,880
 I was working at a church in Austin

837
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,980
 that did a wakeboard camp during the summer,

838
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:26,020
 and so these families would bring their top of the line

839
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:29,100
 wakeboard boats to this camp.

840
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:31,020
 And I remember walking down the dock

841
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:32,460
 and I saw my friend David

842
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:34,060
 standing in the middle of his boat,

843
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:36,460
 which was tied up to the dock,

844
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:41,360
 and he was just standing there looking perplexed at his boat.

845
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:44,260
 Like he was just confused.

846
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:47,520
 I was like, "David, is everything okay?"

847
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,140
 And here's what you need to know.

848
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:53,920
 David had given up his week to drive middle school girls

849
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,580
 and their counselors around

850
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:57,320
 so that these middle school kids

851
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,500
 could learn how to wakeboard

852
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:01,100
 and their counselors could tell them about Jesus.

853
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:02,460
 And these middle school girls

854
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:06,220
 had brought permanent markers onto David's boat,

855
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:07,740
 and while they were riding around,

856
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:09,020
 they were coloring,

857
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:13,540
 and marker had gotten on the seats

858
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:15,680
 of this top of the line boat.

859
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,760
 And so I asked David, I was like,

860
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,220
 "David, is everything okay?"

861
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:21,860
 And I will never forget what he said.

862
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:23,420
 He said this to me 10 years ago.

863
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:26,260
 He was like, "Yeah, I was just standing here

864
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:30,820
 "wondering why God wanted marker on his boat."

865
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:34,440
 Isn't that amazing?

866
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:38,580
 Like he was like, "This boat isn't mine."

867
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:42,460
 David had sold his company years earlier for $50 million.

868
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:47,020
 This was a guy who viewed his house

869
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:49,020
 as belonging to Jesus and not him.

870
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:51,340
 And so they consistently hosted people,

871
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:52,960
 opened up their home to people.

872
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,780
 People would come and stay with them

873
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:57,900
 because it wasn't theirs anyway.

874
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:59,220
 If people wanted to use their boat,

875
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:00,740
 they gladly loaned it to people.

876
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:03,140
 Why? Because it wasn't their boat anyway.

877
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:04,620
 If you were to look at the refrigerator,

878
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:07,220
 it was covered from top to bottom

879
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:10,780
 with support letters from people around the globe

880
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:13,460
 who were going overseas to take the gospel

881
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:14,420
 to those who had never heard.

882
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:16,580
 Because David had come to a place in his life

883
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:19,060
 where he just decided if there was a believer

884
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:22,740
 that was seeking to do something for the glory of God,

885
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:24,740
 he felt called to give to it.

886
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:28,360
 And he had just decided this isn't mine,

887
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,960
 this is his in the first place.

888
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:34,160
 So own nothing, steward everything.

889
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,860
 And then the final reason that money is a terrible God

890
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:39,540
 is because no matter how much you have,

891
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:44,060
 you will still need Jesus Christ.

892
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:45,740
 Doesn't matter how much money you have,

893
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:48,140
 you will still need Jesus.

894
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:51,700
 Look really quickly at chapter six, the story he tells.

895
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:54,660
 He just says, "There's an evil that I've seen under the sun.

896
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:57,340
 "It lies heavy on mankind,

897
00:41:57,340 --> 00:42:01,480
 "a man to whom God gives wealth, possessions, and honor

898
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:04,220
 "so that he lacks nothing of all that he desires."

899
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:08,060
 So he's saying, look, picture someone who has everything,

900
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:09,660
 all of the money he could ever want,

901
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:13,860
 all of the possessions, the house, the Tesla, the boat,

902
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:17,460
 the extra homes, the lake house, the box seats

903
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:19,300
 to the Mavs games, to the Cowboys.

904
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:21,800
 He has everything, she has everything.

905
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:27,160
 Yet God does not give him power to enjoy them.

906
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:30,300
 But a stranger enjoys them.

907
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:31,520
 This is a vanity.

908
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:34,540
 It's a grievous evil.

909
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:38,460
 If a man fathers a hundred children and lives many years

910
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:40,060
 so that the days of his years are many,

911
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:45,060
 but his soul is not satisfied with life's good things,

912
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:47,420
 and he also has no burial,

913
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:51,580
 I say that a stillborn child is better off than he.

914
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:56,440
 For it comes in vanity and goes in darkness,

915
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,780
 and in darkness its name is covered.

916
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:01,980
 Moreover, it has not seen the sun or known anything.

917
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:05,780
 Yet the stillborn finds rest rather than the guy

918
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:07,920
 who had everything but couldn't enjoy it.

919
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:12,280
 Even though he should live a thousand years twice over,

920
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:16,760
 yet enjoy no good, do not all go to the one place.

921
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,220
 Do you know what he's saying?

922
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:23,940
 He's like, if you have everything, but you don't have Jesus,

923
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:27,260
 in the end you have nothing.

924
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:34,820
 Because you can't enjoy all you have apart from Jesus.

925
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:36,100
 You're like, I sure can't.

926
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:39,220
 No, the problem is is when you make your stuff your God,

927
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:42,700
 in the end, you're always going to want more.

928
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:45,260
 It will never be enough.

929
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:48,020
 Until your stuff can just be your stuff,

930
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:50,300
 and Jesus can be your God,

931
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:52,740
 that is where satisfaction happens.

932
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:53,580
 Why?

933
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:59,220
 Because you have been made for Jesus.

934
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:01,140
 You have been made to worship.

935
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:02,020
 You have.

936
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:03,380
 You've been made to worship.

937
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:05,940
 You are worshiping something with your life now.

938
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:07,860
 Your soul is made to worship.

939
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:11,020
 Your soul was made to worship Jesus.

940
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:13,540
 But we look other places.

941
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:15,760
 Jim Carrey, famous actor.

942
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:16,940
 Many of you have heard this quote,

943
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:19,260
 but he said, I think everybody should get rich and famous

944
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:21,600
 and do everything they ever dreamed of

945
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:24,960
 so that they can see it's not the answer.

946
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:29,120
 Blaise Pascal said, "There is a God-shaped vacuum

947
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:30,340
 "in the heart of each man,

948
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:33,020
 "which cannot be satisfied by any created thing,

949
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:34,420
 "but only by God the creator,

950
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:38,160
 "made known through Jesus Christ."

951
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:41,800
 See, what you don't want to do is find yourself

952
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:45,040
 in a place where you have everything you want

953
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,960
 and nothing that you need.

954
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:49,120
 What do I mean by that?

955
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:51,480
 I grew up in the park cities.

956
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:52,960
 I grew up surrounded by people

957
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:55,480
 who had everything that they wanted,

958
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:58,300
 but they didn't realize what they were lacking.

959
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:00,000
 See, they had everything that they wanted,

960
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,360
 but many of them had nothing that they needed.

961
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:05,960
 Because you could have all the money in the world,

962
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:06,800
 but here's the reality,

963
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:10,020
 you cannot buy your way into a relationship with God.

964
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:11,560
 That's the wrong currency.

965
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:16,020
 Cash is not the currency of heaven.

966
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:18,040
 The body and blood of Jesus Christ

967
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:19,540
 is the currency of heaven.

968
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:22,840
 Money will not get you into heaven.

969
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:24,800
 If you get to the end of your life

970
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:25,760
 and you're on your deathbed

971
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,800
 and you're looking back on all that you've made

972
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:30,600
 and all that you have, you just need to know

973
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:32,360
 that's the end of it.

974
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:34,640
 It stays here.

975
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:37,480
 It will not be enough for God.

976
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:41,720
 The scripture says that you have been bought at a price

977
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:46,720
 and that price was the body and blood of Jesus Christ.

978
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:49,280
 See, money is not enough,

979
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,880
 but Jesus's death, burial and resurrection

980
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:55,520
 is enough to make you right with God.

981
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:59,160
 That's why I say everyone here was created

982
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:01,520
 to be in relationship with Jesus.

983
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:03,340
 And Jesus Christ is the only way

984
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:05,640
 to have a right relationship with God.

985
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:07,800
 This is what eternity with God costs.

986
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:10,680
 This is what salvation costs.

987
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:17,560
 Salvation costs the body and blood of Jesus Christ.

988
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:19,080
 That's the price.

989
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:22,720
 I'll end just by pointing you to Judas Iscariot.

990
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:26,160
 We know Judas is the guy who betrayed Jesus.

991
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,200
 I want you to think about Judas for a moment.

992
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:32,720
 Judas betrayed Jesus for 30 pieces of silver.

993
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:34,040
 Why?

994
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:35,680
 Because money was his God.

995
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:38,640
 Judas was in charge of Jesus's bank account.

996
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:41,880
 Judas used to pilfer from Jesus's bank account.

997
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:46,060
 Judas betrayed Jesus for 30 pieces of silver.

998
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:51,520
 And yet, when he got that 30 pieces of silver,

999
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:54,280
 it's like he caught the bill.

1000
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:57,680
 It's like the money dropped and he caught it.

1001
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:00,360
 And yet, what did he do?

1002
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:03,920
 He went out and bought a field and committed suicide.

1003
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:05,440
 Why?

1004
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:10,240
 Because he realized he had chosen the wrong God.

1005
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:13,880
 Money is a terrible God.

1006
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:17,160
 So the question you need to answer is,

1007
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:21,540
 will you have your money or will your money have you?

1008
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:25,040
 You've been made for Jesus.

1009
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:27,880
 If you don't know Jesus, would you come into him tonight?

1010
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:29,600
 Would you put your trust in him?

1011
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:33,080
 Would you let Jesus be the satisfaction of your soul?

1012
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:34,880
 Maybe you're here tonight

1013
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:35,800
 and you're just sitting there saying,

1014
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:37,760
 "Look, I realize that money doesn't have

1015
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:39,040
 "a healthy place in my life."

1016
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:41,280
 If you need to come down front and pray with someone,

1017
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:42,480
 there will be people down front.

1018
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:43,720
 We would love to pray for you.

1019
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:45,760
 If you need to go up to the prayer chapel,

1020
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:48,320
 you can go up and just get alone with God

1021
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:50,560
 and do business with him.

1022
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:52,400
 If you need a copy of the word of God,

1023
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,400
 we wanna, the Bible, we wanna give it to you.

1024
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:57,160
 You can go out to the welcome desk and ask for a Bible.

1025
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:59,360
 We will gladly give it to you

1026
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:01,680
 so that you can begin to center your heart

1027
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:04,880
 on what is true.

1028
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:08,720
 But do business with the Lord tonight.

1029
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,400
 May we be a group of people.

1030
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:14,280
 May this room of 2,000 young adults leave here tonight

1031
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:19,280
 believing that nothing is better than knowing Jesus Christ.

1032
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:22,560
 Let's pray together.

1033
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:30,200
 Lord Jesus, you're a good king.

1034
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:34,560
 I thank you that you went to the cross,

1035
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:35,960
 that you died, you were buried,

1036
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:38,480
 you rose from the dead, you conquered the grave

1037
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:41,560
 so that we might have life.

1038
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:45,480
 You did what money could never do.

1039
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:49,840
 You made a way when there was no way

1040
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:52,800
 for us to be right with God.

1041
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:55,280
 So if there's anyone here tonight

1042
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:58,320
 who doesn't have a real relationship with you, Jesus,

1043
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:00,760
 I pray that tonight they would come,

1044
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:02,000
 they would put their faith in you,

1045
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,600
 they would surrender their life to you,

1046
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:06,800
 that they would know you as savior and king.

1047
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,880
 We love you, God.

1048
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:14,800
 Would you, Lord Jesus, be the satisfaction of our souls?

1049
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:17,560
 In Jesus' name, amen.

1050
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:27,560
