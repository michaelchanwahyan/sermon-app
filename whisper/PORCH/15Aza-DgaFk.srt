1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 I've been tried and you know I've been tested

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 I won't back down, I won't surrender

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 I've seen the proof, I know the truth

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 This is what I was made to do

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 I was born for this

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 I was born for this

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 Alright Porch, how we doing?

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 Yeah!

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 It is awesome to be with you and our friends watching online

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 It's the second week of North Dallas Porch up there in the Frisco area

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 How about that? Way to go!

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 We're glad you guys are up there gathering

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 Welcome, welcome, welcome

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 About 19 other Porch locations around the world

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 And we are so glad you're jumping in online

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 And I am glad to be here in Dallas with you all this summer

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 We are talking about Jesus Walks

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 This is an amazing privilege to get to talk about this little series tonight

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 Because I get to introduce you to a friend

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 There's really nothing better than you can do than to share friends

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 I can remember I was going through a time in my life

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 Where kind of my core friend group was radically changing

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 I was not yet a believer

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 I was not yet somebody that was in any way walking with Jesus

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 But I had made a decision that I wanted to be an athlete

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 And in my day and age, at the time I didn't think athletes were some people that were doing drugs and a lot of other things

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 And so, especially being a guy that was late developing

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 As I was fighting for spots and opportunities to play for a long time

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 In different fields of competition

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 I just decided I wasn't going to go a certain direction

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 And I had no problem with some of my friends starting to make some choices

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 That they were going to party in different ways in the week and do some things

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 But what bothered me is they all of a sudden started to say

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 Hey Todd, look, if you're not going to do what we're going to do

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 Then you're not going to hang where we hang

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 And I was like, well what's that all about? I thought we were friends

37
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 Friends run together and friends do things with one another because they like each other

38
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 Not because we're just doing certain activities

39
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 Are you telling me that you're not my friend if I don't do what you do?

40
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 And that was exactly what they started to tell me

41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 And I was just, the way I was wired, I was like, well wait a minute

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 I wasn't going to be swayed by that peer pressure

43
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 Just the way that I was made to no credit of my own

44
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 I just kind of said, well then, to heck with that

45
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 We're not even friends

46
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 Let's deal with that

47
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 And so I went from being a guy that was kind of what I would say

48
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 In the mainstream of popularity and friend groups

49
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 To being pretty alone

50
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 I would say completely alone

51
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 And it was interesting, I got a call last Thursday

52
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 From a guy that knew me about this time

53
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 And he happened to run across some messages

54
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 And some talks that I had given about this Jesus

55
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 And how my life had been radically changed

56
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 And it just so happens, he was at a place where his heart was being tenderized

57
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 And he called me 35, 40 years, that was actually 40 years later

58
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 So this was before I knew Christ

59
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 This was my late teens

60
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 And this guy wanted to talk to me

61
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 And he said, hey man, I've got to tell you

62
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 I've been listening to some of the stuff you've been saying

63
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 And I've got to let you know, I'm learning

64
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 And I have begun to understand a little bit about what you're talking about

65
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 And I remember a time

66
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 When you were starting to make some choices

67
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 That I was in another group

68
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 And man, we just destroyed you

69
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 We talked poorly of you

70
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 And I remember this guy, wasn't just around me when I was in high school

71
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 He was later, he went to the same college I did

72
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 And he talked about the fact that when he was in college

73
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 At one point, he came around with a group of friends

74
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 That were getting ready to go out to a bar

75
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 And he said, Todd, you were going, at that time I had trusted Christ

76
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 And I was actually headed to go pour into some high school kids somewhere

77
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 And speak, and he said, man, we saw you knock on one of the bars with us

78
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 And I want to tell you, I laid into you

79
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 I talked about you behind your back

80
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 And I did everything I could to destroy your reputation

81
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 And to make others think poorly of you

82
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 And he said, I just want to tell you, man

83
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 I've come to know what you knew

84
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 And it's changed my life

85
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 Now what's interesting, about that same time

86
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 I had some guys

87
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 When I was in high school

88
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 And kind of in that transition period

89
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 That were a year or two ahead of me

90
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 One of his names, Jeff Kogan

91
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 And Jeff Kogan

92
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 Was the starting quarterback

93
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 When I was just a freshman in high school

94
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 And was beginning to make some choices

95
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 Because I wanted to compete on those levels

96
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 You know, in high school and beyond

97
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 And Jeff Kogan saw me alone

98
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 He saw me without a friend group

99
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 And Jeff Kogan, the starting quarterback

100
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 As a junior in the football team

101
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 Learned my name

102
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 And Jeff Kogan didn't just learn my name

103
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 He invited me to start to hang out with his friend groups

104
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 Now at first, I was pretty shy

105
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 Because I was just certain

106
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 I'm like, why would these guys want to hang out with me

107
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 And want to break my little heart

108
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 And want to maybe abuse me in some way

109
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 Haze me in some way, I don't even know what that word meant

110
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 But I just didn't trust that anybody could really love me

111
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 But what Jeff Kogan did, is he learned my name

112
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 He sought me, he invited me in

113
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 And he shared his friendship with me

114
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 And he shared his friends with me

115
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 And I went from being a guy

116
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 That was running alone

117
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 To all of a sudden, Paul Frazier

118
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 Jacques, Jeff, Chip, Michelle

119
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 Who was the captain of the cheerleading squad

120
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 It was Dayton, Jeff

121
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 Started to be my friend

122
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 I'll never forget it

123
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 Because I thought, man, there's no greater kindness

124
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 That you can show somebody

125
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 Than to share friends with them

126
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 I remember as my life went on

127
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 You know, I spent some time in college

128
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 With a gal that ended up having a little bit of success

129
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 In the music field

130
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 And she later got selected

131
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 To be the only female soloist

132
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 On the Michael Jackson Dangerous Tour worldwide

133
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 I mean, she sang every duet with Michael Jackson

134
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 Okay

135
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 You might have heard her name a little bit later

136
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 She went on to have her own independent career

137
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 Her name was Cheryl Crow

138
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 And Cheryl, you know, when she came to Dallas

139
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 With the Dangerous Tour, when Michael Jackson was like

140
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 Justin Bieber, right

141
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 In fact, Michael Jackson made Justin Bieber

142
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 Look like, you know, no one

143
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 I mean, Michael Jackson was like the bomb

144
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 And he was on the world tour

145
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 And he was going around

146
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 And Cheryl was coming through with that tour

147
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 And I remember Cheryl had a backstage pass

148
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 And we hung out

149
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 And I remember her inviting me to kind of go backstage

150
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 Before the Dangerous Tour in Dallas

151
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 That nobody could get tickets to

152
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 And just saying, "Come on man, come on back here, Todd

153
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 Here's the crew, here's the team"

154
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 And I remember she was just sharing her life

155
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 And her friends with me, and I was like, "That was alright"

156
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 You know, it was kind of fun to see that

157
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 I remember when a friend did that with me with Garth Brooks

158
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 I remember when I got to do that when I invited guys

159
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 Into locker rooms and things of that sort

160
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 Because you've got access somewhere

161
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 To do the fleeting, silly things

162
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 And I want to tell you tonight

163
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 I'm going to do the kindest thing I can do with you

164
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 I'm going to share with you about my friend

165
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 His name is Jesus

166
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 And there's no greater

167
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 I mean, Michael Jackson, Garth Brooks

168
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 Patrick Mahomes

169
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 I don't care what little circle you're invited into

170
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 There is no greater friend than Jesus

171
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 And I'm going to do the kindest thing I can do with you

172
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 And I remember when people shared their friendships with me

173
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 And I want to share with you about my great friend, Jesus

174
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 And I want to share with you about my great friend, Jesus

175
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 And I want to share with you about my great friend, Jesus

176
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 If you've got a Bible, turn to John 5

177
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 I hope you always bring your Bible

178
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 Because we want to show you that this is

179
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 This word is living and active

180
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 And this word is true

181
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 And it's beautiful and it's amazing

182
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 And we're just going to tell you what happened when God walked the earth

183
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 Now here's what's amazing

184
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 Is that Jesus wasn't just anybody, he was God

185
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 And when Jesus walked the earth

186
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 There was amazing

187
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 Activity all around him

188
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 And Jesus still lives today

189
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 I just got through doing a podcast

190
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 With our friends here

191
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 We have what's called a church leaders podcast

192
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 Which even if you're not a leader in the church

193
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 It's great for you to listen to

194
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 And they asked me to jump in with them

195
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 It was actually on discouragement

196
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 And they just said, Todd, we want to talk to you about how people handle discouragement

197
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 In life and ministry

198
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 And I just shared with them very honestly

199
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 Look guys, I got to let you know

200
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 I'm going to tell you why in almost now 30 plus years

201
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 Of walking with Jesus

202
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 I've never had discouragement

203
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 Here's why

204
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 I love watching God go to work

205
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 I love believing that Jesus is still alive

206
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 That he was risen from the grave

207
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 That when he ascended to sit at the right hand of the father

208
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 He intercedes for me

209
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 That his spirit, the spirit of God which indwelt in him

210
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 When he took on human form

211
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 Is still here and dwells in me

212
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 Because I'm a friend of God

213
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 And when I am walking with Jesus

214
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 The kind of crazy things that happen

215
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 When Jesus walked the earth still happen

216
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 The things that happen when Jesus walked the earth

217
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 Happen right where I am

218
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 I'm going to make a claim that you really got to listen to me on

219
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 And that is more miracles have happened here

220
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 At Watermark in the last six months

221
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 Than in all of the gospels combined

222
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 More miracles

223
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 More radical

224
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 World changing things

225
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 Have happened here at Watermark

226
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 In the last six months

227
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 Than in all the New Testament stories combined

228
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 Now let me just explain that to you a couple of ways

229
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 First of all you shouldn't be surprised

230
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 Because Jesus said that's exactly what's going to happen

231
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 He said if you believe in me the works that I do

232
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 You will do also

233
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 In fact greater works than these will you do

234
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 If you believe in me

235
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 In the New Testament

236
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 In the life of Christ specifically

237
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 Depending on how you count them

238
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 There's only 30 some odd miracles

239
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 That happen in all the gospels combined

240
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 We're now a group of people

241
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 That number in the thousands around here at Watermark

242
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 We walk with him

243
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 We're sharing the news of who Jesus is

244
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 And the truth about who God is

245
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 And we're sharing our friend Jesus and the work of God with others

246
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 And so it shouldn't surprise you

247
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 That the blind see, the deaf hear

248
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 The lame walk and the dead are raised

249
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 Now look

250
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 I've never been a part of a resurrection

251
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 Of a person who was flat lined

252
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 Like dead in a grave for four days

253
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 And somebody said

254
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 You know

255
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 John Doe come forth

256
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 And the ground broke

257
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 And the coffin was kicked open

258
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 And the guy crawled out

259
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 I've never been a part of that

260
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 There's no wheelchair stapled to the walls here

261
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 Because I've never seen somebody

262
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 Who was in a wheelchair

263
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 Get up and be radically healed

264
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 After a lifetime of paralysis

265
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 But let me just tell you something

266
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 When Jesus said this

267
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 What he was saying there is

268
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 What I'm going to do is I'm going to teach sinners to live holy lives

269
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 What I'm going to show you tonight

270
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 Is when Jesus did some of the miracles and healings he did

271
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 And false teachers by the way

272
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 Are going to take advantage

273
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 Of some of the things in the bible that are easy to misinterpret

274
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 And difficult to understand

275
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 And they're going to exploit you if you're not careful

276
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 Now I believe God can do whatever he wants to do whenever he wants to do it

277
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 If God wanted to raise people from the dead today

278
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 Physically like he did with Lazarus

279
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 He could do it

280
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 If God wanted to have blind men see

281
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 Because I spit in my hand and rub it on somebody's eyes with dirt

282
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 He could do it

283
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 There's no question that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today and forever

284
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 But you need to understand why Jesus did miracles

285
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 And what the purpose of the miracles were

286
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 And I'm going to introduce you to my friend Jesus

287
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 And give you a biblical understanding of Jesus

288
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 So you're not taken advantage of by charlatans

289
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 And so that your life can be radically changed

290
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 The way Jesus wants to radically change your life

291
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 And that means if you're here and you're in a wheelchair tonight

292
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 And you go out of here in a wheelchair

293
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 You can still have hope

294
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 And begin to walk

295
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 Not physically but walk

296
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 With a new perspective and a newness of life

297
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 If God wants to get you out of the wheelchair he can do that

298
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 But there's something better

299
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 Let me encourage you with this

300
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 I've got a friend, Johnny Erickson Tata

301
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 Who is one of the godliest people I've ever met

302
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 Johnny, J-O-N-I

303
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 Erickson Tata

304
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 Google her

305
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 I do something called Real Truth Real Quick

306
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 And just type in there healing

307
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 And listen to Johnny and I talk about healing

308
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 And Johnny who's been in a wheelchair

309
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 A quadriplegic

310
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 Since she was 17

311
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 Talks about what she really needs to be healed from

312
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 Because she's had all kinds of faith healers come up to her

313
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 And talk to her

314
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 About if she just had enough faith they think they could heal her

315
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 They could get her out of the wheelchair

316
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 And what Johnny says is let me ask you a question

317
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 Can I just tell you, I'd love to walk on this earth again

318
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 But if you really want to pray for my healing

319
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 Would you pray for my anger

320
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 Would you pray for my elitism, my pride

321
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 My belief that I'm better than you

322
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 Would you heal that part of me

323
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 Because even if I get out of this wheelchair

324
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 There's parts of me that are dead that need to be resurrected in newness of life

325
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 And Johnny talks about what's really broken in her life

326
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 And how Christ has dealt with that

327
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 With amazing hope

328
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 Listen to Johnny talk about if you have enough faith

329
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 Will God heal you

330
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 I beg you to watch that real truth real quick

331
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 But let me teach you about my Jesus

332
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 And let me tell you that right here and tonight

333
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 Maybe in your life

334
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 You can begin to walk with a new hope

335
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 Maybe their dead ears will begin to hear truth

336
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 And your blind eyes will begin to see who Jesus really is

337
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 John chapter 5

338
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 John chapter 5

339
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 John chapter 5

340
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 John chapter 5

341
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 Here we go

342
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 Here's my Jesus

343
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 It says in verse 2

344
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 Now there is in Jerusalem by the sheep gate a pool

345
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 So one of the things I always love to tell you about my Bible

346
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 Is that it's not just a collection

347
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 Of stories

348
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 There is no Mount Olympus

349
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 That you can go visit

350
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 There is no

351
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 History

352
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 That you can really verify

353
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 And test in a lot of other books

354
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 Right

355
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 That claim to be holy

356
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 When you read and study Hinduism

357
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 It's called Hindu Mythology

358
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 This is called

359
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 History

360
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 It is God's story

361
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 It's H-I-S capital

362
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 His story anchored in the context of our history

363
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 And you can test this book

364
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 And verify it

365
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 You can make sense out of it

366
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 Because there are names and places

367
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 And dates and claims

368
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 That's not what happened

369
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 Then we got to get rid of this book

370
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 Do you know that until 1990 there had never been any evidence

371
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 There was a guy named David that lived

372
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 And a lot of people mocked the Bible

373
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 And said that David was just some venerated made up character

374
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 Some hero

375
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 In Jewish history that never really existed

376
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 But a compilation of a lot of stories that were exaggerated

377
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 Because they couldn't find existence of who David was

378
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 And then just

379
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 About 20 some odd short years ago

380
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 We find evidence that there was a ruler named David

381
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 Do you know that in the 1960's

382
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 There was no evidence that there was ever a prefect

383
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 Named Pontius Pilate

384
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 But then in 1960 we found some stone right there by the Mediterranean Sea

385
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 That had the name Pontius Pilate on it

386
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 Do you know there has never been a single archaeological discovery

387
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 In the history of the world

388
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 That has contradicted anything in this book

389
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 Do you know there is not a single prophecy

390
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 That this book has said won't happen

391
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 That hasn't happened yet already

392
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 That needed to happen for this book to be called true

393
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 This is a book that God decided to anchor in history

394
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 So you can test it

395
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 And make sense out of it

396
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 I've been to Bethesda

397
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 I've been through the Sheep Gate

398
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 Right here in Jerusalem

399
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 At this place where there was

400
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 Um

401
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 A lot of pagan practices that were going on

402
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 Let me just read you the story

403
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 It says now they're in Jerusalem by the Sheep Gate

404
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 There was a pool which in Hebrew is called Bethesda

405
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 It's interesting Beth means house

406
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 Hasad or Hesed

407
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 Means love

408
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 Or grace or kindness

409
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 It's the most one of the most often used words in your Bible

410
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 It's the covenant love of God

411
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 The unconditional kindness of God

412
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 This is the house of grace

413
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 The house of kindness

414
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 That's what this place was called

415
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 Now in Bethesda right here

416
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 Um there was this

417
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 Development and the reason there was a development there

418
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 Is because there were springs

419
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 And in these springs

420
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 You're going to find out

421
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 That um they believed that they held

422
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 Some supernatural ability

423
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 To heal

424
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 Check this

425
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 It says around this place

426
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 That had five porticos

427
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 In these lay a multitude of those who were sick

428
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 And blind and lame and withered

429
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 There was all kinds of evidences

430
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 Of broken humanity

431
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 There was a blend there

432
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 It's called syncretism of Greek mythology

433
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 Roman mythology and even just some

434
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 Judaic belief that was right there

435
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 So by the way

436
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 If you go to this place today and you can go to it

437
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 Bethesda it's still there it's been excavated

438
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 In about a 30 second walk

439
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 You will go through another gate

440
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 And you'll be on what's called the temple mount

441
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 In about 3 minutes you could have been to what's called

442
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 The holy of holies

443
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 These were people

444
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 That were not seeking the God

445
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 Of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob to be healed

446
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 These were people that were kind of

447
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 Caught up over here

448
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 In worship in pagan practices

449
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 And cult worship and what had happened

450
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 Is there was superstition in that day

451
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 I'll read to you this little section

452
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 Right here in verses 3 and 4

453
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 It says there was a bunch of folks that were lame and withered

454
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 That were waiting for the moving of the waters

455
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 For an angel of the Lord

456
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 And this is now what they believed

457
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 This is not what happened

458
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 An angel of the Lord went down at certain seasons

459
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 Into the pool and stirred up the water

460
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 Whoever then first after the stirring up of the water

461
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 Stepped in was made well from whatever

462
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 Disease with which he was afflicted

463
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 Now let me ask you a question

464
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 What kind of people could get to a water first when it stirred

465
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 And by the way you're kind of like well what's that mean

466
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 What does the water stir? The water stirred because

467
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 They didn't know it but there was a deep spring that was there

468
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 And every now and then when the water would come out

469
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 And move forward because of rainy season

470
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 Things like that there would be a flow

471
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 And the water would stir and it would come up

472
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 And bubble up and it would move the surface of the water

473
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 Inside these pools and then people would

474
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 Scurry to jump in and there were all kinds of people there

475
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 Let me ask you a question

476
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 If there were people there that were lame and there were other people there

477
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 That were discouraged or there were people there

478
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 That were depressed or there were people there that had skin diseases

479
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 Which people would make it into the water first?

480
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 It wouldn't be the lame people

481
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 If the belief was first come first serve

482
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 Man you're going to be sitting right there

483
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 And if you're discouraged

484
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 Probably the people, most of the people with the most psychosomatic illnesses

485
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 Who believe that there's some healing power there

486
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 And there's all kinds of evidence

487
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 If you believe something can help you

488
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 It typically can help you

489
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 Especially if your diseases are not

490
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 You're quadriplegic or paralytic

491
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 You'd get in that water and you'd come out and go

492
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 I'm healed, I'm healed, I got it, I got it

493
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 And I guarantee you there'd be a fit of adrenaline

494
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 I guarantee you if you were the first one in

495
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 There was a sense of belief

496
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 And it probably did something for you

497
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 At least in the short term

498
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 Blind people wouldn't get in first

499
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 They couldn't see that the water stirred

500
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 If you ever go to some of the charlatans today

501
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 They're involved in healing ministries

502
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 Watch carefully about how they move the critically ill

503
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 And the sick and the wheelchairs away from the stage

504
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 Watch the way that they are telling you

505
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 That you're going to be healed

506
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 And you're going to be healed

507
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 And you're going to be healed

508
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 And they are telling you

509
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 Sometimes even when people

510
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 Are going through certain types of healings

511
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 That if it doesn't happen completely

512
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 In that moment, sometimes they put people in wheelchairs

513
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 Who have limps and they get them up

514
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 And they say stand up and they stand up with their limp

515
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 And they go he's walking

516
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 Just like he was walking before they put him in the wheelchair

517
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 Now I'm going to tell you God can do whatever he wants to do

518
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 Whenever he wants to do it

519
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 But a lot of what you see

520
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 On TV and amongst these charlatans

521
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 Is exactly that

522
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 And it offends God

523
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 And it offends Jesus

524
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 The reason that Jesus did miracles by the way

525
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 Is because he was trying to show you who he was

526
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 The reason there's sickness

527
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 The reason there's disease

528
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 The reason there's death on this earth

529
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 Is because of sin

530
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 God didn't create us with cancer

531
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 And with disease

532
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 And with brokenness

533
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 There were no down syndrome children

534
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 Born to Adam and Eve

535
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 If they conceived before the fall

536
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 And there's no evidence that they did

537
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 All of that is a result

538
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 Of us leaving the God of perfection

539
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 And being left to our own way

540
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 Sin and death and disease entered into the world

541
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 What Jesus is about to show you

542
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 Is that he has the ability to reverse the effects of sin

543
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 Who can do that?

544
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 Only God can reverse the effects of sin

545
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 Because the effects of sin are here

546
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 Because we have offended God

547
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 There's no other way

548
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 But to forgive God

549
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 There's a reason

550
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 For example when Jesus healed somebody else

551
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 He was sitting there and somebody came to him

552
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 Who was lame

553
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 And Jesus looked at this guy

554
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 And he said hey your sins are forgiven

555
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 And the religious leaders were very offended

556
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 They go hey you can't forgive sins

557
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 Nobody can forgive sins except God

558
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 And so what did Jesus do?

559
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 Because that is an excellent point

560
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 Because sin is an offense against God

561
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 And so what did Jesus say

562
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 He said that no man has authority on earth to forgive sins

563
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 In other words that I am the visible image of the invisible God

564
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 That this isn't just Jesus walking

565
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 This is God walking

566
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 Remember how I told you I'm going to do the kindest thing I can do

567
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 Which is to share my friend with you

568
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 I'm going to share with you the truth about who God is

569
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 You want to know what God looks like? Look at Jesus

570
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 And by the way isn't it interesting

571
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 That even people

572
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 Who aren't Christians

573
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 Love Jesus

574
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 Because we're like

575
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 If people could really be like that

576
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 Really that loving, really that selfless

577
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 I'd want to know him more

578
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 And you should want to know more of Jesus

579
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 But Jesus says

580
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 Hey that's an excellent point

581
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 Only God can forgive sins

582
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 In order that you might know who I am

583
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 I say to you take up your pallet and walk

584
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 Because only God can give regeneration

585
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 To paralyzed crippled legs

586
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 This wasn't the guy with a limp

587
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 This was the guy that stood up and walked

588
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 The reason Jesus did the miracles he did

589
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 Is to authenticate his words

590
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 He said if you don't believe me

591
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 Believe the works that I do

592
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 Jesus a little bit later said this

593
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 He said there's not going to be any more signs

594
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 I didn't come here to do a bunch of signs

595
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 He didn't come here to heal everybody

596
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 He came here to not heal everybody

597
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 From the effects of the fall

598
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 In short term temporal ways

599
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 He came to heal everybody from the effects of the fall

600
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 And their separation from God

601
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 He said heaven's going to be where there's no disease

602
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 Heaven's going to be where there's no tears

603
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 Heaven's going to be where there's no death

604
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 On this earth there's still going to be

605
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 Paralyzation, cancer, betrayal, and despair

606
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 But I am going to give you hope

607
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 And I'm going to restore you into relationship with me

608
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 So that when judgment comes upon sin

609
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 It passes over you

610
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 And I move you into the kingdom I intended for you

611
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 But I'm not going to heal everybody

612
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 Guess what Jesus didn't heal everybody

613
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 We're at a place where there's scores of afflicted people

614
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 And my friend Jesus walks up

615
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 And he says this

616
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 There was a man there who had been ill for 38 years

617
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 There's certain numbers, there's a reason that the Bible has in it what it has in it

618
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 I mean there's a reason that John put down 38

619
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 And you might go well Todd what's the reason John put down 38?

620
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 Well here's an idea

621
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 There are certain numbers in societies that always mean something

622
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 Right?

623
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 Like in America, if I say 9/11

624
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 Does that mean something to you?

625
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 That number, those numbers together mean something to you don't they?

626
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 The number 1776 means something to you doesn't it? In America?

627
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 Say yes, I remember American history

628
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 Right?

629
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 There are certain numbers that mean something

630
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 You can even go kind of the superstitious way

631
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 I mean February 14th means something for you, right?

632
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 It means you're alone again, despairing and depressed

633
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 [Laughter]

634
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 That's right, it's sad day, singles awareness day, that's what Valentine's is

635
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 [Laughter]

636
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 But there's certain numbers that mean something

637
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 If you were a Jew, the number 38 meant something to you

638
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 Now listen, Jesus came to reveal who he was

639
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 The reason 38 meant something to you, if you went back and looked in the book of Deuteronomy

640
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 It talks about how the fact that God wanted to take Israel

641
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 And deliver them out of Egypt and the oppression of the powers of the earth

642
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 And set them free from being slaves to free

643
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 Take them from a place of oppression to a place of promise

644
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 In a land flowing with milk and honey

645
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 Where they would live in cities and in homes that they did not build

646
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 That they would be safe and have protection

647
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 It was a picture of what God wants to do for all humanity

648
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 And God didn't uniquely love the Jews

649
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 He chose to show his love to the Jews

650
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 That all the nations of the earth could be blessed through the Jews

651
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 That was his idea

652
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 So that all the nations of the earth would know that he is God

653
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 But what happens is that they were led out of Egypt

654
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 And as God then sent spies into the holy land

655
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 And showed them what they were going to go take

656
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 There were giants in the land

657
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 And they go, man, we can't fight those people, we can't take those people

658
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 So the 12 spies went back and 10 of them said

659
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 There's no way, man, we got our clock clean

660
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 Two of them said, no, we can do this because God is for us

661
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 God just delivered us from Egypt

662
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 Surely he can give us what he said he's going to give us there

663
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 But the 10 carried the day

664
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 And took the whole nation into a place where they did not trust God

665
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 And so God said, this wicked generation

666
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 Shall all pass away

667
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 And then I'll take a new generation to the land that believes in me

668
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 Guess how long it was from the moment that he pronounced that judgment

669
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 Until they got into the land, the answer is 38 years

670
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 They lived a life of wondering and oppression

671
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 And hopelessness and despair

672
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 It's the wilderness wondering years

673
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 Here's a guy that is 38

674
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 By the way, 38 was longer than the average life expectancy

675
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 During the time of Christ

676
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 In other words, everything about this guy's life

677
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 From beginning to end was lame, right?

678
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 Was hopeless

679
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 And there's nobody that could help him

680
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 He was without God and without hope in the world

681
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 Trusting in superstitions to heal him

682
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 Had nobody who cared for him

683
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 You're going to find a little bit later

684
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 He said, there's no man who could help me

685
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 And he was exactly right, there's no man that could help him

686
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 And I'm here to tell you tonight, there's no man that can help you

687
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 This man didn't know God, but God knew him and knew his despair

688
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 And you're going to see that this man

689
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 Jesus uniquely went and grabbed him

690
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 Because he was trying to show you something

691
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 He knew he was trying to say, hey, I can get you out of your wonderings

692
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 And your wilderness

693
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 And to all of us, he's just saying, are you sick and tired of your lame life?

694
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 Jesus asked him amazing questions

695
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 The question I'm going to ask you tonight, because my friend wants you to hear it

696
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 And the question is found right here in verse 6

697
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 It says, when Jesus saw him lying there

698
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 And he knew that he had already been a long time in that condition

699
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 He knew he'd been there his entire life

700
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 He said to him something crazy

701
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 He said, do you wish to get well?

702
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 And he said, I wish to get well

703
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 And he said, I wish to get well

704
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 And he said, I wish to get well

705
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 And he said, I wish to get well

706
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 And he said, I wish to get well

707
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 And he said, I wish to get well

708
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 And he said, I wish to get well

709
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 And he said, I wish to get well

710
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 And he said, I wish to get well

711
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 And he said, I wish to get well

712
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 And he said, I wish to get well

713
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 And he said, I wish to get well

714
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 And he said, I wish to get well

715
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 And he said, I wish to get well

716
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 And he said, I wish to get well

717
