[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.160]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:14.140]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.960]   - All right, here we go, POV.

[00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.740]   We are in week four of POV.
[00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.920]   We're looking at Jesus from the different Bible characters,
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.940]   I should say, are looking at Jesus from their point of view.
[00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.100]   That's the whole purpose of this series.
[00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.280]   But before we get going in that,
[00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.120]   I just wanna welcome some Porch Live locations.
[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.280]   So here in Dallas, will you help me welcome

[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.840]   Yeah.
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.200]   There's so many more I could have mentioned
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.360]   and God is doing a work here at the porch
[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.520]   and man, we are humbled to be a part of it.
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.320]   So wherever you're tuning in tonight, welcome.
[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.960]   And first and foremost, I just wanna start out by saying,
[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.320]   man, it's a good day, right?
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.040]   I mean, summer's here.
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.520]   I mean, we're in the 90s y'all.
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.760]   So I don't know about you, but summer is my favorite time
[00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.120]   of year, I can shed some LBs because all I do is sweat
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.340]   in the summer, amen?
[00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.960]   And so man, it's a good day because summer is here.
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.440]   Well, hey, before I get going, I thought I'd share a story.
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.000]   And this story happened just a few months
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.480]   after I got married.
[00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.480]   And I had this brilliant idea that I would go on this hike
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.240]   with my wife, Kathy.
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.440]   Anybody just love the great outdoors?
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.280]   Anybody like just, yeah.
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.740]   I mean, specifically hiking.
[00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.360]   And so I had this incredible plan.
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.620]   Like we were gonna go to the Grand Canyon.
[00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.120]   Like anybody?
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.940]   Yeah, Grand Canyon?
[00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.320]   And so for me, man, like it was a first.
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.800]   I was like, man, we're gonna go to the Grand Canyon
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.680]   and we're not just going there to sightsee.
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.080]   Like we're going there to hike.
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.760]   And so what I did not know is I needed the full day
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.520]   to hike the South Rim of the Grand Canyon.
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.760]   And I did some research and this was after the fact,
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:39.600]   but here's what you need to know
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.160]   about this particular hike, the Grand Canyon.
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.320]   From Google itself, it says this.
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.500]   The hike down generally takes around four hours,
[00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.620]   while the hike up after a good night's rest
[00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.400]   will typically take seven to eight hours.
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.360]   Okay, a total of 13 miles, rated difficult,
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.640]   and no one recommends doing this in one day.
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.920]   But you know, I'm an athlete, right?
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.640]   Well, my athlete's in the house.
[00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.280]   And my roommate, okay, we got some athletes.
[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.080]   And my roommate from college is like, bro, I did this.
[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.940]   I did this, you know, we did it and it was fine.
[00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.280]   And little did he say, he started at 7 a.m.
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.680]   So I'm kind of a, there's two kinds of people
[00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:21.600]   in the room tonight.
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.520]   The people that just plan out everything
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.760]   and they leave no room for surprises.
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.740]   And then the people that just kind of shoot from the hip,
[00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.020]   fly by the seat of their pants.
[00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.400]   Yeah, that's me, baby, come on.
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.880]   I'm just like, fly by the seat of,
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.880]   we'll figure it out as the day unfolds.
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.180]   And so that's kind of what I did.
[00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.600]   And so we pull up to the Grand Canyon at 12 o'clock.
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.560]   And so I go to the welcome desk and I'm just like,
[00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.380]   hey, I'm wanting to hike the South Rim.
[00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:48.680]   And they're like, at 12 o'clock?
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.080]   I'm like, yeah, it'd be fine.
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.880]   They're like, I wouldn't recommend that.
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.520]   I'm like, you don't know me.
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.520]   And so we just, man, we're having some fun.
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.320]   I think we got a picture of it.
[00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.080]   This is my wife, Kathy and I.
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.920]   I mean, we're like five months into marriage.
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.500]   Okay, we're not even really dressed.
[00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.280]   I mean, I got cotton long shorts.
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.320]   I mean, you could tell, that's seven years ago, y'all.
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.960]   Y'all men ain't wearing them kind of shorts.
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.820]   I seen y'all in what you're wearing these days.
[00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:17.720]   And so we, man, we're having a great time
[00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.080]   and we're going down because you start on the top
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.920]   and you go down.
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.720]   And so we're taking pictures and we're having lunch.
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.800]   Man, I'm the, I'm pulling out Romeo.
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.480]   I'm romantic on this hike, y'all.
[00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.720]   I did pack a lunch, I thought about that.
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.000]   And so we're having lunch and we're, you know,
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.240]   overlooking the, it's beautiful.
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.760]   I mean, one of the best days of my life so far.
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.520]   And I'm looking down at the Colorado River.
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.040]   I'm saying, surely it ain't that far.
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.920]   It don't look that far.
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.200]   I mean, come on, we got this.
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.440]   And so we had another two and a half hours to go.
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:48.520]   And I'm like, we got to do it.
[00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.380]   Like, I don't want to just turn back.
[00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:51.880]   Like, that would be zero fun.
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.480]   And so we get down to the Colorado River
[00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.800]   and we dip our feet in and it's beautiful.
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.760]   And one of the hikers comes up and says,
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.840]   "Hey, wasn't that an amazing hike down?"
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:00.660]   Like, yeah.
[00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.360]   He's like, "Where y'all staying tonight?"
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.440]   "Staying?
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.240]   "We ain't, we going back up."
[00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.520]   And he's like, "Bro, you going back up?"
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.600]   And I'm like, "Yeah, we going back up."
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.760]   And he's like, "Well, you didn't get a hotel?"
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:12.960]   I'm like, "Well, we can get a hotel."
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.220]   He's like, "No, man, you got to plan out months in advance.
[00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:17.600]   "And looking at you, you ain't the planner."
[00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.360]   He's like, "So do you have a headlamp?"
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.200]   "A headlamp?
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.040]   "No, I ain't got no headlamp."
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.260]   He's like, "You're not making it up before dark."
[00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.680]   He's like, "Take my headlamp and if you make it up,
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.660]   "leave it at the hotel at the top of the canyon."
[00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:30.500]   I'm like, "If?
[00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:31.760]   "What you talking about, bro?"
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.220]   (audience laughing)
[00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.620]   I'm getting a little defensive, right?
[00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.540]   And my wife's looking at me at this point.
[00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:41.660]   Kathy's just like, "What the heck did you just get us into?"
[00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.220]   I'm like, "It's okay, baby."
[00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:44.940]   And so I got a little bit of water.
[00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:45.980]   I got a little bit of water left.
[00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:47.100]   And so your boy just drinks it
[00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:48.620]   'cause he's got to stay hydrated.
[00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:52.160]   And so not even giving any to Kathy.
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.180]   Like, that's just selfish, y'all.
[00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:55.580]   Hey, I'm newly married, okay?
[00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.100]   God sanctifying me.
[00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:57.940]   And so...
[00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:00.140]   (audience laughing)
[00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:03.360]   No, but seriously, like we get going on this hike
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.180]   and we're not even halfway up and we are, we're dog tired.
[00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:08.700]   Like we don't have any water.
[00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:11.300]   And we are thirsty to the point of like,
[00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.860]   my mind starts hallucinating.
[00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:16.740]   I mean, I mean this, like this is not made up.
[00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:18.780]   And I'm like, man, what's about to happen?
[00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:20.100]   Like, is the helicopter going to come down?
[00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:22.820]   We're going to make the Grand Canyon times, you know?
[00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.580]   Or is a mountain lion going to eat us?
[00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:27.500]   And the sun is setting.
[00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.700]   And I'm like, we're not even halfway up.
[00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:32.420]   And we got at least another four hours to go.
[00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:37.720]   And I come to a place where I'm exhausted and I'm spent.
[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:38.580]   She's exhausted.
[00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:41.080]   We can't even go another 10 yards.
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.780]   And I start there tonight
[00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:49.460]   because just like we were thirsty physically,
[00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:55.060]   humanity is thirsty spiritually.
[00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:56.260]   Like we come into this place,
[00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.340]   if you had to be honest with yourself tonight,
[00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:01.660]   if you had to be honest where you're sitting tonight,
[00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:05.420]   like we come into this place and we're thirsty emotionally,
[00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:08.220]   we're thirsty spiritually.
[00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:12.900]   Some of us, man, we are running to things like sex,
[00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:14.920]   thinking that it's going to fulfill us.
[00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:17.540]   And we're running to the next party or the next drink,
[00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:19.140]   or we're living for the weekend,
[00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:22.180]   or you're trying to become a millionaire by 30,
[00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:24.440]   or you're looking to the next promotion,
[00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:29.980]   all the while kind of leaving God over here on the side.
[00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:31.100]   And you know, deep down,
[00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:32.660]   like you know when you lay your head down
[00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:33.500]   on the pillow at night,
[00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:38.500]   you know that what you're pursuing is not fully satisfying.
[00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:42.420]   Like you're looking at that two-dimensional image
[00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:45.080]   and it, man, it helps with the release in the moment,
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:48.920]   but you know it just keeps you coming back for more.
[00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:51.480]   Like it calls your name and there's real,
[00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:54.420]   I mean, let's just keep it real now.
[00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:56.760]   There's not a lot of satisfaction.
[00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:59.520]   There's not a lot of fulfillment in that.
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:00.560]   And I can say that, man,
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:02.960]   I was a porn addict for 10 years of my life.
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:07.720]   And so tonight we're talking about this idea
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:11.040]   of being thirsty because I think that's a picture
[00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:13.500]   of what some of us come into this room with,
[00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:15.600]   or we've all been there at some point.
[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:19.520]   Just like I was that cotton mouth thirsty,
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:21.240]   that frustrated thirsty,
[00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:24.180]   like some of us come into this place and we're,
[00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:25.240]   you know, we're not cotton mouth
[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:27.240]   from the weed we smoked the other day.
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:30.220]   Well, we're cotton mouth from just like life.
[00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:36.680]   And we're just wondering, man, what's this life all about?
[00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:41.580]   Like, what's really gonna fulfill this body of mine,
[00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:43.020]   this life of mine?
[00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:48.380]   So I resonate with some of you tonight
[00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:51.380]   because a majority of my life was spent
[00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:54.280]   trying to pursue satisfaction.
[00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:57.400]   Like the Rolling Stones song says, come on, you know this.
[00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:59.460]   I can't get no.
[00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:03.520]   That's weak.
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:06.840]   (congregation laughing)
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:08.360]   Some of you wear the T-shirt and you don't even know
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:11.040]   the song and you just proved it, right?
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:16.240]   But we're gonna look at a story tonight between Jesus
[00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:19.360]   and a woman at the well way before the Rolling Stones
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:22.320]   ever penned that song, I Can't Get No Satisfaction.
[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:27.320]   Jesus has an interaction with a woman at a well
[00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:32.080]   where she is trying to find satisfaction.
[00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:36.240]   We're looking at a story where Jesus shares with this woman
[00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:39.000]   where satisfaction is found.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.040]   If you have your Bibles, and I hope you do,
[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:44.520]   we're gonna be opening them to John chapter four,
[00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:45.880]   starting in verse three.
[00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:48.440]   Tonight we're talking about how we go
[00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:51.900]   from being a thirsty person to a satisfied one.
[00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:54.100]   John chapter four.
[00:09:54.100 --> 00:10:00.280]   So he, Jesus, left Judea and returned to Galilee.
[00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:04.000]   He had to go through Samaria on the way.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.380]   Hold up, this is important.
[00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:09.360]   Jesus is a Jew.
[00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:11.900]   Jews didn't associate themselves with Samaritans.
[00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:15.240]   Like they had racial tensions,
[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:18.540]   like Samaritans were half breeds,
[00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:20.600]   like they weren't full Jews,
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:24.360]   and so they racially profiled them.
[00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:27.320]   And so Jews, in order to get to Judea,
[00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:30.600]   they would go around Samaria.
[00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:33.440]   And this would add days to their travel.
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:34.920]   Not Jesus.
[00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:36.880]   He went right through Samaria, why?
[00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:38.940]   'Cause he was on a mission.
[00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:39.780]   Verse five.
[00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:45.240]   Eventually he came to a Samaritan village of Saqqara,
[00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:47.880]   near the field that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.
[00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:50.320]   Jacob's well was there, and Jesus,
[00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:53.680]   tired from the long walk, sat wearily beside the well
[00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:54.660]   about noontime.
[00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:58.840]   Soon a Samaritan woman came to draw water,
[00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:01.480]   and Jesus said to her, "Please give me a drink."
[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:02.440]   Verse eight.
[00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:04.520]   He was alone at the time because his disciples
[00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:06.900]   had gone into the village to buy some food.
[00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:10.640]   The woman was surprised, for Jews refuse
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:13.860]   to have anything to do with Samaritans.
[00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:16.520]   She said to Jesus, "You are a Jew,
[00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:18.860]   "and I'm a Samaritan woman.
[00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:23.200]   "Why are you asking me for a drink exactly?"
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:26.560]   If you're taking notes, point number one is his pursuit.
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:27.400]   His pursuit.
[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:32.240]   What makes Jesus' pursuit of this woman so powerful
[00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:35.000]   is this woman was an outcast of society.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.800]   We're gonna go on, the text is gonna go on
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:39.720]   and say that this woman has had five divorces,
[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:43.320]   and the man that she's living with is not even her husband.
[00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:45.840]   Now this would have been crazy, y'all.
[00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:48.480]   Like, you know, today, five divorces
[00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:50.720]   seems a little bit extreme, but first century,
[00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:53.240]   like five divorces would have been unheard of.
[00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:58.800]   And so this woman is at the well trying to get some water,
[00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:01.300]   and notice the text says at noontime.
[00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:03.200]   Why?
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:05.600]   Because this woman has been just kinda
[00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:08.200]   casted out of her society.
[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:10.900]   Like, no one's wanting to associate with her.
[00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:14.260]   Like, she got kicked out of the Samaria Girls Club,
[00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:18.960]   if you will, because she's kinda the one
[00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:22.400]   that kinda gets around the town,
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:24.740]   and she's a loose woman.
[00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:30.740]   She's going at noon 'cause she doesn't wanna be seen
[00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:33.900]   because she's embarrassed and she's shameful
[00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:35.260]   about the way she's living.
[00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:43.820]   And everyone has rejected her except one person, Jesus.
[00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:46.420]   Like, can you imagine what's going on
[00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:49.300]   in this woman's mind from her point of view?
[00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:51.220]   Like, Jesus, you're a Jew.
[00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:52.980]   Why are you asking me for water?
[00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:56.220]   Like, why are you even talking to me?
[00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:59.860]   Why are you even associating yourself with me tonight?
[00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:01.260]   Like, you might come into this place
[00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.640]   and you might feel like God has forgotten you
[00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:06.860]   because the circumstances of life seem unbearable.
[00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:08.180]   Maybe you've gone through a breakup.
[00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:10.340]   Maybe you were on the verge of getting married,
[00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:14.220]   and the whole thing just fizzled out.
[00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:16.380]   Maybe you come into this place and you lost your job
[00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:17.580]   or you didn't get that promotion,
[00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:19.060]   or you lost that loved one,
[00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:22.900]   or you're still single at 30 like I was,
[00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:25.540]   and you're just like, come on, God.
[00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:29.700]   Maybe you come into this place
[00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:31.180]   and you think you're too far gone
[00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:33.020]   because you're entrenched in your sin
[00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:36.860]   and there's no way up because you're just addicted.
[00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:40.360]   Let me tell you something.
[00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:41.920]   Way before you ever came to the porch tonight,
[00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:43.580]   Jesus has been pursuing you.
[00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:48.260]   In a world where there's almost eight billion people,
[00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:51.580]   Jesus says, "You're the one I want."
[00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:54.420]   This is what he's communicating to you.
[00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:57.100]   If you find yourself in the circumstances of life
[00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:59.820]   or you think you're too far gone because of your sin,
[00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:02.300]   Jesus is looking straight at you tonight and saying,
[00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:04.520]   "No, that's the person I want."
[00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:06.500]   Just like he looks at this woman and says,
[00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:10.260]   "Hey, let's talk.
[00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:11.780]   "I don't care about your past.
[00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:13.440]   "I don't care about your present.
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:16.740]   "Let's talk about where life is found."
[00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:20.100]   Some of you have this idea
[00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:22.100]   that Jesus is more kind of like the police,
[00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:23.180]   like a police officer.
[00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:27.380]   Your boy up here, man, he's got a need for speed.
[00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:30.540]   And so there was a month when I got three speeding tickets
[00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:33.900]   and I'm on the verge of spending some jail time,
[00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:35.380]   like real talk.
[00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:40.180]   But this is a picture of how you think Jesus is, right?
[00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:43.380]   He's just out to catch you in the act.
[00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:45.580]   When you get off sides or when you get out of bounds,
[00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:47.080]   he's just coming to get you.
[00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:50.820]   He's not going to slap your hand
[00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:52.180]   or one guy I talked to say,
[00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:53.020]   "Hey man, you wanna come to church?"
[00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:55.060]   No, if I came to church, lightning would strike.
[00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:58.400]   It's like, whoa, that's not how Jesus is.
[00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:04.820]   No, Jesus is looking at you in all of your mess,
[00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:09.320]   in the well that you're running to and saying,
[00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:10.320]   "No, I want you.
[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:16.260]   "You're the person that I love and that I want."
[00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:19.580]   And here's what I learned.
[00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:22.460]   Even when I was running from God
[00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:26.540]   for a great majority of my life,
[00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:27.900]   he was always pursuing me.
[00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:31.020]   When I was running to the next relationship
[00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:35.940]   or the next baseball game I had
[00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:39.140]   and thinking that that was gonna fulfill me
[00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:43.460]   if I did well in that game and got the affirmation
[00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:45.140]   and that a boy's from the coach
[00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:47.540]   or that next party or that bottle
[00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:50.900]   or that drug that I tried or making money,
[00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:54.220]   you know how God pursued me?
[00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:57.220]   He allowed me to be empty
[00:15:57.220 --> 00:16:00.740]   and unsatisfied with all of that.
[00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:02.980]   I felt like Solomon in Ecclesiastes
[00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:06.100]   where the whole book of Ecclesiastes
[00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:10.420]   could be summed up in one sentence, all is vanity.
[00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:13.160]   He allowed me to pursue all those things
[00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:15.820]   only to leave me empty and unsatisfied
[00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:17.060]   and unfulfilled with those things.
[00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:19.280]   It was one of the kindest things
[00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:22.460]   that God could have done for me.
[00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:24.460]   He met me at my well in all my mess.
[00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:29.620]   Listen, if you're here today, which you are,
[00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:31.860]   Jesus is after you.
[00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:36.080]   So we're gonna see how this story unfolds
[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:38.980]   and we're gonna watch how Jesus does the same
[00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:42.500]   for this woman, verse 10, John chapter four.
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:48.200]   Jesus replied, "If only you knew the gift God has for you
[00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:51.220]   "and who you're speaking to,
[00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:54.500]   "you would ask me and I would give you living water."
[00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:57.920]   Look what her response is.
[00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:01.600]   "But sir, you don't have a rope or a bucket," she said,
[00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:03.780]   "and this well is very deep.
[00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:06.400]   "Where would you get this living water?
[00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:08.220]   "And besides, do you think you're greater
[00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:11.760]   "than our ancestor Jacob who gave us this well?
[00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:16.500]   "How can you offer better water than he and his sons
[00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:17.640]   "and his animals enjoyed?"
[00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:20.600]   Jesus replied, "Anyone who drinks from this water
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:22.700]   "will soon become thirsty again,
[00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:25.760]   "but those who drink the water I give
[00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:27.620]   "will never be thirsty again.
[00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:30.560]   "It becomes a fresh, bubbling spring within them,
[00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:33.160]   "giving them eternal life."
[00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:37.920]   Verse 15, "Please, sir," the woman said,
[00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:40.200]   "give me this water."
[00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:42.400]   I think I would've said the same thing.
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:43.760]   "Then I'll never be thirsty again.
[00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:46.620]   "I won't have to come to this well and get water."
[00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:49.640]   See, she was still operating in the physical realm.
[00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:52.240]   She was still thinking that this was some physical type
[00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:55.280]   of water that Jesus was offering her.
[00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:57.520]   But then Jesus does a hard left
[00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:04.840]   and he looks deep within her soul and exposes something.
[00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:09.500]   And I believe the most gentle, loving,
[00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:11.440]   but convicting way, verse 16.
[00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:14.340]   "Go and get your husband," Jesus told her.
[00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:16.800]   "I don't have a husband," the woman replied.
[00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:18.000]   Jesus said, "You're right.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.400]   "Thanks for your honesty.
[00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:22.800]   "You don't have a husband, for you have had five husbands
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:24.040]   "and you aren't even married
[00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:26.240]   "to the man you're living with now."
[00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:29.120]   And she said, "You have certainly spoken the truth.
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:34.120]   "Sir," the woman said, "you must be a prophet."
[00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:36.880]   Point number two, if you're taking notes, his promise.
[00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:40.660]   His promise, Jesus is looking at this woman
[00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:43.180]   and he's promising her living water,
[00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:45.980]   water that quenches every longing this woman
[00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:46.820]   would ever have.
[00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:49.320]   And from the text, we see that the greatest longing
[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:52.020]   that this woman had was a longing to be loved.
[00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:56.260]   But she was looking in all the wrong places for that love.
[00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:59.940]   For her, she had been drinking at the well of men.
[00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:02.100]   She had gone through one broken relationship
[00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:05.140]   after another relationship after another relationship.
[00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:06.960]   Now she's at a point where she's just like,
[00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:09.380]   "Man, I'm just giving up on marriage,
[00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:10.880]   "but I don't wanna be single and alone,
[00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:12.860]   "so I'll just shack up with this guy
[00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:14.420]   "and we'll just be roommates.
[00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:17.360]   "And we'll just live together."
[00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:22.480]   And she keeps going back to the same empty well.
[00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:26.520]   And Jesus looks at her in the most loving way
[00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:33.560]   and just says, "Hey, do you want a water that will satisfy
[00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:37.480]   "the deepest longings of your soul?"
[00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:41.200]   See, the fact that Jesus wasn't driven away from this woman
[00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:46.200]   because of all her issues shows us the heart of the Father.
[00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:50.620]   Like in other words, He's not driven away from anything,
[00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:55.540]   He's driven closer to the issues of this woman.
[00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:57.120]   See, this is God's heart for us.
[00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:57.960]   Why?
[00:19:57.960 --> 00:19:59.120]   Because Jesus' main mission in life
[00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:03.260]   was to pursue and save sinners by giving them a promise.
[00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:05.840]   What's that promise? That He alone is living water,
[00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:07.560]   that He alone is the source of life.
[00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:10.800]   And the reason any of us find ourselves not satisfied
[00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:15.400]   is because we're going to the wrong well to drink.
[00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:18.980]   I liken it to this.
[00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:26.280]   Imagine just, this is a bucket,
[00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:30.720]   and you're trying to get filled by the bucket of people.
[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:32.000]   Like you're thinking, "Hey, people
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.760]   "or is what's going to fulfill me?"
[00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:38.300]   This relationship, this friendship, this date,
[00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:40.140]   ultimately, hopefully it leads to a marriage,
[00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:43.200]   and we run to the bucket of people
[00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:47.640]   thinking that this bucket is going to fulfill us
[00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:51.700]   because we have this possible daddy wound,
[00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:55.600]   and we were never affirmed by our dad.
[00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:57.440]   And so we jump from one relationship
[00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:59.520]   to another relationship to another relationship
[00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:02.040]   thinking that that man is going to satisfy.
[00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:03.200]   I have two little girls,
[00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:05.360]   and every day I say three things to them.
[00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:08.480]   I say, "Hey, baby, daddy loves you.
[00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:12.320]   "I mean, I love you, not because of your performance,
[00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:14.020]   "not because of anything you do or don't do.
[00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:17.400]   "I love you because you're mine, you're my daughter.
[00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:20.440]   "And baby, you're special to me.
[00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:23.480]   "And lastly, you are beautiful,
[00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:27.160]   "not because you wear princess dresses and put makeup on,
[00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:31.520]   "but because of how God has created you."
[00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:36.240]   And some of us, if we had to be honest with ourself tonight,
[00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:40.020]   we never experienced those types of words.
[00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:44.520]   We never experienced with specificity that from our dad.
[00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:49.300]   I mean, last time I taught, I said, "I have a mama wound."
[00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:54.160]   And this mama wound just plays out in really broken ways
[00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:56.600]   where I think that people, this is my ditch sometimes.
[00:21:56.600 --> 00:22:00.200]   I want the affirmation and the praise of people.
[00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:03.880]   And so that's why I've ran to teachers and coaches
[00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:07.400]   and other people's parents to try to get attaboys.
[00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:13.760]   This is why some of you, man, you run to thirst traps, man.
[00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:15.000]   You know who I'm talking about.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:19.320]   Like you post things just to get affirmation
[00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:21.840]   because you never got it when you were a kid.
[00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:24.440]   And you don't believe that God's approval of you,
[00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:27.760]   what he says of you, who you are in Christ is enough.
[00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:30.040]   So that's why you post things and you do things
[00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:34.440]   and you say things to get the world's approval.
[00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:36.140]   And so you run to the bucket of people
[00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:38.940]   only to find out that they're broken.
[00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:43.220]   For you, it might not be people, it might be pleasure.
[00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:46.520]   Like you run to the bucket of pleasure
[00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:50.240]   and you run to sex or porn.
[00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:52.080]   And this is what, let me say this for a second.
[00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:53.980]   You know why I ran to porn?
[00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:57.620]   For a decade of my life is because
[00:22:57.620 --> 00:22:59.960]   I had a desire to be desired.
[00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:05.480]   I wanted to be wanted.
[00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:11.540]   And so in those few minutes where I could escape reality
[00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:15.740]   from not feeling wanted by my mama,
[00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:21.860]   I escaped reality and I went to that two-dimensional image
[00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:24.620]   thinking that hey, this would satisfy me,
[00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:27.660]   this pleasure of porn would do it,
[00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:32.140]   but it only left me more and more thirsty.
[00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:34.460]   Some of you, it's not porn, it's just the party, man.
[00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:36.300]   It's just that drug, it's just that drink
[00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:38.780]   and you have way too many.
[00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:40.580]   And so it leads you to do stupid things,
[00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:42.460]   but you kinda like it because you can just
[00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:44.780]   blame it on the alcohol.
[00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:48.140]   Or for you, it's like whatever that blank is,
[00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:50.300]   if I just get to that next season,
[00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:53.380]   what's that next season that you wanna get to?
[00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:56.580]   Is it the season of marriage?
[00:23:56.580 --> 00:23:58.400]   Or just the season of getting that date?
[00:23:58.400 --> 00:23:59.980]   Or maybe if you're married, you're like,
[00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:01.220]   man, if I could just have kids.
[00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:03.660]   And it doesn't stop, y'all,
[00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:07.020]   because not only people is broken,
[00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:10.060]   but pleasure's broken and performance is broken.
[00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:12.780]   And before it was like, hey, I wanna pad my stats
[00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:14.340]   in the baseball field, that's where I'm gonna find
[00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:18.780]   my performance, that's where I'm gonna find my worth.
[00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:21.720]   And today, after Christ, for me, it's like,
[00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:23.220]   I wanna build a bigger stage for myself.
[00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:25.620]   I wanna live in that neighborhood or that zip code
[00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:27.140]   or I wanna get to that tax bracket
[00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:30.260]   or I wanna get to that car, I want that car.
[00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:34.060]   And it just doesn't stop.
[00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:38.640]   And so you just run from people to pleasure to performance.
[00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:43.220]   And some of these things, if I had to be honest tonight,
[00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:44.780]   they're broken, but they're not necessarily
[00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:48.020]   bad in and of themselves because if you put Jesus
[00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:50.180]   at the center of all those things,
[00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:55.260]   like He can do amazing things with the people in your life,
[00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:57.300]   even the pleasures that you have.
[00:24:57.300 --> 00:25:00.180]   Like there's some good and holy pleasure
[00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:02.500]   that you can redeem for the glory of God
[00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:06.460]   or the performance that you're running on.
[00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:10.460]   Like, man, go get it.
[00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:12.820]   Go build something.
[00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:14.300]   Go create something.
[00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:17.500]   Have significance.
[00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:22.260]   I mean, if you wanna make money, go make money.
[00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:24.220]   But at what expense, y'all?
[00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:26.860]   The expense that you can't be a Christian
[00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:29.140]   and do the things that this book is saying to do
[00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:31.640]   and it's only gonna leave you more and more broken?
[00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:38.180]   Like if you're trying to find success in your significance,
[00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:41.500]   or if you're trying to find significance in your success,
[00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:44.480]   like it will never fully satisfy.
[00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:48.440]   And this is what God in His kindness
[00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:51.200]   is trying to share with this woman tonight.
[00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:54.160]   The truth is is God could give you
[00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:55.960]   everything you ever wanted.
[00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:59.820]   Whatever future season out there
[00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:01.760]   that you're thinking that you want,
[00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:03.680]   and it still would not satisfy you.
[00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:07.960]   And sometimes in His kindness, He gives you everything
[00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:10.800]   just to show you that it won't ever fulfill.
[00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:12.200]   And sometimes in His kindness,
[00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:13.760]   He doesn't give you everything.
[00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:17.720]   Because He's trying to save you from pain,
[00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:20.640]   heartache, and greater levels of brokenness.
[00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:26.560]   See, a lot of you, man, I talk to you
[00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:28.640]   and you claim, "Jesus is my living water.
[00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:30.760]   "Like He's my fulfillment."
[00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:32.220]   You got that verse in the bio,
[00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:35.340]   and you would say that He alone satisfies you.
[00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:37.640]   But if I was to follow you for a whole week
[00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:39.560]   and I would go where you go,
[00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:42.120]   I would listen to how you speak,
[00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:44.520]   I would watch the decisions that you make.
[00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:49.680]   Would your actions be aligned with your words?
[00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:56.240]   And listen, I don't ask that to put guilt on you.
[00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:58.560]   Like, I want that for me.
[00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:00.440]   Like, that's why I'm in community with other men
[00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:04.160]   who can walk with me and observe things in me
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:06.720]   and point out things that are inconsistent
[00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:07.840]   with the character of Christ,
[00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:11.600]   because at the, at the hardest of hearts,
[00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:12.960]   like, I wanna be God's man.
[00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:17.400]   And some of us tonight, man, we say one thing,
[00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:20.800]   but we do another thing, and it's just downright confusing.
[00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:22.960]   And we keep making excuses as to why
[00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:25.400]   we're not really all in.
[00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:30.480]   It's kind of like,
[00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:34.400]   you can answer that if you need to.
[00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:36.120]   (congregation laughing)
[00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:37.720]   It's kind of like salt water.
[00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:41.280]   I don't know if you know much about salt water,
[00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:45.680]   but salt water, it makes up 70% of the planet.
[00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:46.920]   Do you know that?
[00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:49.600]   That was something I learned this week.
[00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:53.320]   And only 1% is fresh water.
[00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:55.880]   And so if I was to ask you, like,
[00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:58.240]   how much would you have to drink?
[00:27:58.240 --> 00:27:59.120]   Like, if you were thirsty,
[00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:01.160]   you go back to my story in the beginning.
[00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:03.480]   Like, if I just started drinking salt water,
[00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:06.480]   like, how much would I have to drink to be satisfied?
[00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:08.320]   Maybe I should try, no, I'm just playing.
[00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:09.920]   I'm not gonna do that.
[00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:12.720]   I tried it early, and it was gross, y'all.
[00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:14.280]   But how much would I have to drink to be satisfied?
[00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:16.880]   Here's the thing, if you know anything about salt water,
[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:20.200]   there's not an amount that you could drink to be satisfied.
[00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:24.720]   It only leaves you more and more thirsty
[00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:28.000]   the more and more salt water that you drink.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.880]   And it's like God in his kindness is looking at this woman,
[00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:32.280]   and he's looking at you and I tonight,
[00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:33.120]   and he's saying, hey,
[00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:35.680]   you can keep chasing the bucket of people,
[00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:37.880]   the bucket of pleasure, the bucket of performance,
[00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:40.360]   but if I'm not at the center of those things,
[00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:43.480]   listen, you're drinking salt water,
[00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:46.360]   and it's only gonna leave you more and more thirsty
[00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:50.240]   in this life and in the life to come.
[00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:52.200]   Like, it won't end well for you.
[00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:53.280]   Proverbs 14, 12 says,
[00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:55.040]   "There's a way that seems right to man,
[00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:58.040]   and that way ends in death."
[00:28:58.040 --> 00:28:59.920]   And I'm not just talking about physical death,
[00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:01.760]   I'm talking about spiritual death,
[00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:05.160]   separation forever and ever from your creator,
[00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:06.960]   the one that's pumping breath into your lung,
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:08.240]   that's giving you a heart that beats,
[00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:10.200]   eyes that see, a body that functions.
[00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:19.000]   And I believe that when we really double down on
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:24.040]   who God is and who we are,
[00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:28.960]   like it puts us in the right perspective
[00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:32.300]   to see what this woman's about to see.
[00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:36.080]   Like this woman believes that there's more to life
[00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:38.660]   than the things that she's been pursuing.
[00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:41.000]   It goes on and says in verse 25, check this out,
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.440]   the woman said, "I know the Messiah is coming."
[00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:46.060]   See, that's important, because if you were a Jew,
[00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:49.420]   like you look forward to this Messiah,
[00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:53.060]   this God who would come and save the people,
[00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:58.000]   and they were, you know, looking forward to that day,
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.680]   so she had something in her body,
[00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:03.680]   like hardwired, like God is hardwired.
[00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:06.600]   We see in Ecclesiastes chapter three, verse 11,
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:08.200]   that God has written eternity in the hearts
[00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:09.640]   of every man and every woman.
[00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:12.480]   And so even you know
[00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:15.440]   that there's something greater out there.
[00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:17.600]   And so she says, "I know the Messiah is coming,
[00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:19.280]   "the one who is called Christ,
[00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:22.760]   "and when he comes, he will explain everything to us."
[00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:25.280]   She's still not connecting the dots, y'all.
[00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:27.640]   So what does Jesus do in his kindness?
[00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:32.640]   Verse 26, "Then Jesus told her, 'I am the Messiah.
[00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:34.320]   "'I am the Messiah.'"
[00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:37.760]   Jesus told this woman that he already was the living water,
[00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:39.640]   that he would quench her thirst.
[00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:42.600]   Then Jesus showed the sin that she had been committing
[00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:45.160]   and the sin that she was currently living in,
[00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:47.000]   and she still didn't connect the dots.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.840]   She still thought Jesus was speaking in code
[00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:50.540]   and being cryptic, but Jesus said,
[00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:53.380]   "Hey, let me just set the record straight.
[00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:54.860]   "I'm the Messiah.
[00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:56.260]   "I'm not a prophet.
[00:30:56.260 --> 00:30:58.060]   "I'm not just a good teacher.
[00:30:58.060 --> 00:31:00.920]   "I'm not just some religious person.
[00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:04.300]   "Like I am the one that you have been waiting for,
[00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:07.040]   "the one that you have been thinking about
[00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:10.780]   "and you have read about in the Old Testament.
[00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:12.000]   "I am on the scene.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.980]   "I am God, the one who had been,
[00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:17.280]   "that they would have been anticipating back then."
[00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:21.320]   See, the greatest promise that you and I
[00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:26.320]   could put our faith in is that Jesus is the Messiah.
[00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:28.420]   In other words, Jesus is God,
[00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:32.820]   that he didn't just come and just do some cool miracles
[00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:36.100]   and give the blind sight and the lame walks,
[00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:39.200]   and he didn't just come and teach some good things
[00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:44.200]   like love your neighbor as yourself, the golden rule.
[00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:46.760]   No, no, he ultimately did those things
[00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:51.760]   so that people would see that he was the Messiah,
[00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:53.500]   that he was God.
[00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:57.160]   And the ultimate act that he and I did for you and I
[00:31:57.160 --> 00:32:00.200]   was that he died on the cross for our sin.
[00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:03.420]   That you and I know, man, that we're not perfect,
[00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:05.540]   that we're broken, and then there's a chasm
[00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:07.720]   between us and God.
[00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:12.460]   And the only bridge that is suffice
[00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:14.620]   for that chasm is the cross.
[00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:16.860]   It's not your good works, it's not your religiosity,
[00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:18.220]   it's not your porch attendance.
[00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:21.420]   It's only what Christ has done for us on the cross.
[00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:24.540]   And so all of our sin was poured out on him at the cross,
[00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:27.160]   and he soaked up the wrath and the judgment
[00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:30.920]   that you and I should receive.
[00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:34.640]   Scripture says, and history records,
[00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:37.560]   that he didn't just die, but he rose again on the third day
[00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:38.880]   to defeat sin and death,
[00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:41.120]   and now the ball is in your court and my court.
[00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:43.040]   What are you gonna do with Jesus?
[00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:47.640]   And it's the greatest message out there.
[00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:50.960]   There's not another message that you could proclaim
[00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:54.660]   or embody that's going to give you life now
[00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:56.700]   and the life to come.
[00:32:56.700 --> 00:32:59.620]   And so this is my story, man.
[00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:01.460]   It was a Saturday night.
[00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:04.620]   I had just finished playing a three-game series,
[00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:07.020]   and boys were getting ready to go to the party,
[00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:08.820]   and my roommates, and also my teammates,
[00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:11.220]   and I just said, guys, I'm taking this one off,
[00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:14.020]   and I finally just said to myself,
[00:33:14.020 --> 00:33:17.180]   hey, what is my purpose in life?
[00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:18.700]   What kind of life does my,
[00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:20.860]   what kind of meaning does my life have?
[00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:23.080]   And I got real with those questions,
[00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:25.120]   and I asked myself, where am I going when I died?
[00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:30.120]   And God met me right there in my sin,
[00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:34.420]   and it was this unbelievable conviction of sin,
[00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:39.420]   but comfort of his promise that I wasn't too far gone,
[00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:44.640]   and only a God who can give you conviction of sin,
[00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:48.600]   but comfort in his promise simultaneously
[00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:50.780]   is a God worth following,
[00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:53.500]   that he didn't expect me to go and make things right.
[00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:55.180]   I couldn't make it right,
[00:33:55.180 --> 00:33:58.300]   but he helped my eyes look to the cross,
[00:33:58.300 --> 00:34:00.380]   look to what he had done for me,
[00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:02.600]   and I'm like, that's my sin on the cross,
[00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:04.540]   and I stopped comparing my life to everyone else,
[00:34:04.540 --> 00:34:06.640]   even people in the church, and when I did,
[00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:09.380]   my mouth was stopped of all justification
[00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:12.520]   because you and I know that if we keep comparing our life
[00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:14.280]   to other people in the church,
[00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:16.540]   we can always find someone worse than us,
[00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:18.900]   and so I would justify that I was not,
[00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:20.780]   I was a pretty good person, I'm fine.
[00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:22.940]   Not that night.
[00:34:22.940 --> 00:34:27.420]   It stopped, and God met me,
[00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:30.220]   and Jesus provided not just conviction of sin,
[00:34:30.220 --> 00:34:31.820]   but the promise of hope,
[00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:33.460]   and so we see from this passage
[00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:36.300]   that Jesus is not just saving this woman from something,
[00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:39.660]   her sin, but he's saving her to something.
[00:34:39.660 --> 00:34:42.060]   He saved her to tell others about him.
[00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:44.300]   If Jesus saved you, then you share it.
[00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:46.140]   Like, he didn't just need to coach her up and say,
[00:34:46.140 --> 00:34:48.300]   okay, this is how you go and share about me.
[00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:51.860]   No, he just said, hey, this is who I am.
[00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:52.860]   Now, what are you gonna do with it?
[00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:54.060]   Watch how she responds.
[00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:56.380]   Verse 28, this is one of my favorite parts
[00:34:56.380 --> 00:34:57.700]   of this entire passage.
[00:34:57.700 --> 00:35:00.260]   The woman left her water jar beside the well
[00:35:00.260 --> 00:35:03.000]   and ran back to the village telling everyone,
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:08.740]   come and see a man who told me everything I ever did.
[00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:10.700]   Could it possibly be the Messiah?
[00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:13.740]   So people came streaming from the village to see him.
[00:35:13.740 --> 00:35:16.140]   Point number three, if you're taking notes, his purpose.
[00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:19.340]   So not only do we see his pursuit,
[00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:22.060]   we see his promise, and now we see his purpose.
[00:35:22.060 --> 00:35:22.900]   Did you catch that?
[00:35:22.900 --> 00:35:25.280]   She left the one thing that she thought
[00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:27.000]   was gonna quench her thirst, why?
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.580]   Because this woman was discovering a purpose
[00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:30.820]   by which she was made for.
[00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:34.100]   She came to this well trying to be filled physically.
[00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:38.480]   She didn't realize her spiritual and emotional dehydration,
[00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:41.400]   and God points it out, and he says,
[00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:43.940]   no, you don't just need physical water.
[00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:47.340]   You need spiritual water, and Jesus changes her life
[00:35:47.340 --> 00:35:50.860]   and begins to change her purpose.
[00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:53.120]   And the Bible goes on record to say
[00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:56.300]   that this woman was the first convert in Samaria,
[00:35:56.300 --> 00:35:58.380]   and it led to a mighty move of God
[00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:00.540]   among the Gentiles in that town.
[00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:03.460]   Verse 39 of John chapter four,
[00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:06.280]   many of the Samaritans from that town, what did they do?
[00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:09.700]   They believed in him because of the woman's testimony.
[00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:12.580]   He told me all that I had ever did.
[00:36:12.580 --> 00:36:14.180]   Don't miss this.
[00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:17.420]   Your purpose and my purpose in life
[00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:20.180]   is to know Jesus and to make him known.
[00:36:20.180 --> 00:36:21.580]   Like, that's it.
[00:36:21.580 --> 00:36:23.980]   Like, if you don't leave with anything else,
[00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:27.060]   leave with this purpose that you are called to know Jesus
[00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:28.620]   and to make him known.
[00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:31.060]   Every promise that God gives us
[00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:34.240]   comes prepackaged with a purpose, and I'm thankful, man,
[00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:37.000]   that God didn't just save me from my sin.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   Like, he saved me to go out with this incredible purpose
[00:36:42.140 --> 00:36:44.540]   that wherever I go, whether I'm, you know,
[00:36:44.540 --> 00:36:46.040]   a young adult pastor full-time,
[00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:48.260]   or whether I'm a husband of Kathy
[00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:50.740]   and, you know, a dad of three kids,
[00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:52.380]   or whether I'm going out to a restaurant,
[00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:55.620]   or I'm going to a coffee shop, or I'm going to buy clothes,
[00:36:55.620 --> 00:36:57.140]   for me, it's probably shoes.
[00:36:57.140 --> 00:36:59.220]   And so wherever I go, man,
[00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:02.820]   like, I am just proclaiming who Christ is.
[00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:04.200]   Like, this is your purpose.
[00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:07.340]   And listen, like, you just share what you know.
[00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:10.180]   I think sometimes we overcomplicate this thing.
[00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:12.880]   Like, we're like, man, what do you mean?
[00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:15.640]   Like, I don't know about that.
[00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:16.900]   That seems weird.
[00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:20.120]   It's not, man.
[00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:24.560]   Like, this is, I'm just telling you, man,
[00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:28.380]   ever since my junior year in college, I've opened this book.
[00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:30.880]   I've gathered around with some men,
[00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:33.600]   and I just said, hey, based on what we're reading here,
[00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:35.000]   what's God calling us to do?
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.080]   Okay, great.
[00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:38.540]   He's calling us to go serve?
[00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:39.920]   All right, I'm gonna go serve.
[00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:43.040]   He's calling me to be all in with the church,
[00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:44.560]   and become a church member,
[00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:46.360]   and be a part of that body of Christ,
[00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:48.560]   because his church is his hands, his feet,
[00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:50.080]   his eyes, his mouth, his ears.
[00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:51.500]   Okay, I'm gonna go all in with the church.
[00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:54.160]   Okay, he's calling me to repent of sin,
[00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:56.160]   do a turning from sin, and a turning to him.
[00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:58.400]   Okay, so I'm gonna constantly repent of sin.
[00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:00.520]   When sin is in my life, I'm gonna confess that to him.
[00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:04.140]   I'm gonna confess that to my trusted brothers.
[00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:06.280]   Oh, he's calling me to go share the gospel?
[00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:07.640]   Okay, I'm gonna do that.
[00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:09.440]   I mean, just the other day, man.
[00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:12.240]   I'm like, I gotta go get a fade.
[00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:13.840]   So hey, who knows a barber?
[00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:14.760]   Okay, you know a barber?
[00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:16.840]   Okay, I'm gonna go to the barber shop.
[00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:19.040]   And so I come across this barber, BJ.
[00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:20.440]   I'm like, what's up, BJ?
[00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:22.720]   I heard you're the best in town, bro.
[00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:24.560]   He's like, well, that's kind.
[00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:25.680]   I'm like, no, for real.
[00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:28.280]   I heard athletes fly you out, man.
[00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:30.120]   And my boy over here, he's paying for it,
[00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:31.040]   so we good, man.
[00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:34.720]   And so we're sitting here talking, man,
[00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:39.480]   and BJ's got Michael Jordan days up on the TV.
[00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:43.560]   I mean, the Dynasty days, and we're talking basketball.
[00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:46.240]   We're talking Dallas Mavericks, Luka Dakti.
[00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:47.520]   I've just butchered that, right?
[00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:48.360]   Whoop!
[00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:49.200]   (congregation laughing)
[00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:51.040]   And man, we're just talking basketball,
[00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:53.000]   'cause that's the season of life we're in, go Mavs.
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.520]   And I'm like, no, man, Mavs are the best, bro.
[00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:57.500]   I think Luka Dakti, he might be the best ever.
[00:38:57.500 --> 00:39:00.600]   That might be a stretch, but bear with me.
[00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:01.680]   No, Michael Jordan's the GOAT.
[00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:03.280]   Okay, cool, we're on the same page.
[00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:05.000]   And we're just talking life.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   And I look at him, I just said, hey, bro,
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:10.880]   I know this is, I'm downshifting now,
[00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:13.720]   but before I leave, man, you hooked me up.
[00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:14.800]   I love it, thank you.
[00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:18.840]   But if you were to die tonight, man, where would you go?
[00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:20.280]   Heaven or hell?
[00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:21.840]   And he looks at me with all sincerity,
[00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:23.200]   and he says, man, I'd go to heaven.
[00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:24.400]   I said, can I ask you one more question?
[00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:25.760]   He's like, sure.
[00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:26.600]   I was like, why?
[00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:29.440]   He said, because I'm a good person, man.
[00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:33.940]   I said, hey, man, thank you for your honesty.
[00:39:33.940 --> 00:39:36.980]   You know I thought that for 22 years of my life.
[00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:39.820]   I said, BJ, if you could get to heaven
[00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:40.700]   by being a good person,
[00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:43.020]   what was the point of Jesus dying on the cross?
[00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:48.300]   He looks at me, he's like, man, you got me.
[00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:50.860]   I said, man, bro, I'm not here to get you.
[00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:52.760]   I'm here to just share the hope that lies within me.
[00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:54.760]   Like, seriously, bro, if you're saying,
[00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:57.140]   hey, I can get to heaven by my good works,
[00:39:57.140 --> 00:40:00.020]   you're basically saying I don't need Jesus,
[00:40:00.020 --> 00:40:02.020]   and you're taking away from what he did for you
[00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:04.100]   on the cross, you're stealing glory from him,
[00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:06.940]   and you're placing glory on yourself.
[00:40:06.940 --> 00:40:07.780]   You understand that?
[00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:09.380]   I said, yeah, bro, that makes sense.
[00:40:09.380 --> 00:40:13.020]   And I'm like, hey, dude, here's the problem.
[00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:15.140]   We can't do enough to get to God.
[00:40:15.140 --> 00:40:16.940]   The Bible says that we've been saved by grace through faith,
[00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:18.340]   not of ourselves, but as a gift from God,
[00:40:18.340 --> 00:40:19.420]   so that no man may boast.
[00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:21.540]   If you and I could get to heaven based on our good works
[00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:22.660]   or our church attendance,
[00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:24.340]   then we would surely boast about it.
[00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:26.360]   And that's kind of like what you did, man.
[00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:27.520]   He's like, yeah, I know, I did.
[00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:29.260]   I was boasting about my good works.
[00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:34.100]   I said, you're stealing glory away from the God
[00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:35.780]   who created you.
[00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:39.540]   And everything in us, bro, there's a part in all of us,
[00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:40.580]   God's hardwired it,
[00:40:40.580 --> 00:40:43.140]   we wanna connect back to our creator
[00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:45.180]   because this world is broken, right?
[00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:46.700]   Like you can't get away from that.
[00:40:46.700 --> 00:40:49.180]   Everywhere you look, the news you turn on,
[00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:51.020]   the headlines you read on social media,
[00:40:51.020 --> 00:40:53.860]   like there's brokenness all around us.
[00:40:53.860 --> 00:40:58.860]   And I said, Jesus came to give us hope.
[00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:00.820]   For that brokenness.
[00:41:00.820 --> 00:41:04.320]   And what you do with Jesus,
[00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:07.260]   you ask him to forgive you of your sins.
[00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:09.760]   You place your trust in what he's done for you,
[00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:11.760]   not what you do for yourself.
[00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:15.540]   Bible says he'll save you, he'll forgive you of all sins.
[00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:17.420]   We don't work for our salvation, bro,
[00:41:17.420 --> 00:41:19.060]   but we sure as heck work from it.
[00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:24.900]   I'm not sharing this gospel with you because I have to,
[00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:26.380]   bro, I'm sharing it because it's just,
[00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:27.260]   it's welling up in me.
[00:41:27.260 --> 00:41:29.060]   I can't, man, every time I look at somebody,
[00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:31.260]   I'm like, bro, there's an eternity there.
[00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:35.200]   There's an eternity there.
[00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:37.300]   And he's like, I got questions.
[00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:39.100]   I said, I don't have all the answers,
[00:41:39.100 --> 00:41:40.180]   but let's continue to talk.
[00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:41.140]   So we are.
[00:41:41.140 --> 00:41:45.380]   I said, bro, you're my barber, let's do this.
[00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:48.100]   I said, I don't know if I can afford coming every week,
[00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:50.500]   but unless you're trying to give me a discount.
[00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:52.740]   And so we're in this conversation.
[00:41:52.740 --> 00:41:53.580]   I think sometimes, man,
[00:41:53.580 --> 00:41:56.700]   we just overcomplicate what it looks like to follow Jesus
[00:41:56.700 --> 00:41:58.820]   and know him and to make him known.
[00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:07.120]   As I close, I want to go back to the start of the message.
[00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:10.680]   And we're sitting there, we're dehydrated,
[00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:12.300]   we're lacking water.
[00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:13.740]   And this is no joke, man.
[00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:16.780]   I was thinking that, hey, this was the end.
[00:42:16.780 --> 00:42:18.180]   I looked at Kathy, I said,
[00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:20.180]   well, baby, it's been a good five months.
[00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:24.340]   And I just said, I know.
[00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:25.940]   And we started arguing.
[00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:26.780]   We started fighting.
[00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:28.140]   It's like, we start blaming each other
[00:42:28.140 --> 00:42:30.860]   and we can't go anymore.
[00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:33.620]   Like, we're just exhausted to the point of,
[00:42:33.620 --> 00:42:37.860]   hey, either God sends someone to help us
[00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:41.520]   or like, I need some water.
[00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:45.500]   And so it's getting dark
[00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:50.500]   and we see people walking down the canyon.
[00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:54.620]   Like, they stop because they're like,
[00:42:54.620 --> 00:42:57.140]   man, we haven't seen anybody walking back up.
[00:42:57.140 --> 00:43:01.100]   And I'm like, well, yeah, no duh.
[00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:03.780]   We probably should have stayed down there.
[00:43:03.780 --> 00:43:05.860]   But we don't have a hotel.
[00:43:05.860 --> 00:43:06.940]   And they're like, are you okay?
[00:43:06.940 --> 00:43:08.380]   I'm like, no, we're not okay.
[00:43:08.380 --> 00:43:11.180]   And so in that moment, they said,
[00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:13.140]   hey, well, we have water and we have some snacks.
[00:43:13.140 --> 00:43:14.580]   We even got a cool towel, you want it?
[00:43:14.580 --> 00:43:15.660]   And we're like, yeah.
[00:43:15.660 --> 00:43:18.700]   But you know what we wanted the most
[00:43:18.700 --> 00:43:20.700]   in that moment was just water.
[00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:22.740]   And we just started crushing water.
[00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:25.140]   Just crushing water.
[00:43:25.140 --> 00:43:29.700]   And I share that with you
[00:43:29.700 --> 00:43:36.140]   because that's a picture of what God wants you to do
[00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:38.540]   when you wake up tomorrow morning
[00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:40.240]   or when you go out to eat tonight.
[00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:46.500]   Like, they saw a need and they had the thing
[00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:49.340]   that would help the need.
[00:43:49.340 --> 00:43:52.000]   The need was dehydration and they had the water.
[00:43:53.180 --> 00:43:55.740]   And so I'm speaking to you Christian tonight.
[00:43:55.740 --> 00:44:00.260]   You have the supplies.
[00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:02.340]   You have the message of Christ.
[00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:06.040]   And there's gonna be people that you come across
[00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:07.820]   that are thirsty.
[00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:09.900]   Not for water, per se.
[00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:11.780]   They might be, give them water.
[00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:14.900]   But more so, they're gonna be thirsty,
[00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:18.860]   spiritually, emotionally.
[00:44:18.860 --> 00:44:21.660]   And they're trying everything underneath the sun,
[00:44:21.660 --> 00:44:23.860]   trying to fulfill that need.
[00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:26.500]   And it can only be fulfilled
[00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:29.820]   by what Christ has done for them.
[00:44:29.820 --> 00:44:33.540]   And so when you wake up and you go to your office
[00:44:33.540 --> 00:44:36.000]   at Deloitte or wherever you work tomorrow morning,
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.920]   you're gonna come across thirsty people.
[00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:44.620]   And my charge to you tonight is just share what you know.
[00:44:44.620 --> 00:44:48.780]   In your kindness and the love that God has poured out
[00:44:48.780 --> 00:44:52.340]   on your life, just ask good questions.
[00:44:52.340 --> 00:44:54.180]   Show 'em that you care.
[00:44:54.180 --> 00:44:58.420]   Like, how unloving would that couple had to be
[00:44:58.420 --> 00:45:03.820]   to notice that we were struggling with dehydration,
[00:45:03.820 --> 00:45:06.180]   they have water, and not share that water?
[00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:07.620]   Like, that would be pretty unloving.
[00:45:07.620 --> 00:45:08.920]   They'd just pass us by.
[00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:14.500]   And that's a picture of some of us today.
[00:45:14.500 --> 00:45:16.300]   That we keep passing people by,
[00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:19.220]   and we have the hope from this book,
[00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:21.740]   we have the gospel, the good news of Jesus Christ,
[00:45:21.740 --> 00:45:23.520]   and we're just not sharing it.
[00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:28.160]   Like, we're not even attempting to build bridges
[00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:31.900]   to the people that we're coming across in this life.
[00:45:31.900 --> 00:45:34.700]   And so my charge for you tonight
[00:45:34.700 --> 00:45:40.060]   is that you would see God's pursuit of you.
[00:45:40.060 --> 00:45:42.740]   He's after you.
[00:45:42.740 --> 00:45:44.580]   You would see his promise.
[00:45:44.580 --> 00:45:46.500]   He's promising living water,
[00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:49.900]   a water that will always quench your thirst.
[00:45:49.900 --> 00:45:55.280]   And he's inviting you into the greatest purpose
[00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:56.700]   that you could ever have,
[00:45:56.700 --> 00:46:00.140]   to know your creator,
[00:46:00.140 --> 00:46:04.180]   and to make him known through the person of Jesus.
[00:46:04.180 --> 00:46:09.700]   Acts 20, 24 says, "But my life is worth nothing to me,
[00:46:09.700 --> 00:46:11.600]   "unless I use it for finishing the work
[00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:14.020]   "assigned to me by my Lord Jesus,
[00:46:14.020 --> 00:46:16.380]   "the work of telling others the good news
[00:46:16.380 --> 00:46:18.100]   "about his wonderful grace."
[00:46:18.100 --> 00:46:22.940]   And so tonight, I'm asking, I'm pleading, I'm begging you,
[00:46:22.940 --> 00:46:24.240]   don't waste your life, man.
[00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:26.980]   Don't miss out on opportunities,
[00:46:26.980 --> 00:46:30.860]   because there's nothing that's gonna fulfill you
[00:46:30.860 --> 00:46:32.740]   like what we talked about tonight.
[00:46:32.740 --> 00:46:33.620]   Let me pray that you would.
[00:46:33.620 --> 00:46:37.840]   God, Father, I pray that you would help us see,
[00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:41.500]   not just with our physical eyes,
[00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:42.840]   but with our spiritual eyes,
[00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:45.020]   that you're the only one that can satisfy.
[00:46:45.020 --> 00:46:52.340]   God, I know that people come into this place tonight,
[00:46:52.340 --> 00:46:56.860]   and they're drinking from the wrong wells,
[00:46:56.860 --> 00:47:00.720]   and they're doing the same thing over and over and over,
[00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:04.780]   thinking that it's gonna lead to change,
[00:47:04.780 --> 00:47:06.340]   thinking that's gonna lead to fulfillment,
[00:47:06.340 --> 00:47:09.460]   thinking that's gonna lead to satisfaction,
[00:47:09.460 --> 00:47:12.560]   and that's really the definition of insanity.
[00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:14.940]   And so for those that aren't drinking
[00:47:14.940 --> 00:47:16.540]   from the well of Christ,
[00:47:16.540 --> 00:47:19.940]   would you call them to drink from that well tonight?
[00:47:19.940 --> 00:47:23.900]   And those who are and have drank from the well of Christ,
[00:47:23.900 --> 00:47:28.060]   would they go and share that with the people around them?
[00:47:28.060 --> 00:47:31.300]   For your glory, for our joy, and for the world's good,
[00:47:31.300 --> 00:47:33.100]   it's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
