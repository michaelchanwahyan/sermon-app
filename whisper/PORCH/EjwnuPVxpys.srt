1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:22,720
 - All right, how about that transition?

3
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:23,560
 Let's go.

4
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:24,780
 (audience laughing)

5
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:25,760
 Man, welcome to the porch.

6
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,600
 My name is David.

7
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,360
 We are so excited to finish off this series tonight

8
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,880
 and dive in it with you.

9
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,240
 Have you guys ever had something

10
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,000
 that ended up going away where you're like,

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,280
 man, that is not how I saw that thing going.

12
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,640
 Ever experienced this before?

13
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,400
 I'm gonna start off kind of tonight

14
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,400
 by telling a experience in a dramatic fashion

15
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,420
 that this took place.

16
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:46,360
 It was about a year ago.

17
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:49,320
 My wife was pregnant with our son.

18
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,080
 We were gonna give birth in December.

19
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,200
 The baby was gonna come as a little baby boy.

20
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,920
 We decided that we were going to buy

21
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,600
 a foreclosure property in October.

22
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,440
 That's right.

23
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,000
 And we were going to remodel it all

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,640
 in the two months that we had before the baby came.

25
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,720
 People will tell you, hey, don't ever buy a house

26
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,480
 and have a baby at the same time.

27
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,800
 We decided to buy a house and remodel it

28
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,040
 and have a baby at the same time

29
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,480
 and essentially gave that thing a middle finger.

30
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,280
 So that is where we were.

31
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,160
 We're waiting for this baby to come

32
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,600
 and getting everything ready.

33
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,240
 He's supposed to come December 16th.

34
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,760
 December 9th, I'm at work.

35
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,520
 I'm getting ready for the Christmas concert

36
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,920
 that we're gonna have here.

37
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,000
 Last year, my wife calls me.

38
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,280
 We're waiting, we're about a week out.

39
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,000
 The baby is still coming.

40
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,600
 The house is supposed to be done on December 11th.

41
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,960
 So we've got a very small window

42
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,120
 between the 11th and the 16th

43
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,600
 to get this house all in order.

44
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,000
 We're gonna move in, have a baby.

45
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,760
 It's gonna be great.

46
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,840
 My wife calls me on December 9th,

47
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,000
 a week before the baby is due,

48
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,360
 and she says, I'm leaving the doctor

49
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,320
 and I have to have an emergency C-section

50
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,540
 because this baby is humongous

51
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,960
 and has his father's head, which is humongous.

52
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,720
 And she's saying, we have to get the baby out.

53
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,720
 He's too big.

54
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,520
 And so I'm like, what does that even mean?

55
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,320
 She's like, it means we have an appointment tomorrow

56
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,280
 at 9 a.m. and you're gonna be a daddy.

57
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,380
 And I'm like, okay, great.

58
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,680
 I go home, go pack, get everything ready.

59
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,600
 We're talking through it.

60
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,880
 And really, this is not going how I saw this going.

61
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,240
 Even the fact that we have an appointment

62
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,980
 at 9 a.m. to get the baby out was not how I saw this.

63
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,960
 Guys, I think, have this fantasy

64
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,880
 where they're like, man, at least there's one time

65
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,560
 in my entire life where I can drive

66
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,360
 as fast as I want to to the hospital.

67
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,640
 And if the police officer comes,

68
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,260
 I'm like, we're having a baby, sir.

69
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,460
 We gotta keep moving.

70
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,360
 She's having a baby, she's in labor.

71
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,600
 And that's not at all what happens

72
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,360
 when you have a C-section 'cause it's like,

73
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,880
 yeah, we're here for the nine o'clock appointment.

74
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,720
 We'll check in.

75
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,560
 [audience laughing]

76
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,060
 And so we get there and it just was not how I saw it going.

77
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,440
 We go, we check in.

78
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,700
 They tell me, hey, we need you to put these scrubs on

79
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,800
 and we're gonna take her away

80
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,640
 and get her in the surgery room.

81
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,280
 And I'm like, scrubs, what does that mean?

82
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,240
 They give me these clothes.

83
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,600
 I put this on, got a little shower cap on,

84
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,960
 everything, wearing blue.

85
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,080
 They finally come get me after I'm sitting in this room

86
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,320
 for a while, they say, you can come in.

87
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:01,020
 My wife is in there laying back on a table on laughing gas.

88
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,480
 They put this sheet up in front of us.

89
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,320
 I'm like, dude, this is not how I saw

90
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,760
 this whole thing going down.

91
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,040
 And they put this sheet up and I'm sitting by my wife,

92
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,040
 her head up at the top of the table.

93
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,800
 She's laying down and the doctors are gonna cut an incision.

94
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,080
 That's what happens in a C-section, in the stomach.

95
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,480
 And they pull the baby out.

96
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:21,100
 And so I'm sitting there, I'm in the scrubs next to her.

97
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,920
 She's on laughing gas, a little out of it.

98
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,400
 And I asked the doctor, hey, can I watch this?

99
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,240
 Is this okay?

100
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,240
 And he's like, yeah, that's fine.

101
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,440
 So I stand up.

102
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:33,240
 Further, not how I saw this thing going.

103
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,960
 It is, I will save you the details,

104
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,440
 but let's just say it is a scarring experience.

105
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,300
 So I'm seeing this whole thing happen

106
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,600
 as they're cutting open and they're finally pulling the baby

107
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,540
 and I'm like, man, this is not how I thought

108
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,680
 this was gonna go down.

109
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,680
 The doctor brings the baby over.

110
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,760
 They finally, they get him out.

111
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,580
 His name's Crew.

112
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,960
 They bring him over, brings him in front of my wife and I,

113
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,960
 behind the sheet.

114
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,560
 And my first thought, I was like,

115
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,400
 oh, I don't know whose baby that is,

116
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,280
 but that does not look like my baby.

117
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,120
 That thing is dark.

118
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,960
 This guy is extra Caucasian.

119
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,440
 I'm not sure that that is my baby.

120
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,360
 And what happened was he's just like blue and purple

121
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,560
 'cause he oxygen and he's getting used to the air.

122
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,780
 And I'm like, oh, that's what's going on.

123
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,440
 Did not see that going that way.

124
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,200
 And then they take it.

125
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,440
 And for whatever reason, I thought like,

126
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,000
 oh, then they give it to you in your arms

127
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,840
 and you just hold the baby.

128
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:17,660
 No, they're like, all right,

129
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:18,500
 we gotta get this thing over here.

130
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,320
 They're cleaning up.

131
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,560
 They're slapping its back.

132
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,640
 They're trying to get all these different fluids out of it.

133
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:26,040
 They're like testing him for all these different bodily,

134
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,840
 either fluids or just different body tests

135
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,680
 that they have to do.

136
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,140
 And you're just kind of sitting there watching like,

137
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,160
 oh, I thought it was gonna, you know,

138
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,280
 get to hold the baby and let me take a selfie.

139
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,920
 And that's not what happens at all.

140
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,760
 They're kind of separated.

141
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,160
 And then finally you get to a point

142
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,040
 where you get to hold your son

143
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,200
 and you're taken away with your wife into your next room.

144
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,960
 And it was one of those experiences

145
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,400
 where just throughout every turn,

146
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,480
 it seemed like, man, that is not how I saw this thing going.

147
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:53,240
 And the reason I start there is because really,

148
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,120
 life is just like that experience.

149
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,300
 Where life, you could say, is a series of moments,

150
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,440
 a series of experiences in your life, in my life,

151
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,480
 in anyone's life, where you find yourself going,

152
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,960
 man, this is not how I saw this thing going.

153
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,800
 There were some plans.

154
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,260
 There was like a vision that I had

155
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:10,340
 for how my dating life was going to go,

156
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:12,440
 how my relationship life was going to go,

157
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,700
 when I would be married by,

158
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,320
 how many children that I would have,

159
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,340
 what type of job I would have,

160
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:20,920
 how fastly I would progress up the corporate ladder,

161
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,780
 if you will, how fast I would be able to buy a home.

162
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,880
 All these different successions in life

163
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:29,160
 where many times for most of us at some point,

164
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,480
 we discover that life is full of those moments of going,

165
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:35,040
 this is not how I saw this thing going.

166
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:38,040
 And a lot of people turn to different things

167
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,400
 in those moments where they realize like,

168
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,780
 oh man, I'm not gonna be married

169
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,000
 by the time I thought I was.

170
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,680
 I'm not gonna have two kids and a white picket house,

171
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,360
 white picket fence at a house by the time

172
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,200
 that I thought I was.

173
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,480
 I'm not going to drive that car that I thought,

174
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,960
 I didn't get into the college that I thought I would.

175
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,080
 I haven't graduated by the time I thought I would.

176
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,920
 And a lot of people turn to,

177
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,720
 I mean, really, it's no surprise.

178
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,720
 This leads all kinds of people to turn to alcohol,

179
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:10,500
 turn to substances, turn to just like freaking out,

180
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,880
 like man, life is falling apart,

181
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,960
 I'm gonna take the wheel, I'm freaking out.

182
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,920
 It turns to, I don't know how it expresses itself for you.

183
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,580
 Maybe for you it's anger.

184
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:21,640
 But what do you do in those moments

185
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:25,360
 where you find yourself going, man, maybe it's despair.

186
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,760
 That's probably one of the more common ones is,

187
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,120
 this is not how I saw this thing going.

188
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,740
 God, what are you doing?

189
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:37,200
 Further, it's relevant because we as a country

190
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,860
 find ourselves in a situation where I think most Americans

191
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,780
 and probably most of us in this room would say,

192
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:46,620
 man, in terms of this election and the next national leader,

193
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:49,140
 this is not how I saw this thing going.

194
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:51,320
 And yet here we are.

195
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,560
 And so what I wanna do for the next few minutes

196
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,260
 is really go to a story in the Old Testament

197
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:59,060
 that I think will give us the prescription

198
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,780
 or the remedy for God's people.

199
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,660
 If you're a follower of Christ in this room,

200
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:05,060
 that God says all of us have been invited into,

201
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:07,200
 that all of us are to do in those moments

202
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,340
 where we find ourselves going, God, where are you right now?

203
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:10,740
 What are you doing right now?

204
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:13,720
 This is not going how I thought it would be going.

205
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,900
 My parents are getting a divorce after 20 years.

206
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:20,740
 I just found out that someone close to me has cancer.

207
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:23,900
 God, where are you going with this?

208
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,380
 And what are we gonna do in those moments?

209
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,160
 And I think that the story we'll explore tonight

210
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,060
 will not only give you and I the individual answer,

211
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,940
 but the answer for the broader nation

212
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:34,140
 and specifically Christians everywhere

213
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:36,200
 on what we are to do in those moments of life

214
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,660
 where we find ourselves going,

215
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:41,300
 where are you going with this, God?

216
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,260
 So we're gonna be in the story of Joshua

217
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:46,300
 and specifically when Joshua crossed over the Jordan River.

218
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,460
 When he took the nation of Israel,

219
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,720
 this was a defining moment in Israel's history.

220
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,640
 So we're gonna be in Joshua chapters really one through five.

221
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,740
 I'm gonna summarize and really tell the story

222
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,420
 and you can go back and read it yourself

223
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:58,660
 as you get time this week

224
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,020
 if you wanna go through the story of Joshua.

225
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,820
 We're gonna explore this defining moment

226
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,940
 in the nation of Israel's history

227
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:06,720
 where they were in circumstances

228
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,700
 where the country was going,

229
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,760
 this is not how I saw this thing going.

230
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:13,300
 And coincidentally, it was also one of those moments

231
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:16,040
 where they had passed the baton

232
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:19,300
 from one leader of the nation, their president, if you will,

233
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:22,400
 to the next president in the midst of this defining moment.

234
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,420
 So here's what's going on.

235
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,700
 So I'll tell kind of the scene

236
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,020
 and then we'll dive in in chapter three

237
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,740
 and read some of the verses of what's going on.

238
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:30,020
 But the nation of Israel has been set up.

239
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,900
 The nation of Israel is really with the Old Testament,

240
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,000
 the first half of the Bible,

241
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,500
 all about the people of Israel,

242
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,340
 nation of Israel, God's people.

243
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:39,020
 God comes to a man named Abraham and Genesis says,

244
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,900
 I'm gonna make you a great nation

245
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,380
 and I'm gonna give you land.

246
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,920
 It's gonna be an awesome country.

247
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,620
 It's gonna be called the promised land.

248
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:46,860
 It's your inheritance.

249
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,740
 Your people are gonna inherit it for years and years.

250
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,020
 Abraham has some kids.

251
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,180
 His kids have kids.

252
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,000
 Time goes on.

253
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,360
 The nation of Israel exists.

254
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,500
 They're slaves in Egypt with no land.

255
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,620
 And they're going, God, where are you going with this?

256
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:05,060
 And 500 years go by and the nation of Israel

257
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,980
 experiences freedom from slavery during that time.

258
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,700
 Moses is leading the nation.

259
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:12,060
 They are waiting still and waiting and waiting

260
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:15,740
 and waiting and waiting for God

261
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:18,940
 to give them their inheritance, this promised land.

262
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:21,940
 And finally, God says, now is the time.

263
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,540
 I'm going to give you the inheritance.

264
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,700
 I'm moving you towards taking the promised land.

265
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,660
 You are going to receive,

266
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,620
 this people will receive the land from God.

267
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,620
 And he begins to move the people in that direction.

268
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:31,820
 And then all of a sudden,

269
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,480
 and then all of a sudden, something happens.

270
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,220
 Moses dies.

271
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:39,880
 And for you and I, we're like, man, Moses,

272
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,720
 that's kind of cool.

273
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,760
 I mean, I guess he's dying.

274
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,400
 You know, sorry, man, rest in peace.

275
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,520
 But for them, the nation of Israel,

276
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,520
 Moses is like George Washington.

277
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,800
 It's the only leader they've ever known.

278
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,960
 Moses not only was an incredible leader,

279
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,440
 he was someone that all the people had found comfort

280
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,320
 in knowing, hey, this man of God who gave us the law,

281
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,860
 he's our leader, this incredible person.

282
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:00,400
 Moses was the person who, with the staff,

283
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,020
 separated the Red Sea and the water parted.

284
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,960
 Moses was the person who not only that,

285
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,940
 who led the people and through him,

286
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,880
 God delivered manna or like food from heaven

287
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,680
 as the people wandered into Israel.

288
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,960
 Moses was the guy who hit a rock

289
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,440
 and water came bursting out of it

290
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,320
 when they were looking for water.

291
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,360
 That's a hard guy to follow.

292
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,520
 I don't care who you are.

293
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,800
 If the leader before you can hit a rock

294
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,640
 and make water come out of it, that's Moses.

295
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,680
 And Moses dies.

296
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,400
 And who's gonna come after Moses?

297
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,120
 Joshua.

298
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:32,060
 And as they head towards the promised land,

299
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:34,560
 God says, Moses, you are not gonna lead the people.

300
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,760
 Joshua, you will lead the people into the promised land.

301
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,520
 And Joshua is also, oddly enough, the name for Jesus

302
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:45,280
 or Yeshua, if you've heard that, if you're Jewish.

303
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,240
 Yeshua, Joshua, it's the same name.

304
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,560
 But when they translated the Bible,

305
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,720
 they were like, hey, there's only one Jesus, okay?

306
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,160
 So Joshua, we're gonna go with Joshua for you.

307
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,960
 But it's the same Hebrew name.

308
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,620
 And Joshua's appointed to lead the people

309
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:59,520
 and all the people are going, Joshua's gonna lead us in?

310
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,240
 He's gonna be the one that takes us to the promised land?

311
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,100
 And God says, yes.

312
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,580
 Joshua, take them to the Jordan River

313
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:07,540
 where they will cross the river.

314
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:12,020
 So Joshua begins to lead two million Jewish men and women

315
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:14,020
 towards this huge river.

316
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,460
 In fact, I think we have a map of it

317
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,140
 where he's gonna lead them into,

318
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,700
 passed over the Jordan River,

319
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,780
 where you can see right in the middle.

320
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,180
 So everyone in the nation of Israel,

321
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,460
 they're on the right side of this map,

322
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:24,100
 the Jordan River right down the middle,

323
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,260
 and they're gonna pass over it.

324
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,180
 And all the land on the left side of the map

325
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,660
 is gonna be theirs.

326
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,980
 And God says, Joshua, I want you to take the people

327
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,520
 up to the edge of the Jordan River.

328
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,840
 So all the people are going there,

329
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,180
 and that's really where our story's gonna pick up,

330
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:39,040
 where God begins to give instructions to Joshua

331
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:39,880
 to give the people.

332
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,740
 So we're gonna pick this up in chapter three, verse eight.

333
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:45,720
 As they're about to enter the promised land,

334
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,500
 they're on the edge of the Jordan River.

335
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,380
 They can see the land that was promised to them,

336
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:53,580
 the land that every person in their ancestry

337
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:56,000
 has ever longed to see, they can see it.

338
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,600
 And they're looking over this huge rushing river,

339
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,480
 and they can see it.

340
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,820
 But between them and their inheritance stands

341
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:06,620
 this one obstacle, this river.

342
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,800
 And so here's what Joshua says.

343
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,240
 Give this command to the priests

344
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,960
 who carry the Ark of the Covenant.

345
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,900
 So that's like the pastors of the day

346
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,760
 who carried the Ark of the Covenant.

347
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,920
 Let me explain what that is.

348
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,120
 Ark of the Covenant was Israel's special,

349
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,220
 it was like the most valuable thing in Israel.

350
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:23,920
 It was a box, this wooden box,

351
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:28,120
 that inside held these kind of symbolic parts

352
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,400
 of Israel's past, but essentially,

353
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,680
 all that it was was it was a visible representation

354
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,320
 of the presence of God.

355
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,760
 That it declared to the nation of Israel,

356
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,360
 hey, God is with this people.

357
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,100
 This box is the most important thing

358
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,440
 that we as a people possess.

359
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,720
 And as long as it is with us, God's presence,

360
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,680
 God has promised that this will symbolically declare

361
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,480
 and display my presence among the people.

362
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,920
 And so Joshua tells the priests,

363
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:54,720
 I want you to go stand in the water with this box.

364
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,920
 And the people have gotta be thinking,

365
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,760
 Joshua, are you kidding me?

366
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,200
 It's gonna float away, it's wood.

367
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,280
 It's literally gonna float away.

368
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,920
 This is the most valuable thing that we own.

369
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,200
 This is your first decision.

370
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,020
 We need to impeach this new leader.

371
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,720
 This is the first decision that you're gonna make

372
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,280
 to lead the people, and here's what happens.

373
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,520
 So the people left their camp to cross,

374
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,200
 this is verse 14 of chapter three,

375
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,680
 to cross the Jordan, and the priests

376
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,440
 who were carrying the Ark of the Covenant

377
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,940
 went ahead of them.

378
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:21,020
 It was harvest season, look at this.

379
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:24,500
 And the Jordan was overflowing in its banks.

380
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,360
 Wait a second.

381
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,040
 We're just told something very significant

382
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,080
 about what's going on when the people arrive

383
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:34,600
 at the banks of the shore of the Jordan River.

384
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,260
 But this wasn't any season of the year.

385
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:39,600
 It was harvest season, or you probably might say flood season.

386
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,440
 What is a flood season?

387
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:43,080
 Flood season is like this two-month period

388
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,400
 in the Jordan River, just this two months,

389
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,840
 couple months during the year,

390
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,560
 where the river expands like never before.

391
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,840
 It begins to overflow with water

392
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,840
 and begins to travel at a more rapid pace

393
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,800
 than the rest of the year.

394
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,960
 In fact, here's kind of a picture

395
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,840
 of the Jordan River today in parts of it

396
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,120
 where it's overflowing with water.

397
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,560
 Significantly different than non-flooding season.

398
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,040
 So God says, I want you to bring the people

399
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,640
 to the river's edge during the flooding season,

400
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:13,600
 when the river and the water is rushing over,

401
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,900
 impossible to pass.

402
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,900
 I mean, scholars tell us and studies tell us

403
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,880
 that the non-flooding season,

404
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,540
 the distance of the width of the river

405
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:26,640
 is like 50 feet wide during the flooding season

406
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,960
 where the water would come down from the Sea of Galilee,

407
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:33,120
 it would go as far as half a mile wide and 150 feet deep

408
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,960
 and move as fast a pace of 10 miles an hour as you just saw.

409
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,600
 And the people of Israel come up to the water's edge

410
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,520
 where God has told them, I mean, think about it.

411
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,680
 Why would God, why would you bring them here at this time?

412
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,320
 Even wandering in the desert 40 years,

413
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,120
 if you would have come a month later

414
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,680
 or a couple months earlier,

415
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,440
 you're gonna miss this whole flooding season, God.

416
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,520
 We could have easily passed.

417
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:59,640
 Why would you bring us in the worst of the worst times?

418
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,280
 Why would you command us, God, to come here?

419
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,100
 What is he doing?

420
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,260
 What is he trying to communicate?

421
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,460
 And so all of a sudden, the people are there,

422
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,800
 they're watching what's gonna happen,

423
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,080
 and the priests begin to approach the water.

424
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:14,480
 And you gotta think, Joshua's nervous 'cause he's like,

425
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,860
 man, I hope that was the Lord and not El Diablo.

426
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,320
 I don't know who gave me that command,

427
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,860
 but please, something happen as the priests begin to take

428
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,280
 the most valuable thing that they have,

429
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,240
 the presence of God, this wooden box that communicated,

430
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:30,240
 I'm with you, and put it in harm's way inside of the river.

431
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,840
 But here's what happens.

432
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:37,040
 But as soon as the feet of the priests, this is verse 15,

433
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,580
 who were carrying the ark touched the water

434
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:43,280
 at the river's edge, the water at that point began backing

435
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:47,140
 up a great distance away at a town called Adam,

436
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:49,600
 which is near Zarethan.

437
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,960
 We don't know where Adam is.

438
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,980
 This is the only mention of the town of Adam in the Bible.

439
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:56,440
 The reason we know where it is, I'm sorry,

440
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,600
 is because of Zarethan.

441
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,600
 But had it not been marked by, oh, it's the town by Zarethan,

442
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,080
 we wouldn't know, it's the only time it's mentioned.

443
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:08,280
 And the water below that point flowed on into the Dead Sea

444
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,060
 until the riverbed was dry.

445
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,680
 Here's what this means, that in this moment,

446
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,440
 Joshua says, hey, guys, slowly start to creep out

447
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,300
 into the water, take a few steps, and this doesn't,

448
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:20,160
 all of a sudden, something begins to happen to the water.

449
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,000
 And if you know this story, you may have heard

450
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,320
 that it's like the Red Sea, where Moses goes,

451
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,000
 all of a sudden, two walls of water.

452
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,720
 That's not what happens here.

453
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:31,140
 They take a step out, and it says 20 miles away,

454
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:32,760
 which is where Zarethan was.

455
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,360
 All of a sudden, the water stops.

456
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,040
 And so Joshua is sitting there with the people

457
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,360
 as they watch.

458
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:41,040
 I think the water's beginning to go down a little bit,

459
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,160
 because all of a sudden, it stopped 20 miles away,

460
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,240
 and so it's just gonna continue rushing away.

461
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,200
 And they watch as the waters flow,

462
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,240
 almost like letting a bathtub out of water,

463
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,800
 as it slowly begins to drain out,

464
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,960
 and slowly, they begin to see, oh, man,

465
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,000
 this water is going away.

466
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,640
 Scholars have estimated that it would have taken

467
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,640
 almost two hours to sit there as they watched

468
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:03,240
 the water go away, and they watched the power of God

469
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:07,120
 show up when this Ark of the Covenant was in their midst,

470
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,640
 was placed in the middle of this obstacle

471
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,640
 in the Jordan River.

472
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:18,760
 But even if you're Joshua, I mean, another occasion

473
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,120
 where you've gotta be thinking, man,

474
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,240
 this is not how I saw this thing going,

475
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,800
 but God was going to show up for his people.

476
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,320
 Here's what happens.

477
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,040
 Eventually, all of the water goes out

478
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,440
 until the waterbed is dry.

479
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:31,000
 Then all the people, two million people,

480
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,240
 cross over near the town of Jericho.

481
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:37,000
 Meanwhile, the priests, who were carrying the Ark

482
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,120
 of the Lord's Covenant, stood on dry ground

483
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,680
 in the middle of the riverbed.

484
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,760
 As the people passed by, they waited there

485
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,360
 until the whole nation had crossed over the Jordan

486
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,400
 on dry ground.

487
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:51,400
 Two million people walk past this Ark of the Covenant,

488
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:55,480
 these pastors standing in the middle of the water,

489
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:59,080
 holding this wooden box, and two million people

490
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,480
 walk past as the water ceases.

491
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:05,120
 The overflowing, rushing water, that was the Jordan River.

492
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,760
 As it ceases, it is completely dry in this one space,

493
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,000
 and the people pass over.

494
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,640
 As soon as they get to the other side,

495
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,800
 verse 18 of chapter four, it says this,

496
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,520
 that the priests carrying the Ark of the Lord's Covenant

497
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,600
 came up out of the riverbed, and as soon as their feet

498
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,920
 were on high ground, the water of the Jordan

499
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,360
 returned and overflowed its banks.

500
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,120
 Joshua, while they were walking through,

501
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,880
 the Bible tells us, I want you to pick up 12 stones,

502
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,200
 and I want each one, each person that had

503
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,720
 these different 12 tribes, he says, hey, look,

504
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,800
 I want everybody from each tribe to grab a stone,

505
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,580
 12 big stones, take the stones,

506
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:45,720
 take 'em outside of the river,

507
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,160
 and here's why I want you to do that,

508
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,540
 because there's gonna come a day,

509
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:51,800
 and I want you to stack 'em and make this memorial,

510
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,240
 because there's gonna come a day

511
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,080
 where people are gonna not remember this,

512
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,720
 and when your children ask, it tells us in chapter four,

513
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:02,040
 when your children ask you, why are those stones here?

514
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:05,360
 I want you to tell them of what God did here,

515
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,520
 where he separated the waters,

516
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,260
 where you saw the Jordan stopped,

517
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,640
 and I want you to tell them that God can be trusted.

518
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,320
 I want you to pass it on to your children

519
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,220
 and set up a memorial inside of there.

520
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:21,520
 But as soon as this wooden box,

521
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,700
 the presence of the Lord comes out of the water,

522
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:26,920
 the water all of a sudden comes rushing back in.

523
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:32,920
 During chapter five, Joshua, who's further being introduced

524
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,760
 as his first acts of leadership, man,

525
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,080
 the God who we worship, the God of this box,

526
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,860
 the God of this people, the God of the whole earth,

527
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:40,760
 can be trusted.

528
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:43,760
 He's now in the promised land with his people.

529
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,240
 They're stepping on the land that was promised

530
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,080
 to their ancestors for hundreds of years,

531
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:50,380
 and now Joshua goes out to scout some of the land,

532
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:52,100
 and while he's out scouting the land,

533
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:55,360
 he further encounters why and who he can trust

534
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,280
 as their God.

535
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,120
 Here's what happens.

536
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,100
 He's out walking around the town.

537
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:00,520
 This happens in chapter five, where Joshua says this.

538
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,600
 When Joshua was near the town of Jericho,

539
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:06,440
 he looked up, so Joshua, all the people, they make camp.

540
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,560
 They got all the camels, all the donkeys, all the tents,

541
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,680
 everything across the riverbed, they make camp.

542
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,840
 Joshua's gonna go out, kinda scout stuff up,

543
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,360
 and all of a sudden, he goes out scouting,

544
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,560
 and here's what he sees.

545
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:20,520
 He looked up, and he saw a man standing in front of him

546
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,880
 with his sword drawn in hand, and he went up to him,

547
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,200
 and he said, "Are you friend or are you foe?"

548
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,520
 So there's a man standing there with his sword drawn out,

549
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,780
 and he says, "Neither one.

550
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:34,220
 "I am the commander of the Lord's army."

551
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:37,040
 As I'm like, hey, you're asking whose side I'm on,

552
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,040
 your side or their side?

553
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,440
 I'm on neither side.

554
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,600
 I didn't come to take sides.

555
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,560
 I came to take over, and I'm the commander of your army.

556
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,360
 I'm the commander of all things.

557
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,840
 That's who I am, and he's introduced to God in the flesh.

558
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,240
 Many scholars, Martin Luther,

559
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,440
 there's lots of famous people who say,

560
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:56,440
 "This is actually Jesus, the later Yeshua,

561
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:59,820
 "the later Joshua, standing eyeball to eyeball

562
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:02,100
 "with Joshua, saying, 'I'm the one

563
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,540
 "'who's ultimately in charge of all of these people,

564
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:05,660
 "'of all things.

565
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:06,500
 "'That's who I am.

566
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,600
 "'You're asking me to take sides?

567
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,840
 "'I didn't come to take sides.

568
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,040
 "'I'm here to take over, because all things are mine.

569
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:16,400
 "'I'm the one ultimately in charge of these people,

570
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,400
 "'of all people.'"

571
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:24,260
 Why did I choose the story of Joshua?

572
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:27,960
 As we close out this series,

573
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,800
 what I think more than anything this story portrays

574
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,340
 is the idea that God can be trusted,

575
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:35,240
 that he can be trusted.

576
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,400
 I mean, think about it.

577
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,560
 Why would you bring them, God, to the water's edge

578
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,920
 in the worst of the worst time?

579
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,720
 I mean, it's flooding.

580
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,480
 There's water overflowing the banks.

581
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,300
 They can't get through.

582
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,640
 This is the worst time they could possibly come, God.

583
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,820
 Had they come during non-flooding season,

584
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,080
 they could have walked across.

585
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,480
 They could have at least tried to get the camels

586
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,640
 and the donkeys across.

587
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,120
 They could have waded through the water.

588
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,960
 You bring them when it's overflowing,

589
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,360
 when the water's rushing everywhere.

590
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,400
 This is not how they saw this thing going.

591
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,880
 Why would you bring them then?

592
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,680
 They're your people who you love,

593
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:08,720
 because he wanted to show the nation of Israel

594
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,160
 that God can be trusted.

595
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:15,040
 And I don't want you to put your trust, Israel, David, you,

596
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:20,320
 and Joshua, and Moses,

597
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,480
 and your own ability to cross over

598
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,680
 whatever is in front of you,

599
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,920
 whatever trouble you're facing,

600
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,220
 I do not want you to put your trust in yourself.

601
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,880
 I want you to put it in me, your God.

602
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,120
 I can be trusted.

603
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,400
 That's the one idea from this entire text

604
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:37,000
 is that God is a God who can be trusted.

605
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,680
 And in the midst of, the reason why he allows

606
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:42,600
 even crazy candidates to come to the surface

607
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,240
 is the same reason why he says,

608
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,840
 "I'm gonna bring you in the midst of the flood

609
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,220
 "to show you there is a God who is alive

610
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:53,520
 "and will work in the midst of my people

611
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,140
 "in incredible ways if they will trust him."

612
00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:00,180
 And the message of Joshua,

613
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:02,760
 and the message that Israel was introduced to

614
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:05,940
 was that, man, our confidence was never in Moses.

615
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:08,100
 Our confidence was never in Joshua.

616
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,960
 Our confidence is never in a man.

617
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,980
 It's in you alone, God.

618
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:12,820
 You're our delivery.

619
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:13,760
 You're the one who saves.

620
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,240
 You're the one that can be trusted,

621
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,900
 the only one that can be trusted.

622
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:22,080
 In the same way it's true today,

623
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,920
 in the midst of crazy circumstances around you and me,

624
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:28,120
 he's inviting all of us that I can be trusted.

625
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:31,880
 I don't know what you're walking through in the room.

626
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,640
 I know that all of us are walking through

627
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,140
 like kind of a crazy political season,

628
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:36,980
 but here's what else I know.

629
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:38,320
 I know that inside of this room,

630
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,220
 there's a lot more than that going on.

631
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:43,820
 There's divorce going on.

632
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:49,040
 There's shame and pain from past sexual abuse going on.

633
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:52,240
 There's challenges at work.

634
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,640
 There's challenges of unemployment.

635
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,660
 There's challenges of dating relationships,

636
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:57,000
 challenges of just trying to figure out

637
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,240
 how I can make ends meet.

638
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,020
 And in the midst of all of that, God is saying,

639
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:02,920
 "Hey, I'm inviting you, if you are a follower of Jesus,

640
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:06,000
 "if you are a part of my people, that I can be trusted."

641
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,460
 As you look, do not be dismayed like the rest of the world

642
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:13,260
 as to what the election's gonna hold

643
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:15,600
 or to what the future of America's gonna hold.

644
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,080
 Look to me.

645
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,920
 I can be trusted.

646
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:21,520
 Remember that God can be trusted.

647
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:29,200
 It's easy to see when someone actually believes this,

648
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,120
 like there's something distinct about someone

649
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,560
 when they actually think, "Oh man, God,

650
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,860
 "no matter what comes my way,

651
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:37,240
 "I can actually trust God's in control."

652
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:40,680
 If this relationship ends, I know I can trust God.

653
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,680
 I know he's got something else going on.

654
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:45,160
 When you introduce to these people,

655
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,140
 when you meet these people and they're like,

656
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:47,320
 "Yeah, I lost my job, but you know what?

657
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,800
 "I trust God is at work.

658
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,980
 "I don't know what that's gonna mean,

659
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:52,080
 "and it may not mean that I have another job anytime soon.

660
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,520
 "It may mean that I have a worse job,

661
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,200
 "but I trust God and he's at work.

662
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,660
 "The dating relationship I thought was gonna go

663
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:00,680
 "another direction, it didn't end up going there,

664
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,720
 "but I trust God."

665
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,680
 And that's one experience, one type of person.

666
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,240
 Then there's an entirely other person

667
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,560
 walking through the exact same circumstances

668
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,600
 where all of a sudden we're like,

669
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,360
 "Oh my gosh, this relationship ended.

670
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,580
 "My life is over.

671
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,160
 "I'm gonna be the cat lady forever.

672
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,000
 "I cannot believe it.

673
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,620
 "We had a song, we had a cat,

674
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:22,000
 "and all of a sudden we're done,"

675
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,160
 and they begin freaking out.

676
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,120
 This job, I cannot believe it.

677
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,880
 I wanna ruin this employer.

678
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,800
 There's two different responses that come out

679
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,880
 of the person who trusts God

680
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,080
 despite the fact they're walking

681
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,760
 through the exact same circumstances.

682
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,040
 The one difference is one trusts that God's at work,

683
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:40,120
 and the other's not so sure.

684
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,360
 It's not dissimilar to like,

685
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:47,160
 there's really two types of people in this room

686
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,120
 as it relates to roller coasters.

687
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,480
 Anyone like roller coasters in here?

688
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,320
 There's two types of people.

689
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,200
 There's one type of person who's like,

690
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,200
 "Oh man, I hate roller coasters,

691
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,500
 "and there's no chance that I'm gonna trust

692
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,800
 "that 12-year-old kid flipping the switch over here

693
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,960
 "as I go up in the air."

694
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,080
 And then there's the other person who's like,

695
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:01,960
 "Oh man, it's awesome.

696
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,000
 "The engineering is great.

697
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:03,840
 "I love this.

698
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,560
 "Hands up in the air, woo, can't do anything.

699
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,440
 "It's not gonna hurt me, this is great.

700
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,600
 "Our team recently went to the fair,

701
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,380
 "and we have this tradition on our team

702
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:13,860
 "where we will go on the ship every year,

703
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:14,920
 "and I won't name names,

704
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,600
 "but there's one person on our team

705
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,500
 "who was terrified of the ship, Elena,

706
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:21,180
 "and Elena was, we're getting on the ship,

707
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,440
 "and all of a sudden we're gonna ride the ship,"

708
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,480
 and she's like, "No, there's no way."

709
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,460
 I'm like, "It's the most tame.

710
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:25,800
 "Look, there's a nine-year-old

711
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,280
 "in front of us on this thing."

712
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,680
 She's like, "No, oh my gosh, I can't.

713
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,240
 "I'm so terrified of what's gonna happen."

714
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,800
 Here's the difference between her

715
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,540
 and the person she's sitting next to on that ship

716
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:36,380
 or on that ride.

717
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:39,860
 One trusts the ride, and one doesn't.

718
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:43,520
 And because the person who loves the ride

719
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,260
 or not loves the ride, trusts the ride,

720
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:46,580
 they're able to go, "Man, I don't know

721
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:48,300
 "what's gonna happen next, but I trust it.

722
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:52,360
 "I'm okay," versus the person on the roller coaster

723
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,840
 who doesn't trust the engineer behind the ride,

724
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:57,840
 or doesn't trust it, and is grabbing on

725
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,520
 to anything that it can for control.

726
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,480
 In the same way, you see it reflected

727
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,920
 in behavior of people who go,

728
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:08,540
 "Man, I trust the person behind the ride.

729
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:10,940
 "I trust God's at work in this circumstance.

730
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:13,300
 "I trust him with what's going on right now,

731
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,580
 "right here, in this election, in my life,

732
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:17,920
 "with my roommate that just moved out,

733
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,200
 "with what's gonna happen next."

734
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,100
 And then there's the person who says,

735
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,360
 "No, I don't trust the ride."

736
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:25,000
 And they're grabbing on to anything they can

737
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,740
 to allow them to feel in control.

738
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:31,260
 And God's inviting, and he invited the nation of Israel,

739
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:34,600
 "I'm bringing you when the floodwaters are there.

740
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,080
 "Because my question for you is,

741
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,560
 "when you look into the water,

742
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:40,040
 "when you look into the floods as they rise,

743
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:43,060
 "who are you gonna trust in, Israel?

744
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:48,280
 "Me or yourself, and you're gonna turn back."

745
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,840
 And he's invited you, and he's invited me

746
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,560
 in the midst of every circumstance in life.

747
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,480
 That's the message he's trying to get to you,

748
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,780
 is that I can be trusted with what you're walking through.

749
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:00,120
 And I don't know about you,

750
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,120
 but especially in a season like this,

751
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,440
 that's the message my heart needs to hear.

752
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,560
 That's the message I think the church needs to hear,

753
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,520
 is that we, above all other people,

754
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,240
 in the midst of, man, uncertainty,

755
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,600
 political uncertainty, whatever's ahead,

756
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,120
 our God is in the heavens, and he is in control.

757
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,080
 Whoever is elected tonight has been placed there

758
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,720
 and appointed by God.

759
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,960
 Does that mean that they're like,

760
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,360
 they've won the most favor with God?

761
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:27,100
 No, it means that he said, "In my divine,

762
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:31,320
 "my sovereign, or my power, all-powerful purpose,

763
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,900
 "I'm putting this person there.

764
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:37,360
 "And I'm not surprised that I'm in control,

765
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:42,380
 "just like I was with the nation of Israel."

766
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:45,760
 And just like, ultimately, what Joshua found out

767
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:49,740
 from being introduced to God in the flesh, Jesus,

768
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,500
 as he stood there in chapter five,

769
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:54,800
 and he got down on one knee and bowed before him

770
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,000
 because he was told that,

771
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,080
 you're standing on holy ground, Moses.

772
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,160
 I'm sorry, Joshua.

773
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:03,460
 And I'm the one who's in command of this country.

774
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:05,440
 I'm the one who's in command of this army.

775
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,940
 I'm the one who's in command.

776
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:10,480
 In the same way, as it relates to the election of Rhine-West,

777
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,100
 not only can God be trusted,

778
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,840
 but he can be trusted because he's in control,

779
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,040
 and he's the one who's ultimately in command.

780
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:19,480
 And so because of that, what I'm gonna do

781
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,240
 is I'm gonna have the band come up,

782
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:25,520
 and we are going to pause, and we are going to,

783
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,320
 and I'm gonna ask you to stay seated,

784
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:31,480
 and stay here, and we are gonna do something

785
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,720
 we've never done at The Porch before.

786
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,120
 We are going to sit where we are

787
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:39,280
 and pray for the candidates and pray for our country,

788
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,780
 and we are gonna storm the gates of heaven

789
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,320
 with the prayers of the saints.

790
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,760
 We're gonna pray for Donald Trump,

791
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,080
 we're gonna pray for Hillary Clinton,

792
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,800
 and I'll lead us through that individually

793
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,280
 right where you are.

794
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:53,240
 By name, I'm asking,

795
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:57,420
 I want you to turn your attention to God and pray for them.

796
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:00,800
 The band will play softly behind,

797
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,560
 and we'll give a chance for 45 seconds,

798
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:05,600
 maybe a minute for each of you to pray for Hillary Clinton.

799
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:12,280
 Pray for her family, pray for her if she is our future leader.

800
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,140
 If half of the things that the media says are true,

801
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:16,320
 here's what I know about her.

802
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,880
 She is hurting, she is sad, and she needs the grace of God.

803
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:24,260
 And so now the church has an opportunity

804
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:27,700
 to do what it always does with any person on this planet,

805
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,820
 because all of us are broken, and turn and say,

806
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:32,180
 God, will you step in and save this woman?

807
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:34,580
 Will you do miraculous things in her life?

808
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:37,220
 I mean, if she becomes our next president

809
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:39,980
 or whatever she does, Lord, I know that she's passionate

810
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:43,880
 about advancing the stages in which you can do abortion,

811
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:44,720
 full-term abortion.

812
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,820
 She's like, yes, let's do it.

813
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:47,120
 God, will you make her,

814
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,960
 you are the God who can do all things.

815
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,120
 Will you make her the most passionate, outspoken advocate

816
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,320
 for shutting down abortion in our lifetime?

817
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,360
 Because you're the God who does those kinds of things.

818
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,600
 You're the God who takes Saul's and turns them into Paul's.

819
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,000
 Will you do that now?

820
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,880
 Will you stretch out your hand and will you save her?

821
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,400
 And if she's our next president, Lord,

822
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:08,560
 would she rule out of an overflow of being ruled by you?

823
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,480
 We're gonna pray now for Hillary,

824
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,040
 right where you are, for Hillary.

825
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,080
 And then in 45 seconds, I'm gonna come back

826
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,440
 and we'll move into Donald.

827
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,580
 (gentle music)

828
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:23,000
 (gentle music continues)

829
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,420
 (gentle music continues)

830
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:29,840
 (gentle music continues)

831
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,260
 (gentle music continues)

832
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:36,680
 (gentle music continues)

833
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:40,100
 (gentle music continues)

834
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:43,520
 (gentle music continues)

835
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:46,940
 (gentle music continues)

836
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:50,360
 (gentle music continues)

837
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:53,780
 (gentle music continues)

838
00:31:53,780 --> 00:32:16,020
 All right, where we are.

839
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:20,220
 I'm gonna move and let's pray for Donald Trump.

840
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:24,860
 Pray that God would step into his life,

841
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:28,420
 that he would save him

842
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:31,220
 if he doesn't have a relationship with Jesus,

843
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:33,500
 that he would become the most passionate advocate

844
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:37,340
 of women and their rights that there ever has been.

845
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:40,100
 For the rest of his days, he would spend his life

846
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:43,380
 putting the name of Jesus on the towers

847
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:44,460
 of the hearts of men.

848
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:47,740
 That's what God does.

849
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:49,820
 He's done it every week here at the porch,

850
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:50,780
 or he does it every week.

851
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,380
 He does it in Houston.

852
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:54,460
 He does it in the woodlands.

853
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:55,980
 He does it in Fort Worth.

854
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:57,620
 He does it all over the place

855
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:00,060
 where the people of God, the saints say,

856
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:01,780
 he can be trusted.

857
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:03,260
 And we're gonna step out in faith.

858
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:04,620
 We're gonna trust you, God.

859
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:07,340
 So let's pray for Donald Trump.

860
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:09,920
 (gentle music)

861
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:13,340
 (gentle music continues)

862
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:16,760
 (gentle music continues)

863
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:20,180
 (gentle music continues)

864
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:23,600
 (gentle music continues)

865
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:27,020
 (gentle music continues)

866
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:30,440
 (gentle music continues)

867
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:33,860
 (gentle music continues)

868
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:02,740
 We're gonna have a chance to pray for our country.

869
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,060
 There's a lot of anger.

870
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:05,260
 There's gonna be a lot of division,

871
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:07,020
 regardless of what happens afterwards.

872
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:09,740
 And the church offers the best solution

873
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:13,140
 of unity, of love, of hope.

874
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:14,580
 So pray for our country,

875
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:17,220
 and specifically pray for the strength

876
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:19,040
 of the church in our country,

877
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,380
 that God would awaken dead churches,

878
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:23,980
 awaken the parts of this church member's heart

879
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:26,140
 that are dead and your heart that are dead.

880
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:28,820
 A friend on our staff said today

881
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:30,820
 that if the nation is led astray,

882
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:32,980
 it won't be because if it was ever elected today,

883
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:36,420
 it will be because the church ceases to be the church.

884
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:37,860
 So let's pray for the church in our country,

885
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:38,780
 for our country.

886
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:42,320
 (gentle music)

887
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:47,740
 (gentle music continues)

888
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:53,160
 (gentle music continues)

889
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:56,580
 (gentle music continues)

890
00:34:56,580 --> 00:35:04,000
 (gentle music continues)

891
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:09,920
 (gentle music continues)

892
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:19,980
 (gentle music continues)

893
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:23,400
 (gentle music continues)

894
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:32,620
 Father, just like Joshua stood before you

895
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:34,340
 and he bowed before you,

896
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,780
 he bowed his head before you.

897
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:39,700
 He acknowledged that you're the God over all things.

898
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:42,340
 We come before you now,

899
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,780
 and we storm the gates of heaven,

900
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:48,140
 and we ask that you would save these two men and women

901
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,700
 if they do not know you,

902
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:51,020
 and if they do know you,

903
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:54,220
 would they have a deep, abiding,

904
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:56,980
 overflowing relationship with you

905
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:59,700
 that leads them to rule,

906
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,840
 marked with the characteristic of love

907
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,780
 that the ultimate ruler, Jesus, our Savior,

908
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:06,980
 rules with.

909
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:11,720
 Father, we pray for the church ahead.

910
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,140
 Would you strengthen the church?

911
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,940
 Pray for the future of the church,

912
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,860
 for the faces of the men and women in this room,

913
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:17,780
 in the room in Fort Worth,

914
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:18,660
 in the room in the Woodlands,

915
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:19,780
 in the room in Houston.

916
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:23,420
 God, would you strengthen your church

917
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:24,980
 through my friends here,

918
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:25,920
 through me here?

919
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:29,220
 Father, would the biggest and best ideas of the church

920
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,140
 be from this room,

921
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:33,220
 from those rooms,

922
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:34,620
 from the body of Christ?

923
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:36,660
 Would they courageously step out in faith and say,

924
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:38,100
 "We're gonna trust the God who is there.

925
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:39,700
 "He can be trusted.

926
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,780
 "He will make a way."

927
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:45,160
 Would you pour unbelievable amounts of resources

928
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,660
 into the hands of my friends here?

929
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:49,180
 And would they radically and generously

930
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:50,680
 steward them for your kingdom?

931
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,740
 Would they be bold in their faith

932
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:54,660
 and bold and courageous?

933
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:56,340
 And would you do the same in my heart, God?

934
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:58,060
 Forgive me, forgive my friends,

935
00:36:58,060 --> 00:36:59,180
 for the parts of us

936
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:01,440
 that have not been disciplined in praying,

937
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:06,940
 for men and women who are slandered every day on TV,

938
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:07,980
 running for an office,

939
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:08,980
 who we do not know,

940
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:10,660
 who we've made judgments about.

941
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:13,480
 Father, would you,

942
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:17,060
 through the hounds of heaven,

943
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:18,660
 pursue and save these people?

944
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:21,380
 You saved Saul and you turned him into Paul.

945
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:22,820
 You saved Peter the coward

946
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:25,120
 and you turned him into Peter the courageous.

947
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:28,040
 Would you do this now?

948
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,460
 Father, help us to be strong.

949
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:31,300
 Whatever you have ahead,

950
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:32,740
 we love you and we trust you.

951
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:34,420
 We will not fear the terror of the night,

952
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:36,260
 as you say in Psalm 91,

953
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:38,180
 because you are our refuge and our fortress,

954
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:39,420
 the God in whom we trust.

955
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:41,860
 And we will dwell in the shelter of the Most High

956
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,860
 and abide in the shadow of the Almighty.

957
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:48,140
 Whatever's ahead, Lord,

958
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,580
 make us strong and courageous like you did with Joshua.

959
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:52,140
 May we trust in what you said

960
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:55,260
 and what you quoted in the book of Hebrews from Joshua.

961
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:57,980
 The fear not, for I will never leave you, my people.

962
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:59,540
 I will never forsake you.

963
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:02,940
 And I've already gone before you by that presence of God.

964
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:04,900
 I am with you in the middle of the flood

965
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,140
 through the presence of God.

966
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:09,660
 And I'm behind you in whatever flood we face.

967
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:12,420
 May you're with us in nearness.

968
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:15,380
 Amen.

969
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:18,780
 I'll close, and then we're gonna close in song.

970
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:25,100
 Ultimately, man, this story tells us why God can be trusted.

971
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:32,580
 Because it points in every detail to another story.

972
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:35,380
 Like, think about it.

973
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:40,380
 A man named Jesus shows up to the people of God

974
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:44,780
 and he takes the baton from Moses, the law,

975
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,140
 and he takes the people

976
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:48,460
 who are awaiting to go into the inheritance,

977
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:50,340
 but they cannot cross this barrier,

978
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:51,980
 and he takes the people of God,

979
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:54,660
 and what the law could not do with Moses,

980
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:58,380
 takes the baton and through a piece of wood,

981
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:01,500
 this wooden arc, he allows the people of God

982
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,580
 to enter into their inheritance,

983
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:05,900
 their promised inheritance from God.

984
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:09,180
 A man named Jesus shows up and through a piece of wood,

985
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:12,180
 that's an arc, similar to a man named Jesus

986
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:13,580
 who through a piece of wood,

987
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:15,820
 just like the arc of the covenant

988
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:19,100
 that displayed the covenant of God for his people.

989
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:21,460
 So the cross of the covenant

990
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:24,900
 that displayed the covenantal love of God for his people,

991
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:27,540
 a man named Jesus shows up through a piece of wood,

992
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:29,980
 allows the people of God to cross over the barrier

993
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:34,300
 they could not do without him through a piece of wood.

994
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:38,220
 And he cuts off the water

995
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:41,380
 all the way back to a town called Adam.

996
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:42,940
 He cuts off the problem,

997
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:45,100
 the barrier is cut all the way back

998
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:47,980
 to the place where it began, Adam.

999
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:50,020
 It's all over, every detail in the page,

1000
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:51,740
 the story points to Jesus.

1001
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:53,300
 It points to the ultimate reason

1002
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:55,020
 why no matter what we're walking through,

1003
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:57,060
 no matter what you're walking through,

1004
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:58,220
 he can be trusted

1005
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:00,540
 because it was perfectly displayed on that cross.

1006
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:01,540
 What do I mean by that?

1007
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:04,020
 The God who showed up and said, "Can you trust me?

1008
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:05,780
 "I'm the God who loves you so much.

1009
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:10,140
 "I will enter into my own creation and die for you."

1010
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:13,020
 So that by a piece of wood,

1011
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:15,900
 a man named Jesus could allow the people of God

1012
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:19,660
 to enter into a place that without him,

1013
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:20,740
 they could not enter.

1014
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:23,380
 It points to him in every detail,

1015
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:25,420
 even the town of Adam,

1016
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:27,340
 even taking what the law could not do.

1017
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:31,900
 And it points to the ultimate story of life,

1018
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:34,740
 the ultimate reason that you're alive,

1019
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:39,620
 the ultimate place that meaning is found in life,

1020
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:41,980
 the ultimate reason why every circumstance

1021
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:43,140
 that will exist on this planet,

1022
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:44,340
 listen to me very clearly,

1023
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:46,660
 everything you're gonna go through

1024
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:50,260
 is God's screaming attempt to get you to look at Jesus.

1025
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:51,740
 Right now, inside of our country,

1026
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:53,620
 the craziness that is the election

1027
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,540
 is God in his mercy saying,

1028
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:57,300
 "I need you to look for a savior,

1029
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:58,700
 "and I'm pretty sure you're not gonna look

1030
00:40:58,700 --> 00:40:59,900
 "to the White House.

1031
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:01,300
 "Will you look at my son,

1032
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:04,060
 "the one who made a way when there was no way

1033
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:06,940
 "so that all people could cross over the barrier,"

1034
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:09,340
 separating them from that promised land.

1035
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:12,860
 And it points to him, to the God who can be trusted.

1036
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:14,900
 And tonight, as much as any time,

1037
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:15,780
 I don't know about you,

1038
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:17,180
 but what I need more than anything

1039
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:19,820
 is not to be concerned about looking at who's going what,

1040
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:22,020
 I need to be concerned and look at Jesus.

1041
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:25,780
 Would he capture more of our attention than ourselves?

1042
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:28,020
 Would we be more focused on him than ourselves,

1043
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:30,580
 more focused on him than whoever wins tonight?

1044
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:32,340
 Because he's already won,

1045
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:34,020
 and in Christ, we've already won.

1046
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:35,180
 Let me pray that that would be the case,

1047
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:36,820
 and we're gonna sing in song.

1048
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:37,820
 Father, we thank you.

1049
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:40,340
 You have already won.

1050
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:41,940
 We worship you now in song.

1051
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:45,140
 God, strengthen your church,

1052
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:47,980
 and do so through my friends in this room.

1053
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:50,540
 Thank you for Jesus, the ultimate Savior,

1054
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:52,100
 who made a way when there was no way.

1055
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:55,380

 We trust you.

 Amen.
