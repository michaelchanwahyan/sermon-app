[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   [Music]
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:20.020]   [Music]
[00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.020]   [Music]
[00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.020]   All right, Porch, how are we doing tonight?
[00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.020]   We doing okay?
[00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.020]   It's great to see you.
[00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.020]   Welcome back to another Tuesday night.
[00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.020]   We're so grateful that you would choose to be here with us.
[00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.020]   Not just those of you that are here in the room, but everyone that is
[00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.020]   tuning in online.
[00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.020]   We have not forgotten about you.
[00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.020]   This is the amazing thing, y'all.
[00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.020]   I was just thinking this sitting over in my seat.
[00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.020]   God is so very clearly doing something.
[00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:53.020]   And he always is doing something, but he has his thumb on the young
[00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.020]   adult generation.
[00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.020]   You see, he is working, yes, in our room, but he is working in rooms
[00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.020]   like ours all over the nation and really all over the world.
[00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.020]   And so to gather together and to be with a group of people that are
[00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.020]   from the exact same generation, they're in their 20s and they're in
[00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.020]   their 30s, and they believe similarly about the things of God.
[00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.020]   There's a united hunger for more of God is a great place to be because
[00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.020]   God loves to satisfy his people.
[00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.020]   So if you're here and you're wondering what the heck have I been --
[00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.020]   what the heck have I stepped into, let me just welcome you.
[00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.020]   We're really glad that you would make time to be with us here on
[00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.020]   Tuesday night, and if you've been rolling with us for a long time,
[00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.020]   welcome back.
[00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.020]   Special shout out to our Porch Live locations, particularly Porch
[00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.020]   Live Dayton/Fort Worth, and put your hands together for those guys.
[00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.020]   Hey, I'm so excited for tonight.
[00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.020]   Yes, because it's Tuesday, but also because we have a very special
[00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.020]   guest joining us tonight.
[00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.020]   Whenever it comes to identifying people we want to preach in a
[00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.020]   guest-speaking spot here at the Porch, we really do the hard work of
[00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.020]   praying through God, who would you have come?
[00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.020]   And this person certainly feels like an answer to prayer.
[00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.020]   When I was a young man, I mean, fresh in my relationship with God,
[00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.020]   learning what it looked like to walk with Jesus, it was his voice that
[00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.020]   God used to really teach me not just about what to do, but particularly
[00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.020]   about who he was, who Jesus is.
[00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.020]   I would ride in my 2004 GMC Sierra from Longview, Texas, to College
[00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.020]   Station, Texas, and it would be his voice that would keep me company as
[00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.020]   he would teach me the things of Jesus.
[00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:36.020]   And I know that voice has timelessly tuned my faith even to this day, and
[00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.020]   it's not just true of me.
[00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.020]   I know it is true of so many of you.
[00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.020]   And so, Porch, would you please do an amazing job of helping me welcome
[00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.020]   old-time friend, guest speaker tonight, elder, lead pastor of the
[00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.020]   village, Matt Chandler.
[00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.020]   [Applause]
[00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.020]   Let's hug.
[00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.020]   It's just daffing hug.
[00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.020]   All of you both.
[00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.020]   There it is.
[00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.020]   Hey, Porch, it's good to be back, man.
[00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.020]   You guys look amazing.
[00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.020]   Especially you, bro.
[00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.020]   Just living the dream.
[00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.020]   If you have your Bibles, go ahead and grab those.
[00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.020]   We're going to be in Exodus chapter 3.
[00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:15.020]   If your Bible's on your phone and you trust yourself, you have self-control,
[00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.020]   then go ahead and do it that way.
[00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:21.020]   If not, just check on the screen behind me.
[00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:25.020]   I loved the worship set was just unbelievable.
[00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:29.020]   I don't know whether they are, but that was just not only anointed,
[00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.020]   but just God-ward.
[00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.020]   Like we weren't singing about us.
[00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.020]   We weren't singing about our stuff.
[00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.020]   We were singing about God's God-ness.
[00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:43.020]   And that has a shaping force that over time, like when you get to be
[00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:49.020]   Papaw Chandler's age, you start to appreciate the shaping force of
[00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:54.020]   God-ward-ness in regards to your own joy and delight in life.
[00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:58.020]   If you've listened to me preach or you've followed anything I've done,
[00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:03.020]   written or anything like that, you know I'm not prone to starting stuff
[00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.020]   with ancient pagan prayers.
[00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:15.020]   But tonight I'm going to read an Assyrian prayer from around 668 to 633 B.C.
[00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:20.020]   The title of the prayer was "A Prayer to Every God."
[00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:22.020]   Let me read it to you.
[00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:25.020]   It's longer than I would like, but they wrote it.
[00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:30.020]   "May the fury of my Lord's heart be quieted toward me.
[00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.020]   May the God who is not known be quieted toward me.
[00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.020]   May the goddess who is not known be quieted toward me.
[00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:43.020]   May the God whom I know or do not know be quieted toward me."
[00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.020]   Just brother covering his bases.
[00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:50.020]   "May the goddess whom I know or do not know be quieted toward me.
[00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.020]   My transgressions are many.
[00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:57.020]   Great are my transgressions which I have committed.
[00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.020]   Indeed, I do not know.
[00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:04.020]   The sins which I have done, indeed, I do not know.
[00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:09.020]   The forbidden thing which I have eaten, indeed, I did not know.
[00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:14.020]   The prohibited place on which I had set foot, indeed, I do not know.
[00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:19.020]   The Lord in the anger of his heart looked at me.
[00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.020]   The God in the rage of his heart confronted me.
[00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:28.020]   When the goddess was angry with me, she made me become ill.
[00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:33.020]   The God whom I know or do not know has oppressed me.
[00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:39.020]   The goddess whom I know or do not know has placed suffering upon me.
[00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:44.020]   How long, O my goddess whom I know or do not know,
[00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.020]   ere your hostile heart will be quieted?
[00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.020]   Man is dumb.
[00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:52.020]   He knows nothing."
[00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.020]   This is very different than the prayer of Jabez, if you remember that.
[00:05:55.020 --> 00:06:00.020]   "Mankind, everyone that exists, what does he know?
[00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:05.020]   Whether he is committing sin or doing good, he does not even know.
[00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:10.020]   O my Lord, do not cast your servant down.
[00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:14.020]   He is plunged into the waters of a swamp.
[00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:17.020]   Take him by the hands."
[00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.020]   Now, make some eye contact with me.
[00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:24.020]   By the grace of God, we never have to pray like that.
[00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:28.020]   You and I, as children of the creator God,
[00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:33.020]   are not left guessing what pleases God or displeases God.
[00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:35.020]   How would God behave?
[00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:36.020]   What does God love?
[00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:38.020]   What does God require of us?
[00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:41.020]   What's the meaning and purpose of our lives?
[00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:43.020]   What's this thing all about?
[00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:45.020]   We don't have to pray this prayer at all,
[00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:50.020]   because God in his grace has revealed himself to us.
[00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:54.020]   He has let us know who he is, what he wants,
[00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:57.020]   what life's all about, what our purpose is,
[00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:01.020]   and he has not left us groping in the dark,
[00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:05.020]   hoping we get it right when all's said and done.
[00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:09.020]   God has made himself known.
[00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:13.020]   Now, what's interesting, not just in our generation,
[00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:15.020]   but in all generations before us,
[00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:19.020]   each generation has this bad habit
[00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:23.020]   of disregarding God's revelation of himself
[00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:28.020]   and instead creating a new God made in our image that we like,
[00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:30.020]   and here's the way it works.
[00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:33.020]   Now, all of us, in this moment we're living in,
[00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:35.020]   all the inputs are creating
[00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:39.020]   what sociologists would call plausibility structures.
[00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:41.020]   Here's all that means.
[00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:44.020]   There's things that just make sense to us.
[00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:47.020]   Like when we see 'em, when we hear 'em, when we watch 'em,
[00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:50.020]   it just makes sense to us,
[00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:52.020]   and so then what we're prone to do
[00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:56.020]   is we're prone to make God in our own image.
[00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:58.020]   We're prone to make God submit
[00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:01.020]   to the current cultural's plausibility structures,
[00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:04.020]   and so God obviously doesn't believe
[00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:07.020]   what he used to believe about sexuality, bro.
[00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:09.020]   It's so 2025.
[00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:14.020]   It just makes sense to us that God would think like us
[00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:18.020]   and not like God has actually revealed himself to be,
[00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:22.020]   but God refuses to play this game with us.
[00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:25.020]   God will not let you give him a makeover.
[00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:27.020]   In fact, if I could be so bold
[00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:30.020]   without not trying to be offensive,
[00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:35.020]   it does not matter what you think about God.
[00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:36.020]   God is God,
[00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:39.020]   and your little opinion of how he should behave
[00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:41.020]   or what he should be like or how,
[00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:43.020]   he will not bend to your will.
[00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:46.020]   He will not become what we think he should become.
[00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:50.020]   He is what he is, and he's unapologetic,
[00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:52.020]   and as we'll read in a second,
[00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:55.020]   he has no plans on changing his name.
[00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:58.020]   He has no plans on changing his character
[00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:01.020]   so we think he's more palatable.
[00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:07.020]   God is God, and there is no one else like him,
[00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:12.020]   and our opinion of him has no bearing on who he is.
[00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:16.020]   He is who he is,
[00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:19.020]   and so what I want to emphasize tonight,
[00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:21.020]   and we sang it through the whole set,
[00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:26.020]   is I want to talk about the holiness of God
[00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:30.020]   and then some really good news around that holiness.
[00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:34.020]   God is ultimate reality.
[00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:37.020]   He's not a concept that you and I get to shape,
[00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:40.020]   and so I want to read this Exodus passage.
[00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:42.020]   If you've got a church background,
[00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:44.020]   here's the story all through Genesis.
[00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:48.020]   In the early part of Exodus, you see God working.
[00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:49.020]   You see him moving.
[00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:51.020]   You see him working and doing things,
[00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:54.020]   but he never actually introduces himself.
[00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:58.020]   He just, as at work and people, he's just God,
[00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:02.020]   and then what happens is the people of Israel are enslaved.
[00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:04.020]   God hears their crying.
[00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:07.020]   In fact, it's one of my favorite passages in the Bible
[00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:11.020]   that God heard them, saw them, and came down,
[00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:14.020]   which is good for you to dwell on and think on
[00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:17.020]   that God sees, he hears, and he has come down.
[00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:21.020]   So we read that, and then God goes and finds a man
[00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:24.020]   that's going to be used by him in profound ways
[00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:27.020]   to deliver his people out of bondage,
[00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:31.020]   and he comes to Moses, and Moses makes sense, right?
[00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:33.020]   He's fluent in Egyptian.
[00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:35.020]   He knows the layout of the palace.
[00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:39.020]   He knows he's the perfect guy for the job,
[00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:42.020]   and so God shows up, and Moses wants no part of this.
[00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:45.020]   He had already tried his own little rebellion back in the day.
[00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:47.020]   He had murdered a man with his hands,
[00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:49.020]   and then did a really poor job of burying the body,
[00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:52.020]   and they found the body, and then he had to flee and run
[00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:54.020]   when Pharaoh came after him,
[00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:59.020]   and he's just lived out in median in like total isolation,
[00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:01.020]   like he deleted the apps.
[00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:03.020]   No one knew what he was doing, no pictures of lamb,
[00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:05.020]   and none of that.
[00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:07.020]   He's just out working the pasture,
[00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:11.020]   and he comes across this bush that was on fire
[00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:13.020]   and not being consumed,
[00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:17.020]   and God begins to speak to him out of the bush
[00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:19.020]   to tell him, "Hey, you're my guy.
[00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:21.020]   "I know you're a stutterer.
[00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:22.020]   "I know you're a murderer.
[00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:23.020]   "I know you're kind of rage.
[00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:25.020]   "You still kind of freak out in traffic
[00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:26.020]   "if somebody's in the left lane
[00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:27.020]   "not quite going the way they should.
[00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:29.020]   "I know you've got some issues, but you're my guy.
[00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:31.020]   "It's not going to be your Egyptian skills.
[00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:33.020]   "It's not going to be your knowledge of the past.
[00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:35.020]   "It's going to be my power
[00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:38.020]   "that leads my people out of bondage,"
[00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:40.020]   and Moses kind of keeps deflecting,
[00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:42.020]   keeps deflecting, keeps deflecting,
[00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:44.020]   and then he finally in desperation goes,
[00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:46.020]   "They're going to ask me who sent me.
[00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:47.020]   "What do I say?"
[00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:49.020]   And this is the first time in the Bible
[00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:53.020]   God introduces himself by giving his name to his people.
[00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:54.020]   So let's look at this.
[00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:58.020]   Exodus 3, I'm going to start in verse 14.
[00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:02.020]   "God replied to Moses,
[00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:05.020]   "'I am who I am.
[00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:10.020]   "'This is what you are to say to the Israelites.
[00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:13.020]   "'I am has sent me to you.'
[00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:17.020]   "God also said to Moses, 'Say this to the Israelites.
[00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:19.020]   "'The Lord, the God of your ancestors,
[00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:22.020]   "'the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac,
[00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:25.020]   "'the God of Jacob has sent me to you.'"
[00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:27.020]   And here's, this is a huge sentence.
[00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:31.020]   "'This is my name forever.
[00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:33.020]   "'I am who I am.
[00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:36.020]   "'I am Jehovah, Yahweh.
[00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:40.020]   "'That is my name forever,
[00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:42.020]   "'and how I am to be remembered in every generation.'"
[00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:44.020]   So you remember a moment ago when I said
[00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:45.020]   God's not going to change his name
[00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:48.020]   to kind of meet our cultural standards.
[00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:49.020]   There it is.
[00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:53.020]   "'This is my name in every generation.
[00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:59.020]   "'I will not change who I am to fit your cultural norms.
[00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:04.020]   "'I sit at the center of reality enthroned on high.
[00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:05.020]   "'You will conform to me.
[00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:08.020]   "'I will not conform to you.'"
[00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:10.020]   That's the thrust of the passage.
[00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:12.020]   Now this, "I am who I am,"
[00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:15.020]   is meant to blow up our categories, right?
[00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:18.020]   It's translated Yahweh or Jehovah.
[00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:20.020]   If you're reading in the Old Testament,
[00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:23.020]   you're going to see this as the Lord in all caps.
[00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:26.020]   And so every time you see the Lord in all caps,
[00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:29.020]   you're reading this, "I am, Jehovah, Yahweh."
[00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:31.020]   But this, "I am who I am,"
[00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:34.020]   it's there to kind of blow up our categories.
[00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:35.020]   Here's what I mean.
[00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:37.020]   You are, I am something.
[00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:38.020]   I am.
[00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:41.020]   It's hard for me to explain to you who I am
[00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:42.020]   without giving you the something.
[00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:43.020]   I am a pastor.
[00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:44.020]   I am a husband.
[00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:46.020]   I am a dad.
[00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:47.020]   I am a friend.
[00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:49.020]   I am a fill in the blank.
[00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:50.020]   I am these things.
[00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:52.020]   It could be my socioeconomic.
[00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:53.020]   It could be my ethnicity.
[00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:54.020]   I am something.
[00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:58.020]   I have to use I am, but God isn't that way.
[00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:01.020]   He isn't shaped by others.
[00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:03.020]   I have been shaped by others.
[00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:05.020]   God has never been shaped by anyone.
[00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:09.020]   Like you did not just spontaneously arrive here tonight
[00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:12.020]   with all your compulsions and fears and hopes and joys.
[00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:17.020]   No, that was shaped by your environment to some degree.
[00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:19.020]   God isn't built like that.
[00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:22.020]   He's not shaped by anyone.
[00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:23.020]   And then he goes on,
[00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:25.020]   and here's what's funny about I am who I am.
[00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:27.020]   In the Hebrew, a better translation would be,
[00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:31.020]   I be who I be, which sounds cooler, but it's bad English.
[00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:34.020]   So they translated I am who I am.
[00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:36.020]   But God is saying in this,
[00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:39.020]   I have always been who I have always been.
[00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:41.020]   He is unchanging.
[00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:43.020]   You and me, we change.
[00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:47.020]   God, immutable, does not change.
[00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:49.020]   He is the unchanging God.
[00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:50.020]   I am who I am.
[00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:52.020]   Now I've been shaped by others.
[00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:53.020]   You've been shaped by others.
[00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:55.020]   God is not shaped by others.
[00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:58.020]   And then I will be who I will be.
[00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:01.020]   God will be what matters in the future.
[00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:04.020]   God is ultimate reality.
[00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:07.020]   Past, present, and future.
[00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:11.020]   Now, let me take my opening illustration
[00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:13.020]   and give you an example of what I mean
[00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:15.020]   by plausibility structures
[00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:17.020]   and how we tend to try to define God
[00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:18.020]   in our own cultural moment
[00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:21.020]   as opposed to letting God tell us who he is
[00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:23.020]   and heeding that.
[00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:25.020]   So if you were to ask,
[00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:30.020]   like even your most unbelieving friend
[00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:33.020]   to tell you what God was like,
[00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:40.020]   90% shot that they're gonna say God is love.
[00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:41.020]   God is love.
[00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:42.020]   That's who God is.
[00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:45.020]   God is love and love is love and God is love.
[00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:47.020]   And that's the refrain of our--
[00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:49.020]   Now here's the problem.
[00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:52.020]   The problem with that is love is a junk drawer word
[00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:54.020]   in English.
[00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:56.020]   It has no meaning.
[00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:57.020]   And I know that for how we use it
[00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:59.020]   because I will oftentimes talk about
[00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:00.020]   how much I love my wife
[00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:03.020]   and I'll tell you how much I love a good ribeye.
[00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:05.020]   And I'm not talking about the same thing
[00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:06.020]   when I use that.
[00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:08.020]   I love my dog and I love my children
[00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:09.020]   and I'm not saying--
[00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:12.020]   It's just a junk drawer word.
[00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:14.020]   So it's been emptied of meaning
[00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:15.020]   and most of the time,
[00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:17.020]   when people say God is love,
[00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:21.020]   what they're saying is God and I are cool.
[00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:23.020]   Like God doesn't have any problem with me.
[00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:26.020]   Like God doesn't have a problem with anyone.
[00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:28.020]   Like he's like Tinkerbell from Peter Pan.
[00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:30.020]   He just kind of flies around
[00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:32.020]   and sprinkles things on people and they fly.
[00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:35.020]   And he's always just cheering everybody on
[00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:37.020]   to their ideal self.
[00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:39.020]   And this is what we've done.
[00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:41.020]   That God is love.
[00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:46.020]   And what we mean is that God is who I want him to be.
[00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:48.020]   And here's what's hard.
[00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:51.020]   God is love.
[00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:52.020]   It's not something he has.
[00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:54.020]   It's actually, he is it.
[00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:55.020]   He is love.
[00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:58.020]   In fact, we read that twice in the same passage
[00:16:58.020 --> 00:17:00.020]   in the New Testament.
[00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:04.020]   And yet, if we're just perusing the canon,
[00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:07.020]   Genesis to Revelation,
[00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:13.020]   he is called something else 400 times in the Bible
[00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:17.020]   and 400 times in the Bible compared to two.
[00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:20.020]   He is called holy.
[00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:25.020]   So I think we can start teasing from this
[00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:28.020]   that the main kind of thrust of God wanting us
[00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:32.020]   to get to know him is not that he is love,
[00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:35.020]   but that his love has been informed by his holiness.
[00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:37.020]   Are you tracking with me when I say that?
[00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:41.020]   It's not his love that informs his holiness.
[00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:43.020]   It's his holiness that informs his love.
[00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:45.020]   Now, for that to make sense,
[00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:47.020]   we have to actually have a definition
[00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:49.020]   for what holiness is.
[00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:51.020]   'Cause here would be my bet, and I could be wrong.
[00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:53.020]   I don't know where you go to church.
[00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:55.020]   If I just stopped and I was like,
[00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:57.020]   put an open mic out there, and I were to ask you,
[00:17:57.020 --> 00:17:59.020]   tell me what holiness is.
[00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:01.020]   I'm curious.
[00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:03.020]   I mean, I'm not, no smoke.
[00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:06.020]   This is a discipleship, Western evangelical issue.
[00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:07.020]   It's not yours.
[00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:10.020]   So here, we just sang like 30 songs
[00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:12.020]   that talked about his holiness.
[00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:15.020]   And I was looking around, like, holy, holy.
[00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:17.020]   And I'm just wondering,
[00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:20.020]   do you even know what you're saying?
[00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:22.020]   This is such a sad thing.
[00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:24.020]   We've got these Bible words,
[00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:26.020]   this kind of Christian nomenclature
[00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:30.020]   that's been empty of its meaning, depth, and power.
[00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:34.020]   So let me throw up the definition of holiness.
[00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:36.020]   It means wholeness,
[00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:38.020]   entireness,
[00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:41.020]   perfection in a moral sense.
[00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:44.020]   And so when we say God is love,
[00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:45.020]   we're not wrong.
[00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:50.020]   We're just saying his love is different than our love
[00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:52.020]   in that his love is whole.
[00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:55.020]   His love is entire.
[00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:59.020]   His love is perfect in a moral sense.
[00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:01.020]   We can't love like that.
[00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:03.020]   God can love like that.
[00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:06.020]   So his love isn't indifference to our sin.
[00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:10.020]   His love isn't indifference to our rebellion.
[00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:11.020]   His love is holy.
[00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:12.020]   It's entire.
[00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:15.020]   It's morally perfect.
[00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:19.020]   And a good place to see this is in Revelation chapter four.
[00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:21.020]   In Revelation chapter four,
[00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:24.020]   what we see is Christ enthroned on high.
[00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:26.020]   Like he's on his throne,
[00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:29.020]   and there are these 12 thrones to his right,
[00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:31.020]   these 12 thrones to his left,
[00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:36.020]   symbolizing the 12 tribes of Israel and the 12 apostles.
[00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:38.020]   What they're standing for is the people of God
[00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:40.020]   across human history.
[00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:42.020]   And then in front of him,
[00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:44.020]   you've got men and women from every tribe,
[00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:46.020]   tongue, and nation on earth,
[00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:48.020]   and they're there and they're worshiping him.
[00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:50.020]   And you've got a rainbow behind his throne,
[00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:53.020]   and you've got crystal and topaz and all these things
[00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:55.020]   that are just meant to communicate
[00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:57.020]   that all the beauty and all the power
[00:19:57.020 --> 00:20:01.020]   and all the authority belong to Jesus.
[00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:03.020]   And then in the middle of the scene,
[00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:05.020]   there's these four freaky creatures.
[00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:07.020]   I mean, the stuff of nightmares.
[00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:09.020]   I'm telling you, you can read it.
[00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:11.020]   You wake up and one of those floating above your head,
[00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:12.020]   you're freaking out.
[00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:14.020]   You ain't like worshiping all of a sudden.
[00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:15.020]   You're wetting yourself.
[00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:18.020]   And so you've got these four freaky little creatures,
[00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:20.020]   and they're made up of these different things.
[00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:22.020]   Like they're part ox, they're part eagle,
[00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:25.020]   they're covered in eyes, they've got faces like men,
[00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:26.020]   they've got these wings,
[00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:28.020]   and they're covering stuff with their wings
[00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:29.020]   and they're fluttering.
[00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:31.020]   The Bible says since the beginning
[00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:35.020]   'til forever into eternity, they sing the same song.
[00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:40.020]   Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty
[00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:42.020]   who was and is and is to come.
[00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:43.020]   Do you catch it?
[00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:46.020]   They're not around the throne singing,
[00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:49.020]   mercy, mercy, mercy, or love, love, love,
[00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:53.020]   or you fill in the blank with your favorite attribute of God.
[00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:56.020]   No, they're saying, no, he is holy, he is mighty,
[00:20:56.020 --> 00:21:00.020]   he is enthroned on high, his name will not change.
[00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:01.020]   Did you see the line I just drew?
[00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:04.020]   So he introduces himself as what?
[00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:08.020]   Yahweh, I am who I am, I will not change my name.
[00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:10.020]   I have always been this, I am this now,
[00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:11.020]   and I will always be this.
[00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:15.020]   And then we fast forward to Revelation four
[00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:16.020]   and what are they saying?
[00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:18.020]   This is my name in every generation.
[00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:20.020]   The same thing he said in Exodus three.
[00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:26.020]   This is the God of the Bible, holy, perfect.
[00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:31.020]   This is the giant obvious idea in the Bible
[00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:33.020]   that God is holy.
[00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:35.020]   If I could say it more simply,
[00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:40.020]   Jesus might be your friend, but he is not your homeboy.
[00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:42.020]   Jesus might be your friend, but he is,
[00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:46.020]   you see him, you will not dap him up, 100%.
[00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:49.020]   People can't even see angels without falling on the ground
[00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:50.020]   like dead people.
[00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:52.020]   You think you're gonna dap up the king of kings
[00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:53.020]   and lord of lords?
[00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:55.020]   You will not.
[00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:59.020]   He might be your friend, John 15, he is not your homeboy.
[00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:02.020]   He is holy, and look right at me,
[00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:05.020]   'cause this is where things are gonna get more difficult.
[00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:12.020]   God will not violate his holiness for any reason.
[00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:16.020]   God will not violate his holiness for any reason.
[00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:20.020]   He is not understanding like that, if you will.
[00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:24.020]   Now, what I've just done is created tension with the text.
[00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:25.020]   Here's what I mean.
[00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:30.020]   God is holy, but God is love.
[00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:35.020]   Now, this is a problem because God is holy,
[00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:39.020]   and here, look at me, don't, and God loves you.
[00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:40.020]   But here's the problem.
[00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:44.020]   When holiness, when the pure holiness of God
[00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:51.020]   manifests presently, it destroys anything that's not holy.
[00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:54.020]   I don't know if you ever thought about God's wrath this way,
[00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:55.020]   but let me frame it like this.
[00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:58.020]   God's wrath is not rage.
[00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:01.020]   It's priestly fire.
[00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:02.020]   I'm gonna say that again.
[00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:04.020]   God's wrath is not rage.
[00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:06.020]   It's priestly fire.
[00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:12.020]   The very essence of who he is will obliterate anything
[00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:16.020]   that is sinful, twisted, dark, and broken, anything.
[00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:18.020]   Even if it's a small, little thing,
[00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:21.020]   it happens just because of the nature of his holiness.
[00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:23.020]   When you read about the wrath of God in the Bible,
[00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:26.020]   it's not like God freaking out like your mom or dad used to
[00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:28.020]   and flipping over, you know, whatever.
[00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:29.020]   That's not what it is.
[00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:31.020]   It's priestly fire.
[00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:33.020]   It's his holiness obliterates.
[00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:37.020]   And so now you've got a God who wants to be near to us.
[00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:38.020]   He wants to love us,
[00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:41.020]   but all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God.
[00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:48.020]   He loves us, and his holiness will destroy us if he comes near.
[00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:51.020]   How can that be fixed?
[00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:53.020]   It can't be fixed by us because the Bible says
[00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:55.020]   that we were born in iniquity,
[00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:57.020]   that we were born with a bent,
[00:23:57.020 --> 00:24:00.020]   that we came out of the womb headed towards rebellion.
[00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:03.020]   If you've ever been around toddlers, this is true.
[00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:05.020]   Like, look, I mean, my kids are older now,
[00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:07.020]   but I can tell you there were things I saw my kids do
[00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:10.020]   that they did not learn in our environment, if you will.
[00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:14.020]   Like, my mouth to God's ear,
[00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:16.020]   they never watched me shove down Lauren
[00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:18.020]   and snatch the remote out of her hand
[00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:21.020]   and scream "mine" into her face.
[00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:25.020]   They did not learn that in my home.
[00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:28.020]   They had broken little hearts.
[00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:30.020]   And from the earliest ages,
[00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:33.020]   when they didn't get what they wanted, they acted violently.
[00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:35.020]   They acted in rebellion.
[00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:38.020]   This is how all of us come into the world,
[00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:40.020]   in iniquity, bent towards rebellion.
[00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:41.020]   So God loves you.
[00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:43.020]   He wants to move towards you.
[00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:45.020]   And if he moves towards you in his holiness,
[00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:48.020]   you will be obliterated.
[00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:51.020]   And so here's what's crazy about God's holiness.
[00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:54.020]   For all his incommunicable attributes,
[00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:59.020]   all of the things that he is and we can never be,
[00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:03.020]   this is the one he's offering to make us.
[00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:06.020]   So God doesn't say, "I'm going to make you transcendent.
[00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:08.020]   "I'm going to make you omnipresent.
[00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:10.020]   "I'm going to make you omnipotent.
[00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:12.020]   "I'm going to make you omniscient."
[00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:14.020]   He's not saying, "I'm going to make you immutable."
[00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:16.020]   None of those are gods and gods alone.
[00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:21.020]   But God, who is holy, solves the problem of holiness and love
[00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:27.020]   by offering holiness to those who will believe by faith
[00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:29.020]   in the grace made available.
[00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:34.020]   And he does this namely through the blood of Jesus Christ.
[00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:36.020]   I don't know if you've ever thought about this.
[00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:38.020]   When we talk about blood in church,
[00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:41.020]   if you're not a Christian, it probably sounds weird.
[00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:44.020]   Like the only two people that sing about blood
[00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:47.020]   are like heavy metal bands and Christians.
[00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:49.020]   It's like there's Pantera and Chris Tomlin.
[00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:53.020]   It's just like that's who's singing about blood.
[00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:55.020]   But there's a reason that we're singing about blood
[00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:57.020]   because the Bible's been really clear
[00:25:57.020 --> 00:26:00.020]   about the effects of sin.
[00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:05.020]   It talks about the scope of sin, that sin fractures everything.
[00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:08.020]   It fractures everything at a macro level and a micro level.
[00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:10.020]   Like when sin entered the cosmos,
[00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:14.020]   it fractured everything down to the cellular level.
[00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:19.020]   He talks a lot about the damages, causes along the horizontal plane,
[00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:22.020]   the damage it does to us and then the damage it does to others.
[00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:27.020]   The scriptures are clear about this, that sin leads to death,
[00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:33.020]   that sin wreaks havoc, that bitterness and strife and anger
[00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:38.020]   and lust rot out the soul.
[00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:42.020]   And then he gives God's solution for it.
[00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:45.020]   We see when the Bible talks about blood,
[00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:47.020]   so the ancient Near East, when it talked about blood,
[00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:49.020]   when we see blood, we think death.
[00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:51.020]   It's just what we think.
[00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:53.020]   Like we see blood and we think death.
[00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:56.020]   Ancient Near East saw blood and thought life.
[00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:57.020]   It's opposite.
[00:26:57.020 --> 00:26:59.020]   Like ancient Near East, they saw a sacrifice,
[00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:01.020]   they saw blood flowing out of a temple,
[00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:04.020]   they thought life, life is there.
[00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:09.020]   So when the Bible's talking about the blood, namely the blood of Jesus,
[00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:11.020]   here are the things it says about his blood,
[00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:15.020]   that it establishes a new covenant.
[00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:18.020]   That means God enters into a covenant with you,
[00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:21.020]   a covenant that he will not break.
[00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:24.020]   In fact, make some eye contact so I can say this to you.
[00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:26.020]   I don't care how you came in tonight,
[00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:29.020]   Jesus knew what he was buying on the cross.
[00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:31.020]   I don't care what's in your past.
[00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:33.020]   Jesus knew what he was buying on the cross.
[00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:38.020]   He didn't die on the cross and now that he sees you in 3D, full of regret.
[00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:40.020]   That's not the way this works.
[00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:43.020]   The cross is so grotesque and so heinous
[00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:46.020]   so that you'd be able to look to it and believe
[00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:48.020]   that he paid your price in full.
[00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:51.020]   This is the new covenant, and the writer of Hebrews says
[00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:55.020]   that God has sworn by his own name to keep this covenant
[00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:59.020]   because there wasn't anything else that he could swear by that had more power.
[00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:00.020]   Right?
[00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:02.020]   Like you and I can swear to the Lord,
[00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:04.020]   we can swear by our moms, we can swear by--
[00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:07.020]   God can't swear by anything other than himself.
[00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:13.020]   And so he swears to himself that he'll keep his covenant promise to us.
[00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:16.020]   The blood atones for our sins.
[00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:22.020]   All of them, follow me, past, present, and future.
[00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:26.020]   So here's what I know is in the room, and I got to keep an eye on the time.
[00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:31.020]   There are some of you that when you became a Christian,
[00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:34.020]   man, it was euphoric.
[00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:37.020]   And you felt free, and you couldn't believe God loved you,
[00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:39.020]   and you were on it, man.
[00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:43.020]   And then a year later, six months later, two years later,
[00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:45.020]   you stumbled and fell, and you screwed up,
[00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:47.020]   and now you just can't believe he loves you.
[00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:50.020]   So he loved you when you were at your worst,
[00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:54.020]   but now that you're a son or a daughter, you screwed up and he hates you?
[00:28:54.020 --> 00:29:00.020]   And then this starts, I think, the kind of bondage and enslavement
[00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:02.020]   I experience with so many of God's people
[00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:04.020]   because you refuse to believe the gospel that you believed
[00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:06.020]   when you first believed.
[00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:07.020]   And the gospel is what?
[00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:09.020]   That all of your sins, past, present, and future,
[00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:12.020]   are fully, freely, and forever forgiven.
[00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:17.020]   Yeah, this is Paul's point in Romans chapter 5.
[00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:21.020]   When he's saying, if he loved you when you were at your worst,
[00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:27.020]   when you were his enemy, how much more then does he love you now
[00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:31.020]   that you're his son or his daughter?
[00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:36.020]   No, no, no, the blood of Jesus covers us from all unrighteousness.
[00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:37.020]   It provides this salvation.
[00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:39.020]   It redeems those who would believe.
[00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:43.020]   It cleanses our consciences.
[00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:45.020]   How does it cleanse our conscience?
[00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:47.020]   Let me tell this story.
[00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:49.020]   Years ago, I was preaching down--
[00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:54.020]   So I graduated from Texas City High School down by Galveston Island,
[00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:57.020]   and I had been gone a long time.
[00:29:57.020 --> 00:30:00.020]   And, man, I did some scandalous stuff when I was there
[00:30:00.020 --> 00:30:02.020]   before I became a Christian.
[00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:04.020]   And I was preaching in Clear Creek, which is right north.
[00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:06.020]   And so I thought, you know what would be cool?
[00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:09.020]   I'm going to go down, and I'm going to take pictures of my old houses
[00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:11.020]   and all this stuff so I can show my kids when I get home.
[00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:14.020]   And I had that experience where, you know when you thought
[00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:18.020]   that you were climbing some giant oak, and then you get there
[00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:22.020]   because you were like 7 or 8, 9 or 10, and it was like a bush?
[00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:24.020]   It wasn't even a tree. You didn't even climb a tree.
[00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:25.020]   It was like a bush.
[00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:28.020]   And so as I'm driving into town to kind of take pictures of these,
[00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:30.020]   I pass this field.
[00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:36.020]   And in this field, I got in a fight with a kid named Sean.
[00:30:36.020 --> 00:30:41.020]   And, man, I just sucker-punched him, and there was nobody there to pull me off.
[00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:46.020]   And I just beat--I just shamed and embarrassed him in front of everyone.
[00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:51.020]   And I have to believe, unless God did some kind of gracious work in his life,
[00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:54.020]   wherever he is right now, he hates me.
[00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:57.020]   The thought of me, the thought of my name, the thought of that moment,
[00:30:57.020 --> 00:31:00.020]   that's the kind of crap that will follow a man the rest of his life.
[00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:02.020]   And so I was like, "Oh, God."
[00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:04.020]   And then I kept driving. I was going to the first house,
[00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:08.020]   and I passed by this other house, Holly's house, that was a party,
[00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:12.020]   and there were some grotesque, wicked, sinful things that happened
[00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:15.020]   in that house that I was a part of.
[00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:17.020]   And then I was like, "Oh, my gosh."
[00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:20.020]   And then rounded out this other house as I went to the second house
[00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:24.020]   that we lived in in that area, and another house where there was another party.
[00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:28.020]   And I just--wherever I went in that town, I started feeling immense shame.
[00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:31.020]   And then I'm driving up to preach the gospel to a room full of pastors,
[00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:34.020]   and there's this little voice in my head about what those people
[00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:37.020]   would think about me if they knew I was preaching the gospel,
[00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:42.020]   and how shameful my life had been and how gross my life had been.
[00:31:42.020 --> 00:31:44.020]   And I'm telling you, maybe you're freer than I am.
[00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:48.020]   I felt physically nauseous driving back up.
[00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:50.020]   And then I remembered.
[00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:54.020]   And then I remembered that the book of Galatians says
[00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:56.020]   that I have been crucified with Christ.
[00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:59.020]   It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me.
[00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:03.020]   And the life I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God
[00:32:03.020 --> 00:32:05.020]   who loves me and gave himself up for me.
[00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:07.020]   So that moment for me was a cleansing of my conscience,
[00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:12.020]   because that Matt Chandler was a piece of crap, and that Matt Chandler's dead.
[00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:15.020]   That Matt Chandler went to the cross with Christ,
[00:32:15.020 --> 00:32:20.020]   and part of the brutality of the cross was old Matt Chandler,
[00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:26.020]   for all his scandalous wickedness, not being able to condemn me anymore.
[00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:31.020]   That's how the blood of Jesus cleanses our consciousness.
[00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:35.020]   So if we think about this kind of along the biblical arc,
[00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:38.020]   here's what's happening.
[00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:43.020]   The blood of Jesus covers us in such a way,
[00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:45.020]   gives us righteousness in such a way,
[00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:50.020]   takes our sin away in such a way, so completely,
[00:32:50.020 --> 00:32:55.020]   that when God looks upon us, the Bible uses this kind of language,
[00:32:55.020 --> 00:33:03.020]   that we are spotless.
[00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:09.020]   I have been spotless today, but you know who calls me spotless?
[00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:13.020]   God. How in his holiness can he call me spotless?
[00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:16.020]   Because of the blood of Jesus.
[00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:19.020]   Because the blood of Jesus has cleansed me from all unrighteousness
[00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:23.020]   in my past, in my present, and all that I've got waiting for me tomorrow.
[00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:27.020]   So that frees me up to go where? To run to him, not from him.
[00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:32.020]   To cling to that grace, not run from that grace.
[00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:34.020]   In fact, I've tried to say at The Village for 20 years,
[00:33:34.020 --> 00:33:37.020]   I'll know what you actually believe about the gospel,
[00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:40.020]   not by how you act when everything's going your way,
[00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:44.020]   I'll know by how you act when you blow it.
[00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:47.020]   And if you blow it, and you go farther than you ever thought you would,
[00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:51.020]   and you feel that rod of shame in your chest,
[00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:55.020]   and you run to him, then you get the gospel.
[00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:59.020]   And if you run from him, you're still stuck in some sort of
[00:33:59.020 --> 00:34:03.020]   moral-based theism, that you might as well pray that,
[00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:06.020]   that prayer that we read at the beginning.
[00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:10.020]   No, no, no. The grace of God covers our unrighteousness
[00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:12.020]   through the blood of Jesus.
[00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:15.020]   It's why we sing about it. It's why we talk about it.
[00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:18.020]   It's why us and the heavy metalers, we get together and we write
[00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:21.020]   melodic scream songs about the blood of Jesus,
[00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:24.020]   because it covers us from righteousness.
[00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:29.020]   The perfection of the law had to be dealt with, or God's not just.
[00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:34.020]   In his holiness, if God just went, "Hey, that rebellion, don't worry about that,"
[00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:37.020]   now means God's not just.
[00:34:37.020 --> 00:34:42.020]   So, to satisfy the just requirements of the law,
[00:34:42.020 --> 00:34:47.020]   the second person of the Trinity, the Son of God, condescended,
[00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:52.020]   put on flesh and blood, dwelt among us, was tempted in every way we would be tempted,
[00:34:52.020 --> 00:34:54.020]   and yet stayed true to Christ.
[00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:57.020]   And then he imputes that righteousness to us,
[00:34:57.020 --> 00:35:01.020]   after he takes on all of our sin on the cross,
[00:35:01.020 --> 00:35:05.020]   and resurrects to reveal that the bill's been paid in full.
[00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:09.020]   If he's still in the ground, I'm still in debt, because he was risen,
[00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:13.020]   then death and sin have been defeated for all who put their faith in him.
[00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:18.020]   Now, the invitation then to you and to me
[00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:23.020]   is to receive from God this holiness that he wishes to lavish upon us.
[00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:29.020]   It's to receive from him what we can never earn through our striving.
[00:35:29.020 --> 00:35:37.020]   Given by his grace something that all our moral improvement can never bring about.
[00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:43.020]   To be reconciled to God through Christ in a way that we're transformed from the inside out.
[00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:49.020]   Not white-knuckled, navel-gazing, trying to get morally, morally pure, more and more and more.
[00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:56.020]   I think what I have found, if that's your thing, is you're going to run out of gas.
[00:35:56.020 --> 00:36:00.020]   You're going to run out of gas, and you're going to punt, and you're going to say stupid stuff,
[00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:02.020]   like this Jesus stuff doesn't work.
[00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:06.020]   I'd like to just say, that's stupid. You never tried Jesus.
[00:36:06.020 --> 00:36:09.020]   You tried you really hard.
[00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:15.020]   And the Bible's pretty clear that you really hard doesn't work.
[00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:21.020]   So if your answer to your life's problems is to me even harder,
[00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:29.020]   friend, you're like on a treadmill, you're running, but you're not going anywhere.
[00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:32.020]   No, no, no. The way out is the way in.
[00:36:32.020 --> 00:36:35.020]   To receive from God his holiness.
[00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:44.020]   To accept from God the free gift of grace that was poured out on the cross at Calvary.
[00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:48.020]   Now, how do you respond to this? How should you respond?
[00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:54.020]   Well, let me read one more passage to you, and I want to talk about that.
[00:36:54.020 --> 00:36:57.020]   There's this great passage that Christians in particular, they know,
[00:36:57.020 --> 00:37:00.020]   and sometimes they'll quote it. They haven't really read the rest of the chapter,
[00:37:00.020 --> 00:37:04.020]   but it's fine. Not my point tonight.
[00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:09.020]   Where Isaiah, in the year that King Uzziah died, it was a big year.
[00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:11.020]   It was a big year.
[00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:14.020]   Uzziah had brought all sorts of reform. He kind of flamed out at the end,
[00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:17.020]   but he had done a lot of good stuff for Israel.
[00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:21.020]   But he ends up becoming strong in his own heart, rebels against God,
[00:37:21.020 --> 00:37:26.020]   and gets leprosy, dies. God's holy.
[00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:33.020]   And in the year that he dies, Isaiah, our boy, Isaiah, good man, upright man.
[00:37:33.020 --> 00:37:37.020]   This is what we know about him. He goes into the temple to worship.
[00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:39.020]   So he certainly is a God-fearer.
[00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:43.020]   And when he goes in there, he has this vision of the Lord.
[00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:48.020]   What's funny is it looks very similar to what I described in Revelation 4.
[00:37:48.020 --> 00:37:54.020]   It was God enthroned in his temple, and the robe filled his temple.
[00:37:54.020 --> 00:37:59.020]   And when Isaiah sees him, he says this,
[00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:05.020]   "Then I said, 'Woe is me, for I am ruined,
[00:38:05.020 --> 00:38:10.020]   because I am a man of unclean lips, and live among a people of unclean lips,
[00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:15.020]   and because my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of armies.'"
[00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:17.020]   Now, here's something I've always wondered.
[00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:23.020]   Did Isaiah know when he walked in there that he was a man of unclean lips,
[00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:26.020]   and that he lived among a people of unclean lips?
[00:38:26.020 --> 00:38:33.020]   Or did seeing God rightly for who he is, enthroned in his holiness,
[00:38:33.020 --> 00:38:37.020]   expose in Isaiah his lack of holiness,
[00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:41.020]   that cut him to the quick, that led him to repent?
[00:38:41.020 --> 00:38:44.020]   Personal experience.
[00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:48.020]   When God shows up, you see things rightly,
[00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:54.020]   and that rarely gives you swagger, and most frequently gives you tears.
[00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:56.020]   Now, they can be tears of joy,
[00:38:56.020 --> 00:38:59.020]   because conviction's a sweet gift of God's grace.
[00:38:59.020 --> 00:39:03.020]   Conviction's always an invitation into greater intimacy with God.
[00:39:03.020 --> 00:39:05.020]   You should never despise it.
[00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:09.020]   God's not in the guilt business, but he is in the conviction business,
[00:39:09.020 --> 00:39:15.020]   because the conviction is reminding you that he has filled that gap.
[00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:19.020]   Why are you trying to create it again?
[00:39:19.020 --> 00:39:24.020]   Step into the intimacy that I've purchased by my blood.
[00:39:24.020 --> 00:39:27.020]   And so what should be our response if God is holy,
[00:39:27.020 --> 00:39:30.020]   and God doesn't care about your opinion of him,
[00:39:30.020 --> 00:39:33.020]   and how you think he should behave or not behave,
[00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:36.020]   or how you think he should act or not act,
[00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:42.020]   and that even God's love is informed by his moral perfection,
[00:39:42.020 --> 00:39:44.020]   so that all the commands of God in the Bible,
[00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:47.020]   every "thou shalt" and "thou shalt not"
[00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:50.020]   are woven into the fabric of creation for human flourishing,
[00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:55.020]   and to try to step outside of that tapestry
[00:39:55.020 --> 00:39:58.020]   is great rebellion against the holiness of God,
[00:39:58.020 --> 00:40:02.020]   and it's a willingly putting yourself in the position
[00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:05.020]   obliterated by his holiness when all is said and done.
[00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:08.020]   This is why the Bible says that at the second coming of Christ,
[00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:13.020]   the mountains flee before him.
[00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:16.020]   I'm guessing if the mountains are trembling at his coming,
[00:40:16.020 --> 00:40:19.020]   you're not going to be standing with your chest out.
[00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:22.020]   I'm guessing you're going to want to try to catch up to those mountains.
[00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:25.020]   In fact, the Bible says that people cry out for the mountains to fall on them,
[00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:28.020]   to try to hide from the coming of the Lord.
[00:40:28.020 --> 00:40:34.020]   So those of us in Christ, those of us who are covered in his blood,
[00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:40.020]   spotless, blameless, delighted in, rejoiced over,
[00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:44.020]   sung over, sons and daughters.
[00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:48.020]   No, no, no, we don't run on that day.
[00:40:48.020 --> 00:40:51.020]   The Bible says we get caught up.
[00:40:51.020 --> 00:40:53.020]   I love that.
[00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:58.020]   Anybody else running, we're caught up? I'll take that.
[00:40:58.020 --> 00:41:01.020]   Caught up to what? Caught up to reward?
[00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:04.020]   An ever-increasing life for eternity.
[00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:09.020]   Ruling and reigning alongside King Jesus in a remade heaven and earth,
[00:41:09.020 --> 00:41:13.020]   not some spiritual, ethereal plane where we're playing harps
[00:41:13.020 --> 00:41:15.020]   and hanging out in some ghosty space.
[00:41:15.020 --> 00:41:19.020]   No, no, no, physical, literal place and physical, literal bodies,
[00:41:19.020 --> 00:41:21.020]   reigning and ruling alongside Christ forever.
[00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:26.020]   All of that purchased by his blood, given to his children,
[00:41:26.020 --> 00:41:31.020]   invited in to participate in the very life of the Trinity forevermore.
[00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:34.020]   And so what should be our response?
[00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:35.020]   Well, here's the first thing.
[00:41:35.020 --> 00:41:38.020]   If you've never said yes to Jesus,
[00:41:38.020 --> 00:41:44.020]   I would just say Christ has made a way for you.
[00:41:44.020 --> 00:41:45.020]   Like, it doesn't matter.
[00:41:45.020 --> 00:41:48.020]   I know this script, guys. I remember it.
[00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:51.020]   Like, you've just done some things.
[00:41:51.020 --> 00:41:53.020]   And so when you hear somebody talk like I talk,
[00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:56.020]   the way your brain starts to talk to you,
[00:41:56.020 --> 00:41:58.020]   I don't think it's just your brain talking to you,
[00:41:58.020 --> 00:42:01.020]   but you're talking yourself out of this being true for you
[00:42:01.020 --> 00:42:04.020]   because of this thing back here.
[00:42:04.020 --> 00:42:07.020]   Like, we witness this at the village all the time.
[00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:11.020]   We baptized a girl last year that had had an abortion in college,
[00:42:11.020 --> 00:42:14.020]   and every time we preached the gospel in her head,
[00:42:14.020 --> 00:42:15.020]   she was like, "This is so awesome,
[00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:19.020]   but it can't be for me because I killed that baby."
[00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:24.020]   And I'm just saying there is no sin with more power than the cross of Jesus Christ.
[00:42:24.020 --> 00:42:27.020]   Like, guys, are you reading your Bible?
[00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:28.020]   I say this a lot.
[00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:32.020]   No one in the Bible could get hired at the village.
[00:42:32.020 --> 00:42:35.020]   Their background check's going to show up some shady stuff,
[00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:37.020]   and we're not going to hire him.
[00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:39.020]   Like, we already mentioned Moses.
[00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:41.020]   Dude had a deep rage issue
[00:42:41.020 --> 00:42:45.020]   even after he had face-to-face encounters with Christ.
[00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:49.020]   Dude would just freak out, smash stuff with his staff.
[00:42:49.020 --> 00:42:53.020]   David? You think I'm hiring David?
[00:42:53.020 --> 00:42:54.020]   I mean, best worship leader ever.
[00:42:54.020 --> 00:42:57.020]   Bible said he'd play his harp and demons would flee.
[00:42:57.020 --> 00:43:00.020]   I'd love some of that at the village, but my wife's an attractive woman.
[00:43:00.020 --> 00:43:03.020]   That brother might have me killed.
[00:43:03.020 --> 00:43:06.020]   I can't bring him on.
[00:43:06.020 --> 00:43:07.020]   Who else? Who else you got?
[00:43:07.020 --> 00:43:08.020]   You ain't going to find them.
[00:43:08.020 --> 00:43:11.020]   You got Daniel and Jesus.
[00:43:11.020 --> 00:43:15.020]   Everybody else, scandalous.
[00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:16.020]   So look at me.
[00:43:16.020 --> 00:43:21.020]   You're the guy, you're the gal that's out sinning the grace of God?
[00:43:21.020 --> 00:43:23.020]   Not Saul of Tarsus.
[00:43:23.020 --> 00:43:25.020]   Seriously, get over yourself.
[00:43:25.020 --> 00:43:26.020]   I know what happens.
[00:43:26.020 --> 00:43:30.020]   So maybe today is the day that you say yes to Jesus.
[00:43:30.020 --> 00:43:31.020]   That's why I'm here.
[00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:33.020]   I'm not here to shame you.
[00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:35.020]   I'm here to tell you the best news in the universe,
[00:43:35.020 --> 00:43:38.020]   that the one that sits at the center of reality
[00:43:38.020 --> 00:43:40.020]   has made a way for you to be whole,
[00:43:40.020 --> 00:43:42.020]   has made a way to reconcile you to God,
[00:43:42.020 --> 00:43:45.020]   has made a way to free you from all your striving
[00:43:45.020 --> 00:43:49.020]   and into the rest of being a son or daughter of God.
[00:43:49.020 --> 00:43:52.020]   And then another way we respond, Christian,
[00:43:52.020 --> 00:43:55.020]   where are you all locked up with him right now?
[00:43:55.020 --> 00:43:58.020]   Where are you delaying obedience?
[00:43:58.020 --> 00:44:03.020]   Where is it clear to you that you know God is asking this of you
[00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:05.020]   and you are either saying no
[00:44:05.020 --> 00:44:07.020]   or you're doing that delayed obedience thing,
[00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:10.020]   which is just disobedient?
[00:44:10.020 --> 00:44:16.020]   So what is it like to fear the Lord rightly as the Bible commands us?
[00:44:16.020 --> 00:44:18.020]   If it's the beginning of all wisdom,
[00:44:18.020 --> 00:44:22.020]   then repentance is the ongoing ethic of his people.
[00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:24.020]   So where are you--I just want to be straight.
[00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:27.020]   Where are you treating Jesus like he's your homeboy?
[00:44:27.020 --> 00:44:29.020]   Where are the commands of Scripture
[00:44:29.020 --> 00:44:32.020]   crashing against what you actually want to do in your life?
[00:44:32.020 --> 00:44:36.020]   Where is God refusing to be used by you as a genie in a bottle
[00:44:36.020 --> 00:44:40.020]   and you're growing in resentment towards him?
[00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:43.020]   Where have you just decided that your sexual compulsions
[00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:48.020]   or whatever, your addiction, he's just got to be cool with that.
[00:44:48.020 --> 00:44:52.020]   Where are you trying to sin all the more so that grace may abound?
[00:44:52.020 --> 00:44:57.020]   Don't forget the next sentence in Romans 6, "May it never be."
[00:44:57.020 --> 00:44:59.020]   What does it look like for you to lay that down tonight,
[00:44:59.020 --> 00:45:03.020]   to confess it tonight, to step into obedience tonight?
[00:45:03.020 --> 00:45:06.020]   The holiness of God demands it.
[00:45:06.020 --> 00:45:11.020]   The sacrifice of Christ covers us in and through repentance,
[00:45:11.020 --> 00:45:16.020]   through faith, in the grace made available to us through the blood.
[00:45:16.020 --> 00:45:17.020]   So I want you to do--you know what, I'm not going to--
[00:45:17.020 --> 00:45:19.020]   don't bow your heads, don't close your eyes.
[00:45:19.020 --> 00:45:21.020]   I think if you won't do it in this room, you won't do it anywhere.
[00:45:21.020 --> 00:45:26.020]   If you're here tonight, you're like, "Man, I've got some repenting that I need to do.
[00:45:26.020 --> 00:45:31.020]   I have lived, behaved, and navigated this thing."
[00:45:31.020 --> 00:45:35.020]   Not like God is holy, but like I'm free to do whatever,
[00:45:35.020 --> 00:45:38.020]   and Christ is just cool with me despite these areas of my life
[00:45:38.020 --> 00:45:40.020]   that I refuse to surrender to him.
[00:45:40.020 --> 00:45:42.020]   Is that anybody in the room?
[00:45:42.020 --> 00:45:46.020]   Anybody stuck in some serious sins, some besetting sins?
[00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:48.020]   Anybody--yeah, it should be all over the room,
[00:45:48.020 --> 00:45:51.020]   or I need to preach my next sermon online.
[00:45:51.020 --> 00:45:54.020]   Yeah, this is--okay, so, hey, great news. Thank you.
[00:45:54.020 --> 00:45:56.020]   That's courageous.
[00:45:56.020 --> 00:46:00.020]   The invitation for you is to come lay it down, and maybe lay it down again,
[00:46:00.020 --> 00:46:04.020]   and then keep laying it down until it's dead.
[00:46:04.020 --> 00:46:08.020]   And so I'm going to pray for us, and then we're just going to respond to the Lord.
[00:46:08.020 --> 00:46:10.020]   I don't know what you need to do, but you know.
[00:46:10.020 --> 00:46:13.020]   There'll be prayer team people up here if you need to pray.
[00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:15.020]   Here's what I would tell you.
[00:46:15.020 --> 00:46:20.020]   If God's convicting your heart, tell someone.
[00:46:20.020 --> 00:46:23.020]   Move some way.
[00:46:23.020 --> 00:46:27.020]   You're not going to make it out of the parking lot with just your inner conviction,
[00:46:27.020 --> 00:46:32.020]   which is why the command's always repent and confess, or confess and repent.
[00:46:32.020 --> 00:46:35.020]   It's not just internally, "Okay, I won't do it ever again."
[00:46:35.020 --> 00:46:38.020]   Yeah, okay, well, I'll give you three weeks depending on your discipline level.
[00:46:38.020 --> 00:46:42.020]   If you let it out, darkness loses its power.
[00:46:42.020 --> 00:46:46.020]   So what if we kind of do some damage against darkness tonight?
[00:46:46.020 --> 00:46:51.020]   You're allowed to boldly approach the throne of grace with confidence.
[00:46:51.020 --> 00:46:53.020]   I'm going to pray for us.
[00:46:53.020 --> 00:46:54.020]   Prayer team members will be up.
[00:46:54.020 --> 00:46:55.020]   We're just going to respond.
[00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:58.020]   We're going to sing a little bit, I think, and there'll be people here if you need somebody to pray
[00:46:58.020 --> 00:47:00.020]   or somebody to confess to.
[00:47:00.020 --> 00:47:04.020]   I'm just encouraging you, don't harden your heart against the holiness of God
[00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:06.020]   and the work he's doing in your spirit right now.
[00:47:06.020 --> 00:47:10.020]   This will cost more 10 years from now.
[00:47:10.020 --> 00:47:13.020]   It will cost more 10 years from now.
[00:47:13.020 --> 00:47:16.020]   Father, I bless these young men and women in the name of Jesus.
[00:47:16.020 --> 00:47:18.020]   I thank you for how you love us.
[00:47:18.020 --> 00:47:24.020]   I thank you that you solved the problem in our lives that we cannot solve.
[00:47:24.020 --> 00:47:27.020]   Thank you that you call us holy.
[00:47:27.020 --> 00:47:28.020]   It's crazy.
[00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:30.020]   It's hard for me to get my mind around.
[00:47:30.020 --> 00:47:34.020]   That despite me, despite my past, despite my present compulsions
[00:47:34.020 --> 00:47:39.020]   and all the screw-ups that are coming for me tomorrow and moving forward,
[00:47:39.020 --> 00:47:46.020]   that you have made a way, that you will not grow weary in moving towards me in love.
[00:47:46.020 --> 00:47:50.020]   So I pray even as you do that tonight that we would not create space from you,
[00:47:50.020 --> 00:47:57.020]   but that we would move towards you and receive from you this grace.
[00:47:57.020 --> 00:48:01.020]   That we would receive from you this love that you are love.
[00:48:01.020 --> 00:48:03.020]   You want to give us that.
[00:48:03.020 --> 00:48:10.020]   And so would you overpower our stubbornness tonight for the fame of Jesus.
[00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:13.020]   We need you. We love you. Thank you.
[00:48:13.020 --> 00:48:15.020]   It's for your beautiful name I pray. Amen.
[00:48:15.020 --> 00:48:17.020]   Why don't you stand up and respond.
[00:48:17.020 --> 00:48:20.020]   I wouldn't argue with yourself too long. Just come on up and get prayed for.
[00:48:20.020 --> 00:48:22.360]   (whooshing)
