1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:21,560
 - Well, good evening friends here in Dallas

3
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:24,000
 and Fort Worth, Houston and around the country

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,820
 as you listen in.

5
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,060
 It's so great to be with you tonight.

6
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:28,100
 If we've never met before, my name is Garrett.

7
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,360
 I typically spend my Tuesday nights

8
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,460
 about 40 miles west over in Fort Worth.

9
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:32,800
 I don't know if you knew this.

10
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,800
 Somebody knew that.

11
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,540
 And so I don't know if the rest of you,

12
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:36,400
 the majority knew this,

13
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,480
 but there's an invisible section of seats

14
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,360
 that's here every single Tuesday.

15
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,160
 And it's just a little bit west of here in Fort Worth

16
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,920
 that meets over in the Ridgely Theater.

17
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,480
 I actually wanna start tonight by telling you a story

18
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,320
 about something that happened there about three weeks ago.

19
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,880
 Three weeks ago, three or four weeks ago now,

20
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,600
 I lose count, January 26th, a few weeks ago.

21
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,080
 Oh my gosh, we're up to five or six weeks now.

22
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:58,120
 January 26th was the first porch of the year.

23
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,960
 And so we take off around Christmas break.

24
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,520
 And so there's like a six, seven week break.

25
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,840
 Some of you kind of get a little antsy

26
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,760
 because it's time for porch to start back up again.

27
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,600
 And so that starts to happen a little bit.

28
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,360
 And then finally on January 26th,

29
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,480
 we load up and we're ready for the first porch of 2016.

30
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,480
 Something you wanna know about the experience in Fort Worth.

31
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,920
 We typically stream the message.

32
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,060
 By stream, I mean it comes through on the internet

33
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:18,920
 on a flat screen.

34
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,720
 So whoever's in three dimensions with you here in Dallas

35
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,080
 is in two dimensions over in Fort Worth on the screen.

36
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,520
 All right, and so that's what's normal.

37
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,920
 That is obviously dependent on technology.

38
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,480
 So January 26th, we all load up in the Ridgely Theater.

39
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,960
 No exaggeration, I just want you to feel

40
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,180
 for what that moment was like.

41
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,100
 Seven weeks of pent up energy, lots of excitement.

42
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,900
 We're all ready to go.

43
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,640
 Just so that you know, there's more people in the theater

44
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,360
 than we've ever had on a Tuesday night before.

45
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,360
 It's very exciting.

46
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,560
 And so the stream comes on.

47
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,720
 We move through the worship set.

48
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,560
 So there's a band there that leads us live

49
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,920
 and worship there in Fort Worth.

50
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,480
 And we move through the worship set.

51
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,680
 And then on comes the stream, the sermon time.

52
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,700
 And it has no audio.

53
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,680
 So there's no sound coming.

54
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,160
 It's like JP's mouth is moving

55
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,480
 and you can tell it's animated.

56
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,980
 I mean, there's this going on.

57
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:04,920
 And so that's happening.

58
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,200
 And so we're watching 1920s movie kind of thing.

59
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,200
 And then, but good news, we have a backup.

60
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,920
 And so I left my seat and I kind of went back

61
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,840
 to the AV booth to see how my friends were doing.

62
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,280
 And so we switched to the backup feed.

63
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,480
 And wouldn't you know, it's also dependent on technology.

64
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,100
 And so that one starts to click, click,

65
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,520
 it goes off, black screen.

66
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,800
 And you hear an audible, oh.

67
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,640
 (congregation laughing)

68
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,320
 And my friend who serves on the AV team,

69
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,860
 who has an answer for everything on this one,

70
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:34,980
 his answer was to look up.

71
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,340
 He looked at me, we made eye contact.

72
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:37,220
 It felt like an hour.

73
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,820
 I know it was a two second interaction.

74
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:42,100
 And he said, you're on.

75
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:42,940
 And he pointed to the stage.

76
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,380
 I'm like, oh boy.

77
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,700
 Okay, so I got between here and the stage

78
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,460
 to come up with something.

79
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,620
 And I just wanna tell you,

80
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,560
 we were together for a normal 35 minute sermon.

81
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,360
 And the best part about that sermon is that it's over.

82
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,620
 (congregation laughing)

83
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,220
 You're not gonna find that sermon anywhere.

84
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,180
 It's not on the podcast.

85
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,980
 It's like not in the resource center.

86
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:02,820
 It's not on the app.

87
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,300
 You can look for it, like it won't be there.

88
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,140
 It's done.

89
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,740
 And so we did survive.

90
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:07,780
 We did make it.

91
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:10,860
 And my countenance personally,

92
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,780
 as this was going on was just a sense of dependence.

93
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,060
 Like, okay, God, I mean,

94
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,860
 who could be in control of this except you?

95
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,020
 We've got great technology.

96
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,140
 We've got the best and brightest personnel

97
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,740
 that you can possibly imagine

98
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,060
 that put this thing together.

99
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,120
 And we were ready to go.

100
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,060
 And so if something went wrong, it's gotta be you.

101
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,980
 And so that was kind of my posture.

102
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,900
 And then all of a sudden I came off,

103
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,620
 off of that moment, 10 o'clock hits,

104
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,180
 we locked the doors, I go home.

105
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,940
 And my posture starts to change dramatically.

106
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:37,960
 Now, I just would want you to know this about me,

107
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,960
 honest confession.

108
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,120
 I've sometimes been accused of being a little bit intense

109
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,980
 and kind of like, mm.

110
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,100
 And so you heard of type A?

111
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,300
 Like type A hole, okay,

112
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,700
 is like what I've been accused of every once in a while.

113
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:49,540
 And so.

114
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:52,960
 (congregation laughing)

115
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,940
 I'm just gonna be,

116
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,060
 I'm gonna start on the real foot with you guys.

117
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:58,940
 I'm just gonna be honest.

118
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:01,140
 And so that, I have that downside.

119
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,500
 And so all of a sudden after the message,

120
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,940
 whereas I didn't feel like I needed answers beforehand,

121
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:06,780
 all we just needed to do,

122
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,100
 what was God wanted us to do,

123
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:08,940
 all of a sudden afterward,

124
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,420
 I felt like I really needed some answers.

125
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,880
 I felt like, okay, was it man?

126
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,720
 Was it machine?

127
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,540
 Was it a mistake that someone made?

128
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,460
 Or was it a box that's broken?

129
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,380
 I mean, what's the deal?

130
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:19,340
 And so my need for answers continued to rise.

131
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:21,900
 And instead of all of a sudden feeling like the stream

132
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,220
 and the experience that we get every single Tuesday night,

133
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,140
 instead of remembering that that's a privilege,

134
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:29,060
 all of a sudden that itself and all the answers

135
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,180
 that pertain to that particular situation

136
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,540
 started to feel like rights.

137
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:37,360
 Rights to me that I was losing and having to part with.

138
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,220
 And so a couple of days later, this does not lift.

139
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,180
 This darkness does not lift.

140
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,140
 It's not from God, by the way.

141
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,060
 I'm not condoning this.

142
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,260
 I'm being honest with you.

143
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:46,220
 And so the next Wednesday was not a good day.

144
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,940
 On Thursday morning, I'm driving over to work.

145
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:51,900
 Again, and it still has not, I have still,

146
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,420
 what I've got from a team, which just to be clear,

147
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:56,660
 the team is best, brightest in the land,

148
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:57,980
 in the business, period.

149
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,320
 Like they're working on it.

150
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,580
 That's what I'm getting is they're working on it,

151
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,000
 which should bring comfort.

152
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,900
 But instead, I was so lost in my own entitlement

153
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:08,220
 to what I thought were rights, namely information,

154
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,100
 that I was so frustrated.

155
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,900
 I got into a traffic jam on Thursday morning

156
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,780
 and I thought I was gonna be late.

157
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,220
 And the lateness doesn't normally bother me so much,

158
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,720
 but I felt my fist,

159
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,420
 I felt my hand form into a fist

160
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:23,540
 and I brought it down twice on my console

161
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:24,440
 and it was broken,

162
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:28,380
 which is why no one needs to interrupt this sermon tonight.

163
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:31,720
 (congregation laughing)

164
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:35,080
 I'm not kidding.

165
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,140
 I broke my car.

166
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:38,740
 I literally, like my console was broken.

167
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,140
 Like the latch broke.

168
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:43,060
 I mean, one, two, the latch is broken.

169
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,860
 It's like up and it's just laughing at me.

170
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,340
 And so what happens is it's like,

171
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:48,060
 it's open and it won't close.

172
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,080
 It's like the middle console, it's like hanging open.

173
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,980
 And I'm like, I'm looking for something to hold it down.

174
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,100
 All I got is my Bible.

175
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:53,940
 Great.

176
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:54,760
 And so I like,

177
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:58,820
 I've got my Bible holding down my broken car console

178
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,660
 that I broke in a fit of anger.

179
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,740
 And so here's the deal.

180
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,080
 We're not talking about anger tonight

181
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,300
 because I'm convinced that anger

182
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:07,220
 is actually just this outworking, the symptom,

183
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:09,740
 the outward fruit of what my real problem was.

184
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:12,500
 And so I wanna tell you what that specific problem was.

185
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,940
 And then we'll go into tonight.

186
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:17,180
 That problem I'm convinced was entitlement.

187
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,160
 Entitlement.

188
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,780
 And I'm gonna give you a definition of entitlement

189
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:22,620
 before we go any further

190
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,260
 so that you know exactly what we're talking about.

191
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:27,340
 Entitlement is the belief that your privileges,

192
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,300
 namely an experience on Tuesday night,

193
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,380
 an answer about what happened on Tuesday night,

194
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,460
 anything like that,

195
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:35,420
 your privileges, namely things you don't deserve

196
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,160
 are actually your rights.

197
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:41,640
 It's believing that the things that are your gifts,

198
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:45,100
 your blessings, the kindnesses to you

199
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:48,660
 are actually things that you've merited,

200
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:49,900
 actually your rights,

201
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,440
 and you will not part with them easily.

202
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,840
 That's what entitlement is.

203
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,180
 And so I appreciate you getting to chuckle at mine,

204
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,340
 but let's let you have a go.

205
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,980
 And so from our team to you,

206
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,660
 let's take a little entitlement quiz tonight

207
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:02,500
 and we'll see how we're doing.

208
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,780
 All right, so here we go.

209
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:04,620
 Entitlement quiz number one.

210
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,140
 You are almost to the porch on time,

211
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,740
 but the parking line is slow.

212
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,100
 No.

213
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,540
 How done are you?

214
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,400
 (audience laughing)

215
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,880
 A, done.

216
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,880
 (audience laughing)

217
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,580
 B, so done.

218
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:20,620
 (audience laughing)

219
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:23,120
 C, will you forgive me for flipping you off at church?

220
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,460
 (audience laughing)

221
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:29,260
 That's the laughter of the guilty right there.

222
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:32,120
 Number two, you're working hard for a promotion

223
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,200
 only for a coworker to get it instead.

224
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,960
 Ouch.

225
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,960
 Your reaction is, I'm overqualified.

226
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,120
 I'm too good for this job.

227
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:40,960
 (audience laughing)

228
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,980
 B, who did they suck up to?

229
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:45,260
 C, I quit, I'm leaving, I'm quit.

230
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,220
 I need a new job, I'm out of here.

231
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,860
 All right, number three.

232
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:49,940
 Oh boy, close to home.

233
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:52,580
 You've been single after college long enough

234
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:55,280
 to be counting in years instead of months.

235
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,280
 (audience laughing)

236
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:06,460
 I wish you the best.

237
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:07,300
 All right.

238
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:10,600
 (audience laughing)

239
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,840
 When asked why, you say, I'm too intimidating.

240
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,140
 These people are scared of me.

241
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,140
 (audience laughing)

242
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,640
 That sounds like something mama would say, right?

243
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,760
 They're scared of you.

244
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,320
 (audience laughing)

245
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,640
 B, life sucks.

246
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,060
 C, I need a new church.

247
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,800
 (audience laughing)

248
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,320
 I am out of here.

249
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,160
 I am out of here.

250
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,640
 Six more months of not getting asked out

251
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,680
 and I am leaving and I'm gonna make sure they know.

252
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,560
 It's gonna be on social media.

253
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,260
 I'm gonna tell 'em.

254
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,860
 We know some of you think that.

255
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,680
 Oh, it's so easy.

256
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,800
 It's so easy in our day and age, in our culture,

257
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,000
 to sink into this idea of entitlement.

258
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,880
 It's just, there's just breeding grounds for it everywhere.

259
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,980
 The gas pump, it's like you pull up to the gas pump,

260
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:50,620
 the buttons don't work, the pump clicks,

261
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,220
 the receipt doesn't come out.

262
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,800
 It's like, the horror.

263
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,060
 I think I might have to go inside.

264
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:57,300
 (audience laughing)

265
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,600
 I think I'm gonna have to deal with a person.

266
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,700
 (audience laughing)

267
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,020
 Oh no.

268
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,160
 It's like, this is the reason.

269
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,520
 Entitlement is the reason.

270
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,480
 This confusion between privileges and rights,

271
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,840
 this is the reason why the hashtag firstworldprobs exists

272
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,280
 and it's hilarious.

273
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,220
 This is the reason right here,

274
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:14,400
 because the people who have the most

275
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,360
 seem to have the most problems, which is amazing.

276
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,560
 It's like the pizza, oh, some of you had this.

277
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,140
 The pizza delivery guy comes.

278
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:22,280
 There's no ranch.

279
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,480
 You're like, I can't even eat this.

280
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,280
 (audience laughing)

281
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,240
 I can't even deal with this anymore.

282
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,720
 And we hate it, oh, we hate it.

283
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,800
 We hate it when we see it in other people.

284
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,760
 We can't stand it.

285
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,720
 It's like the person's in line at the grocery store

286
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,640
 in the express line, 15 items or less,

287
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,320
 and they got that whole cart, and you were like,

288
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,920
 mm, that right there,

289
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,500
 that's the problem with humanity right there.

290
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,360
 (audience laughing)

291
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,640
 And then you get in the express lane in the tollway

292
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,360
 and you're just going by everybody in traffic like, ha ha.

293
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,200
 Just taking care of entitlement.

294
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,520
 And some of you, I know what you're thinking.

295
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,060
 I paid, it's the tollway.

296
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:02,080
 Which tells me you think that you bought your entitlement,

297
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,520
 you're really not gonna let it go.

298
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,560
 (audience laughing)

299
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,240
 This confusion between privileges and rights

300
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,280
 is a dangerous thing.

301
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:11,440
 So here's the good news.

302
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,860
 Jesus knows about this.

303
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:15,920
 He knows that we are apt to get our privileges

304
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,880
 and our rights confused.

305
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:21,680
 He knows that we are very likely to get confused

306
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,640
 between what we deserve and what we don't.

307
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,600
 And he knows that we're gonna disappoint ourselves

308
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,960
 greatly and unnecessarily and cause pain

309
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,920
 to our relationships and ourselves

310
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,280
 when we get confused about that.

311
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:36,920
 And so he told a story once, Matthew chapter 20.

312
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,800
 Matthew chapter 20 is where we'll be tonight.

313
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,120
 He told a story once that discusses this particular idea.

314
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,660
 He speaks very clearly to this particular issue.

315
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,760
 It's fascinating, it's called a parable.

316
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,160
 So if you don't know what a parable is,

317
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,520
 it's just a fictional story, one made up story

318
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:55,560
 that's designed to illustrate, designed to show one idea.

319
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,760
 So Jesus is going to tell a little made up fictional story

320
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,600
 about a vineyard, about workers who go into a vineyard

321
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,800
 and it discusses very clearly entitlement

322
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,280
 that I'm gonna explain as we go.

323
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,120
 Matthew 20th chapter, that's the first book

324
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,120
 of your New Testament, first verse of the 20th chapter.

325
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:10,960
 Here we go.

326
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:15,600
 First one, for the kingdom of heaven

327
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,300
 is like a master of a house.

328
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,920
 The master of the house, so that everyone knows,

329
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,200
 is God and the story represents God in the story,

330
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,960
 who went out early in the morning

331
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,680
 to hire laborers for his vineyard.

332
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,820
 Now early in the morning is a specific phrase

333
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:29,800
 that means something.

334
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,100
 They were on a specific clock.

335
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,120
 Like they never had the conversation

336
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,680
 about, whoa, what are your hours?

337
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,880
 Are you like normal eight to five?

338
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,720
 Do you work weekends?

339
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,560
 Do you work nights?

340
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,520
 They would have never had that.

341
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,960
 It's like daylights when you work.

342
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,600
 So everybody worked from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m.

343
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,640
 It was a 12 hour shift, roughly 6 a.m. to 6 p.m.

344
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,600
 And they would count the hours from six

345
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,600
 and they would go through the day.

346
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,480
 So a 12 hour shift, that was understood.

347
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,040
 And so at 6 a.m. the master of the house

348
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,040
 goes to hire laborers for his vineyard.

349
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,800
 He's looking in the marketplace for people who can work.

350
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,680
 Says, after agreeing with the laborers, he found some,

351
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:04,000
 that were available for hire for a denarius a day,

352
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,160
 he sent them into his vineyard.

353
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,740
 Now you wanna know what a denarius is?

354
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:10,600
 That's just a normal day wage for a day laborer.

355
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,920
 So that's like standard wage for day labor.

356
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,160
 So just so that we've got a number,

357
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,920
 a US dollars number that we can throw in there

358
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,400
 so that we've got at least a mental picture

359
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,960
 of how much money this is.

360
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,000
 Call it a little more than a minimum wage,

361
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,040
 $9 an hour, 12 hours, do a little rounding,

362
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,480
 call it a hundred bucks.

363
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,320
 All right?

364
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,160
 So the deal is you work for me 12 hours,

365
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,800
 I'll give you a Benjamin, that's the deal.

366
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,560
 And so they cut this deal to work all day.

367
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,480
 And they go, it says in verse three,

368
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,720
 and going out about the third hour.

369
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,760
 So remember they start at 6 a.m. and count.

370
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,600
 So the third hour is 9 a.m.

371
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,040
 The master goes back out and he saw others

372
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,600
 standing idle in the marketplace.

373
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,320
 More people who had zero purpose,

374
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,360
 they had zero employment, they had nothing to do.

375
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,360
 And he sees them standing idle in the marketplace

376
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,420
 and he says to them, you guys go into the vineyard too.

377
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,760
 And whatever is right, I will give you.

378
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,640
 Interesting, nonspecific agreement.

379
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,080
 Did you notice that?

380
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,280
 Did not tell them what they were going to get.

381
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,720
 The first guys, really clear.

382
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,080
 Hey, 6 a.m. people, go work 12 hours,

383
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,720
 I will give you a Denarius.

384
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,440
 Next group, 9 a.m., hey, you guys go into the vineyard,

385
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,760
 whatever's right at the end of the day.

386
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,440
 I'll do the math and I'll give it to you.

387
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,280
 Nonspecific.

388
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,160
 So they went.

389
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,440
 Going out again about the sixth hour, that's noon.

390
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,000
 And the ninth hour, that's 3 p.m., he did the same.

391
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,280
 And then the 11th hour, think about this.

392
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:32,040
 The 11th hour, it's 5 p.m., the workday's almost done,

393
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,200
 it's almost over.

394
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,680
 About the 11th hour, he goes out

395
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,640
 and he finds others still standing.

396
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,640
 And he hires them, he says,

397
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:41,060
 hey, why do you stand here idle all day long?

398
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,400
 They said, no one's hired us.

399
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,900
 No one gave us anything to do.

400
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:47,240
 And he said to them, the master said to them,

401
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,400
 you go into the vineyard too.

402
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,600
 And so now we got a pack of guys

403
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,100
 working together in a vineyard.

404
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,840
 They've been stomping on grapes all day.

405
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,920
 It's hot out there.

406
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,340
 And they have joined,

407
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,800
 they have been joined into this group in stages.

408
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,120
 And so imagine you're the 6 a.m. crew.

409
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,160
 Imagine you're the guys who have endured the heat of the day,

410
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,920
 you're the guys who have worked the hardest

411
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,200
 and earned your keep,

412
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,520
 and you guys had the guarantee of what was coming to you.

413
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,360
 And all of a sudden, you're out there working at six,

414
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,600
 and then some more guys come,

415
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,680
 and then some more guys come,

416
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,800
 and then some more guys come.

417
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,520
 At some point, this is going to cross your mind.

418
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,600
 You're gonna think, who are these guys?

419
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,000
 Did the master hire them?

420
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,540
 And whose pay exactly are they gonna cut into?

421
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:27,280
 Because you wanna make sure

422
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,160
 that your part of the deal is preserved.

423
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,760
 You wanna make sure that the agreement that you had

424
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,920
 is absolutely honored, but you make room for them.

425
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,720
 And on and on and on the day goes

426
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,960
 until finally 60 minutes before time to quit,

427
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,300
 even more people come.

428
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:45,880
 So with question marks everywhere, finally at six o'clock,

429
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:49,100
 time to quit and go see the boss.

430
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,000
 So here they come.

431
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,880
 And when evening came, the owner of the vineyard

432
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:56,080
 said to his foreman, call the laborers

433
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,480
 and pay them their wages.

434
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,680
 Here's where it gets interesting.

435
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:02,780
 Beginning with the last, the people who worked the least,

436
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:05,440
 the 5 p.m. crew that worked for an hour,

437
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,520
 up to the first who worked all day, those first hired.

438
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:11,800
 And when those hired about the 11th hour came,

439
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:15,560
 each of them received a denarius.

440
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,320
 Okay, picture this moment.

441
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,720
 We got all these guys lined up in reverse order

442
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,960
 that they were hired in.

443
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,600
 The first guys come up, it's time to get paid.

444
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,880
 Everybody likes to get paid, it's payday.

445
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,720
 And so he's standing right here

446
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,040
 and he gets paid a denarius, okay?

447
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,260
 And nobody knows where they're getting paid

448
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,440
 except the guys in the very back.

449
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,940
 They're the only ones who know what they're getting paid.

450
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:38,360
 So it's presumable that the first group to be paid

451
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,600
 is gonna get a 12th of that

452
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,280
 'cause they worked a 12th as long.

453
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,760
 Instead, they receive a denarius.

454
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,760
 Well, here's what happens.

455
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,400
 The guy who's second in line is bound to be looking over.

456
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,640
 I mean, there's no way that he wouldn't be.

457
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,960
 And so the next group is kinda looking

458
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:53,000
 and they see that this starts to happen and people talk.

459
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,800
 I've heard a saying, three people can keep a secret

460
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,320
 as long as two of them are dead.

461
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,600
 I believe that that's true.

462
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,680
 And so here's the deal.

463
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,400
 Like people are going to talk,

464
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,640
 people are going to share, people are gonna talk.

465
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,720
 And so all of a sudden they found out,

466
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:10,120
 hey, these guys got a denarius for their hour.

467
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:13,240
 And that news trickles back into the line.

468
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,680
 And that creates a dangerous little thing

469
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:19,680
 called entitlement, hope, expectation.

470
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,360
 All those things.

471
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,800
 And so that starts to rise the farther the line goes.

472
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:30,000
 Verse 10, now when those hired first came,

473
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,120
 when they were hired, those who had hired earlier,

474
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,480
 worked the longest, worked the hardest,

475
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,880
 they thought they would receive more.

476
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,360
 There's your entitlement.

477
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,440
 They thought they would receive more.

478
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,840
 Not they hoped, not, oh, that would be a privilege

479
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,760
 that I would like.

480
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,120
 They thought, they thought they would receive more.

481
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,960
 They were convinced that they would actually receive more.

482
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,840
 Can't you hear them?

483
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,200
 12, one denarius for an hour.

484
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,680
 Does that mean we're gonna get 12?

485
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,560
 Does that mean we're gonna get to pay $1,200 for this day?

486
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,760
 But each of them also received a denarius.

487
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,400
 And on receiving it, they grumbled

488
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,760
 at the master of the house,

489
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,880
 who just kept his end of the deal, to be clear,

490
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,720
 saying these last worked only for an hour.

491
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,200
 They worked for one hour.

492
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,760
 Can you feel the outrage in that?

493
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,880
 They worked for one hour.

494
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,760
 They gave, you gave them what you agreed to for us.

495
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:27,280
 And you have made them equal to us,

496
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,680
 who have borne the burden of the day

497
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,320
 and the scorching heat.

498
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,440
 In other words, there's a little problem here

499
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,800
 between what was given and what's being received.

500
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,760
 You are not giving me, master, what I deserve.

501
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:42,160
 You are not giving me the things that I bargained for.

502
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,400
 And so they forgot a really key piece of information.

503
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,520
 It's in verse 10.

504
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,720
 They thought they would receive more.

505
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,200
 They forgot what they deserved.

506
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,720
 They completely forgot what they actually deserved.

507
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,640
 That is a dangerous thing to do, by the way.

508
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,920
 And so our first point tonight is remember what you deserve.

509
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,280
 Remember what you deserve.

510
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,600
 Now you gotta be careful there,

511
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,600
 because that sounds a little bit like entitlement, right?

512
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,360
 I'm gonna assert what I deserve.

513
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,560
 What I mean by that is,

514
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,160
 what I mean by remember what you deserve is,

515
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:15,040
 I mean, remember what you actually deserve.

516
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:18,520
 What you biblically deserve.

517
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:21,880
 What you really should get.

518
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,040
 What you're entitled to.

519
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,400
 What your rights really are.

520
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,240
 So let's take a look at this.

521
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,400
 Romans 3, 23, very famous verse.

522
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,560
 Many of you have seen it before.

523
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,840
 All have sinned.

524
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,760
 By all, I'm gonna pause on the story just for a second,

525
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,520
 and I'm gonna see what we actually deserve,

526
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,480
 and then we're gonna go back.

527
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:38,440
 So it says in Romans 3, 23, all have sinned.

528
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,160
 By all, of course, it means every human being

529
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,240
 who's ever lived, and by sin,

530
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,640
 it means lived in a way that's contrary to God.

531
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,880
 Lived in a way that's offensive to God.

532
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,800
 Lived in a way that puts a spiritual,

533
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,680
 obscene gesture in God's general direction.

534
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:58,680
 Every human being who has ever lived has lived that way.

535
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:02,280
 Every single person is a sinner.

536
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,280
 That's where we are.

537
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,160
 The news does not get better.

538
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,040
 Romans 6, 23.

539
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,400
 The wages, interesting word there.

540
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,280
 That's like an entitled to word.

541
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,600
 That's like a deserve word.

542
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,640
 It's like a what we should get word.

543
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:19,360
 The wages of sin is death.

544
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,640
 The wages of sin is death.

545
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,600
 So in nine or 10 words right there,

546
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,160
 the scripture has made it really, really clear.

547
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,640
 Those are taken out of their verses,

548
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,880
 that's why there's dot, dot, dot,

549
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,160
 but they're not taken out of context.

550
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,360
 This is what they mean.

551
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,160
 They mean that every human being who's ever lived

552
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:36,240
 and ever had a life actually has sinned against God,

553
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,640
 and that there's a wage for that,

554
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,440
 there is an entitlement that comes with that,

555
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,960
 there is a payment that comes with that,

556
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,040
 there is a what you deserve that comes with that,

557
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,880
 and it's death, and by death,

558
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,000
 it means separation from God,

559
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,280
 separation from the life giver,

560
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,800
 separation from everything that reminds you of life.

561
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,160
 The Bible has a word for it, hell.

562
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:59,600
 That's what we deserve.

563
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:04,840
 If you have a pulse and you can hear my voice right now,

564
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,360
 that's what you deserve.

565
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,480
 That's the biblical truth.

566
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,800
 Which is why you wanna be very careful

567
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:16,160
 about asserting what you deserve in this life.

568
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,520
 That's why you wanna be very hesitant

569
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,960
 to speak really broadly and really boldly

570
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,640
 about what you think you should get.

571
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,160
 You might wanna remember what these workers forgot

572
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,360
 in the parable, they forgot what they actually deserve,

573
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,880
 it led to lots of heartache for them.

574
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,640
 You would do well to remember,

575
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,760
 well to remember those little verses

576
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:37,920
 of what you actually deserve from God.

577
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:41,000
 You wanna thank God tonight that he is not fair.

578
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,840
 God is so much better than fair.

579
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,680
 If you want God to be fair,

580
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,400
 I mean, check out Hinduism, I wouldn't encourage it,

581
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,480
 you can check out karma,

582
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:51,280
 you can check out any other ideological system out there,

583
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,600
 you're probably gonna find some false idea of balance.

584
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,520
 God is so much better than fair.

585
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,920
 He is better than fair.

586
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,400
 If you are alive right now,

587
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,160
 you are getting better than you deserve

588
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,760
 from God today, right now.

589
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,480
 Think about this with me.

590
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,960
 Five million people or so woke up today

591
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,720
 in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex.

592
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:15,720
 Not one person deserved it, nobody.

593
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:19,120
 We woke up today and you know what we got?

594
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,840
 All of us, sinners, saints, thieves, criminals,

595
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,480
 rapists, murderers, people doing everything they can

596
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,840
 to glorify God and people who are doing everything they can

597
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,280
 to run as fast as they can from God.

598
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,920
 Everybody got the same exact thing, precipitation.

599
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,000
 And half of us were mad about it

600
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,800
 'cause we're so entitled to our food.

601
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,240
 (congregation laughing)

602
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,480
 It says in Matthew 5:45,

603
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:43,040
 "God sends rain on the just and the unjust.

604
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:46,480
 "He makes his sun rise on the evil and the good."

605
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,920
 God gives grace that's common to everyone,

606
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,280
 namely the fact that you can breathe right now.

607
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,240
 So if we're gonna talk about what we actually deserve,

608
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,280
 we gotta lower the bar way down

609
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:59,880
 because we don't deserve anything good from God.

610
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,480
 We deserve less than nothing from God.

611
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,000
 These guys made the mistake.

612
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,400
 They forgot what they deserve.

613
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,840
 If you are struggling to remember what your due is,

614
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,920
 it's simply, this is gonna be redundant,

615
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,520
 it is simply because you forgot what you deserve.

616
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:18,840
 You completely forgot what it is that you deserve from God.

617
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,720
 Entitlement cannot get a foothold

618
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,360
 if you don't allow that to happen.

619
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:25,600
 It always starts here.

620
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,760
 Forget what you signed on for,

621
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,360
 you just forget what you deserve.

622
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,400
 They forgot that in this story,

623
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,160
 and now they've gotta deal with the master.

624
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,920
 Verse 13, Matthew 20.

625
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:39,160
 "But he replied to one of them, 'Friend.'"

626
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,400
 Isn't that gentle for someone who forgets what they deserve

627
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,080
 and then come falsely given a charge

628
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,280
 and falsely given an accusation?

629
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,960
 You did us wrong when you did no,

630
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,280
 when he did no wrong,

631
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,960
 when the master actually did no wrong.

632
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,000
 But look how gently he replies,

633
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,880
 "Friend, I'm doing you no wrong.

634
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:57,680
 "Did you not agree with me for a denarius?

635
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:01,040
 "Did you not agree with me for a denarius?"

636
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,320
 Side note, I think I would have added,

637
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,480
 and you didn't even have a job.

638
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,840
 Let's just talk about how you did not have a job.

639
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,480
 You were like gainfully unemployed

640
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,240
 before we got into this arrangement.

641
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,000
 "Did you not agree with me for a denarius?

642
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,840
 "Take what belongs to you and go."

643
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:15,960
 And look at these words.

644
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,160
 You can't blame him for being unclear.

645
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,000
 This is clear.

646
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,960
 "I choose.

647
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,880
 "I choose.

648
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:27,600
 "I choose to give to this last worker as I give to you."

649
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,440
 Listen, friend.

650
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:34,200
 Am I not allowed to do what I choose

651
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,760
 with what belongs to me?

652
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:40,680
 Would you wanna hear that from God?

653
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,520
 Come here, friend.

654
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,360
 Let's have a little talk.

655
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:45,080
 [congregation laughing]

656
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,160
 Do I not get to pick?

657
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,200
 Don't I pick?

658
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,760
 Don't I choose?

659
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:54,960
 My second point tonight is God distributes everything.

660
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,880
 God distributes everything.

661
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:03,800
 Everything that's valuable in the universe,

662
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,440
 God distributes.

663
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:10,440
 He owns it, it's his, and he distributes it as he sees.

664
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,920
 So everything, that means talent,

665
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:17,360
 that means success, that means relationships,

666
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:22,360
 it means money, it means kids and families and cars,

667
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:26,080
 it means houses, it means addresses

668
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,360
 where those houses are placed,

669
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:32,800
 it means titles, promotions, approval, and a lot more.

670
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:36,320
 God owns it all.

671
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:40,360
 He owns everything, and he distributes it as he sees fit.

672
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,240
 Psalm 24, one says, "The earth is the Lord

673
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,600
 "and all that fills it."

674
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,520
 The earth, the whole thing, is the Lord's

675
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:49,160
 and everything that fills it.

676
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:52,680
 "The world and those who dwell therein."

677
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:55,440
 Even the people, God owns the people.

678
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,400
 He owns everything, and he distributes everything.

679
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,000
 I love this, because this will always be

680
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,580
 the response of Jesus to entitlement.

681
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:08,040
 This will always be the response of Jesus to entitlement.

682
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,000
 You're not gonna catch him being rough with you.

683
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,940
 Hey, friend, he's gentle.

684
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:13,360
 But he's also not gonna lie to you and say,

685
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,240
 you know what, yes, yes, I have done you wrong.

686
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,200
 I guess it's never gonna happen.

687
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,320
 Here's the shortest conversation between you and Jesus ever.

688
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,800
 It's the one where he lists the things

689
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,920
 that he did you wrong.

690
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:25,000
 [congregation laughing]

691
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,960
 That is a short talk, shortest sermon in porch history.

692
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,120
 All the ways God did you wrong.

693
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,600
 Let's close in prayer, it's done.

694
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,420
 [congregation laughing]

695
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:35,420
 You have never been done wrong by God, ever.

696
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:40,660
 But we still come with suspicion, don't we?

697
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:41,600
 Don't we come?

698
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,360
 Don't we come with accusation?

699
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,360
 Let me try some on, I'm just gonna make these up.

700
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:49,300
 I've been following you for a decade of singleness, God.

701
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,140
 A decade.

702
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:55,960
 That person has been following you for about eight months.

703
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,320
 And it looks like they've got a God-fearing relationship

704
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,720
 that's gonna go towards marriage.

705
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,760
 And see, I didn't understand, I didn't understand

706
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,220
 that you were gonna be so confusing

707
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:06,120
 in the way you distribute these things.

708
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:11,800
 Someone else gets a car, someone else gets a job,

709
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,840
 someone else gets a promotion,

710
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,120
 someone else comes to the job later

711
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,840
 and then runs away with all the opportunity

712
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,640
 and oh, we come with the accusation.

713
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,960
 You didn't give me what I deserve.

714
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,960
 I endured it, I endured more.

715
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,800
 I'm the harder worker, I'm the one who's done more for you.

716
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:31,720
 Jesus says, okay, hard worker, let me remind you of something

717
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,020
 friend, I've done you no wrong.

718
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:38,840
 He is kind, if you wanna know how he's gonna handle

719
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:41,560
 your entitlement issue, he is kind,

720
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:44,760
 he is clear and he is honest.

721
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:49,760
 Here's kind, friend, here's clear, I did you no wrong.

722
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:55,760
 Here's honest, I choose, I choose, I do.

723
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,020
 And I know you don't like that if you don't trust me,

724
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:02,120
 but if you do trust me, you love it, you'll love it

725
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,520
 'cause I'm watching you too.

726
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,920
 And then if that weren't enough,

727
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,520
 Jesus asked the last penetrating question

728
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:11,760
 and it is the most difficult to read

729
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,500
 if you get caught in an entitled moment.

730
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,280
 Listen to this question from Jesus.

731
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:18,440
 Or do you begrudge my generosity?

732
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,160
 Do you begrudge my generosity?

733
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:23,240
 In other words, hey, are you mad at me

734
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,540
 'cause I was nice to them?

735
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:29,400
 Can you imagine that conversation between you and Jesus?

736
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,440
 He has done you no wrong.

737
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,000
 He has never done you any wrong.

738
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,600
 He's never done your family any wrong.

739
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,800
 He's never done, because after all, we know what we deserve.

740
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,160
 And so he has never actually given you what you deserve.

741
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,340
 He has consistently for every day of your entire life

742
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,560
 given you better than what you actually

743
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,880
 and biblically deserve.

744
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,680
 And you come in with the accusation

745
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,600
 because of what he's given somebody else

746
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,440
 and he looks at you and says,

747
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,360
 hey, you gonna be mad at me

748
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,740
 'cause I was kind to that person, friend?

749
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:58,000
 He didn't have to yell.

750
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,080
 That's so heart penetrating.

751
00:27:59,080 --> 00:27:59,920
 I mean, what does he have to do?

752
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,640
 He could whisper that and you would melt.

753
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,880
 Hey, you gonna be mad at me

754
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,500
 because I was nice to that person?

755
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,320
 You gonna be mad because that imperfect self

756
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,260
 got more than your imperfect self?

757
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:09,480
 Can we just remember for a second

758
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,820
 what everybody here deserves?

759
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,520
 I did you no wrong.

760
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,080
 Do you begrudge my generosity?

761
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,320
 And then this last statement tells me

762
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:20,160
 that he is trying to warn us.

763
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,280
 He's trying to warn us.

764
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,280
 Don't miss this last bit.

765
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,000
 He is trying to show us

766
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,240
 that it is not going to make sense

767
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,360
 if you try to observe what everybody else

768
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,760
 is being distributed to and what they're receiving.

769
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,960
 It is not going to add up in your sight

770
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,720
 if you choose to try to look left and right

771
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:38,120
 and decide in what order you should go

772
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,640
 and in what order the promotion should come

773
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,440
 and in what order the spouse should come

774
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,160
 and in what order the money should come

775
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,920
 or in what order, comparatively speaking, at all.

776
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,920
 It's like he's trying to warn us away from this

777
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:51,840
 and so he says, so the last will be first

778
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,600
 and the first last.

779
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:58,060
 In other words, in your eyes, in your eyes,

780
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:00,060
 whenever we line up to get payday,

781
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:01,120
 first, why don't you remember

782
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,600
 that you don't really want payday

783
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,960
 because payday's bad for you.

784
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,120
 You don't want what you deserve.

785
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,360
 But when you line up to receive grace from me,

786
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,680
 when you line up to receive the things

787
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,000
 that you don't deserve from me,

788
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,880
 when you line up to receive privilege from me,

789
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,360
 let me warn you about something.

790
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,400
 If you watch what other people receive,

791
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,080
 it might not seem to go in order to you.

792
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,680
 I just wanna warn you ahead of time.

793
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,800
 The first will be last and the last first.

794
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,160
 And I know I could've cleared all this up

795
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:29,040
 if I just paid everybody like a normal person.

796
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,560
 But that's not the way I do things.

797
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,720
 It's going to be different.

798
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,720
 The math won't work, your powers of observation

799
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,440
 will not work, your ability to piece together

800
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,560
 what God's doing won't work

801
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,960
 because it's just simply on a canvas

802
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,040
 that's bigger than you can see.

803
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,160
 And so let me just warn you,

804
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,120
 don't begrudge my generosity to other people.

805
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,280
 And I just wanna let you know ahead of time,

806
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:50,280
 the last will be first and the first will be last.

807
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:53,560
 Comparison will kill you.

808
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:56,000
 So my last point tonight is that comparison

809
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,120
 fuels entitlement.

810
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:02,320
 Comparison fuels entitlement.

811
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,960
 These guys were fine.

812
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,320
 These guys were fine until they saw

813
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,120
 what the other people got.

814
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,080
 Like what if they had been blindfolded and earplugged

815
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,120
 and then they got to the front

816
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,160
 and then it was let there be light

817
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,000
 and they got paid their denarius.

818
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,880
 I bet they went home fine.

819
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,240
 They would have gone home just fine,

820
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,880
 wouldn't have been a problem.

821
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,600
 But see, there's something about that awareness.

822
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,840
 There's something about that vision

823
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,120
 into what other people are getting from God.

824
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,440
 And we know it's from God.

825
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:28,080
 We know deep down that the one who is behind the choices

826
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,880
 and the one who is behind the blessings

827
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,080
 that other people receive, we know it's God.

828
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,280
 And if we start to compare,

829
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:38,400
 we are gonna be really, really in danger.

830
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,440
 Just simply by virtue of the knowledge

831
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:43,840
 we'll be really in danger of assuming

832
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,240
 that we deserve a fraction or in proportion

833
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,560
 to what that other person received.

834
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:51,040
 And it can lead to confusion and certainly entitlement,

835
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:55,800
 the confusion of what is deserved versus what is not.

836
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:59,960
 So let me give you two ideas as we finish up tonight.

837
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:00,800
 Two ideas.

838
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,640
 So you're like, so what do I do?

839
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,600
 Like what can I do about entitlement?

840
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,560
 I got two ideas for you.

841
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,000
 You can choose which one you are.

842
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,280
 And so if you happen to be a Jesus follower,

843
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,360
 if you identify tonight, you're like, I'm a Christian.

844
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,200
 Yes, that's me.

845
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,040
 I follow him.

846
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:12,960
 I believe in him.

847
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,440
 I believe that he actually is the son of God

848
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,760
 that he proclaims to be,

849
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,120
 that he literally died and literally rose again,

850
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,960
 that that's a real thing that happened in a real place

851
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,040
 at a real time and that he is alive today

852
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:26,000
 and that he is God and I'm giving him my whole life.

853
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,780
 If that's you, I have a simple exercise for you.

854
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:31,160
 I did it earlier today, in fact.

855
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,000
 I would love for you to try to do this.

856
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,240
 Take a pen and put it on the paper

857
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,920
 and write down 100 things.

858
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,360
 This feels like school, 100 things.

859
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:43,800
 So write down, pen on paper, 100 things

860
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:47,580
 that are your privileges but that you tend to forget

861
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:49,080
 and think they're your rights.

862
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:53,860
 So find 100 things, 100 things that you think,

863
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:55,960
 like on your worst day, when you wake up

864
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,280
 and you get angry and you're like,

865
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,280
 there's never a car console around here when I need one

866
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,200
 because I am upset right now.

867
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:05,560
 [congregation laughing]

868
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,760
 It like falls in waves.

869
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,160
 I thought you guys weren't with me for a second.

870
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,400
 I didn't know everybody laughed.

871
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:12,280
 [congregation laughing]

872
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,360
 On your worst days, those things that you think

873
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:17,640
 are your rights, those things.

874
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,620
 Write them down and just simply remind yourself,

875
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:21,740
 this is it, these are privileges.

876
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:24,000
 These things, these are privileges.

877
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 I'm not owed anything on this list, not at all.

878
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,620
 Every one of these things is a gift.

879
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:36,880
 Just reclassify them and remind yourself.

880
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,000
 I did this earlier today and so here it is.

881
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:39,840
 It took me half an hour.

882
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,020
 This is not a long assignment.

883
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:43,040
 So I did this in half an hour.

884
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,660
 And so I wrote down, I know you're like,

885
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:46,760
 how do you even read that?

886
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,960
 And so I wrote down, there's everything on here

887
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,060
 from my relationship with God, my access to God.

888
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:53,720
 That was number one, my access to God.

889
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,040
 And so I just started to write.

890
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:59,440
 And everything is on that list from my fiance's smile

891
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,140
 to my ability to practice hygiene.

892
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:04,440
 Like everything is on that list.

893
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,080
 Everything that I could possibly think of.

894
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,000
 And I would get stuck.

895
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 I'm like, socks, shoes, shoelaces, shoe cleaner.

896
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,140
 You know, it's like, you just get stuck.

897
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:17,200
 I mean, you start to have fun with it.

898
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,320
 It's like, oh my goodness.

899
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,560
 And so I looked at that piece of paper

900
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:23,040
 and I thought that could have gone for a very long time.

901
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:26,280
 And all of a sudden, I just have a little more joy today.

902
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,520
 You know why?

903
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,260
 Because instead of assuming that the things

904
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:31,640
 that are right here, instead of assuming

905
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,480
 that the things right here are

906
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,520
 because of my intrinsic meanness,

907
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,480
 all of a sudden I remember this is just

908
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,760
 'cause I'm loved by God.

909
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,960
 Everything I have, every relationship in my life,

910
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,800
 every person, a lot of these are names, ton of 'em.

911
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:47,180
 Family, yes, family.

912
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:49,840
 Right?

913
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,520
 Everything on there is not owed me.

914
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,360
 So why don't you do that?

915
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,480
 If you count yourself a Christ follower,

916
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,840
 why don't you try that on?

917
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,900
 If you are not, if you would say, hey, I don't know, man.

918
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,040
 I don't know.

919
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,160
 I'm not really a God person.

920
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,200
 I'm not really a Jesus person.

921
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,520
 I'm not really the religious type

922
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,040
 or however you might self-describe.

923
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,400
 Let me give you something.

924
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:10,800
 This passage was actually written for you.

925
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:15,800
 Matthew chapter 20, verses one through 16, I think it is,

926
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,220
 is written for you.

927
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:21,000
 The primary thing that Jesus is trying

928
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,800
 to communicate with this story is in fact not a tip,

929
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,100
 a trick, or a technique about how to fight entitlement,

930
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:28,040
 although it is clearly useful for that.

931
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:31,800
 His goal is to communicate that no matter

932
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,560
 where you are in your life, no matter where you are

933
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,240
 in your relationship to God right now,

934
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,800
 you can have a connection with him that starts today.

935
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,120
 You, it is not too late.

936
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,640
 You have not wasted so much time

937
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:43,320
 that God will not come to the marketplace

938
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,560
 or whatever place you're in and call you

939
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,160
 to be a part of what he's doing.

940
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:50,920
 There is no such thing as a situation

941
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,500
 that you've created for yourself

942
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:55,400
 that God will not approach you and say, hey, come with me.

943
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,440
 I got a place for you.

944
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,280
 I wanna call you friend.

945
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,560
 Let me explain how this works.

946
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,080
 The passage is for you.

947
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,880
 And don't misunderstand.

948
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,800
 It's not there so you can say, oh, goody,

949
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,320
 I'll wait till the last hour.

950
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,620
 It might be the last hour.

951
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:13,560
 This might be the last time Jesus calls clearly to you.

952
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,400
 It might be your 5 p.m.

953
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:19,360
 And so if you don't happen to follow Christ,

954
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,760
 why don't you spend some time with us afterward

955
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,000
 and let us just talk with you.

956
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,560
 We won't force you to do anything,

957
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,280
 but we'll share with you what the truth is

958
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,640
 and the kind call of God that he wants

959
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,880
 to give you purpose and call you friend.

960
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:32,060
 That's what the passage is designed to do.

961
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:36,500
 (pages rustling)

962
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,460
 Love to close with a story.

963
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:42,820
 A couple weeks ago, my girlfriend, then girlfriend,

964
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:45,700
 and I decided to go to Palo Duro Canyon.

965
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,060
 Shout out, West Texas.

966
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:49,660
 (congregation cheering)

967
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:50,660
 Shameless.

968
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:51,500
 All right.

969
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,860
 (congregation laughing)

970
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:54,820
 West Texas, all right.

971
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,740
 And I thought, I've been to Palo Duro Canyon before.

972
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:57,700
 She's not from Texas.

973
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,380
 She just got here as fast as she could.

974
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:02,180
 And so she's never seen it.

975
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:03,100
 I'm like, okay, Palo Duro,

976
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:04,300
 it's kind of this big hole in the ground

977
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:06,300
 and I've seen it before, but you know what,

978
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:07,500
 happy boo, happy you.

979
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,700
 So I'm like, all right, here we go.

980
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:12,040
 (congregation laughing)

981
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:16,220
 She's listening in Fort Worth right now

982
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:17,820
 and she's very nervous, I promise.

983
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:20,180
 Okay, so we go out to Palo Duro Canyon.

984
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:21,140
 It's beautiful.

985
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:22,020
 It's more beautiful than I remembered.

986
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:23,360
 I'd love to show you a picture of it, in fact.

987
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,300
 So there we are.

988
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:26,620
 It's so great and all.

989
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:30,300
 And so just like two feet farther away from the camera

990
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:31,140
 and we're done.

991
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:32,940
 So we just got our feet hanging off right there.

992
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,100
 But it is a beautiful spot.

993
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:34,920
 We're loving it.

994
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,020
 We just handed my phone to a guy that was passing by

995
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:37,840
 and I thought, this is beautiful.

996
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,180
 So I think we're gonna just propose right here.

997
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:40,380
 So this is what's about to happen.

998
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:42,580
 So that actually happened.

999
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:43,540
 And so a few minutes later,

1000
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:44,780
 we handed my phone to another guy.

1001
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:46,180
 He was like walking by.

1002
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,380
 I was like, hey man, will you take our picture?

1003
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:48,820
 And I did it kind of rudely, kind of abruptly.

1004
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:49,900
 I was like, hey man, will you take a picture?

1005
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:50,980
 And he was like, yeah, I guess.

1006
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:51,820
 And he saw me go like this.

1007
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:53,700
 He was like, oh, and he started fumbling with the phone.

1008
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:56,700
 (audience laughing)

1009
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:59,260
 But he got it pointed in the right direction.

1010
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,320
 Thank you, thank you.

1011
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,100
 So there we are.

1012
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:05,940
 And we are happy.

1013
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:07,640
 Okay, those are happy people.

1014
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,980
 All right, we're excited to marry each other.

1015
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:13,100
 Like, I think it's gonna go great.

1016
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:13,940
 I really do.

1017
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:14,760
 She's my better half.

1018
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,660
 I'm her other half.

1019
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:17,100
 Like, this is gonna go really great.

1020
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:19,020
 (audience laughing)

1021
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:20,140
 So that's where we are.

1022
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:21,700
 Now, look, let's just be honest with you for a second.

1023
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:23,460
 I know that that's a lot of fun.

1024
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:25,340
 But you think entitlement, is it like,

1025
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:26,180
 look at those two people.

1026
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:28,320
 You think entitlement's in there anywhere,

1027
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,720
 in those two people's minds?

1028
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:34,300
 Oh yeah, it was there.

1029
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:35,900
 You think I expected a yes?

1030
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:39,180
 You're not gonna insult me, come on.

1031
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:40,380
 (audience laughing)

1032
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:41,980
 You think I expected a yes?

1033
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:43,020
 I'm not exactly the kind of guy

1034
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:44,820
 who goes to the jeweler on a whim, all right?

1035
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:46,300
 We had talked about this.

1036
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:49,480
 I was expecting a yes, all right?

1037
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,320
 What about her?

1038
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,980
 You think she was expecting a ring?

1039
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:53,880
 You think she felt entitled to a ring?

1040
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,660
 I don't think I pulled out a diamond

1041
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:58,700
 and she thought, this guy is a pioneer.

1042
00:37:58,700 --> 00:37:59,540
 What a--

1043
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:02,540
 (audience laughing)

1044
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:06,360
 What a creative.

1045
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:09,700
 This guy digs deep, wow.

1046
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:16,540
 I really doubt, I really doubt that happened, okay?

1047
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:18,340
 And there's plenty, I mean, the smiles are genuine.

1048
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:21,020
 I mean, there's plenty of happiness there.

1049
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:22,180
 But imagine with me for a second,

1050
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:23,560
 imagine this with me for a second.

1051
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:26,160
 What if there was like no entitlement?

1052
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,620
 What if there had been zero?

1053
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:31,380
 Truly, and I know that's hard to get there, right?

1054
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:32,300
 Because you just expect,

1055
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:34,440
 like we have these cultural expectations.

1056
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,540
 But imagine just for a second,

1057
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:38,220
 like what if moments like this,

1058
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:40,980
 not just moments like this, but any moment,

1059
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,700
 what if that could have been experienced

1060
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:45,940
 with zero entitlement whatsoever?

1061
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,860
 I'm talking about like there has never been

1062
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:50,540
 a person proposed outside in nature before ever.

1063
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:51,880
 Like there's just no knowledge of that.

1064
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:54,440
 There's never been a ring involved in this deal ever.

1065
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,580
 There's like all kinds of credit coming in all over the place

1066
00:38:56,580 --> 00:39:00,500
 and so like nobody has any entitlement whatsoever.

1067
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:03,420
 You think the joy rises?

1068
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:05,700
 Oh yeah, oh yeah.

1069
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:10,060
 So here's why I'm telling you that.

1070
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:15,060
 Your joy will be capped by your own expectations.

1071
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:21,400
 Your joy will be limited by your own sense of entitlement.

1072
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,840
 You know why?

1073
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,640
 Because when you get the things you want,

1074
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,240
 you'll just say, "I had it coming to me."

1075
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,820
 And when you don't, you'll just be mad.

1076
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:30,640
 That's what entitlement does.

1077
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,160
 When entitlement rises,

1078
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:35,480
 it takes away your ability to enjoy anything

1079
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,880
 because the things that you get,

1080
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,040
 "I just had it coming to me.

1081
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:38,960
 "That's what I deserved anyway.

1082
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,760
 "It's really more of a paycheck than anything."

1083
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:43,100
 And the things you don't get, you are frustrated about.

1084
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:43,940
 You can't stand it.

1085
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:45,400
 You end up punching your car.

1086
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,040
 (congregation laughing)

1087
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:53,040
 So what happens is as your entitlement minimum rises,

1088
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:56,400
 your joy maximum falls.

1089
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,080
 Does that make sense?

1090
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,600
 And it is possible to be so entitled, in fact,

1091
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,100
 that you run at a deficit.

1092
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,000
 You're frustrated.

1093
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,160
 You don't love your life.

1094
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,320
 In fact, you hate it

1095
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,360
 because you think God gave you a raw deal when he didn't

1096
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:11,340
 because of the confusion called entitlement.

1097
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:14,040
 I'll say that one more time.

1098
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:17,440
 If you don't have a minimum entitlement,

1099
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,480
 you will have no maximum joy.

1100
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:23,360
 What if you woke up tomorrow rejoicing about your roof,

1101
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:28,360
 your AC, your hot water, your car, your job, your boss?

1102
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:31,240
 Yeah, I went there, your boss, even your boss, okay?

1103
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:34,640
 Like what if you rejoiced about every single thing

1104
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,740
 in your life, everything?

1105
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:40,600
 You would feel like you were moving around in God's theater

1106
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,920
 watching the movie play and you would enjoy it.

1107
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:43,760
 That's what would happen.

1108
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,080
 You're fighting for your joy tonight.

1109
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,600
 I don't want you to embrace some false reality.

1110
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:50,520
 A lack of entitlement is not embracing some false reality.

1111
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:53,960
 I'll fake myself out like I don't deserve anything

1112
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:54,920
 and then I'll be happy.

1113
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,440
 No, no, no.

1114
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,640
 It's not that.

1115
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:01,360
 It's remembering that you actually don't deserve anything.

1116
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,280
 It's not some false humility idea where it's like,

1117
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,780
 okay, just lower my expectations.

1118
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:06,200
 Like I don't think something good

1119
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,480
 is gonna like should come my way.

1120
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:11,120
 It's no, nothing good should come your way.

1121
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,160
 That's the reality.

1122
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,200
 And if you can embrace that,

1123
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:19,040
 you will be a joyful, free, faith-filled person.

1124
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:22,000
 Let me pray that that's who we'd be.

1125
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:27,060
 Thank you, Jesus, Son of God,

1126
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:29,480
 that you did not grasp the things

1127
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,660
 that you could have grasped for,

1128
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:32,200
 that you did not leverage the things

1129
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,160
 that you could have leveraged.

1130
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:35,640
 You were never confused about what you deserve.

1131
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:38,000
 In fact, you deserved everything and you gave it all up

1132
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,040
 for the sake of connecting us to God.

1133
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:42,120
 Thank you, thank you.

1134
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,560
 God, will you make it possible,

1135
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,200
 will you make it possible, God,

1136
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,920
 that we would connect to you through faith

1137
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,680
 in a way that receives that as one who is rejoicing,

1138
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,160
 as one who is receiving what's not deserved,

1139
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,540
 every gift, whether it's proposal

1140
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:01,160
 or just waking up from a nap, it does not matter.

1141
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:04,300
 Everything is from you, everything.

1142
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:08,180
 Give us open hands, God.

1143
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:10,520
 You can place in and you can take out.

1144
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:12,280
 You can place in and then you can move it

1145
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,560
 to somebody else's hand.

1146
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:16,120
 You are in charge, you distribute everything.

1147
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,500
 We deserve nothing.

1148
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:21,840
 Let us keep our eyes on you, the one who loves us,

1149
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:25,760
 the one who cares for us, the one who calls us friend,

1150
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:26,960
 even when we accuse.

1151
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:36,960
