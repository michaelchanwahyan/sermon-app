[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:27.240]   - All right, well, welcome friends of the room,
[00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.200]   friends of Fort Worth.
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.540]   He's excited, Houston, El Paso, Phoenix,
[00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.320]   Fayetteville, Philadelphia, North Carolina,
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.360]   wherever you're joining us from, we're so excited.
[00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.540]   We are wrapping up this mood series tonight.
[00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.380]   Let me start by sharing a little bit of something
[00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.780]   related to the Marvin household recently.
[00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.840]   My kids are terrible sleepers,
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.120]   and I like to think they get this from their mother,
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.680]   but I think that would be a lie.
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.760]   And she reminds me often that that probably comes
[00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.080]   from their father, who's not a great napper,
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.560]   not a great sleeper, and so we have done everything
[00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.600]   we can to try to get them to sleep.
[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.000]   The latest thing we've been attempting to do
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.160]   is cut out as much sugar as we can anytime around bedtime,
[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.840]   'cause we wanna make sure there's very little sugar
[00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.720]   so that they'll go right to sleep, and it has not worked.
[00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.320]   And so that has led me to discover,
[00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.560]   man, what could that possibly be?
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:15.600]   Like, what is not causing sleep?
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.840]   And in looking even the sugar thing,
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.600]   I recently came across a discovery
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.320]   that sugar has nothing to do with your energy levels.
[00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.680]   Do you know this?
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.480]   Like, it's not responsible, this is a little bit
[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:29.920]   mind-blowing, but I'm going somewhere, people,
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:30.920]   so just stay with me.
[00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.960]   It's not responsible for sleep in children, sleep in you.
[00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.580]   If it's chocolate, there could be caffeine,
[00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.720]   which could be a factor, but it doesn't have anything
[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.920]   to do with that, and that kind of led me
[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.280]   down an article spiral.
[00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.760]   Ever been on the internet, and you're like,
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.400]   all of a sudden, you're going to check your email,
[00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.760]   and then you're on the vortex of just information,
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.680]   and you're checking out like one myth after the next
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.640]   after the next from the article that you looked up
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.000]   related to sugar?
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   And this kind of will give us some traction
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.840]   for where we're going tonight,
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.400]   'cause there were like several different things
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.520]   and myths that I came across in exploring that one
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.840]   that I really think most of us or many of us
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.760]   have heard for a long time in my life,
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.320]   and they just are not true, apparently.
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.640]   So not just is sugar not responsible for increasing
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.840]   energy levels in kids or people,
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.280]   there's other myths that maybe you walked into this room.
[00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.360]   This is one that maybe you've heard of before,
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.160]   or at least it's kind of hard for me to believe,
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.840]   and it is that shaving definitely will not make
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.900]   the hair come back thicker.
[00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.300]   If you shave an area, and I think we all at some point,
[00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:27.420]   at least I grew up in high school,
[00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.380]   and there's this like moment,
[00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.060]   and depending on if you're a guy or a girl,
[00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.660]   how you interact with this is very different,
[00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.300]   'cause if you're a guy, you're hoping that your facial hair
[00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:35.220]   is gonna come in in high school,
[00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.580]   so you're like shaving every day,
[00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.480]   just hoping that three hairs are gonna pop up.
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.340]   And if you're a girl, you're like, hey,
[00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.960]   the one thing you cannot do is wax right here.
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.040]   You shave right here, it's gonna blow up on you,
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.660]   so you need to be very careful about what you do.
[00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.700]   But apparently, it is totally a myth.
[00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.400]   Shaving will not make it come back thicker.
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.740]   Here's another one, turkey.
[00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.260]   Turkey does not make you tired.
[00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.540]   Anyone ever heard this before?
[00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.180]   Yes, it's a myth.
[00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.900]   Turkey does not make, before anybody's like,
[00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.060]   no, wait a second, hey, Thanksgiving, I've experienced it.
[00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.260]   It is not turkey that makes you tired,
[00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.380]   it's that you're bloated, and you had too much dessert,
[00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.160]   or alcohol, or something that made you feel like,
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.180]   man, I just need a nap, but it is not.
[00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.540]   And in case a lot of you guys are checking,
[00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:18.740]   and you're like, wait, there's some hormone
[00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.580]   that's inside of it, that hormone is in every meat.
[00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.480]   So any meat should make, in fact, it's in cheese.
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.760]   If you had cheese, it should make you just as tired.
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.360]   It's not true, it's a myth.
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.240]   Another myth that maybe you came into this room believing,
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.800]   I found this one out today, someone told me,
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.240]   and then verifying it, a dog's mouth
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.960]   is not cleaner than a human mouth.
[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.840]   Yeah, what?
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.560]   Depending on who your dog is, I guess,
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.480]   this would be a fact, and depending on who you are,
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.320]   and how often you brush, but on average,
[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.640]   a dog's mouth is not cleaner than a human mouth.
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.460]   This is only said by people who love their dog
[00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:54.020]   licking their face, and you should stop it.
[00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:57.140]   It's weirding everybody out, and his mouth is not cleaner,
[00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.620]   and you should let anybody lick your face, let alone a dog.
[00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.740]   But it is a myth that a dog's mouth is cleaner.
[00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.200]   Here's another one, a very famous one.
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.640]   Urine will take away a jellyfish sting.
[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.860]   Now, if you grew up in the era that I did,
[00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:16.760]   you saw Monica and Chandler in the episode of Friends,
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.000]   where Chandler steps in, I can't believe
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.040]   this is how we're opening.
[00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.640]   Chandler steps in after Monica gets stung by a jellyfish,
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:25.720]   and he's like, "I gotta help out."
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.260]   This is not true, so if anyone, if you're ever at the beach,
[00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:29.400]   and you get stung by a jellyfish,
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.480]   and somebody tries to come up and help you,
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:35.480]   tell them to back it up, because it will not help you.
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.200]   In fact, it can often make things worse, apparently.
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.440]   Saltwater is your best option at that point,
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.300]   'cause it'll clean it out, but urine is definitely,
[00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.600]   is never really the solution to any problem that you have.
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.360]   And it is a myth, and whoever came up with this,
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.540]   I'm not even sure where it came from,
[00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:52.720]   other than maybe that episode in general.
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.640]   But the reason I start there is 'cause in talking
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.440]   about myths and how if you believe a myth,
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.920]   it can impact your behavior, and just the truth,
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:01.880]   and how oftentimes culture, or just different people,
[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.040]   we grow up and we kind of embrace these different myths,
[00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.540]   and they impact our lives.
[00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.320]   Some on really silly and fun ways.
[00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.160]   There's other things in life where we embrace a myth,
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.400]   and it has tremendous impact.
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.040]   And tonight, we're gonna talk about the subject,
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.720]   or the mood of loneliness.
[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.460]   And we're gonna explore some of the myths that people,
[00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.840]   oftentimes well-intentioned people, promote,
[00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.500]   and oftentimes many of us believe
[00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:27.980]   as it relates to loneliness,
[00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:30.100]   and what a solution to loneliness is.
[00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:33.140]   So we're gonna look at three teachings from God's word
[00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:34.500]   on the subject of loneliness.
[00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.860]   Three myths and then three truths
[00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:38.300]   that come directly from Scripture
[00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:39.300]   as it relates to loneliness.
[00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.320]   This has been called the loneliest generation.
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:46.980]   A recent study found that 68% of young adults
[00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:49.540]   would say that no one really knows them.
[00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.240]   It's been called the most connected generation in history,
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.140]   and it's also one of the loneliest of all time.
[00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:56.200]   Consistently, a majority of young adults
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.480]   describe feeling extremely lonely,
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.520]   or very lonely, on a consistent basis.
[00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:07.060]   Despite the fact that we are more connected
[00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:09.020]   than we've ever been before,
[00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:10.900]   we're often less known than we've ever been before.
[00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:12.540]   In fact, young adulthood in general
[00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:13.680]   can kind of be a lonely time.
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.140]   Because if you think about it,
[00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:16.760]   it's just I was thinking about it this past week,
[00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.380]   your whole life you're kind of like running
[00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:21.220]   with your crew and your friends from very early on
[00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:22.260]   until you reach young adulthood.
[00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:23.760]   So you start in elementary school,
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:25.220]   you're hanging out, you're on the playground,
[00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:26.580]   you're running around playing tetherball,
[00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:28.460]   you're all together, then you move on to junior high.
[00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:30.780]   You're still together, you just get a locker this time,
[00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:31.600]   and you get a little bigger,
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:32.480]   and you start going through puberty,
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:33.620]   but we're all in this together.
[00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:34.940]   Then you move on to high school,
[00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:36.580]   and you still got your crew that you're running with,
[00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:37.780]   and your friends are all together,
[00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:39.860]   and you're just with your group of people this whole time.
[00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:40.700]   Then you go to college,
[00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.020]   and there's a little bit of splitting off,
[00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:43.220]   but it's like, hey, I'll see you back there,
[00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:44.960]   we'll hang out when we come back for the summers,
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:45.800]   but we're going off,
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.740]   and I'm still around people my age and my age group.
[00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:51.120]   And then all of a sudden it's like the track is going along,
[00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.720]   and everything's fine, and it's like the track runs out,
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.080]   and there's just a total decline,
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:57.280]   and you're just free falling out into the real world
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:58.360]   after you graduate college,
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.000]   and you're like, oh my gosh, all of my people,
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.880]   I'm no longer just around all 21 year olds all the time.
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.400]   I no longer live with seven roommates all the time.
[00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.720]   I'm in a new city, I got a new job,
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.920]   I don't work with a bunch of people like me
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:12.800]   and my age all the time, and I'm kind of free falling,
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.600]   and I just feel alone.
[00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:17.740]   And so I don't know what your experience
[00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:18.880]   with loneliness has looked like,
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:21.020]   and what it looks like today,
[00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:22.260]   but it's a feeling that all of us
[00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:23.920]   at some point in our lives have,
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:25.880]   and if you haven't experienced it,
[00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:29.300]   you're either going to experience it in the future,
[00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:31.100]   and knowing how to face it and combat it,
[00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:32.660]   because it's loneliness that's responsible
[00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:34.900]   for so many issues that spring forward
[00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:36.340]   out of that loneliness.
[00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:38.420]   People get into relationships they shouldn't be in,
[00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:41.540]   people start interacting with alcohol
[00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:43.480]   in a way that is destructive towards them,
[00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:45.600]   and further relationships drives them back
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:46.920]   into shame and loneliness,
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:49.640]   and people just make all types of decisions
[00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:51.760]   to try to deal with the pain,
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:54.440]   because it is such a real pain
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:55.360]   that can come with loneliness.
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:56.760]   So we're gonna look at God's word
[00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:00.120]   about how to battle real solutions for loneliness,
[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:02.320]   and how to reject and identify real lives
[00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:03.200]   as it relates to loneliness.
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:04.920]   So if you take notes, you can take notes,
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:06.200]   we're gonna go through three of these things,
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.840]   and look at the scriptures that correspond.
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:10.160]   The first myth as it relates to loneliness
[00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.660]   is related to friends, and it's specifically this.
[00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:15.680]   Friends can fix my loneliness.
[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:17.200]   Friends can fix my loneliness.
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:20.960]   The truth is that it is the right friends
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:23.280]   that help us to fight loneliness.
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:24.480]   It is not just friends in general
[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:25.620]   that can fix my loneliness,
[00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:27.420]   but the solution is that I don't need more friends,
[00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:30.480]   or my old friends, or my college friends, or any friends.
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:32.080]   The truth is that the Bible says
[00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:35.240]   that you are to have the right friends,
[00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:37.320]   to have real friends,
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:39.460]   and friends that align with God's design
[00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:41.400]   to the types of friend relationships
[00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:42.240]   that you're supposed to have.
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:43.060]   You may not know this,
[00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:45.080]   God cares about you having friends in your life,
[00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:47.760]   and having the right types of friends in your life.
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.720]   And he gets very clear in scripture
[00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:51.280]   about the types of relationships
[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:53.600]   that are to mark your life and my life.
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:56.920]   Proverbs 18, 24 says this.
[00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:00.280]   "A man of many companions may come to ruin."
[00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:01.400]   So a man of many companions,
[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.440]   this could be a man of many Facebook friends,
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:04.760]   a man of many Instagram followers,
[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:06.240]   a man who knows a lot of people,
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:07.460]   "may come to ruin."
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:11.880]   But there's a friend that sticks closer than a brother.
[00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:16.000]   The Bible says that there's a type of relationship
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.900]   that you can have with lots of people,
[00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:20.140]   but there are certain relationships
[00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:21.120]   that should mark your life,
[00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:22.240]   that no matter what you face,
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:23.080]   they're sticking by you,
[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:23.920]   and you're sticking by them.
[00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:26.220]   That there's this real friend that God wants you to have.
[00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:28.140]   Specifically, here's the type of real friends,
[00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:29.940]   or the right friendships that should mark your life,
[00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:31.420]   or should be a part of your life.
[00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:34.340]   People who know you, and who know God.
[00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:35.700]   People who know you, and who know God.
[00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:36.620]   And we'll talk about and unpack
[00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:38.460]   why that's so important here in a second.
[00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:40.560]   But the solution to fixing any loneliness
[00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:41.900]   is not more relationships,
[00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:43.860]   not more out social activities,
[00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:45.540]   it is having the right friendships.
[00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:47.240]   And if you do not get this right,
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:48.980]   you will not fight and battle loneliness
[00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:51.620]   in the way that God wants you to experience.
[00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:52.720]   A freedom from loneliness,
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:55.140]   and the ability to fight against loneliness.
[00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:56.340]   It's not just any friendships,
[00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:57.420]   it is the right ones.
[00:09:57.420 --> 00:09:59.320]   Just like, it's not dissimilar to,
[00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:02.020]   if you go to fill an empty room in your apartment,
[00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:03.100]   or an empty room in your house,
[00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:04.860]   you're looking for somebody to split the rent with,
[00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:05.700]   or split the lease with,
[00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:07.580]   there's a couple ways you could go about that.
[00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:09.500]   The first would be through a connection,
[00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:10.560]   through a relationship,
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:11.980]   through an old friend, an acquaintance,
[00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:12.800]   somebody you know,
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:13.940]   somebody from this church,
[00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:14.860]   somebody from your church,
[00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:15.780]   wherever you're connected to,
[00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:16.620]   somebody who you're like,
[00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:19.260]   "Oh, I think we kind of would run together well."
[00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.540]   Then you could go what is the more risky approach,
[00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:22.820]   which is called Craigslist.
[00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:24.420]   And you could go search for,
[00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:25.620]   looking for a roommate.
[00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:28.100]   And what you're likely to experience
[00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:29.760]   is a roommate that no longer,
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:31.820]   is not someone that you get excited about going home,
[00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:32.780]   and being around all the time,
[00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:36.380]   but someone who doesn't know how to wash out the pasta
[00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:38.500]   out of the pot when they finish cooking,
[00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:41.340]   somebody who borrows everything that you have,
[00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:42.180]   and is like,
[00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:43.000]   "I thought we were kind of sharing
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:43.840]   "this whole thing together."
[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:44.660]   Somebody who doesn't tell you
[00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:47.420]   that they're bringing over friends
[00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:49.220]   that are gonna stay in the middle of the week,
[00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:50.060]   over the night,
[00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:51.700]   somebody who leaves the TV on till one o'clock.
[00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:52.660]   The same way that we'd all go like,
[00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:54.620]   "Hey, yeah, the goal is not to just,
[00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:56.680]   "you know, fill the empty room,
[00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:58.960]   "it's to fill the room with the right person."
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:10:59.800]   And in the same way,
[00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:00.620]   the goal is not just for you
[00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:03.580]   to try to fill the empty parts of your heart,
[00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:05.140]   whereas the relationships with people in general,
[00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:06.480]   it's to fill them with the right people,
[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:09.740]   specifically people who know God,
[00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:10.580]   and who know you.
[00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:11.600]   And I'm gonna talk about both of those.
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:14.420]   Without both of those being present,
[00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:17.600]   you are not going to experience the type of friendships
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:19.600]   that God wants you to have.
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.220]   And he designed you for relationships.
[00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:23.400]   The very first thing that God says is not good
[00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:24.940]   was man to be alone.
[00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:27.820]   Before the garden,
[00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:29.460]   or before sin was entered into the world,
[00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:30.880]   in the book of Genesis,
[00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:31.720]   God said,
[00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:33.220]   "It is not good for man to be alone."
[00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:34.540]   You were designed for relationships,
[00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:36.700]   but not just any relationships
[00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:37.780]   will help you battle loneliness.
[00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:38.760]   The right ones will.
[00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:40.340]   So what do I mean by knowing you,
[00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:41.180]   or knowing God?
[00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:42.720]   Specifically as it relates to knowing you,
[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:43.560]   they know you,
[00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:45.220]   they know flaws and all.
[00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:46.940]   You open up and have a life in front of them
[00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:47.780]   where they know,
[00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:49.660]   not just kind of what everyone sees on the outside,
[00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:51.380]   they know all of the different,
[00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:53.680]   just parts of you where God still needs to take ground.
[00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:54.520]   If you're a Christian,
[00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:56.000]   you should have people who know you.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.220]   They know where you struggle,
[00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:59.500]   they know the areas where you're tempted.
[00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:01.180]   The Bible says in Hebrews chapter three,
[00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:02.660]   verse 13,
[00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:04.600]   verse 12 and 13,
[00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:06.420]   "Take care, brothers,
[00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:09.220]   "lest there be in any of you an evil
[00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:11.260]   "and an unbelieving heart,
[00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.420]   "leading you to fall away from the living God."
[00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:14.700]   So hey, everybody listen up,
[00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:16.260]   I want you to make sure that you watch out
[00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:17.380]   that in the midst of you guys,
[00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:18.220]   he's talking to this,
[00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:20.740]   that writer of Hebrews is writing this church,
[00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:22.420]   there's not an unbelieving heart,
[00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:24.020]   or part of you that doesn't trust God,
[00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:27.300]   that could lead you to turn away from your faith.
[00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:29.500]   But here's the way to do that.
[00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:33.780]   "But exhort or call out one another."
[00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:39.580]   Exhort one another every day as long as it is called today,
[00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:41.200]   so that none of you would be hardened
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:42.260]   by the deceitfulness of sin.
[00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:43.900]   That God says, hey, the antidote,
[00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:46.300]   the remedy for you having your heart hardened by sin
[00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:47.540]   is to have people in your life
[00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:49.740]   that can look in and exhort or call you
[00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:50.780]   to the standard of God's word.
[00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:52.420]   They can call you out in the areas of your life
[00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:53.460]   that you need to be called out.
[00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:55.080]   And they can call me out in the areas of my life
[00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:56.300]   that I need to be called out.
[00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:58.300]   How is that possible?
[00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:00.900]   The only way it's possible is for them to know
[00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:04.140]   the areas of your life that you need to be called out in.
[00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:05.060]   For them to know what's going on
[00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:05.940]   in your dating relationship.
[00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:07.980]   For you to open up your life and share about the anxiety
[00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:09.300]   that you feel at work.
[00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:10.940]   For them to know the challenges that you're having
[00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:12.260]   with your family or your parents.
[00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:13.940]   For them to know about the pornography addiction,
[00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:15.820]   the eating disorder, the cutting that's taking place.
[00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:17.260]   For you to open up your life and say,
[00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.980]   hey, this is not who I wanna be.
[00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:20.860]   God's word is clear,
[00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:22.560]   and I don't even wanna talk about this,
[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:24.500]   but I need somebody to know it and hold me accountable
[00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:26.300]   and pray for me and come alongside.
[00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:28.380]   You will not have the right relationships
[00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:31.860]   unless you are willing to open up your life
[00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:33.980]   to other people, to be known.
[00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:38.740]   In Proverbs chapter 27, verse six, it says this.
[00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:42.260]   Faithful are the wounds of a friend,
[00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.220]   but profuse are the kisses of an enemy.
[00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:47.320]   That a true friend, a real friend, the Bible says,
[00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:51.100]   is someone who is willing to wound you with the truth
[00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:54.640]   because they love you enough to tell you it.
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:56.380]   So when he's not willing to be like, hey, dude, look,
[00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:59.340]   I know you're dating Roger, and Roger's a little crazy,
[00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:00.540]   I think he's got an anger problem,
[00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:03.380]   but I really would love to be a part of your bridal party.
[00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:04.340]   Can we make that happen?
[00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:06.460]   They're not willing to just go along with it.
[00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:07.980]   If they see something not consistent
[00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:09.540]   with what God's word says, they're willing to say,
[00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:12.540]   hey, can we talk about your relationship?
[00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:13.660]   I just feel like I'm seeing this.
[00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:16.700]   Maybe I'm wrong, but I wanna love you enough to wound you.
[00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:17.780]   Do you have friends in your life
[00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:20.140]   who love you enough to wound you,
[00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:21.360]   who love you enough to share the truth?
[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:24.220]   When is the last time that someone was honest enough
[00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:26.060]   with you to say, hey, I see this in your life.
[00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:27.920]   Has anyone ever told you this before?
[00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:30.180]   If you wanna have real relationships and real friends,
[00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:31.700]   it's gonna involve people who are willing
[00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:32.940]   to have them speak the truth,
[00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:37.060]   'cause I care enough about you to speak the truth to you.
[00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:37.900]   And if I didn't love you,
[00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:39.400]   I would just tell you whatever you wanted to hear,
[00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:43.100]   'cause I need you to affirm something in me.
[00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:44.860]   But real friends are willing to speak the truth,
[00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:46.460]   and they're people that you have to be willing
[00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:48.260]   to open up your life to, so they have to know you,
[00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.260]   and the second thing, they have to know God.
[00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.020]   That if you're gonna have the type
[00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:53.220]   of real intimate relationships,
[00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:55.140]   can you be boys or can you be girls
[00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:57.100]   with somebody who's not a follower of Jesus
[00:14:57.100 --> 00:14:59.660]   or not a Christian or is like, yeah, I'm cool with that,
[00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:01.140]   but it's not really a big part of my life.
[00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:02.060]   Can you be friends with them?
[00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:03.620]   Sure.
[00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:04.700]   Can you spend a lot of time with them
[00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:07.100]   or can you like being around that person?
[00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:09.540]   Absolutely, but will you experience the type
[00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:11.740]   of friendship that fights against loneliness?
[00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:15.780]   No, because you're not experiencing a friendship
[00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:17.900]   that shares the most intimate part about you,
[00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:21.040]   which if you're a Christian, is your faith.
[00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:22.340]   It's the fact that you have a faith
[00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:25.060]   and you are in relationship with the one true God
[00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:26.340]   through Jesus.
[00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:28.660]   You're just gonna have superficial, shallow relationships,
[00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:29.740]   and so you may have a good time,
[00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:31.300]   you're able to catch up on memories,
[00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:32.980]   and remember that one frat party we were a part of?
[00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:35.380]   That was the best, man, but you're not gonna have
[00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:38.300]   the true, real relationship God wants for you
[00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:40.600]   if they're not someone who actually knows God.
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:44.380]   This is why some of us, like if you are from a family
[00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:46.020]   like I am where there's non-believers
[00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:47.380]   and non-Christians in your family,
[00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:48.940]   you can get around other Christians
[00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:51.320]   and it feels like you're closer, for me,
[00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:53.060]   closer with my community group,
[00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:54.740]   with other Christians that I've known for a while
[00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:57.020]   than I am from my own blood, my family,
[00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:59.320]   or members of my family who don't share the same faith.
[00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:00.680]   Why is that?
[00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:01.880]   Maybe you grew up in a Christian home
[00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:03.140]   and you're like, dude, me and my family,
[00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:04.500]   we're thick as thieves,
[00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:05.620]   and so I don't even know what you're talking about,
[00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:07.560]   but a lot of us, we did not,
[00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:09.500]   and so when we get around family and we're back home,
[00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:11.420]   it's like, dude, I feel closer with the Christians
[00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:14.720]   that I developed relationships than I do with my own family,
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:17.740]   my own blood that I was around for years, 18 years.
[00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:18.580]   Why is that?
[00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:21.200]   It's because kindred spirits is the true thing.
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:23.860]   If you share the Holy Spirit,
[00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:26.260]   you will have a kindred spirit with one another.
[00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:29.020]   You have the same values, you have the same perspective,
[00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:32.180]   the same faith, and the same commitment to following Christ,
[00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:33.940]   which is a far more uniting thing
[00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:37.100]   than anything any human or any family relationship will,
[00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:38.620]   that blood is thicker than water.
[00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:39.860]   Anybody heard that before?
[00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:41.420]   Blood is thicker than water,
[00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:43.840]   but the spirit is greater than them both,
[00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:46.100]   and it's the spirit of God that bonds his people together
[00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:47.820]   in the strongest relationship.
[00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:50.040]   If you're a Christian, you are more family to me
[00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:52.740]   than any family member I have that's not a believer.
[00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:54.140]   That's what the Bible teaches,
[00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:56.820]   that we are all children of God united underneath Jesus,
[00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:58.060]   together in the body of Christ.
[00:16:58.060 --> 00:16:59.700]   So you need to have real relationships
[00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:01.860]   with someone who knows you, that you open up your life to,
[00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:03.100]   and somebody who knows God.
[00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:06.300]   What is at stake if either one of those are gone?
[00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:07.940]   Well, if there's someone who knows you,
[00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:09.700]   but they don't know God, then you just get together,
[00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:10.620]   and they're like, dude,
[00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:13.380]   they celebrate the sins Jesus died for.
[00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:14.220]   They're like, oh man,
[00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:15.700]   hey, let's go have another one of those nights,
[00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:17.300]   you know, we kind of kick back, it was relaxing,
[00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:19.880]   we were, is it Friday, and you know, you ended up,
[00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:21.060]   I think you got like so wasted,
[00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:22.300]   you made out with that random guy,
[00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:23.700]   that was amazing.
[00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:26.220]   And yet they don't call you to be the person
[00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:27.120]   that you wanna be.
[00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:30.860]   They don't push you in the direction that you want to go.
[00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:33.180]   They're gonna be someone that knows you,
[00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:34.620]   'cause they know all the jacked up stuff,
[00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:35.860]   but they're like, dude, that's great,
[00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:38.540]   and they're gonna continue to influence you
[00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:40.420]   in a direction that's away from God.
[00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:42.940]   If they know God, but they don't really know you,
[00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:45.980]   they just know kind of what you let them know,
[00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:47.580]   and you manage your perception with them,
[00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:49.720]   you're not open about, here's where I'm really struggling,
[00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:51.820]   if you don't have people in your life that are like that,
[00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:54.100]   you essentially only have Facebook friends.
[00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:56.340]   Think about it, what's a Facebook friend?
[00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:58.100]   A Facebook friend is someone that I kind of manage
[00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:00.140]   the perception, if we're friends on Facebook,
[00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:03.860]   you kind of see whatever I want you to see, right?
[00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:05.600]   Whatever I wanna post, whatever I wanna talk about,
[00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:07.060]   I kind of like project whatever image
[00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:08.520]   that I want to to you.
[00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:10.940]   If you don't have people who know you,
[00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:14.900]   junk and all, scars and all, flaws and all,
[00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:16.540]   you just have Facebook friends.
[00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:17.660]   That's what you have.
[00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:20.540]   You just have people that you manage the perception
[00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:23.500]   that they have, and here's the tragedy in that.
[00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:25.540]   You'll never experience being loved
[00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:27.920]   because they don't actually know you.
[00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:30.160]   They don't know the you to love.
[00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:31.460]   The moment that you're willing to open up and say,
[00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:34.560]   this is really who I am, you allow for a real relationship
[00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:38.540]   and real intimacy and real love to take place.
[00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:40.540]   But as long as you hide behind, no, hey,
[00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:42.060]   I can't really share that, or I don't feel like
[00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:43.380]   I can be open and honest about that,
[00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:45.020]   you will never have the real relationships
[00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:47.220]   that God wants you to have, the real types of friendships
[00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:49.940]   that he wants you to have.
[00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:53.360]   It is being unknown that will make you feel alone.
[00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:58.140]   Some of you, the reason you feel so alone,
[00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:00.540]   and I hate this, and I could hammer one thing,
[00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:04.960]   it's because no one really knows you.
[00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:06.220]   You're afraid of what would happen
[00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:07.460]   if they actually got to know you.
[00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:10.700]   You're afraid of what they would think about you,
[00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:12.620]   and the tragedy is, here's what they're gonna think.
[00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:14.780]   You're actually honest with people in your life.
[00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:16.300]   I'm not saying everybody, you don't have to go on Facebook
[00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:17.540]   and be like, I gotta let everybody know
[00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:18.380]   about everything in my life.
[00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:21.060]   I'm saying having real relationships
[00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:23.020]   with other believers, other Christians.
[00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:26.900]   And if you're going, what are they gonna think about me?
[00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:28.700]   They're gonna think you're honest.
[00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:31.060]   They're gonna think you're a lot like them,
[00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:32.140]   only more honest.
[00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:35.960]   If they're a Christian.
[00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:38.780]   And as long as you hide behind, well,
[00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:40.860]   I can't really be open, you're not ever gonna have
[00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:42.260]   the real relationships that God wants,
[00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:44.340]   and you're gonna feel alone.
[00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:47.280]   And the God who's there doesn't want you to feel that.
[00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:48.820]   And one of the ways he's given you to fight that
[00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:52.060]   is by having real friendships, not just any friendships.
[00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:55.700]   The second myth, and probably the most widely held myth,
[00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:59.520]   is this, marriage could fix my loneliness.
[00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:03.100]   Marriage could fix my loneliness.
[00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:04.000]   Here's the truth.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.420]   Marriage will address your singleness, not your loneliness.
[00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:11.620]   Marriage can fix your singleness,
[00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:12.980]   and not even fix your singleness,
[00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:14.740]   as though it's something to be fixed.
[00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:17.960]   Marriage will address your singleness.
[00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:19.400]   It can't touch your loneliness.
[00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:21.360]   Those are two entirely different things.
[00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:22.720]   The only thing that getting married does,
[00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:23.880]   if you're someone who's lonely,
[00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:25.520]   and I hear this all the time from people who are like,
[00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:26.720]   I just feel such a loneliness,
[00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:28.400]   you'll never understand 'cause you're married,
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:31.240]   and I just feel like I need to get married to someone.
[00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:36.040]   They're assuming that marriage would fix my loneliness.
[00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:37.840]   Marriage will change your singleness.
[00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:39.320]   It will not address your loneliness,
[00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:43.780]   because loneliness is a heart issue that only God can fix.
[00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:46.460]   You can be married and lonely.
[00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:49.140]   You can be single and not lonely.
[00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:50.120]   You can be single and lonely.
[00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:51.880]   You can be married and not lonely.
[00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:54.560]   Those two things are not related together.
[00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:55.520]   And the God who's there says
[00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:57.760]   he does not want you to buy the lie
[00:20:57.760 --> 00:20:59.820]   that marriage is meant to be some solution
[00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:01.940]   to the heart issues that you have.
[00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:03.400]   Marriage will change your singleness status,
[00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:04.840]   but it will not change your heart,
[00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:06.400]   because loneliness is a heart issue.
[00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:09.840]   The reality is, marriage can add to loneliness.
[00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:12.320]   And so, listen to me very closely.
[00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:13.600]   After doing this for the last 10 years,
[00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:15.760]   I cannot tell you how heartbroken
[00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:19.480]   and how often my heart has broken for the people in my life
[00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:21.600]   who, because they were so lonely and they thought,
[00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:23.320]   you know what, I just need to get married,
[00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:24.520]   despite the fact that, you know,
[00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:25.640]   he's not the best candidate,
[00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:26.840]   but he's the one I'm with right now,
[00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:30.420]   so let's make it happen, and they end up heartbroken.
[00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:33.880]   And the pain of loneliness in marriage
[00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:37.160]   far exceeds the pain of loneliness and singleness.
[00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:40.700]   And please, please, please,
[00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:47.160]   believe me, it is better to be lonely today and single
[00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:52.140]   than to be lonely tomorrow in marriage.
[00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:53.480]   And if you allow that loneliness
[00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:55.400]   and that void inside of your heart
[00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:58.440]   to lead you to get married to someone
[00:21:58.440 --> 00:21:59.880]   out of an attempt to kind of feel that,
[00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:01.880]   not only will it not fix your loneliness,
[00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:04.840]   it'll amplify it if you marry the wrong person.
[00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:07.560]   It's not dissimilar to this.
[00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:10.280]   Anyone go to Costco here?
[00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:11.120]   Shop at Costco?
[00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:13.200]   Okay, that's kind of like a dad thing,
[00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:14.720]   so there's like five of us here.
[00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:18.160]   And, sensor market, we'll just go with that.
[00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:20.280]   So for me, in this stage of life,
[00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:21.920]   we go to Costco all the time, like once a week,
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:23.800]   it's like, hey, we got nothing to do, we're going to Costco,
[00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:25.400]   'cause it's kind of like going to the zoo with kids.
[00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:27.160]   It's like, we'll walk around and we'll eat the samples.
[00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:28.800]   What I've discovered about myself
[00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:34.200]   is that I can't go to Costco when I'm hungry,
[00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:36.520]   because I end up going around and buying things
[00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:38.040]   that I don't need to buy,
[00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:39.680]   because I'm just like, oh man,
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:42.320]   this apple bacon sausage, this is delicious.
[00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:43.680]   I didn't even know that I needed this, let's get it.
[00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:44.640]   And then I go home and I'm like,
[00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:46.360]   I didn't even come here to buy this.
[00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:47.560]   What did we end up with all this stuff
[00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:48.400]   that we ended up purchasing?
[00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:50.760]   Because I went shopping when I was hungry
[00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:51.600]   and it was a bad idea.
[00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:54.680]   In the same way it's bad to go shopping when you're hungry,
[00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:57.240]   it is a bad idea to go dating when you're desperate.
[00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:00.440]   Yeah, whoa, whoa.
[00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:02.280]   (audience laughing)
[00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:04.560]   Ooh, ooh, man.
[00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:07.720]   (audience applauding)
[00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:13.960]   I'm, that's not just some line, that is the truth.
[00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:18.120]   And if you are out there and you are thirsty
[00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:20.880]   and you're looking to satisfy something inside of you,
[00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:24.520]   I'm being totally serious.
[00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:26.280]   If there's a part of you that out of that desperation
[00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:28.000]   or hey man, I just feel like lonely on the inside,
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:28.820]   so I'm gonna go looking,
[00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:30.660]   you're gonna end up marrying someone
[00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:32.280]   that is not who God says.
[00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:34.480]   You're gonna end up marrying someone out of that desperation
[00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:36.980]   and attempting to cope with that pain of just,
[00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:39.200]   man, I want to not be single so bad,
[00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:41.960]   so I don't care if they don't exactly add up to God's word.
[00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:43.280]   I'm moving forward with this
[00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:45.200]   and you are gonna find yourself more lonely
[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:46.040]   than ever before.
[00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:51.200]   Marriage cannot fix your loneliness, but it can add to it.
[00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:54.360]   And I couldn't be more clear as a guy who's so committed
[00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:57.040]   to seeing amazing marriages break out all over this room.
[00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:59.600]   You guys, get married, make babies, make disciples,
[00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:00.480]   it's gonna be amazing.
[00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:02.880]   I hope it happens, I hope to be a part of it.
[00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:06.700]   And truly, there's lots of great options around this room.
[00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:08.680]   Lots of probably not great options too, so be careful.
[00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:12.200]   But point being, as someone who is so deeply committed
[00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:14.760]   to hoping all of you end up in amazing marriages someday,
[00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:16.240]   I want to be abundantly clear.
[00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:19.820]   You need to make sure that you address the heart issues
[00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:22.080]   inside of you before you go dating.
[00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:22.920]   Just like you need to make sure
[00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:25.040]   you address the hunger inside of you before you go shopping,
[00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:26.800]   you need to make sure that you address the heart issues
[00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:28.640]   so that you don't allow that desperation
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:30.040]   to push you to date someone.
[00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:33.020]   Who God says, this is not who you should be
[00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:34.080]   in relationship with.
[00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:38.680]   This is why the danger of marrying or dating someone
[00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:40.920]   who's not a follower of Jesus or not a believer,
[00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:43.240]   and by believer, I don't mean just they say
[00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:45.280]   they're a Christian, I mean they are following Jesus.
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:46.640]   This is why it's such a bad idea.
[00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:49.320]   Or date someone of a different religion,
[00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:50.360]   of a different faith.
[00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:55.280]   Because if you think loneliness being single,
[00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:57.240]   if you marry someone who doesn't share the faith
[00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:59.760]   that you have, you are headed for tremendous heartbreak
[00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:01.080]   and heartache.
[00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:02.700]   I mean, think about it, it's the most intimate part
[00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:03.540]   about you.
[00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:05.520]   Not only if you marry someone, if you're Christian
[00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:07.400]   and they're Jewish, not only does that challenge
[00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:09.120]   or set up lots of challenges down the road of like,
[00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:10.520]   oh, hey, the kids are coming to church now,
[00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:12.240]   then they're going to synagogue and what are we gonna do?
[00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:13.360]   Thought we were gonna raise them this way.
[00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:15.080]   It's not only logistically a nightmare,
[00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:18.640]   it is the most intimate part of you, your soul.
[00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:20.080]   And you're saying, hey, this thing that I share,
[00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:22.340]   this connection with God, this belief that I have,
[00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:24.360]   that he alone is the one that satisfies,
[00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:26.960]   that he died in my place, that I can know him,
[00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:28.100]   that I'm gonna live forever with him,
[00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:30.440]   that most intimate, incredible thing about you.
[00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:34.880]   You don't share with the person that you're married to?
[00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:36.400]   Think about how lonely that is.
[00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:39.120]   And if you know anyone who's in that spot,
[00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:42.000]   if they're honest, what happens is their faith either dies
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.960]   in that marriage or their marriage either dies.
[00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:47.520]   And either way, it leads to incredible loneliness.
[00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:49.040]   And the God who's there does not want you
[00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:50.100]   to experience that.
[00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:51.560]   Marriage will not fix your loneliness,
[00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:53.720]   it will address your singleness.
[00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:55.320]   But loneliness is a heart issue.
[00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:58.740]   And only Jesus can address that part of you.
[00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:01.640]   The best thing to do while you wait right now
[00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:04.420]   is to begin to work on the heart, the areas of your life
[00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:06.840]   where you're like, I feel like I'm looking for a solution
[00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:08.880]   in a man, I'm looking for a solution in a wife,
[00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:13.840]   I'm looking for a solution outside of Christ
[00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:17.640]   to fill some void, some loneliness that I have.
[00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:20.560]   And I think a person could fix it, and it's just a lie.
[00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:27.240]   The third and final myth is related to this idea,
[00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:30.560]   and it's this.
[00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:34.400]   Accepting Christ will fix my loneliness.
[00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:38.020]   Accepting Christ will fix my loneliness.
[00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:41.700]   Accepting Jesus as the one who came, God, became a man,
[00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:43.340]   he died in my place on the cross,
[00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:45.420]   he paid for all of my sin, everything that I've ever done
[00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:47.180]   in the past, everything I'll ever do in the future,
[00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:50.300]   everything that I've ever, every mistake I've ever made,
[00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:52.540]   it was all nailed to the cross, he paid for all of it.
[00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:54.860]   And then he died and he rose again, he came back alive,
[00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:57.420]   showing the payment was more than enough.
[00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:02.040]   Accepting that will not fix your loneliness.
[00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:03.600]   It is not accepting Christ that'll fix it,
[00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:05.240]   it is walking with Christ.
[00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:09.320]   That is the way that we battle loneliness.
[00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:12.640]   Accepting Christ doesn't battle loneliness,
[00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:15.140]   walking with him does.
[00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:16.640]   Any more than this.
[00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:18.200]   Three weeks ago, or two weeks ago, my wife and I,
[00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:22.040]   we joined a gym, thank you, and we're like,
[00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:23.760]   summer's here, this is gonna be great.
[00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:26.880]   Thank you, thank you, Mom, thank you for that support.
[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:27.720]   It's not my mom.
[00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:32.720]   Okay, hey, and two weeks ago, we joined a gym,
[00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:36.300]   and we haven't been back to exercise yet.
[00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:40.200]   But we have gone to the pool like eight times.
[00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:41.540]   It's just become our pool.
[00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:45.440]   And as crazy as it would be if I stood before you
[00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:47.300]   and I was like, hey, here's the deal,
[00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:49.160]   or if I went to that gym and I was like, look,
[00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:52.040]   we signed up to get in shape, to get fit,
[00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:54.740]   we were told that if we signed up with this gym,
[00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:56.060]   we would get in shape.
[00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:57.880]   And they asked us, well, how many times have you come
[00:27:57.880 --> 00:27:59.060]   and used the exercise equipment?
[00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:00.680]   None, but that is not the point.
[00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:03.640]   We signed up to get in shape.
[00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:05.860]   They would say, what is wrong with you?
[00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:09.960]   And in the same way that, hey, it's not access to a gym
[00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:12.680]   that leads someone to be in good physical fitness,
[00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:15.320]   it is taking advantage of that access
[00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:17.800]   and putting it into action that leads that.
[00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:20.080]   It is not access to Christ that alone
[00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:21.680]   is gonna solve your loneliness.
[00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:23.540]   It is taking advantage of that access
[00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:25.820]   and walking with Jesus on a consistent basis.
[00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:29.020]   You cannot express that, hey, if I just accept Christ,
[00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:30.480]   you'll spend eternity with God in heaven.
[00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:32.060]   That is what the Bible teaches,
[00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:33.020]   that if you have true faith,
[00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:35.060]   if you confess with the mouth that Jesus is Lord
[00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:36.840]   and you believe in your heart God raised from the dead,
[00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:38.040]   you shall be saved.
[00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:40.800]   But it is not just having access
[00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:42.380]   to that relationship with God
[00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:44.520]   that's gonna allow you to battle loneliness.
[00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:46.460]   It is taking advantage of that access
[00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:48.960]   and acting on it, walking with him.
[00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:50.420]   Any more than I could expect to be fit
[00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:54.800]   by having a membership, by having access to Christ.
[00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:56.620]   You cannot expect to battle that loneliness
[00:28:56.620 --> 00:28:58.380]   without walking with him consistently.
[00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:00.020]   So what do I mean by walking with him?
[00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:01.260]   Here's some few things that I laid out
[00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:02.180]   as it relates to walking.
[00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:04.600]   One of the first things, if you wanna walk with God
[00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:05.920]   or walking with Christ, looks like,
[00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:07.300]   this is not an exhaustive list,
[00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:09.860]   but it at least should step you in the right direction.
[00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:12.580]   It involves confessing and repenting of sin.
[00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:14.180]   Confessing and repenting of sin.
[00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:17.060]   You cannot walk with God without a willingness
[00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:18.780]   to confess and turn from,
[00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:20.940]   which is what repent means, from sin.
[00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:22.860]   The Bible says in Matthew chapter five, verse eight,
[00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:25.620]   "Blessed are the pure in heart,
[00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:27.820]   "those who seek to purify their heart,
[00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:30.320]   "those whose hearts have been purified,
[00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:32.580]   "for they shall see God."
[00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:38.140]   In other words, the less pure of heart that you are,
[00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:40.620]   the more that you allow sin to infiltrate
[00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:42.980]   and define your heart and sit and contaminate your heart,
[00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:44.940]   the more that sin is present in your life,
[00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:47.720]   it creates a barrier of intimacy with you and God.
[00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:50.740]   It was this barrier, sin, being introduced
[00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:52.700]   that ultimately was the reason that Adam and Eve
[00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:54.500]   and mankind was separated from God.
[00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:56.740]   Anytime sin is present, it creates a barrier
[00:29:56.740 --> 00:29:59.360]   with a perfect, holy God.
[00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:00.300]   So if you continue to sin,
[00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:02.700]   some of you, the reason you feel so far from God
[00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:06.500]   is because you're addicted to pornography.
[00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:08.420]   And every time you close your eyes, you see nudity.
[00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:11.980]   You don't see a chance to pray and reflect on God.
[00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:13.140]   Some of you are in a relationship
[00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:14.640]   and God has just been so clear.
[00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:16.620]   Like you have like an anxiety about it.
[00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:18.000]   You wake up in the middle of the night sweating
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:18.840]   because you're like,
[00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:19.980]   "I know that I'm not supposed to be in this,
[00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:23.740]   "but I'm afraid of what will happen if I break up here."
[00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:27.100]   And it's because of a unwillingness to be obedient to him,
[00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:29.780]   you feel far from him and he didn't move, you did.
[00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:34.460]   And the God who says, "Will you confess, repent of sin,
[00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:36.700]   "will you confess, acknowledge it to God,
[00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:38.700]   "acknowledge it to him?"
[00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:40.840]   And in doing so, you have a step in the right direction
[00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:42.820]   of intimacy being restored with God.
[00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:44.460]   Walking with him means just confessing,
[00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:47.020]   acknowledging all of us, we're not perfect people.
[00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:48.740]   We need a savior.
[00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:51.100]   And so I can confess and repent and turn from that.
[00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:53.140]   Second part of walking with him,
[00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:54.780]   the second thing I included here
[00:30:54.780 --> 00:30:58.280]   is that a constant communication with him or praying to him.
[00:30:58.280 --> 00:30:59.460]   What does it look like to walk with God?
[00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:00.660]   Like, "Hey, what is it gonna mean
[00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:02.320]   "if I actually wanna battle loneliness,
[00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:04.020]   "not accepting but walking with him?"
[00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:06.380]   It means I'm gonna confess and repent of sin.
[00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:08.300]   When I see it in my life, when people point it out
[00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:09.900]   in my life, it means I'm gonna be
[00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:12.340]   in constant communication with you, God.
[00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:15.240]   God doesn't want some relationship with you
[00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:17.300]   that you see him as either the bell service
[00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:20.740]   or as the 911 call, but as a constant walkie-talkie,
[00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:22.220]   that he wants a relationship.
[00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:33.540]   Verse seven says, "Cast all of your cares on God
[00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:34.460]   "because he cares for you."
[00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:36.660]   I want you to think about this verse.
[00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:39.660]   Everything you care about, he wants you to bring that to him.
[00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:43.420]   Like, not just like, "Hey, God, I'm praying today
[00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:44.660]   "and thank you for this food
[00:31:44.780 --> 00:31:47.860]   "and I wanna pray for all the orphans in Africa
[00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:50.700]   "and I wanna pray for sick Aunt Betty."
[00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:53.220]   Everything you care about, your anxiety about work,
[00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:54.620]   your concern about your friend,
[00:31:54.620 --> 00:31:56.700]   your anxiety about what your boss may think of you,
[00:31:56.700 --> 00:31:58.280]   the presentation you have coming up,
[00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:01.100]   you hope that you get green lights on the way to work.
[00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:02.060]   I don't know if you just pray for that or not,
[00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:03.980]   but I know that he wants you to pray,
[00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:06.860]   and as you do so, he'll align your will to his.
[00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:09.220]   But he doesn't want you to hide back and say,
[00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:11.120]   "I can only bring things to him
[00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:13.920]   "that I can read a verse exactly for this in here
[00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:15.340]   "of what exactly I'm gonna pray for."
[00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:18.940]   He wants a relationship where you bring everything to him.
[00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:20.640]   God, I'm feeling lonely right now.
[00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:23.460]   God, I just wanna be married.
[00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:26.540]   I don't know how I'm gonna make ends meet financially.
[00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:28.420]   My roommate's moving out and I don't have an option
[00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:31.340]   of where I'm gonna live, and I'm anxious about it.
[00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:32.620]   Will you provide a roommate for me?
[00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:33.820]   Will you help me not be anxious?
[00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:36.060]   Everything that you feel, I mean, think about that verse.
[00:32:36.060 --> 00:32:37.460]   Some of you, you need to hear this
[00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:38.780]   more than anything else I'm gonna say,
[00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:40.600]   'cause anxiety is a part of your story,
[00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:42.820]   it's a part of your present.
[00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:46.680]   And God says, "I care about everything you care about."
[00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:48.200]   That's what the verse says.
[00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:50.200]   Cast everything, I think they have it on the screens,
[00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:55.080]   cast all of your anxieties on him because he cares for you.
[00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:58.600]   Or your translation has, cast all of your cares on him
[00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:00.180]   because he cares for you.
[00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:02.200]   Everything you care about, he cares about,
[00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:03.080]   because he cares about you,
[00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:05.360]   and he wants you to bring those things to him.
[00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:08.080]   Constant communication, not as a bellhop
[00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:10.480]   or as a room service, like, "Hey, can I get this
[00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:13.360]   "one thing here or 911 only when I'm afraid
[00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:14.660]   "is she pregnant that I'm praying?"
[00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:17.420]   But a constant communication to God.
[00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:18.260]   He wants to have with you.
[00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:20.220]   The third thing as it relates to just walking with him,
[00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:22.600]   and you'll be amazed what happens whenever you do that.
[00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:24.060]   Whenever you begin to actually pray with him,
[00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:26.640]   your awareness, it's like my awareness of his nearness
[00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:30.240]   and his presence over my life is raised.
[00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:33.660]   It's like my awareness of how much he cares about me
[00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:35.320]   and he cares about the things and my circumstances
[00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:37.620]   is raised just by praying more.
[00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:39.220]   God, will you help me right now?
[00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:40.380]   I'm about to walk up here and share,
[00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:41.260]   will you help me to be clear?
[00:33:41.260 --> 00:33:42.940]   Will you help me to get over what people think about me?
[00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:43.780]   Will you help me?
[00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:45.820]   Whatever those things are in your life,
[00:33:45.820 --> 00:33:47.940]   he wants you to bring them to him.
[00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:48.780]   The third thing,
[00:33:48.780 --> 00:33:53.580]   the component of walking with Christ
[00:33:53.580 --> 00:33:55.180]   involves trusting and obeying.
[00:33:55.180 --> 00:33:58.340]   I'm gonna trust you and obey.
[00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:02.980]   I'm gonna follow what your word says in here.
[00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:05.100]   I'm gonna walk by faith is another way of saying that.
[00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:06.460]   I'm gonna trust what you say is right,
[00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:08.260]   and I'm gonna do it.
[00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:10.020]   Romans chapter 12 verse two says,
[00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:13.020]   do not conform to the patterns of this world.
[00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:14.060]   The behavior of the world,
[00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:16.220]   don't conform to what everybody else is doing out there.
[00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:17.620]   If everybody's doing it,
[00:34:17.620 --> 00:34:19.900]   it's probably not the behavior that should mark you.
[00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:22.060]   If it's the behavior or the way of thinking
[00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:23.140]   that the world has,
[00:34:23.140 --> 00:34:25.840]   if it's like this is the common way that people think today,
[00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:28.460]   it's probably not the right one for you.
[00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:30.780]   Do not conform to the pattern or the ways of this world,
[00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:32.940]   but be transformed by the renewing of your mind.
[00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:35.520]   That's reading God's word
[00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:38.480]   and allowing the truth of what it says to transform you,
[00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:41.320]   not be conformed into what the world tells you should be.
[00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:45.920]   Then you will be able to test when you know
[00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:49.720]   what God's will is, which is what the Bible is.
[00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:50.560]   When you know what it is,
[00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:51.720]   then you'll be able to put it to the test.
[00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:53.560]   When you know what he says about sex,
[00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:55.600]   when you know what he says about,
[00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:56.800]   hey, flee sexual morality,
[00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:58.480]   don't allow that to be a part of your relationship,
[00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:00.340]   hey, that is a thing safe for marriage.
[00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:01.360]   Whenever you actually do that,
[00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:02.760]   and you're like, dude, people actually do that,
[00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:03.960]   and you're like, hey, you know what, I'm gonna try it.
[00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:04.800]   Whenever you do it,
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:08.040]   the Bible says, then you'll be able to put it to the test,
[00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:11.080]   and you will approve what God's will is,
[00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:14.720]   as good, pleasing, and perfect will.
[00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:16.360]   It's like whenever you begin to put it to the test,
[00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:18.560]   you're like, oh, well, I guess I'll really try this.
[00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:20.180]   It's as though the Bible's saying, hey, test me.
[00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:21.400]   You're not gonna end up being like,
[00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:22.840]   gosh, I got buyer's remorse here.
[00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:25.840]   I cannot believe I dated the way God says to date.
[00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:27.840]   I really regret my decision there.
[00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:29.880]   No one does it, Paul says.
[00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:31.240]   You begin to walk according to the ways
[00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:32.300]   that God says to walk,
[00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:35.120]   as it relates to your relationship with other people,
[00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:36.600]   as it relates to the way you use your time,
[00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:39.520]   your money, your job, the way that you think.
[00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:42.380]   Alcohol, sexuality, he's like, hey, do what I say.
[00:35:42.380 --> 00:35:43.420]   Put it to the test.
[00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:46.220]   You have a money-back guarantee.
[00:35:46.220 --> 00:35:48.460]   It works, and you will find, Paul says,
[00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:50.380]   you'll be able to test it, and you will approve it,
[00:35:50.380 --> 00:35:52.880]   because it is good, pleasing, and perfect.
[00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:54.320]   And you know what happens whenever that happens?
[00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:55.160]   When you begin to actually say,
[00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:57.160]   like, man, I'm gonna begin to take steps,
[00:35:57.160 --> 00:35:58.340]   and I'm gonna trust you, God.
[00:35:58.340 --> 00:36:01.000]   This is how you think I should handle this situation.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.760]   I'm gonna trust you, and I'm gonna actually do it.
[00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:05.680]   Your faith will begin to grow.
[00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:07.000]   Faith is like a muscle.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:11.580]   The more that you exercise it, the stronger it gets.
[00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:14.600]   And the same, and the inverse is true.
[00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:17.600]   The less that you exercise it, the weaker it gets.
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:18.480]   A muscle atrophies.
[00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:20.160]   If you don't use it, it's like, that's going away.
[00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:22.360]   If you use it, it's gonna get stronger and stronger,
[00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:23.180]   and grow.
[00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:24.220]   This is how faith works.
[00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:25.820]   This is why some people can walk through
[00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:28.040]   the valley of the shadow of the most painful things,
[00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:31.800]   and they're like, unshakably fixed on God.
[00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:32.840]   Because over their life, they've said,
[00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:34.380]   I'm gonna trust you, and I've seen him show up
[00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:36.160]   over and over, I've seen his ways.
[00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:37.960]   They're higher than my ways, but they're better,
[00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:38.800]   and I can trust him.
[00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:40.240]   And then there's other people,
[00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:45.400]   who slowly by slowly, they begin to step away from God.
[00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:47.420]   Maybe they step into some type of sexual relationship
[00:36:47.420 --> 00:36:48.260]   they shouldn't be a part of.
[00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:49.720]   Maybe they step through, maybe they just step through
[00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:51.680]   apathy, they're like, hey, dude, I'm gonna get back
[00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:53.840]   to being serious about my faith when I'm in my 30s,
[00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:56.680]   and kind of like, become more of an adult.
[00:36:56.680 --> 00:36:58.120]   I'll get serious about that then,
[00:36:58.120 --> 00:36:59.680]   'cause I'm really working on my career.
[00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:01.840]   And they just slowly begin to step away from God.
[00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:04.280]   And it's not overnight, like, hey, I'm outta here, deuces.
[00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:05.520]   They just drift away.
[00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:08.080]   And they wake up one day, and they're like,
[00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:10.380]   I don't even know if this whole thing is true.
[00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:15.840]   Because their faith was never exercised,
[00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:18.340]   and it weakened, just like a muscle.
[00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:21.200]   If you haven't used your legs since high school,
[00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:24.640]   men, which many of you haven't in terms of exercising,
[00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:27.220]   they're going to just atrophy and atrophy away.
[00:37:27.220 --> 00:37:29.960]   This is how faith works.
[00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:34.300]   If you don't use it, you don't lose it in an internal sense,
[00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:37.680]   but it's not growing, it weakens over time.
[00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:39.800]   And the Bible says, if you walk with God,
[00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:41.800]   your faith, begin to trust him,
[00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:44.600]   and it will grow your trust every single time.
[00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:46.080]   Become more convinced, his way is true,
[00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:47.600]   his way is true, I can trust him.
[00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:50.440]   So walking with God includes confessing and repenting,
[00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:52.440]   praying constantly, or constant communication,
[00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:54.160]   and trusting and obeying him.
[00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:55.680]   Here's what, let me be very practical,
[00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:58.000]   'cause we're about to wrap it up.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:01.160]   If you're in the room, or you're listening right now,
[00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:04.060]   and you wanna know, what do I do when I'm lonely?
[00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:06.320]   Like in that moment when it just kind of reaches
[00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:09.400]   and washes over me, and I feel alone,
[00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:11.160]   I feel abandoned, I feel like no one is there,
[00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:13.520]   what do I do, very specifically in that moment?
[00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:19.220]   You go to God, and you go to God's people.
[00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:26.140]   You go to God in prayer, and you say, God, I feel alone.
[00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:30.260]   I feel like there's no one who cares about me.
[00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:32.360]   I don't even feel like you're near to me.
[00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:35.540]   I don't even know that praying to you will help me.
[00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:37.480]   You're honest, and you go to him.
[00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:41.680]   And you cry out to him, and you call out to God's people.
[00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:43.600]   You reach out to other believers in your life,
[00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:46.160]   this is why we hammer having a community group,
[00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:47.400]   in your life that can care for you,
[00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:49.680]   that in the midst of walking through loneliness,
[00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:52.200]   you can reach out and say, I feel lonely right now.
[00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:54.400]   I'm battling with lies, and I need someone,
[00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:55.880]   will you pray for me?
[00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:58.120]   Will you come, just, can we hang out, can we talk,
[00:38:58.120 --> 00:38:59.040]   can we go on a walk right now?
[00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:01.080]   I need someone in my life, and someone that you can be
[00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:02.540]   in their life, for in those moments
[00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:05.960]   where they feel loneliness grabbing ahold of their heart,
[00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:10.200]   you reach out to God's people, and to God.
[00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:14.120]   You go to him in prayer, and you reach out to his people.
[00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:16.720]   This is the way that we battle against loneliness.
[00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:19.380]   And the reason I've intentionally said battle,
[00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:22.820]   and not fix loneliness, is because in this life,
[00:39:22.820 --> 00:39:24.880]   in this world, because of sin entering,
[00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:27.680]   there's a loneliness that can be of a good thing,
[00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:29.960]   because it's a reminder of the fact
[00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:33.680]   that we have been separated from God.
[00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:35.200]   And if you're a Christian, you have been restored,
[00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:36.760]   and are being reconciled to him,
[00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:38.720]   but ultimately, it's a reminder for any of us,
[00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:42.120]   for all of us, that one day, that loneliness,
[00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:43.480]   that pain will be no more.
[00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:46.280]   It is going away, for those of you who are Christians.
[00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:48.540]   And there's coming a day where you will be home,
[00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:50.040]   and that loneliness, that sometimes,
[00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:52.800]   the reason it feels like I'm homesick,
[00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:54.380]   is because you're homesick.
[00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:57.520]   And there's gonna come a day in eternity
[00:39:57.520 --> 00:39:59.920]   where you're going home, and it will be no more.
[00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:03.960]   For others of you, you've never had a moment
[00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:05.920]   where you've actually trusted in Jesus.
[00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:13.400]   And the scary thing is that, apart from you having Christ
[00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:16.740]   as the payment for your sins,
[00:40:18.260 --> 00:40:21.200]   you're gonna spend eternity alone,
[00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:24.200]   away from God, separated fully and finally from him.
[00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:25.440]   And he doesn't want you to.
[00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:26.760]   He's crazy in love with you.
[00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:29.600]   He made that abundantly clear 2,000 years ago
[00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:34.600]   when he reset the calendar, and he died in your place.
[00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:37.420]   The reason I say eternally alone is,
[00:40:37.420 --> 00:40:38.920]   it's been described that hell
[00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:43.460]   is being totally separated and cut off.
[00:40:43.460 --> 00:40:44.680]   It's totally separated and cut off.
[00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:47.600]   I mean, in some ways, hell is just eternal loneliness.
[00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:48.440]   Think about it.
[00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:49.980]   Every good and perfect gift, James chapter one says,
[00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:51.700]   comes from the father of lights, who above.
[00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:53.480]   Basically, he's saying God.
[00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:55.940]   Every good and perfect thing comes from God.
[00:40:55.940 --> 00:40:58.580]   Every good thing comes from him.
[00:40:58.580 --> 00:41:00.640]   If you are cut off, then hell is a separation from God.
[00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:01.760]   There's nothing good there.
[00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:03.340]   You're not taking shots of Patron
[00:41:03.340 --> 00:41:04.820]   with your buddy in the devil.
[00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:05.980]   You're not hanging out with friends,
[00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:07.180]   like, kind of like, oh, this is so good,
[00:41:07.180 --> 00:41:09.100]   let's rehash that one time at the frat party.
[00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:10.020]   You're not doing any of that.
[00:41:10.020 --> 00:41:11.940]   You are cut off from humanity.
[00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:13.040]   You're cut off from God.
[00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:14.340]   You're cut off from relationships,
[00:41:14.340 --> 00:41:16.660]   'cause those are good things.
[00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:17.920]   You are totally separated,
[00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:23.180]   eternally lonely, and you don't have to be,
[00:41:23.180 --> 00:41:26.500]   because Jesus came to this earth
[00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:30.340]   and he went through eternal loneliness in your place
[00:41:30.340 --> 00:41:32.280]   so that you wouldn't have to be eternally lonely.
[00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:33.380]   He went through eternal loneliness.
[00:41:33.380 --> 00:41:34.520]   What do I mean by that?
[00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:35.400]   Maybe you've heard this before.
[00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:36.320]   You don't understand.
[00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:37.620]   When Jesus died on the cross,
[00:41:37.620 --> 00:41:40.020]   it wasn't just the crucifixion and nails were painful
[00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:42.240]   and death sucks.
[00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:44.060]   It wasn't just like, oh, that had to be a rough day.
[00:41:44.060 --> 00:41:47.580]   It was that plus the fact that he was separated
[00:41:47.580 --> 00:41:49.140]   from his Father.
[00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:51.400]   God the Father was separated from Christ the Son,
[00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:53.140]   and it says that Jesus even cried out.
[00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:55.300]   It was though Jesus felt abandoned,
[00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:57.300]   because the weight of all that sin
[00:41:57.300 --> 00:41:58.580]   pushed him away from the Father.
[00:41:58.580 --> 00:42:00.220]   He took all of the sin of humanity
[00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:01.580]   and it created separation
[00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:04.940]   between the Son and the Father.
[00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:07.860]   In Matthew chapter 27, he's on the cross,
[00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:09.540]   and one of his last statements on the cross,
[00:42:09.540 --> 00:42:12.060]   he cries out and he's experiencing separation
[00:42:12.060 --> 00:42:14.300]   from his Father like he has never felt before,
[00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:16.700]   and he quotes Psalm 22, and he says,
[00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:20.600]   "My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?"
[00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:26.460]   And the answer was that he abandoned him
[00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:28.860]   and allowed him to experience eternal loneliness
[00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:31.260]   as he was crucified on that cross
[00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:33.060]   so that you wouldn't have to forever,
[00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:36.780]   because he loves you.
[00:42:36.780 --> 00:42:38.940]   And that ache in your heart,
[00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:41.420]   if there's anything good about loneliness,
[00:42:41.420 --> 00:42:44.500]   is that it points us and reminds us that you're not home.
[00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:46.820]   There's something that no human can satisfy,
[00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:49.820]   no substance can satisfy, no money can satisfy,
[00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:50.900]   and if you don't believe that,
[00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:52.660]   live long enough and you'll see it.
[00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:56.540]   And no matter how long you live,
[00:42:56.540 --> 00:42:57.800]   one day you will see it,
[00:42:57.800 --> 00:43:03.380]   either as you experience eternal satisfaction
[00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:06.180]   'cause you're home, or eternal regret
[00:43:06.180 --> 00:43:08.220]   because you're not and you never will be.
[00:43:09.660 --> 00:43:11.460]   The solution for loneliness is not more friends,
[00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:12.980]   it's the right friends.
[00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:15.080]   Marriage cannot fix your loneliness.
[00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:17.340]   Only Jesus can do that,
[00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:19.500]   and it is walking with him every single day
[00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:24.120]   as a solution for how we fight and battle loneliness.
[00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:30.260]   I think when I think about just feeling alone,
[00:43:30.260 --> 00:43:34.600]   I'm reminded of times in my life
[00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:35.440]   where I just felt like,
[00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:39.020]   dude, nobody is actually following God.
[00:43:39.940 --> 00:43:42.020]   Like no one's actually trying to live this way,
[00:43:42.020 --> 00:43:43.140]   there's so few people.
[00:43:43.140 --> 00:43:44.820]   Like God, the world is so crazy,
[00:43:44.820 --> 00:43:46.940]   it's going to hell in a handbasket, literally,
[00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:48.700]   and the number of people that are like,
[00:43:48.700 --> 00:43:49.760]   hey, I'm all in with Jesus,
[00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:51.220]   I wanna seek to do his will,
[00:43:51.220 --> 00:43:52.620]   I wanna seek to walk with him,
[00:43:52.620 --> 00:43:54.520]   though none go with me, I will follow.
[00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:57.180]   It's like there's just no people like that.
[00:43:57.180 --> 00:43:58.540]   Like I remember at different stages,
[00:43:58.540 --> 00:43:59.980]   I remember sitting down with pastors being like,
[00:43:59.980 --> 00:44:01.460]   dude, I just feel like,
[00:44:01.460 --> 00:44:03.260]   if this is what God wants,
[00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:05.500]   there's like 20 Christians on the planet,
[00:44:05.500 --> 00:44:08.260]   and this is what I guess my lot is,
[00:44:08.260 --> 00:44:10.860]   I'm gonna have to be friends with these homeschool kids
[00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:11.700]   that smell funny,
[00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:14.980]   and there's not a single attractive Christian girl anywhere,
[00:44:14.980 --> 00:44:17.860]   and so I guess I gotta marry Mother Teresa and woo a nun,
[00:44:17.860 --> 00:44:19.640]   and is that what God has for me?
[00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:22.060]   And more than that,
[00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:24.620]   just like, it just feels alone.
[00:44:24.620 --> 00:44:26.580]   Like no one's actually trying to date this way,
[00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:27.780]   trying to live this way.
[00:44:27.780 --> 00:44:31.300]   And it's just not true.
[00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:33.380]   And so if you're here tonight,
[00:44:33.380 --> 00:44:35.660]   and you are, someone who's ever felt that,
[00:44:35.660 --> 00:44:37.060]   or wondered that, or thought that before,
[00:44:37.060 --> 00:44:38.580]   I want you to know it's just not true.
[00:44:38.580 --> 00:44:41.480]   In fact, all over, not just in this place,
[00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:43.520]   all over even right now, listening, wherever you are,
[00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:46.060]   there's people, and men and women gathered together
[00:44:46.060 --> 00:44:48.300]   who are worshiping in different locations,
[00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:49.740]   and they share the same faith as you,
[00:44:49.740 --> 00:44:52.460]   the same kindred spirit if you're a follower of Jesus,
[00:44:52.460 --> 00:44:55.160]   and they're seeking to live their lives, not perfectly,
[00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:57.940]   but with the one true God,
[00:44:57.940 --> 00:44:59.820]   and in relationship with his people.
[00:44:59.820 --> 00:45:02.540]   And they're not just in Dallas, Texas,
[00:45:02.540 --> 00:45:03.860]   they're over there in Fort Worth, Texas,
[00:45:03.860 --> 00:45:05.380]   like here's gatherings that are taking place right now,
[00:45:05.380 --> 00:45:06.220]   just so you don't,
[00:45:06.220 --> 00:45:07.260]   you're like, dude, it's just alone.
[00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:09.100]   Here's in Fort Worth, Texas,
[00:45:09.100 --> 00:45:11.260]   here's in Northwest Arkansas, in Fayetteville,
[00:45:11.260 --> 00:45:13.100]   these are gatherings of other ports and locations
[00:45:13.100 --> 00:45:13.940]   that are taking place.
[00:45:13.940 --> 00:45:15.740]   This is Houston, you can go back to Houston,
[00:45:15.740 --> 00:45:18.820]   okay or not, there we go.
[00:45:18.820 --> 00:45:20.940]   Houston, Texas, gathering in the chapel,
[00:45:20.940 --> 00:45:23.380]   H-Town, we know you, that's my hood, go to Tulsa,
[00:45:23.380 --> 00:45:26.700]   Tulsa, go to the next one, Billy,
[00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:29.100]   El Paso, Texas, where people are gathering together,
[00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:31.160]   get excited, El Porche, next one,
[00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:33.480]   the Woodlands, Texas,
[00:45:35.860 --> 00:45:37.180]   Phoenix, Arizona,
[00:45:37.180 --> 00:45:39.760]   Austin, Texas,
[00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:43.060]   Cincinnati, Ohio, Cedar Rapids, Iowa,
[00:45:43.060 --> 00:45:44.300]   Corsicana, Nashville, Tennessee,
[00:45:44.300 --> 00:45:45.580]   there's four other different places
[00:45:45.580 --> 00:45:47.140]   that we didn't even capture up there,
[00:45:47.140 --> 00:45:48.900]   and I just want you to know you're not alone,
[00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:50.660]   and here's the deal,
[00:45:50.660 --> 00:45:52.300]   the way that God is working in our world
[00:45:52.300 --> 00:45:54.460]   is far beyond anything with the different locations
[00:45:54.460 --> 00:45:56.180]   of young adults gathered, listening right now,
[00:45:56.180 --> 00:45:57.660]   listening all over the country,
[00:45:57.660 --> 00:45:59.500]   it far exceeds everything.
[00:45:59.500 --> 00:46:00.900]   That he's got people, he's got his people
[00:46:00.900 --> 00:46:02.860]   all over the place, men and women, just like you,
[00:46:02.860 --> 00:46:04.820]   who are seeking to follow him imperfectly,
[00:46:04.820 --> 00:46:06.200]   but they're striving that, hey, I wanna be
[00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:08.540]   who God calls me to be, I wanna live the abundant life
[00:46:08.540 --> 00:46:10.780]   and experience eternal life forever, you are not alone.
[00:46:10.780 --> 00:46:12.900]   He's got men and women right now that are praying to him
[00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:16.160]   in Mandarin Chinese, in Farsi, in French, in Spanish,
[00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:19.380]   his people are everywhere, you are not alone,
[00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:23.060]   and the God who's there doesn't want you to feel alone
[00:46:23.060 --> 00:46:26.340]   and to experience loneliness
[00:46:26.340 --> 00:46:29.900]   in this life or in the next,
[00:46:29.900 --> 00:46:32.980]   and he has made clear how to battle in this one
[00:46:34.300 --> 00:46:36.860]   and how he has already won the battle for the next.
[00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:40.860]   The choice is yours and mine to accept it.
[00:46:40.860 --> 00:46:42.580]   Let me pray.
[00:46:42.580 --> 00:46:49.660]   Father, I pray for every lonely heart right now in this room
[00:46:49.660 --> 00:46:58.440]   that you who know them, who know everything about them,
[00:46:58.440 --> 00:47:00.340]   you know the circumstances they feel,
[00:47:00.340 --> 00:47:01.980]   the anxieties that weigh on them,
[00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:05.160]   the future that's in store for them,
[00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:07.800]   the hairs on their head, you know the number of them,
[00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:13.080]   that you would break through the walls of loneliness now,
[00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:16.620]   you would be bigger than the pain of loneliness now,
[00:47:16.620 --> 00:47:20.280]   you would move them to step in the direction
[00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:22.200]   of your people tonight,
[00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:27.280]   and you would help us to fight,
[00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:29.220]   and you would win the battle for loneliness
[00:47:29.220 --> 00:47:32.280]   in our heart tomorrow and day by day.
[00:47:32.280 --> 00:47:33.200]   I pray for anyone in this room
[00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:35.760]   who's never put their faith in Christ,
[00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:36.720]   tonight would be their night,
[00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:39.580]   that they would know that there's a way that you have made
[00:47:39.580 --> 00:47:42.280]   so that they don't have to be eternally lonely forever,
[00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:45.480]   because you faced an eternal loneliness
[00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:47.040]   and abandonment for us.
[00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:52.560]   Thank you, God, we are unworthy of your love,
[00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:55.060]   of your sacrifice.
[00:47:55.060 --> 00:47:56.760]   I pray that anyone who's never had a moment
[00:47:56.760 --> 00:47:59.200]   where they've trusted, tonight would be their night,
[00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:03.720]   and they would experience victory and loneliness
[00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:06.200]   in this life and forever in the life to come.
[00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:07.960]   We worship you now in song, amen.
[00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:17.960]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
