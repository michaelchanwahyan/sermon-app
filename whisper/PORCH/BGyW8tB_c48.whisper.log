[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.660]   (phone ringing)
[00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:06.820]   - You have seven unheard messages.
[00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:08.500]   - Hey, sorry I haven't texted.
[00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.540]   I'm just not really sure what I'm feeling right now.
[00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.020]   - Hey, yo Danny!
[00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:14.700]   Where you at, bro?
[00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.540]   I'll see you soon, all right?
[00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:18.660]   - Hey, so I have moved on,
[00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.020]   but I feel like the Lord keeps putting me back
[00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.260]   on my heart for a reason.
[00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:22.940]   So please call me back.
[00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.300]   - Hey, bro, hey, I know you're going through it right now,
[00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.180]   but listen, I found another girl at the farmer's market.
[00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.100]   Now, she's not a farmer, but she is on the market, okay?
[00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.540]   So hit me back, love you, bro.
[00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.300]   - No, I'm sure this is the right number,
[00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.220]   but last night was a mistake.
[00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.140]   I was just hoping we could keep that between us.
[00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.340]   - Hey, just wanted to say,
[00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.140]   I don't think I can make it tonight.
[00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.420]   Yeah, I've just been thinking about us a lot lately,
[00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.880]   and we need to talk.
[00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:56.500]   - All right, all right, Porch, how we doing tonight?
[00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:57.620]   Great to see you.
[00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.020]   If it's your first time, welcome in the room.
[00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.420]   We're really glad you're here.
[00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.820]   If you've been here before, welcome back.
[00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.140]   We never want to forget about you,
[00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.120]   and then we never want to forget about everybody
[00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.820]   that is tuning in online.
[00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.880]   Well, y'all do a great job of helping me say hello
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.780]   to everybody that is tuning in with us here tonight.
[00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:15.960]   Amazing.
[00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.700]   Special shout out to all of our Porch Live locations,
[00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.700]   particularly Porch Live Springfield,
[00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.180]   Porch Live Midland, and Porch Live Boise.
[00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.260]   Got some Midland homies in the front.
[00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:29.740]   Well, when I was in college,
[00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.100]   I was convinced that I wanted to be an accounting major,
[00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.740]   not because I loved a really good balance sheet,
[00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.580]   but because it's what everybody was doing.
[00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.500]   You see, in the school that I went to,
[00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.580]   we had a program where over the course of five years,
[00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.100]   you could pick up not only your bachelor's degree,
[00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.340]   but also your master's degree,
[00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.080]   which in my mind's eye seemed like a really great play
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.540]   to run because for me,
[00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.980]   it meant that I get to add a few more letters to my resume,
[00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.620]   and I also get to spend another year with the boys.
[00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.140]   And so I decided, you know what,
[00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.060]   this is what I'm going to do.
[00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.180]   I don't necessarily need to consider anything else.
[00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.780]   So I didn't think about what are my natural aptitudes?
[00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.560]   I didn't process, well, what are my career ambitions?
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.900]   Or what's the coursework actually look like?
[00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:12.700]   What are the degree tracks are there?
[00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.660]   I just blindly signed up and began to pursue the curriculum
[00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:17.480]   that was set for me.
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.340]   And so I went through my freshman year.
[00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.820]   I went through my sophomore year.
[00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.500]   I got through my junior year,
[00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.520]   and then the imperceivable happened.
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.320]   I didn't get into the program,
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.020]   which was devastating to me
[00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.200]   because I had been planning on this.
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.720]   Like I had been hoping with all of my future in mind
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.560]   that this is what I was going to get to do.
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.160]   And yet in a moment,
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.880]   all of my hopes and my dreams and my ambitions
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.320]   were dashed on the rocks of assets, equal liabilities,
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.720]   plus stockholders equity.
[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.320]   You know, I'd been counting on this, no pun intended.
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.260]   And yet in a moment,
[00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.520]   it felt like all of my peers were racing forward.
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.720]   And yet instead for me, I was stuck behind.
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.760]   And so facing what felt like an existential crisis
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.040]   that was way too early in my young life,
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.720]   I went and I met with a school counselor.
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.000]   And as I sat with him,
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   he said something that has stuck with me ever since.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.300]   He said, "Kylin, don't worry.
[00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:17.600]   The conversation we're having, everybody's having.
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.140]   We're just having this conversation out loud.
[00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.460]   And then he proceeded to help me consider
[00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:27.460]   the things that I hadn't considered.
[00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:28.620]   He helped me to realize,
[00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.420]   "Hey man, you kind of suck at math.
[00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.680]   You know, you don't really love accounting
[00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.220]   and you have no business as a result
[00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.400]   ever balancing anybody's books.
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.100]   And why do I tell you that?
[00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:44.100]   Because tonight I want to have a conversation with you
[00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.480]   out loud that everybody, many young adults
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.020]   across the nation and many in this room as well
[00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.980]   are processing, but they're processing in silence.
[00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.940]   I want to talk to you about a question
[00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.420]   that many people ask themselves
[00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:00.660]   within their young adult years.
[00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.100]   I want to process with you, why am I still single?
[00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.420]   I want to help you, not me, some of you.
[00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.740]   And so I want to help you really consider
[00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:17.120]   what is it then that has put me in this situation?
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.060]   Like you're facing what I felt in a similar way,
[00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.500]   but probably so much greater.
[00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.540]   You're dealing with an existential crisis.
[00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:24.660]   You look at your life and you're like,
[00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.340]   "This isn't what I planned.
[00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.980]   I'm not supposed to still be here.
[00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:29.540]   Everyone else is racing forward
[00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:33.020]   and yet I am stuck someplace I never thought I would be.
[00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.380]   I don't understand why you're complicating my life.
[00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:36.300]   I'm a good person.
[00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:37.320]   That's a good thing to want.
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:38.880]   Why can't I have it?"
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.320]   So what I want to do is I want to help you understand
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:48.320]   a few practicals for why this may be a season
[00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.800]   in your life that you,
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.880]   why this may be a season you're stuck in
[00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.360]   that you don't want to be a part of.
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.160]   And yet before we talk about the practicals,
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.600]   what we need to do is we need to talk about
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.600]   the fundamentals.
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.840]   You need to understand that namely,
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.320]   that singleness is not a second rate state of being.
[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.680]   It's not a second rate state of being.
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.600]   Several weeks ago, we actually preached here at Watermark.
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.160]   I preached here at Watermark through this idea
[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.280]   of why singleness is worth embracing.
[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:17.760]   I'd encourage you to go listen to it
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.440]   'cause it's going to help unpack
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.620]   the fundamental goodness of singleness.
[00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.400]   But just to catch you up really briefly,
[00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.800]   what you need to know is that in our culture,
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.040]   both within our church and in our world,
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.480]   we have a tendency to look at singleness
[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:34.200]   and think it is inferior in comparison to marriage.
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:38.360]   That it's JV in comparison to the marriage varsity.
[00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.940]   That it's a second class sort of state.
[00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:45.120]   That it's the sort of situation
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.120]   where all the marriages are flying first class
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.920]   while all the singles are sitting in coach.
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.000]   But that's not what we understand from the scripture.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.540]   What Paul actually unpacks for us
[00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:55.560]   in 1 Corinthians chapter seven,
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:56.400]   which is where we're going to be
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:57.680]   over the course of the evening,
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.400]   as well as a variety of different passages.
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.360]   So mostly, track with the screen.
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.000]   He says this, 1 Corinthians 7, six through nine.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.320]   "Now as a concession and not a command, I say this.
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.520]   "I wish that all were as I myself am.
[00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:14.460]   "But each has his own gift from God,
[00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:16.460]   "one of one kind, one of another,
[00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:17.520]   "to the unmarried and the widows,
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:20.420]   "I say, hey, it's good for them to remain single as I am.
[00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:22.580]   "But if they cannot exercise self-control,
[00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:26.100]   "they should marry, for it is better to marry
[00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:27.840]   "than to burn with passion."
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.500]   Some of you only heard that last line
[00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.600]   because you squarely identify yourself
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.440]   within the burning for passion category.
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.520]   That's me, man, that's how I feel right now.
[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.140]   I don't need anything else that you're going to say tonight.
[00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:40.680]   Well, before you write me off or you tune me out,
[00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:43.140]   just track with me because here's the reality.
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.900]   So many people were single at one time.
[00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:48.980]   So many people are single in this moment,
[00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:51.420]   but the truth is everybody will be single again
[00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:52.820]   at some point in the future.
[00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:54.980]   And so it's helpful for us to understand
[00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:56.940]   what are the reasons for it?
[00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:59.140]   What's the purpose behind it?
[00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:02.420]   And what we see is that Paul gives us two reasons
[00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:05.860]   for why God ordains the goodness of singleness.
[00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:07.060]   The first thing is he tells us,
[00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:09.100]   hey, singleness is desirable.
[00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:12.940]   He says, "I wish that all," meaning all,
[00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:14.860]   "were as I myself am."
[00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:16.540]   Well, Paul, how are you?
[00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:18.640]   He's talking about his singleness in this moment.
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:23.140]   Paul was a single, celibate, childless man.
[00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:26.100]   And he's saying, "I wish that all people were like me."
[00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:28.420]   You can go read back through more of 1 Corinthians 7,
[00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:29.540]   you can see why that is,
[00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:33.500]   but particularly it's because he could consume himself
[00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:34.900]   with the things of God.
[00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:36.980]   He could focus himself fully
[00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:40.220]   on that which mattered most in life,
[00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:42.820]   which is important for us to know
[00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:44.140]   because as Paul says this,
[00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:45.820]   hey, this is worthy of desiring,
[00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:49.940]   it is in stark contrast to so much of what our world,
[00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:52.300]   culture, and even the church would say.
[00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:53.600]   Because if you look out there,
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.420]   what you realize is often people are saying,
[00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:58.100]   hey, in order to live a fulfilling human experience,
[00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:00.060]   you need to be married, have sex,
[00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:02.140]   and probably should have a couple of kiddos.
[00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:04.740]   But Paul's saying you don't need those things.
[00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:07.060]   And to actually emphasize the point further,
[00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:10.060]   Paul, yes, was single, but so was Jesus.
[00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:11.140]   If you're in the room and you say,
[00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:13.740]   I'm a Christian, I follow that man named Christ,
[00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:14.780]   then what you need to understand
[00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:16.860]   is you follow a single man,
[00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:21.860]   a man that was fully single, and yet he was fully human,
[00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:24.460]   meaning he didn't need to be married,
[00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:25.340]   he didn't need to have sex,
[00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:27.500]   he didn't need to have biological children
[00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:28.700]   to have the fulfilling experience
[00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:31.460]   that the rest of the world is saying you must have.
[00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:32.900]   Singleness is desirable.
[00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:36.980]   He also goes on and he says, secondly, it's purposeful.
[00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:37.980]   Singleness is purposeful.
[00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:40.180]   That's what he means when he says it's a gift,
[00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:42.180]   which I know for many of you
[00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:44.020]   didn't necessarily make your wishlist.
[00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:45.100]   You kind of opened this thing up
[00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:46.500]   and you were like, thank you, God?
[00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:47.500]   You know, like it's not necessarily
[00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:48.980]   the gift you were hoping to get,
[00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:50.220]   but before you look for the receipt,
[00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:53.260]   let me just help you understand why it's a good thing.
[00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.940]   He tells us later on in verse 35,
[00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:59.580]   I say this, talking about singleness,
[00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:02.020]   for your own benefit, for your good,
[00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:03.140]   not to lay a restraint upon you,
[00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:04.740]   but to promote good order,
[00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:07.900]   meaning, hey, I want you to learn how to live
[00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:11.660]   and to secure your undivided devotion to the Lord.
[00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:15.380]   I want you to love God before you love anybody else.
[00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:17.820]   You see, Paul says this thing is good.
[00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:19.580]   It's a gift.
[00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:23.260]   So why do we need to know all this?
[00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.140]   Because fundamentally,
[00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:28.700]   before we even step into the rest of the talk,
[00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:32.320]   at the outset, we have to grasp a new perspective.
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:34.980]   We have to reframe our attitude around this subject,
[00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:39.020]   which so many of us are ready to punt on and push aside.
[00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:44.020]   We have to understand singleness is not a season to endure.
[00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:47.740]   It is a season to embrace.
[00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:49.600]   That's what Paul is describing.
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:53.180]   That's what the word of God is telling us here.
[00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:56.300]   He's saying it's good.
[00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:58.680]   And the reason we have to know this at the outset,
[00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:00.700]   before we talk about anything else, don't worry,
[00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:02.580]   I'm going to help you see some reasons
[00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:04.660]   for why you may still be single
[00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:06.580]   if you don't want to be.
[00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:09.060]   But what you have to understand
[00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:14.060]   is that this takes all of the anxiety out of the assessment.
[00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:18.260]   And as we look at a variety of reasons,
[00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.900]   it helps you to realize,
[00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:24.920]   I'm not stuck in some inferior state of being.
[00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:28.420]   No, I'm in a state that God would say is good.
[00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:32.040]   It's kind of like if you walked into a performance review,
[00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:35.280]   but you'd already received the company MVP award.
[00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:36.660]   How would you feel?
[00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:38.440]   You would walk in and you'd be like, man, okay,
[00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:40.160]   like I'm excited to learn some things.
[00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:41.760]   Sure, I'm gonna get some helpful feedback.
[00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:42.960]   I'm probably gonna grow a little bit,
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:46.720]   but I'm not stressed about this.
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:47.680]   I'm not worried.
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:49.380]   In fact, I'm wanting to learn
[00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:51.440]   because I already have something.
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:55.420]   I've received something that signifies favor.
[00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:58.720]   That's what Paul wants you to know.
[00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:01.520]   You have something that is good,
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:03.540]   but let me be very clear.
[00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:07.680]   As I say that,
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:12.320]   some of you think, man, this thing doesn't feel good.
[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:14.800]   Like if someone tells me that singleness is a gift,
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:15.640]   one more time,
[00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:19.000]   I understand that that can feel like a trite Christian
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.380]   cliche.
[00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:21.760]   It's from the Bible.
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:24.600]   So let's not jettison it
[00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:27.380]   with the rest of our hard feelings towards this subject.
[00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:32.140]   Let's try to understand why is it good?
[00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:35.140]   You see, as we get into this,
[00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:37.360]   you need to know, yes, singleness is good,
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:40.120]   but that doesn't diminish the fact that it's also hard.
[00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:42.900]   It's hard.
[00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:45.420]   I don't want you to hear me say, as we go through this,
[00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:49.300]   that you should feel a diminishing of your longing
[00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:52.580]   for marriage, that this belittles the heartache you feel
[00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:53.860]   or the hurt you have,
[00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:56.780]   that in no way does this look at the sadness
[00:11:56.780 --> 00:12:00.420]   you face in your singleness and make it synonymous to sin.
[00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:03.100]   That's not what we're talking about here.
[00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:04.800]   But what we do have to understand
[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:09.520]   is that God has no problem asking people to wait.
[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:11.980]   All throughout the scripture,
[00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:14.420]   he never has an issue looking at his people and saying,
[00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:15.900]   hey, I know you have a longing,
[00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:18.300]   but I want you to wait for its fulfillment.
[00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:20.520]   You see, admittedly,
[00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:24.100]   the Bible doesn't particularly say a lot
[00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:26.400]   with respect to the question, why am I still single?
[00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:27.900]   But it does have a lot to say
[00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:31.740]   about why we wait for what we want.
[00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:34.420]   You see, in the beginning of the scripture,
[00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:36.220]   a man by the name of Abraham,
[00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:38.900]   who waited 25 years for that which he wanted,
[00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:41.860]   the son of promise, his son, Isaac.
[00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:43.620]   You move over from that and you get to Joseph,
[00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:46.540]   and Joseph, he waited 13 years to be freed from prison.
[00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:47.380]   You move from there,
[00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:49.980]   Moses waited 40 years in the wilderness
[00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:51.380]   before going to the promised land.
[00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:52.740]   David, right after then,
[00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:55.780]   he waited about 15 years from being anointed to become king
[00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:58.080]   before he finally actually took the throne.
[00:12:58.080 --> 00:12:59.720]   And Jesus, he waited 30 years
[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:01.220]   before he began his public ministry.
[00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:02.060]   To top that off,
[00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:04.660]   the guy who is even writing to us understands this well
[00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:06.300]   because Paul waited 14 years
[00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:08.920]   before he began his first missionary journey,
[00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:12.120]   despite being commissioned so early on.
[00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:14.960]   You see, God has no problem asking us
[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:17.020]   to wait for what we want.
[00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:24.880]   But it begs the question, why does he make us wait?
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:27.080]   What reasons does he have to give?
[00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:30.740]   For those of you that are wanting for more than singleness,
[00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:33.780]   what possible explanation does he have?
[00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:37.160]   Well, the first thing that he would say,
[00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:40.800]   the first reason he might give is you're not ready.
[00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:43.580]   You're not ready.
[00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:47.000]   Which some of you hear that and you think,
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.480]   "No, man, I'm pretty ready.
[00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:52.600]   "Have you seen my Pinterest board?
[00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:54.760]   "That thing was done years ago.
[00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:57.080]   "Colors for my wedding, they're picked out.
[00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:59.780]   "Me and the boys, we've already planned the bachelor party
[00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:01.800]   "and none of us are even in a relationship.
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:04.040]   "I'm pretty sure we're ready for this."
[00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:05.680]   I'm not belittling that that's true.
[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:08.200]   And yet what you have to understand
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:10.800]   is that you're not alone in the sentiment.
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:11.640]   When you read through the scripture,
[00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:15.320]   you find the people of God felt the exact same way.
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:16.880]   You see, the nation of Israel,
[00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:19.640]   after they're delivered out of Egypt from slavery,
[00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:22.480]   they have their eyes set on that which was promised to them
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:24.120]   from their ancestral heritage.
[00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:26.160]   They're looking towards the promised land.
[00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:28.240]   And so as they stepped out of Egypt,
[00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:30.200]   they're waiting to go to that place
[00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:31.960]   which they have longed to be.
[00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:33.760]   And yet what we read in Exodus 13
[00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:36.480]   is God doesn't just take them immediately there.
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:39.320]   He says in Exodus 13, verse 17,
[00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:42.120]   "When Pharaoh let the people go,
[00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:44.000]   "God did not lead them on the road
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.280]   "to the Philistine country, though that was shorter.
[00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:50.200]   "For God said, if they face war,
[00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:53.080]   "they might change their minds and return to Egypt.
[00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:55.400]   "So God led the people around by the desert
[00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:57.520]   "toward the Red Sea."
[00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:00.280]   You see, rather than lead the Israelites to that place
[00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:04.300]   which they longed to be in the direction of north,
[00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:06.480]   which would have been fastest,
[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:11.480]   God leads them south in the direction that was furthest.
[00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:14.520]   What?
[00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:15.920]   Why would God do that?
[00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:17.080]   That feels crazy.
[00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:17.920]   And some of you agree.
[00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:19.040]   You're like, that's exactly how I feel.
[00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:20.440]   I feel like I've been trying to get this direction
[00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:22.760]   and God just keeps moving me on a different path.
[00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:26.480]   What you have to understand is God is looking at the road
[00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:27.520]   they would have to take.
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:30.280]   And he's saying, you guys are not ready for this thing.
[00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:31.960]   Like the road that leads north,
[00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:33.520]   the quickest route to your happiness,
[00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:36.280]   where it takes you is through Philistine country.
[00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:39.640]   The Philistines, they were a militarized group of people.
[00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:41.640]   And the road itself was called the Viamaris.
[00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:46.640]   It was a fortified roadway that was set up for ambush.
[00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:49.000]   And so God is saying, hey, if you take this road,
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.800]   you're walking into a buzzsaw.
[00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:52.360]   Like you are not ready for this.
[00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:56.600]   You have been abused and beaten and enslaved for 400 years.
[00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:59.240]   You're doing well just to keep your sandals on your feet.
[00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:01.400]   You're not ready to face these guys.
[00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:04.080]   And so what he does is he takes them south.
[00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:06.960]   It's in his kindness, he takes them a different direction.
[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:09.740]   Do you think they grumbled along the way?
[00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:11.000]   We know they did.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.240]   They grumbled against him the entire time.
[00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:14.440]   And yet in God's kindness,
[00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:18.520]   he led them a different direction for their good.
[00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:21.240]   You see, the fastest route to your happiness
[00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:23.000]   is not always the wisest route.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.840]   The fastest route to your happiness
[00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:27.560]   isn't always the wisest route.
[00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:30.280]   And yet so many people, they rush into marriage
[00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:32.480]   because they wanna feel loved and they wanna have sex
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:33.720]   and they wanna have a bunch of babies,
[00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:36.560]   which are all really good things.
[00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:39.960]   And yet, because they rush into it,
[00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:44.960]   they bring with them unresolved problems
[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:48.540]   and unnecessary pain.
[00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:52.080]   It's interesting.
[00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:54.380]   When you look at the primary causes of divorce
[00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:56.540]   in the United States,
[00:16:56.540 --> 00:17:00.840]   reasons like lack of commitment, infidelity, and arguing,
[00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:03.800]   AKA selfishness, lust, and pride
[00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:05.840]   are the primary perpetrators.
[00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:10.000]   Let me ask, do you think those things
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.040]   just magically materialized in the altar?
[00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:14.000]   Like the minute they said, "I do,"
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.440]   and those wedding bells rang, it was like,
[00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:16.640]   "Oh my gosh, I hate your guts."
[00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:19.400]   Like, no, that's not where it happened.
[00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:21.960]   It happened as two people,
[00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:24.660]   one bride and one groom walked down that aisle.
[00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:26.600]   As they walked towards that altar,
[00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:30.360]   those preexisting issues came with them.
[00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:31.840]   Now, let me be abundantly clear.
[00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:34.480]   I am not telling you that you need to be perfect
[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:36.680]   before you enter into marriage,
[00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:39.200]   but I am saying you need to be prepared.
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:42.680]   You see, contrary to what people often think,
[00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:44.860]   marriage does not minimize your problems,
[00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:47.700]   it magnifies your problems.
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:51.320]   Like having sex in marriage
[00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:54.420]   is not going to solve your lust issue.
[00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:59.200]   If you won't while you're dating,
[00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:02.460]   what makes you think you will when you're married?
[00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:05.000]   It's hard to honor the commitment I do
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.600]   when you never did.
[00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:10.360]   And so it's worth working that out now.
[00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:11.960]   Ladies, gentlemen, listen to me.
[00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:15.680]   You need to evaluate, how does your partner speak to you?
[00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:18.840]   Like guys, if she is always making a little thing
[00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:22.000]   out of a big, or making a big thing out of a little thing,
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.860]   or if she's constantly comparing your shortcomings
[00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:27.920]   to her best friend's husband's strengths,
[00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:31.640]   you don't wanna saddle up 'til death do you part with that.
[00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:34.160]   That's a hard way of life.
[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:39.160]   Ladies, listen, if he's wrestling with pornography now,
[00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:40.880]   you're not going to solve that.
[00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:42.480]   You're not going to fix it.
[00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:44.200]   The day that you go on your honeymoon,
[00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:45.640]   it won't resolve the issue.
[00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:47.320]   It might slow the problem,
[00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:49.280]   it might not progress as quick at first,
[00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:51.440]   but it will eventually return.
[00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:54.040]   Marriage does not, it does not minimize your problems,
[00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:55.600]   it magnifies them.
[00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:59.480]   So it's really worth asking yourself,
[00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:02.880]   given the fact that if you don't deal with it today,
[00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:04.980]   others will have to deal with it tomorrow.
[00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:09.880]   Where are you struggling with sexual sin right now?
[00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:11.120]   Knowing that infidelity
[00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:12.480]   is one of the primary causes of divorce,
[00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:13.680]   it begs the question,
[00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:19.880]   where are you sexually struggling today?
[00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:21.360]   Like where are you making an allowance for it?
[00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:23.360]   Like is it in the shows you watch?
[00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:25.680]   Oh, but Colin, I skipped the nude scenes.
[00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:26.920]   Is it in the books you read?
[00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:28.680]   I didn't know that that was in there.
[00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:30.400]   Is it the thirst trap you follow?
[00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:31.720]   No comment.
[00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:33.360]   Is it the reels you watch?
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:35.340]   But listen, man, I can't help
[00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:37.880]   that the algorithm puts that in front of me.
[00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:40.160]   You might be making an allowance for it
[00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:42.800]   if you're coming up with excuses like that.
[00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:44.360]   Where's selfishness in your life?
[00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:46.120]   Like when things get really hard,
[00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:49.160]   like when things get really tough, what do you do?
[00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:50.740]   Like, do you stay committed?
[00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:52.880]   Do you lean in or do you opt out?
[00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:55.660]   Do you choose to cope in some other kind of way?
[00:19:55.660 --> 00:19:57.960]   Do you find yourself getting sketchy
[00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:01.160]   as opposed to sticking to your word?
[00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:03.880]   Are you reliable or are you unreliable?
[00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:07.160]   Selfish people, they think of themselves.
[00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:08.960]   That's why it's called selfishness.
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:10.880]   How about pride?
[00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:12.600]   Where's pride in your life?
[00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:13.440]   Like what does it look like
[00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:15.200]   for people to have conversation with you?
[00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:17.840]   Are you always the first one to speak up
[00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:19.680]   and the last one to listen?
[00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:21.840]   Are you the strongest voice in the room?
[00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:23.720]   Are you the kind of person that whenever conflict arises,
[00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:26.600]   your instinctual response is defensiveness?
[00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:28.960]   Do people fold like a lawn chair whenever conflict gets up
[00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:32.980]   because they're just like, man, it is not worth it with you.
[00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:34.840]   That could lead to anger.
[00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:36.940]   It's good for you to evaluate.
[00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:41.400]   Where, God, do I need to grow?
[00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:44.000]   Because I want to deal with this now
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.640]   so that they don't have to deal with it then.
[00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:52.580]   You see, perhaps your season of singleness
[00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:55.600]   isn't as miserable as it is merciful of God
[00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:57.400]   to give you a chance to work it out.
[00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:00.840]   You ever thought about that?
[00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:05.840]   Like it is his mercy that leaves you where you are
[00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:09.880]   so you can work out the kinks,
[00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:11.820]   you can figure out the difference.
[00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:17.660]   One of my favorite scriptures is Psalm 51, eight.
[00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:21.360]   David, on the heels of his very worst moment,
[00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:24.880]   he says, God, let the bones that you have broken rejoice.
[00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:27.000]   It's good, God, that you break me
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.600]   so that way I can become more like you.
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:34.280]   This is what God may be trying to do in your life.
[00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:35.960]   Now, let me just be really fair.
[00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:38.600]   Everything we've processed here,
[00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:40.160]   those are moral issues,
[00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:42.000]   but not every reason you may not be ready
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.120]   is necessarily moral.
[00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:45.640]   Sometimes it's situational.
[00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:48.040]   Sometimes the situation may simply say,
[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:49.160]   you're not ready for it right now.
[00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:50.280]   It's not a good idea.
[00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:54.500]   If you don't have a job, you're not ready to date.
[00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:56.380]   You're certainly not ready for marriage.
[00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:58.160]   And that's not a shame-filled comment.
[00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:00.080]   I'm not criticizing anybody's situation.
[00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:02.160]   But what you have to understand is
[00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:04.280]   if dating leads to marriage,
[00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:05.920]   then ultimately you're gonna have to provide
[00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:07.860]   for someone else.
[00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:10.360]   So you probably should figure out what a check looks like
[00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:12.660]   before you jump into a relationship.
[00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:16.280]   Or maybe you're moving cities.
[00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:17.480]   You picked up a new job
[00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:19.520]   and you're actually gonna be leaving town.
[00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:22.320]   It's not a good idea to jump into a relationship now
[00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:24.700]   knowing that that relationship is not going to inevitably,
[00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:27.000]   but very quickly end.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:32.940]   If your station is urgently expiring,
[00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:35.760]   then don't get into a relationship with someone.
[00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:39.480]   Don't emotionally entangle when it is unnecessary.
[00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:43.720]   And sometimes it's not moral or situational, it's personal.
[00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:46.580]   Like some of you, you're coming off of a breakup.
[00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:48.940]   And so what's good is for you to actually close the book
[00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:51.700]   on that chapter before you open up the book on the next
[00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:53.400]   and you start writing a new story.
[00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:56.600]   Others, you're processing some pain
[00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:58.560]   from someone that hurt you in the past.
[00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:03.440]   And so you should focus on that and find healing
[00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:05.860]   rather than divide your attention
[00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:07.860]   and make yourself vulnerable too soon.
[00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:10.100]   I don't know what it may be for you,
[00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:11.940]   but listen, it's worth investigating.
[00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:14.420]   Now to close this point, let me just let you know.
[00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:17.920]   Does this mean you're never going to be ready?
[00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:20.620]   Well, Kyla, that standard feels ridiculous.
[00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:22.100]   I don't know that I'm ever gonna actually amount
[00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:22.940]   to what I need to become
[00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:25.140]   so that when God will give me what I want.
[00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:27.580]   No, you will be ready.
[00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:31.780]   In God's timing, it will happen.
[00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:34.040]   What we know is that the nation of Israel,
[00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:37.720]   they eventually do go to the promised land.
[00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:40.240]   They finally journey north.
[00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:42.920]   And what they do is they not only kick the Philistines,
[00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:46.080]   but they conquer the entire territory.
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:49.360]   You see, God, He led them to a place
[00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:51.760]   where they could become prepared.
[00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:56.280]   Their frailty yesterday was replaced
[00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:59.620]   by formidability tomorrow,
[00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:02.800]   because they walked in the wilderness with God.
[00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:06.300]   Your season of singleness, it might be a wilderness.
[00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:09.080]   It might be the desert to your soul.
[00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:11.480]   And yet God's gonna use it to strengthen you,
[00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:14.380]   to build you up so He can lead you forth
[00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:16.360]   in His timing, according to His will.
[00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:21.320]   He doesn't owe it to you, but He's gracious to His people.
[00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:22.280]   That's the first reason.
[00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:25.360]   Second reason we gotta know is you may be single
[00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:27.580]   because you're waiting for the one.
[00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:29.400]   Ooh.
[00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:34.520]   You want love like Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy.
[00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:38.140]   Yeah, like Jim and Pam.
[00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:42.300]   Like Han Solo and Princess Leia.
[00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:44.740]   Like Troy and Gabriella.
[00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:46.900]   Like Neo and Trinity.
[00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:48.540]   Like Shrek and Fiona.
[00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:51.340]   You want to find your soulmate.
[00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:54.500]   I wasn't sure how relevant this actually was
[00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:55.480]   for our current society.
[00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:56.620]   It felt like a thing of the past,
[00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:57.820]   and so I just did a little bit of research.
[00:24:57.820 --> 00:25:01.020]   And what I found is that YouGov actually found
[00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:06.020]   of American adults, 60% agreed to believing
[00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:07.580]   that soulmates still exist,
[00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:10.420]   that there's someone who will complete me.
[00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:12.300]   Which is a really nice idea.
[00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:13.900]   I could get behind that,
[00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:15.620]   if not for the fact that it's wrong.
[00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:17.140]   And the reason we know that it's wrong
[00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:19.160]   is because God speaks about the purpose of marriage
[00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:20.540]   all throughout His scripture.
[00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:22.020]   And as He does, He tells us,
[00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:24.780]   hey, the purpose of marriage isn't to satisfy
[00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:27.740]   your every longing through another person.
[00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:29.140]   That's not what it exists for.
[00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:31.340]   He actually, in the book of Ephesians,
[00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:32.300]   through the author Paul,
[00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:34.980]   He tells us the most exalted view of marriage,
[00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:36.980]   and He gives us a two-fold functionality
[00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:38.660]   for why it exists.
[00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:41.800]   I would encourage you, go read all of Ephesians 5.
[00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:44.580]   But just to catch us up with a couple of verses,
[00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:48.380]   it says this, "Therefore, a man shall leave his father
[00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:50.120]   "and his mother and hold fast to his wife,
[00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:52.520]   "and the two shall become one flesh."
[00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:54.860]   Meaning there's an inward orientation.
[00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:56.680]   This mystery is profound.
[00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:59.420]   That mystery echoed, or that mystery spoken of
[00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:01.740]   in Genesis 2, it echoes here into the present,
[00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:03.860]   and yet Paul tells us the explanation
[00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:06.260]   that it refers to Christ and the church,
[00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:08.020]   which is an outward orientation.
[00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:10.460]   What's Paul saying?
[00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:12.020]   What's that two-fold functionality?
[00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:14.300]   First, marriage is a model.
[00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:15.860]   Marriage is a model.
[00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:20.380]   It is an example, a representation to the watching world
[00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:22.980]   and to you and your spouse.
[00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:24.380]   What it looks like to love one another
[00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:25.980]   is Christ loves the church.
[00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:27.960]   But then also, marriage is a mission,
[00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:30.420]   in that the mission of your marriage
[00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:33.760]   isn't just to stare longingly into each other's eyes,
[00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:38.760]   but to link arms and to run forward into the cause of Christ
[00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:43.140]   for he left his father and he came in search of us
[00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:45.580]   to redeem us, to bring us back to himself
[00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:46.840]   by way of living the perfect life,
[00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:49.480]   dying the perfect death, and rising forth from the grave,
[00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:50.840]   that we might have faith in him,
[00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:53.700]   should we place our trust and live with him forevermore.
[00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:57.740]   This is an incredibly profound perspective
[00:26:57.740 --> 00:27:00.040]   that the Bible gives on the topic of marriage.
[00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:01.880]   And it is wildly different
[00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:03.720]   than what the rest of the world is trying to tell you,
[00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:05.400]   because according to the soulmate myth,
[00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:06.360]   marriage does not exist
[00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:07.800]   so that way you can serve someone else
[00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:09.440]   or so that way you can serve the rest of the world.
[00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:10.280]   That's strange.
[00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:12.000]   No, the soulmate myth would say,
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.880]   marriage exists for someone to serve me.
[00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:17.640]   I want someone to step into my life
[00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:21.320]   and fill the emotional vacancies deep within
[00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:24.480]   to assuage all of my romantic restlessness.
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:27.280]   And while some of you hear that and you think to yourself,
[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:29.280]   that is ridiculous, Kylan.
[00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:31.400]   I'm not a part of that 60%.
[00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:33.640]   I don't believe that this is actually true.
[00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:39.280]   You are nonetheless trained to hunt for the perfect person.
[00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:40.160]   And it's not your fault.
[00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:42.200]   Like we live in a culture today
[00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:47.040]   where we know relation shopping is at an all-time high.
[00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:49.480]   You can swipe through an endless pool of potential suitors.
[00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:51.920]   You can refine specific romantic search criteria,
[00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:53.280]   and you can filter your way
[00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:56.720]   to a preferred combination of specific attributes.
[00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:58.760]   Whatever your romantic shopping list,
[00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:01.960]   you can build it out and you can search the world
[00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:03.640]   for those perfect ingredients.
[00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:11.760]   That's why ladies, you wanted to be 6'2",
[00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:14.940]   hyper-masculine, but also hypersensitive.
[00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:17.860]   You wanted to be emotionally intelligent,
[00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:19.080]   but also the life of the party,
[00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:20.800]   capable of raising wonderful kids,
[00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:22.240]   but also capable of reading your mind
[00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:24.000]   because you're just tired of having to draw pence
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.520]   so that way he might know what you actually want.
[00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:28.160]   Let me just help you understand.
[00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:30.080]   That doesn't exist.
[00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:31.560]   That man is nowhere to be found.
[00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:32.400]   He is not in this room.
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:33.220]   He is not in that room.
[00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:34.960]   He is not in any room ever.
[00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:37.800]   You see, he didn't go to the coffee shop
[00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:40.120]   because he knew you'd be there.
[00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:42.000]   He didn't post that thing on Instagram
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.400]   because he knew you'd be looking.
[00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:46.100]   He doesn't have a girl brain.
[00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:48.400]   He has man brain.
[00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:50.520]   Man brain, simple.
[00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:53.560]   Woman brain, sophisticated.
[00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:57.460]   Just know that that's what you're crossing paths with.
[00:28:57.460 --> 00:28:59.360]   Gentlemen, so many of you,
[00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:03.040]   you're looking for a girl that likes her steak medium rare,
[00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:03.880]   not medium well.
[00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:05.560]   Can I get an amen?
[00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:08.760]   Is always down to hit balls at the range
[00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:10.880]   and never gives you grief if you want to go
[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:13.680]   play a little twilight round at the end of the day.
[00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:15.440]   She loves hanging with the boys,
[00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:16.680]   would rather watch the game tonight
[00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:17.520]   than talk about that fight
[00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:18.960]   that she's having with her friends.
[00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:20.600]   You see, what you want to find
[00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:22.720]   is basically your friend, Rick.
[00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:24.400]   You know, like that's what you're trying to look for.
[00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:25.880]   The guy that's sitting right to your left
[00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:26.720]   or right to your right.
[00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:28.720]   That's the guy that you kind of want to put a band on
[00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:29.640]   and say, "Hey man, let's journey
[00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:30.560]   through the rest of life together."
[00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:32.520]   But praise God, that's not God's design
[00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:34.280]   because what you need, brother, is help.
[00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:35.520]   That's what we all need.
[00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:36.720]   God says so at the beginning.
[00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:38.760]   And so we know we've got to find someone different
[00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:39.600]   than ourselves.
[00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:40.960]   You see, we live in a culture
[00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:43.440]   that is wracked with unrealistic expectations
[00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:46.120]   and over emphasis on physical appearance,
[00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:50.880]   a deep sense of decision fatigue
[00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:52.680]   and this fear of missing out
[00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:54.840]   all because you're searching for the one
[00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:56.280]   or you're trying to be the one
[00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:57.800]   that someone is searching for.
[00:29:57.800 --> 00:30:04.440]   But hear me, what if instead of entrusting yourself
[00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:07.800]   to some romantic shopping list or algorithm online,
[00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:09.800]   you entrusted yourself to God instead?
[00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:13.560]   Because while there is no perfect match
[00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:15.280]   in a world filled with imperfect people,
[00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:17.920]   there is a perfect God who can satisfy you instead.
[00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:21.640]   Scriptures are loaded with this.
[00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:24.920]   Book of Psalms tells us in Psalm 90, 14,
[00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:31.080]   satisfy us in the morning with your steadfast love,
[00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:33.200]   your love, oh God, I don't want the love of anyone else.
[00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:36.320]   Your love will satisfy me that we may rejoice
[00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:38.680]   and be glad in all our days.
[00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:41.620]   Psalm 60, 35, my soul, you want a soulmate,
[00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:45.460]   will be satisfied in the Lord as with fat and rich food.
[00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:47.720]   Psalm 107, nine, for he,
[00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:50.740]   talking about God satisfies the longing soul.
[00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:54.240]   You longing for love, he's the one that satisfies it.
[00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:57.360]   In the hungry soul, he fills with good things.
[00:30:57.360 --> 00:31:02.060]   Psalm 65, four, blessed is the one that you choose
[00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:05.280]   and you bring near to dwell in your courts,
[00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:08.160]   to be in your house, to make your life alongside.
[00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:10.940]   We shall be satisfied with the goodness of your house
[00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:13.100]   and the holiness of your temple.
[00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:15.780]   You do not have to wait to find someone
[00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:18.340]   to satisfy the every longing of your soul
[00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:22.500]   because the only one who can has already found you.
[00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:26.420]   Jesus, the satisfier of your soul has sought you out.
[00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:30.180]   Therefore, you need not seek anyone else out.
[00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:31.980]   I'm not saying you shouldn't.
[00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:33.660]   I'm not saying marriage is bad,
[00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:36.420]   but I am saying if you load the pressure
[00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:40.460]   and expectation of someone solving all the deep complexities
[00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:44.580]   and intricacies of who you are, that will never happen.
[00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:46.520]   Christ in Christ alone can do that.
[00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:48.940]   Let me be clear.
[00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:51.020]   I am not telling you to stop looking.
[00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:54.940]   As I say this, I'm not saying,
[00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:57.300]   well, just fold your arms and cross your legs
[00:31:57.300 --> 00:31:58.140]   and tap your toe.
[00:31:58.140 --> 00:32:00.020]   Like that's not what I'm processing with you here.
[00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:01.860]   What you have to understand is that
[00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:03.280]   while you shouldn't look for the one,
[00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:05.420]   you also need to look for someone
[00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:08.860]   because the goal of your singleness
[00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:12.700]   is not to find the one who can satisfy you.
[00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:17.120]   It is to find someone who can glorify him.
[00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:18.440]   That's what you're looking for.
[00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:21.180]   Now, some of you, you're deeply content in your singleness.
[00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:22.620]   You might be called to it for a lifetime
[00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:24.180]   and that's a really good thing.
[00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:28.300]   But for others of you that are wanting for this,
[00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:29.860]   that's what you're looking for,
[00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:33.620]   which begs the question, what do they look like?
[00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:37.380]   Well, let me tell you, in the weeks to come,
[00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:38.800]   you'll have to come back 'cause I'm gonna make sure
[00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:40.260]   that you learn all of the details
[00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:42.340]   of what you need be looking for.
[00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:44.620]   But I'll give you a teaser.
[00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:49.260]   That person should love Christ more than they love you.
[00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:55.460]   That person should not be so concerned
[00:32:55.460 --> 00:33:00.900]   with grabbing hold of some guy or grabbing hold of some girl
[00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:03.420]   but instead grabbing hold of him
[00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:04.820]   because in their mind's eye,
[00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:10.820]   he is theirs before anyone else's.
[00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:14.060]   You want someone like that, that sees the things of God
[00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:16.500]   and says, I'm going for it, I'm racing for it.
[00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:18.540]   If you wanna come with me, then let's do it
[00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:20.940]   because this is a journey worthy going on.
[00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:23.140]   This is a cause worth giving our lives for.
[00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:25.380]   This is a purpose that transcends
[00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:27.700]   any other purpose in this world.
[00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:31.180]   But I'm going after him.
[00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:34.780]   I'm not coming after you.
[00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:36.180]   That's what you're looking for,
[00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:40.220]   someone whose allegiance is to Jesus.
[00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:44.820]   Now, the third reason why you may still be single
[00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:48.540]   if you don't wanna be is fear of commitment,
[00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:51.220]   fear of commitment.
[00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:55.940]   It's interesting, when I was researching for the series,
[00:33:55.940 --> 00:34:00.040]   I was just trying to catch up on the landscape of love,
[00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:01.540]   which kind of, it evolves.
[00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:03.260]   Every couple of years, you see that
[00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:05.220]   the romantic realm of our world,
[00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:10.220]   it just, it grows, it adapts, it adds to itself.
[00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:14.740]   And so what I knew was that in our culture,
[00:34:14.740 --> 00:34:20.860]   there's a large word bank of alternate relationship
[00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:24.100]   structures to help us define what's actually going on here.
[00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:26.180]   And yet, as I did the research, I realized
[00:34:26.180 --> 00:34:29.540]   I did not know nearly as much as I thought I would
[00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:31.500]   because what I found were a variety of terms
[00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:32.860]   that you and I may already know,
[00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:35.460]   things like situationships and open relationships
[00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:38.620]   and friends with benefits, all of that kind of stuff.
[00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:42.540]   But I also learned terms like polycules
[00:34:42.540 --> 00:34:45.420]   and hierarchical polyamory,
[00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:49.580]   and I learned about sex interviews and serial monogamy.
[00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:52.260]   I don't expect you to be familiar
[00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:55.840]   with all the varying fluid forms of relationship status,
[00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:58.820]   but what I do want us to know is they all exist
[00:34:58.820 --> 00:35:00.660]   for the same singular reason.
[00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:03.740]   People fear commitment.
[00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:06.180]   That's what they are.
[00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:07.740]   That's why they exist.
[00:35:07.740 --> 00:35:10.020]   They exist because they're trying to help you
[00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:12.500]   enjoy the benefits of a relationship
[00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:14.620]   without bearing any of the responsibilities
[00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:16.100]   of caring for another person.
[00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:20.900]   Paul knows we fear this so much so
[00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:24.180]   that in 1 Corinthians 7, he actually addresses the topic.
[00:35:24.180 --> 00:35:27.540]   He says, right after verse 35,
[00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:29.380]   where he defines the purpose for it,
[00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:31.820]   this in 36 and 37, that if anyone thinks
[00:35:31.820 --> 00:35:34.980]   that he is not behaving properly toward his betrothed,
[00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:37.920]   if his passions are strong, and it has to be,
[00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:39.860]   let him do as he wishes, let them marry.
[00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:41.040]   It's no sin.
[00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:42.740]   But whoever is firmly established in his heart
[00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:44.020]   being under no necessity,
[00:35:44.020 --> 00:35:45.740]   but having his desire under control,
[00:35:45.740 --> 00:35:47.380]   and he's determined this in his heart
[00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:50.940]   to keep her as his betrothed, he will do well.
[00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:51.940]   What's Paul saying?
[00:35:51.940 --> 00:35:55.420]   If you wanna be together, you can't stop talking.
[00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:56.740]   You can't stop texting.
[00:35:56.740 --> 00:35:57.880]   You can't stop thinking.
[00:35:57.880 --> 00:35:58.860]   You can't stop touching.
[00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:00.800]   Then be together, get married.
[00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:02.020]   Like that's what he's saying.
[00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:04.060]   He's like, hey, you don't necessarily need to do this
[00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:06.160]   in a sinful way where we're gonna make an accommodation
[00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:08.180]   for all of our unbridled passion.
[00:36:08.180 --> 00:36:10.180]   But what you need to do is you need to process
[00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:12.820]   that stuff out, you need to bring community into it.
[00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:15.700]   And then once it feels like it's been redeemed,
[00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:20.500]   you need to take a step, make a decision, and get married.
[00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:23.460]   And if you wanna be single,
[00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:25.500]   man, you just love this stage of life.
[00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:26.900]   God's really teaching you something right now.
[00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:28.380]   There's some things that you're trying to work out.
[00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:29.540]   Then be single.
[00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:30.380]   Like that's okay.
[00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:35.380]   His point is make a decision, commit one way or the other.
[00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:40.000]   That's what he means when he says be firmly established.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.700]   That word in Greek, it is the derivative of a word
[00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:44.740]   that means to sit.
[00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:45.980]   So Paul is saying be firmly established.
[00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:49.700]   Hey, why don't you settle down, get sedentary?
[00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:52.700]   He wants you to adopt this picture
[00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:55.880]   of sitting and staying a while
[00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:58.520]   with whatever decision you decide.
[00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:00.580]   Like don't keep moving about with like this anxious energy
[00:37:00.580 --> 00:37:01.420]   of like, well, I think I wanna be single,
[00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:02.240]   but I think I wanna be dating.
[00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:03.340]   I kinda wanna live in both worlds.
[00:37:03.340 --> 00:37:04.320]   Don't do that.
[00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:08.540]   But so many singles in our world, they do this.
[00:37:08.540 --> 00:37:09.840]   I did this.
[00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:11.460]   This is a common practice.
[00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:13.000]   Like instead of making a decision
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:17.280]   and sitting where we say,
[00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:19.480]   what we instead do is we flirt.
[00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:23.400]   Like you text her late at night,
[00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:26.420]   the hour when really it's not appropriate for you to,
[00:37:26.420 --> 00:37:29.040]   but it's gonna get her mind going.
[00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:31.680]   You stop by his desk just to say hi and chat.
[00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:33.480]   And you know, you look good today
[00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:35.880]   and he needs to know it too.
[00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:41.920]   You make an effort in a public place
[00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:43.940]   where both of you are present to seek her out.
[00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:45.120]   Even though it's inconvenient,
[00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:46.720]   someplace maybe like the porch.
[00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:50.720]   You like his Insta story.
[00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:54.000]   You share something on direct message.
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   You go out of your way to express interest.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.600]   But I would never ever enter into a relationship
[00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:01.440]   with that person.
[00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:03.120]   That would ruin the friendship.
[00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:05.240]   I don't necessarily want anything serious.
[00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:07.640]   I'm just trying to have a little bit of fun right now.
[00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:11.160]   So many of us are not firmly established because we flirt.
[00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:13.160]   Others of us are not firmly established
[00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:14.640]   because we date casually.
[00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:17.800]   I'm not trying to load a bunch of pressure on dating.
[00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:20.160]   But what I do wanna say is if you're dating
[00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:22.800]   for the simple sake of fun, you might need to slow down
[00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:25.000]   because often what happens when we're in that pursuit
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:28.120]   is we build emotional bonds with people.
[00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:30.540]   We bend some physical boundaries.
[00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:31.860]   It feels good to be wanted.
[00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:33.560]   We break spiritual rules.
[00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:35.160]   Like, listen, man, I know I'm not supposed
[00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:38.500]   to date a non-believer, but it's nothing serious.
[00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:39.440]   We're just having fun.
[00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:40.680]   They're a nice guy, super moral.
[00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:42.240]   They might believe one day.
[00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:44.560]   And what happens is you express
[00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:46.880]   that you're not firmly established.
[00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:49.140]   Others are delaying their proposal.
[00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:53.840]   You've been dating more than two years.
[00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:56.440]   And so she starts to wonder, like, I wonder,
[00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:57.440]   what is this, you know?
[00:38:57.440 --> 00:38:59.400]   Like, this thing's gonna go the distance.
[00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:00.240]   We made it two years.
[00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:01.400]   Like, this thing looks really awesome.
[00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:04.000]   But then that slips into three years.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.240]   And so she's kind of confused.
[00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:08.600]   Her family's peppering her with questions.
[00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:10.680]   And yet she's committed, you know, it's awesome.
[00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:12.220]   It's been three years, a little longer than I thought,
[00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:13.080]   but we're gonna make it.
[00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:15.280]   But then it slips into four years.
[00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:16.640]   And now she's frustrated,
[00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:19.880]   but she's deeply invested in this thing.
[00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:21.280]   Like, I'm aging.
[00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:22.400]   It's been four years.
[00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:24.680]   I think you are who I think you are,
[00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:26.520]   but this doesn't seem to make sense.
[00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:28.320]   And then it bleeds into five years.
[00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:31.220]   And what you find is that she's emotionally exhausted,
[00:39:31.220 --> 00:39:32.760]   waiting around for you to pop the question,
[00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:33.600]   to bend the knee.
[00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:35.960]   She is seeing that the market is currently flooded
[00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:37.320]   with new dating prospects.
[00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:39.240]   And she just doesn't have the stamina to get back out there.
[00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:41.240]   So she waits around for your sorry, bud.
[00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:46.580]   I wanna be really clear.
[00:39:46.580 --> 00:39:51.360]   This is a very cruel thing to do to someone.
[00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:58.280]   To string them along with the promise of forever,
[00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:00.620]   but never the intent of actually delivering.
[00:40:00.620 --> 00:40:01.920]   Don't do that.
[00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:03.800]   That's a cruel thing to do.
[00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:07.380]   It's not family established.
[00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:11.660]   And the last is the eternal engagement.
[00:40:11.660 --> 00:40:14.640]   Where you did put a ring on it,
[00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:17.340]   but we've moved in together and we're splitting the bills
[00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:19.600]   and we share the same groceries and we love to cook dinner
[00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:20.680]   and we're already having sex.
[00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:21.500]   And you know what?
[00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:23.400]   The formality of a big wedding, that crazy event,
[00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:25.880]   I don't know that I necessarily wanna invest in that.
[00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:30.100]   And so you push and you push and you push.
[00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:32.080]   You're not firmly established.
[00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:34.160]   Now, let me be really clear.
[00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:36.900]   I am not saying in any way that commitment is easy.
[00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:41.960]   Take it from somebody that loved his single years
[00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:45.260]   and all the option value that it brought.
[00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:47.040]   Commitment is hard.
[00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:49.340]   And some of you have very legitimate reasons
[00:40:49.340 --> 00:40:51.580]   for why commitment is hard.
[00:40:51.580 --> 00:40:52.980]   Like you never grew up in a home
[00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:56.340]   where you saw a healthy, loving, committed relationship.
[00:40:56.340 --> 00:40:57.500]   You were involved with someone
[00:40:57.500 --> 00:41:00.100]   and they took advantage of you.
[00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:03.060]   They took something from you that was not theirs to have,
[00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:04.740]   or you've put yourself out there.
[00:41:04.740 --> 00:41:06.540]   You've heard sermons like this
[00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:07.380]   about walking across the room.
[00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:09.560]   And so you've done the effort, you've made the move,
[00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:11.780]   and yet you've been rejected, you've been ghosted,
[00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:12.740]   you've been belittled.
[00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:15.100]   And so you just don't have what it takes any longer
[00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:16.880]   to keep putting yourself out there.
[00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:18.700]   I don't know what it is for you,
[00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:20.040]   but here's what you need to know.
[00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:23.720]   You will never heal from it if you only hide from it.
[00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:27.480]   You'll never heal from it if you only hide from it.
[00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:29.940]   You have to be willing to pull that out
[00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:34.260]   if you want to actually re-engage commitment.
[00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:38.620]   And the good news is, despite whatever hurt you have,
[00:41:38.620 --> 00:41:40.640]   or whatever it is you're ashamed of,
[00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:41.740]   or you're embarrassed about,
[00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:45.040]   Jesus was committed to you anyways.
[00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:46.540]   He looked at the worst of you,
[00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:49.300]   that which you did, that which you will do,
[00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:51.560]   that which was done, that which will be done.
[00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:52.980]   And he said, "I'm in for this.
[00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:54.120]   "I'm committed to you,
[00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:57.620]   "so much so that I will walk the road you cannot walk.
[00:41:57.620 --> 00:41:59.420]   "I will live the life you cannot live.
[00:41:59.420 --> 00:42:00.960]   "I will die the death that you deserve.
[00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:03.520]   "I will take my life back up in my own hand,
[00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:04.980]   "and I will rise forth from the grave
[00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:06.460]   "that if anyone wants to place their faith in me,
[00:42:06.460 --> 00:42:07.840]   "they can be with me forever.
[00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:09.360]   "That's how committed I am to you.
[00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:11.100]   "You want to know the depth of my commitment?
[00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:12.300]   "Look to Calvary,
[00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:17.860]   "because it declares in my mind's eye,
[00:42:17.860 --> 00:42:19.460]   "I am committed to this.
[00:42:19.460 --> 00:42:21.760]   "Not just today, not just tomorrow,
[00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:22.820]   "not just for this life.
[00:42:22.820 --> 00:42:26.100]   "I am committed to you, to us forever."
[00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:27.600]   That's what Jesus has done.
[00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:32.160]   And if you learn a commitment like his,
[00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:35.300]   then you can overcome whatever hardship you have.
[00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:38.040]   Now, let me be quick to finish here.
[00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:42.040]   Some of you are sitting in this room and you're thinking,
[00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:46.500]   "Kyle and I agree, but none of this is true for me."
[00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:49.500]   And that's not a prideful comment.
[00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:52.780]   I am ready.
[00:42:52.780 --> 00:42:57.180]   I know God's still teaching me things,
[00:42:57.180 --> 00:42:59.580]   but God's teaching everybody something.
[00:42:59.580 --> 00:43:00.780]   I walk with him daily.
[00:43:00.780 --> 00:43:02.600]   I read his word regularly.
[00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:03.880]   I make sure to pray,
[00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:05.140]   not because I've got to get my prayers in,
[00:43:05.140 --> 00:43:07.900]   but because I love to talk and process with the Lord.
[00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:08.820]   I'm ready.
[00:43:08.820 --> 00:43:12.500]   Or you're sitting here and you're thinking to yourself,
[00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:14.340]   "I'm not in search of the one.
[00:43:14.340 --> 00:43:15.460]   "I've already found him.
[00:43:15.460 --> 00:43:16.300]   "I found the one.
[00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:19.220]   "I know there's only one worthy of seeking,
[00:43:19.220 --> 00:43:20.820]   "and his name is Jesus."
[00:43:20.820 --> 00:43:24.140]   And you're thinking to yourself,
[00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:27.560]   like, "I'm not afraid of commitment.
[00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:30.720]   "I just have no one to commit to.
[00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:37.240]   "What other possible reason does God have for me?
[00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:40.180]   "Why would he leave me in this spot?
[00:43:40.180 --> 00:43:42.840]   "If he's so good, if this is desirable,
[00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:45.120]   "if it is purposeful, then why?"
[00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:51.580]   Because it's just not time.
[00:43:51.580 --> 00:43:55.920]   That's the fourth reason.
[00:43:55.920 --> 00:44:00.920]   And it is probably the hardest one to receive.
[00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:08.980]   In the book of Lamentations, which is a book of mourning,
[00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:11.900]   it's actually, it's five funeral poems right at the center
[00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:13.860]   of what I think is a scripture for you.
[00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:18.680]   It says this, Lamentations 3, starting in verse 24.
[00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:23.680]   "The Lord is my portion, says my soul.
[00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:25.560]   "Therefore I will hope in him.
[00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:26.940]   "The Lord is good to those who wait for him,
[00:44:26.940 --> 00:44:28.420]   "to the soul who seeks him.
[00:44:28.420 --> 00:44:30.100]   "It's good that one should wait quietly
[00:44:30.100 --> 00:44:30.940]   "for the salvation of the Lord.
[00:44:30.940 --> 00:44:35.780]   "It is good for a man that he bears the yoke of his youth."
[00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:39.080]   Twice in that passage, it says that it is good
[00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:40.940]   to wait for the Lord, which is surprising
[00:44:40.940 --> 00:44:42.520]   because it feels pretty bad, doesn't it?
[00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:45.260]   Like, our world is obsessed with convenience.
[00:44:45.260 --> 00:44:49.220]   No one's still riding horseback from one place to the next
[00:44:49.220 --> 00:44:52.480]   because it's not nearly as efficient as a motor vehicle.
[00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:54.540]   No one likes to wait five to seven business days
[00:44:54.540 --> 00:44:55.820]   to get anything on their doorstep
[00:44:55.820 --> 00:44:57.120]   because you can just prime it and have it here
[00:44:57.120 --> 00:44:59.100]   in less than two days instead.
[00:44:59.100 --> 00:45:02.860]   Like, we know that convenience is not something we opt for,
[00:45:02.860 --> 00:45:06.220]   and yet, why then is waiting good?
[00:45:06.220 --> 00:45:12.300]   Listen, because nothing worth having comes without waiting.
[00:45:12.300 --> 00:45:18.100]   Nothing, nothing worth having comes without waiting.
[00:45:18.100 --> 00:45:22.940]   If you think about it, you don't develop photos
[00:45:22.940 --> 00:45:25.380]   in the sunlight, you take them into a dark room,
[00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:27.020]   and yet, if you pull them out of that dark room
[00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:28.300]   and you expose them to light too soon,
[00:45:28.300 --> 00:45:30.380]   what happens to the photos?
[00:45:30.380 --> 00:45:31.220]   They're ruined.
[00:45:31.220 --> 00:45:35.820]   And yet, if you're patient, wait, give time,
[00:45:35.820 --> 00:45:38.300]   and let those photos develop in the dark,
[00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:42.140]   when they're ready, you pull them forth,
[00:45:42.140 --> 00:45:45.620]   and what you find is something beautiful in the end.
[00:45:45.620 --> 00:45:49.740]   God has left some of you for this reason alone
[00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:51.220]   in a season of singleness,
[00:45:51.220 --> 00:45:53.180]   which equates to a dark room experience
[00:45:53.180 --> 00:45:56.900]   because he is trying to make something beautiful of you
[00:45:56.900 --> 00:45:59.280]   that he may not make in any other way.
[00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:01.660]   He's developing you.
[00:46:01.660 --> 00:46:07.500]   He's preparing you, not just for marriage, but for himself.
[00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:11.640]   He's making of you, not just a wife, not just a husband,
[00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:15.620]   but one that looks like Christ.
[00:46:15.620 --> 00:46:18.460]   You see, we do not get the promise that we will be married,
[00:46:18.460 --> 00:46:20.820]   but what we do get is the promise
[00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:23.180]   of a wedding that is to come,
[00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:26.740]   one where we're united to not some random groom,
[00:46:26.740 --> 00:46:30.500]   but to the perfect groom whose name is Jesus.
[00:46:30.500 --> 00:46:35.500]   We see in him a groom that was always ready,
[00:46:35.500 --> 00:46:39.260]   never needed to get himself right,
[00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:41.540]   but was ready and willing to pursue us
[00:46:41.540 --> 00:46:43.180]   when we were unwilling of being pursued.
[00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:45.820]   We see in him the only perfect one
[00:46:47.380 --> 00:46:49.740]   that has always been waiting for us.
[00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:51.780]   And we see in Christ,
[00:46:51.780 --> 00:46:54.060]   someone that never second guessed his commitment,
[00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:56.820]   but said, "No, I am willing to express my commitment
[00:46:56.820 --> 00:46:58.200]   "in the grandest of ways.
[00:46:58.200 --> 00:46:59.940]   "I will live my life perfectly
[00:46:59.940 --> 00:47:01.900]   "because you cannot in your sin.
[00:47:01.900 --> 00:47:05.100]   "I'm gonna die, but not because I'm worthy.
[00:47:05.100 --> 00:47:06.400]   "You are instead.
[00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:09.120]   "And yet, because I lay down my life
[00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:11.980]   "and I take it up by my own accord,
[00:47:11.980 --> 00:47:14.020]   "I will rise forth from the grave
[00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:16.800]   "that any who believe in me,
[00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:19.860]   "they will have everlasting life.
[00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:24.100]   "Not just heaven to come, but heaven right now
[00:47:24.100 --> 00:47:26.220]   "because you get me."
[00:47:26.220 --> 00:47:27.820]   And what we see in Jesus
[00:47:27.820 --> 00:47:31.960]   is that he had to wait.
[00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:38.460]   He waited for at the right time,
[00:47:38.460 --> 00:47:40.380]   he died for the ungodly.
[00:47:40.380 --> 00:47:42.220]   He died for you and me.
[00:47:42.220 --> 00:47:43.740]   If you're ready to find love,
[00:47:43.740 --> 00:47:47.580]   and listen, you need wait no longer, friend,
[00:47:47.580 --> 00:47:50.020]   for love has found you.
[00:47:50.020 --> 00:47:51.980]   Let me pray for you.
[00:47:51.980 --> 00:47:54.580]   God, thank you for tonight.
[00:47:54.580 --> 00:47:59.800]   Every moment over the course of a Tuesday is yours.
[00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:04.220]   But God, this next moment, I pray you'd use.
[00:48:04.220 --> 00:48:07.460]   I pray you'd work within the hearts of the people here
[00:48:07.460 --> 00:48:11.460]   that you would stir within their souls to believe.
[00:48:12.500 --> 00:48:15.140]   I ask God that people who may have come here
[00:48:15.140 --> 00:48:17.980]   because they wanna learn some tips and tricks on dating
[00:48:17.980 --> 00:48:23.220]   would actually learn something so much better,
[00:48:23.220 --> 00:48:27.000]   so much richer, so much fuller instead,
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:28.920]   that you love them.
[00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:33.780]   And in you, they not only find all they need,
[00:48:33.780 --> 00:48:35.060]   they find all they want.
[00:48:35.060 --> 00:48:38.660]   God, we worship you now.
[00:48:38.660 --> 00:48:41.420]   And it is in your name we pray, amen.
[00:48:41.420 --> 00:48:43.540]   Hey, porch, let's stand together.
[00:48:43.540 --> 00:48:45.100]   Right now, I know we've gone a little long.
[00:48:45.100 --> 00:48:46.660]   Thanks for your patience.
[00:48:46.660 --> 00:48:49.580]   Some of you wanna respond in this moment.
[00:48:49.580 --> 00:48:51.180]   We've got a team down here to the right and to the left.
[00:48:51.180 --> 00:48:52.520]   They would love to do that.
[00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:54.980]   But this moment is a moment to process.
[00:48:54.980 --> 00:48:59.180]   It is a moment to respond to the God who loves you.
[00:48:59.180 --> 00:49:00.340]   Let's do that together.
