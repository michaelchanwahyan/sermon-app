1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,580
 - For freedom in the history of our nation.

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:06,640
 (upbeat music)

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,160
 - Dallas and Fort Worth, we're advancing the state of the art

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,160
 in every aspect.

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:23,760
 - Man, let's go.

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,640
 Well, hello friends in the room,

7
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,400
 friends in Fort Worth and in Houston

8
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,360
 and in El Paso and Tulsa and the Woodlands

9
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,720
 and Spring and all over tuning in with us tonight.

10
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,680
 We are gonna continue this series, New Year Revolution.

11
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,120
 And I'm gonna give us a little bit of story

12
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,880
 that'll tell us where we're going.

13
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,640
 Two Sundays ago was going to the bank,

14
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,800
 I need to make a deposit at the ATM.

15
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,860
 ATMs not only will give you money,

16
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:48,800
 they now give you a place where you can deposit your money.

17
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,360
 Had $300, needed to deposit,

18
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,740
 went up to the ATM driving through,

19
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:56,000
 begin to put the money inside of there.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,960
 Thank you, Billy.

21
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,320
 (audience cheering)

22
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,760
 Oh man, stay hydrated, stay hydrated.

23
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:05,480
 So anyways, at the ATM, putting the dollar bills in there

24
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,520
 and making a deposit, just some cash

25
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,840
 that I acquired at our house

26
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,480
 and needed to put it in the bank.

27
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,920
 I'm depositing it, all of a sudden,

28
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,380
 the money inside of the bank begins to cause

29
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:16,400
 some sort of disturbance in the ATM

30
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,960
 and it begins to go error, error,

31
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,340
 blink, blink, blink, this noise comes on

32
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,000
 and it says malfunction and gives a phone number

33
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,520
 to call on the screen there.

34
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,520
 And I'm like, oh my gosh.

35
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,960
 And it begins spitting out the money

36
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,880
 and I'm trying to catch it so the wind doesn't get it.

37
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,860
 And I begin to take this stack of cash

38
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,200
 and I'm thinking, man, maybe it was like

39
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,580
 a crinkled dollar bill,

40
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,120
 what would have been the problem here?

41
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,280
 And I begin to count out 'cause I realized,

42
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,040
 I don't know if all of the money came back to me.

43
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,560
 So I begin counting out and the bank

44
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,360
 had not returned four $20 bills, $80,

45
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,360
 which when you're not rolling, you're like,

46
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,760
 hey, how's it, your boy, that's a lot of money.

47
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,840
 You don't need my money back.

48
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,520
 So I'm calling the people, I'm frustrated,

49
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,880
 I'm like, what just, ATM,

50
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:00,680
 this ATM that exists solely to give money to you

51
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,360
 or to give you a place to deposit money

52
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,060
 had turned into this little thief that had taken my money.

53
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:10,480
 This automated thief machine

54
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,840
 that Chase Bank is so excited about,

55
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,640
 yeah, it's gonna click in here in a second

56
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,840
 for a couple of you guys.

57
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,960
 (audience laughing)

58
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,880
 ATM.

59
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,480
 I'm sorry.

60
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,720
 Anyways, so I'm like, man, I can't believe

61
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,680
 this stoic take this thing that literally exists

62
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,480
 to give to me had taken from me.

63
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,320
 And the reason why I start there is because tonight

64
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,200
 we're talking about the subject of selfishness,

65
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,160
 of self-centered thinking, if you will,

66
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,460
 of entitlement or narcissism,

67
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:42,600
 of a very pervasive way of thinking for our generation

68
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,800
 and really just for the world around us

69
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,040
 of this idea of selfishness.

70
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,420
 And just like an ATM that I went to

71
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,120
 and I thought it would give to me

72
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,600
 or give me a place where I can deposit money,

73
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,960
 it would give, it took from me, selfishness,

74
00:02:55,960 --> 00:03:00,280
 entitlement and thinking from an entitled perspective,

75
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,720
 self-centered thinking.

76
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,320
 It's something that often we shift into

77
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,080
 thinking it will give to us

78
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,440
 and the reality is it always takes from us.

79
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,600
 And tonight we're gonna learn specifically

80
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,960
 some of the ways that it does from that.

81
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,720
 I mean, you think about how much time you and I

82
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,900
 think about ourself on a daily basis.

83
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:18,920
 I mean, if you thought today, like,

84
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,160
 how much time did I spend thinking about me,

85
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:25,800
 my job, what I look like, what other people think about me,

86
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,120
 I mean, it's like, man, I don't know

87
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,720
 what else I thought about today.

88
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,360
 I mean, think about, let's just pause for a second.

89
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,840
 Think about, like, the last 10 minutes

90
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,360
 or the last, the 10 minutes before you got

91
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,240
 or the porch kicked off, from the time to the car

92
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,300
 to in here where you're like, oh, man,

93
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,880
 check the mirror before I leave the car, how do I look?

94
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,760
 Gotta look at this car that I'm walking past

95
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,680
 to see to make sure this hair's in the right place.

96
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,240
 Then I'm walking past the building

97
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,280
 with these enormous windows on the outside of it

98
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,840
 and these clearly provide a place

99
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,240
 where I can see my reflection in the glass.

100
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,360
 Then I come in here and I'm like, man,

101
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,000
 where am I going to sit?

102
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,840
 And then I wanna make sure that I do whatever I have to

103
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,440
 and I have to avoid to not talk to anyone

104
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,720
 before the song starts and then,

105
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,120
 hey, what do these people think of me?

106
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,360
 And I just left that conversation.

107
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,560
 I wonder what they thought when I said X.

108
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,660
 I wonder what that girl over there is thinking about me.

109
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:09,760
 She kinda gave me the smile.

110
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,800
 Like, the amount of time that you and I

111
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:16,580
 spend thinking about me, I mean, it's a little disturbing

112
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:18,480
 if you really stop and think about it.

113
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,000
 The amount of anxiety that we spend

114
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,520
 over just our insecurities and the way that we think about it

115
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,800
 and tonight, we're gonna explore what Jesus has to say

116
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,440
 about the topic of really selfishness or self-centeredness,

117
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:35,500
 self-focused and how it is costing you and it is killing you

118
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,000
 and it will kill your relationships.

119
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,900
 It will kill mine.

120
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,480
 It'll hurt your relationship with God.

121
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,320
 It'll hurt your ability or inhibit your ability

122
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:47,840
 to experience intimacy and relationships with other people

123
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,320
 and your purpose on this planet.

124
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,240
 So that's what's at stake.

125
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,240
 That's what we're gonna explore.

126
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,320
 What selfishness will take from you?

127
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,160
 What selfishness?

128
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,000
 We're gonna be in Matthew chapter 20.

129
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,040
 If you have a Bible, you can flip over

130
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,240
 to Matthew chapter 20.

131
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,060
 Matthew is the first book in the New Testament.

132
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,940
 It is a gospel, which just means it is an account

133
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,120
 of the life of Jesus.

134
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,120
 There's four of 'em.

135
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,320
 Matthew was a disciple of Jesus, spent time with Jesus.

136
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,400
 One of his close friends, he wrote an account

137
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,280
 on the life of Jesus.

138
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,760
 Here's everything that I observed.

139
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:16,200
 And Matthew chapter 20 takes us to inside of the story

140
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,980
 of the book of Matthew, Jesus' last week on the planet.

141
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,480
 He's about to go to the cross.

142
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,840
 He's about to head towards Jerusalem

143
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,920
 where he's gonna be crucified.

144
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,400
 And as he's going there, he begins to tell this parable.

145
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,600
 And then he has this interaction with his disciples

146
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,760
 right after it, and he gives us a real indication

147
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,440
 of how selfishness, how this me first mentality,

148
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,000
 what can I get, get, get, is robbing you

149
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,240
 and robbed his disciples from experiencing certain things.

150
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,120
 So that's where we're gonna camp out.

151
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:42,960
 We'll be in verse one.

152
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,560
 We're gonna go all the way through verse 28.

153
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,040
 So if you didn't have a quiet time today,

154
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,040
 you are about to have a quiet time.

155
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,240
 So we are gonna start in verse one,

156
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,060
 and I'll kick us right off as we look at this parable

157
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,680
 that Jesus launches into that'll give us our first point

158
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,800
 of the first thing that selfishness will rob us from.

159
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,400
 Here's what he says, verse one.

160
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,440
 Jesus speaking.

161
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,800
 For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner

162
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,480
 who went out in early morning to hire workers

163
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,940
 for his vineyard.

164
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:11,120
 He agreed to pay them a denarius for the day,

165
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,720
 and he sent them to work in his vineyard.

166
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,480
 So Jesus, anytime he tells a parable,

167
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,800
 there's always someone who's God.

168
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,000
 There's always someone who's supposed to play

169
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,120
 like you or me.

170
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,680
 And in this parable, the landowner would represent God,

171
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,280
 and then these different workers would represent people.

172
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,640
 And the landowner went and he found some people,

173
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,660
 showed up at Home Depot, said, hey, I got a vineyard.

174
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:29,720
 I want you to come work.

175
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,540
 What are you doing today?

176
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,600
 I'll pay you a day's wages, which is what a denarius.

177
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,520
 So I'll pay you 100 bucks.

178
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,480
 Come work for me.

179
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,080
 Early in the morning, they head out there

180
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,760
 and they go to work.

181
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,960
 About nine in the morning, he went out

182
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,800
 and he saw others standing in the marketplace.

183
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,820
 So he goes back to Home Depot and he says, hey,

184
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:48,400
 and he told them, you also go work in my vineyard

185
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,500
 and I will pay you.

186
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:53,040
 He doesn't say what, he just says whatever is right.

187
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,640
 So they went.

188
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,880
 And he went out again at noon

189
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,040
 and about three in the afternoon,

190
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,020
 and he did the same thing.

191
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,660
 So he goes again, he goes back to Home Depot,

192
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,160
 gets some more guys, drops them off at the vineyard,

193
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,520
 goes back, gets more guys, drops them off at the vineyard.

194
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,480
 And about five in the afternoon, he still goes back

195
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,520
 and he gets another group.

196
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,200
 Five in the afternoon, there's one hour left in the workday.

197
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,420
 He went out and found still others standing around,

198
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:18,280
 said, why have you been standing here all day doing nothing

199
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,580
 because no one's hired us, he said, or they said,

200
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,860
 and he said to them, you also go work in my vineyard.

201
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,020
 When the evening came, the owner of the vineyard

202
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:27,820
 called them to him and called the foreman and said,

203
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:31,460
 pay them, beginning with the last ones who were hired,

204
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:35,260
 the ones hired at five, and going on to the first.

205
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:38,400
 The workers who were hired at five in the afternoon

206
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,260
 each received a denarius.

207
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,300
 So these guys are like, dude, jackpot,

208
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,820
 we gotta work for this guy every day,

209
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:46,220
 Home Depot, five p.m., be there.

210
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,640
 Because they just worked one hour

211
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,400
 and they got an entire day's wages.

212
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,220
 So everybody's lined up and Jesus says,

213
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,580
 he's given this parable and he gives us a principle

214
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,260
 inside of it that we'll get to in a second,

215
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:57,160
 but inside of the parable, the landowner says,

216
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,200
 hey, everybody go out, everyone work,

217
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,680
 if you started at nine a.m., if you started at three p.m.,

218
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,300
 if you started at five, I want you to all line up,

219
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:07,100
 I'm gonna pay the first or the last group to arrive first

220
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,800
 all the way down to the first.

221
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,980
 And so the people who just got a denarius,

222
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,460
 all of a sudden everyone else in line is going,

223
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,900
 oh my gosh, jackpot, we've been here since six a.m.,

224
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,660
 he gave the people here for one hour $100,

225
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:20,400
 he's gonna give us like $1,200, this is amazing,

226
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,800
 best landowner of all time, here's what happens.

227
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,380
 So when those who had hired first came,

228
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:29,820
 they expected to receive more,

229
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:32,940
 but each one of them also received a denarius.

230
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,500
 When they received it,

231
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,900
 they began to grumble against the landowner.

232
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:43,480
 Those who were hired last worked only one hour,

233
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,980
 and you have made them equal to us

234
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:48,060
 who have borne the burden of work and the heat of the day.

235
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,220
 So they look at the landowner

236
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:52,940
 and they begin to become discontent or angry,

237
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:55,700
 not that he wasn't fair, didn't keep up their end of the deal,

238
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,400
 he said, I'll pay you $100, I'll pay you one denarius.

239
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,660
 But over what he had given to others

240
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:06,100
 and what they thought he should have given to them.

241
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,340
 He continues, but he answered,

242
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,360
 the landowner responds and says,

243
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:13,080
 I'm not being unfair to you, friend.

244
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,960
 Didn't you agree to work for a denarius?

245
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,380
 Take your pay and go.

246
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:20,460
 I wanna give the one who was hired last

247
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,260
 the same as I gave you.

248
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:26,220
 Don't I have the right to do what I want with my money?

249
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:29,380
 Or are you envious, or your translation may have,

250
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,760
 is your eye evil?

251
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,640
 Because I'm generous.

252
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,180
 Are you angry at me?

253
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,580
 You're bitter towards the landowner

254
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:43,040
 and envious of others because of what I gave others.

255
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,380
 So the last will be first and the first will be last.

256
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,500
 Jesus, what are you saying in this?

257
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,660
 The parable, scholars have identified for long,

258
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:55,720
 has salvation implications, there's clear undertones

259
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,600
 with Jews and Gentiles and a bunch going on,

260
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,100
 but inside of it, there's also a principle for us

261
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,740
 that applies to the idea of selfishness.

262
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,260
 That applies to really our first point for tonight,

263
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:07,860
 which is selfishness will rob you of contentment.

264
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:10,380
 And inside of the story, what just happened?

265
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,460
 Was it really selfishness?

266
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,940
 No, it was comparison and envy,

267
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,460
 and I would've been upset too.

268
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,380
 They worked one hour, I worked 12.

269
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,540
 We got paid the same.

270
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:18,700
 That's frustrating.

271
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:22,160
 Anytime there's discontentment in your life and in my life,

272
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,860
 that is a result, think about it,

273
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:29,260
 not of what you have, but of what others have around you.

274
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:32,060
 That is the result of selfishness.

275
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:34,620
 It leads to comparison, leads to jealousy,

276
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:35,620
 but if you wanna know, hey man,

277
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:36,700
 do I have a problem with selfishness?

278
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,380
 If you look around at what others have

279
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,620
 makes you discontent, like, hey man,

280
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,180
 I wish I was married right now,

281
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,780
 and the fact that she just got engaged,

282
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,100
 it's like, of course, great.

283
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,120
 Always the bridesmaid, never the bride.

284
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,940
 If that's the response that you have,

285
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,380
 that is a result of selfishness.

286
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,980
 Selfishness will rob from you contentment.

287
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,860
 The first idea from the text, selfishness will rob you,

288
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,380
 it will rob me of contentment.

289
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,600
 That's what happens in the story,

290
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,460
 is they look around, they're the last group,

291
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:00,400
 and they would not have been frustrated

292
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,900
 had they not seen what the others had gotten paid.

293
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:07,580
 Anytime you and I look just like they looked at the landowner,

294
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:11,120
 look at God and grow frustrated towards him,

295
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,260
 or discontent because, man, he got a new Range Rover,

296
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:17,340
 and I don't even, I got a jalopy over here,

297
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,980
 I got nothing to get to work in.

298
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:21,580
 God, why are you blessing this person?

299
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:24,560
 It's a result of a self-seeking selfishness

300
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,540
 that will rob you and I of contentment.

301
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,940
 I mean, it's gross if you think about it.

302
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:32,400
 When other people succeed or other things go well,

303
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,840
 and you're like, oh, that's so great for you,

304
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:38,880
 man, I wish I was you, I'm so angry right now.

305
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,160
 This past week I had a breakfast with a friend of mine

306
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,900
 who we were getting breakfast, catching up on work stuff,

307
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,520
 and he works in the business world,

308
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,680
 and he said, man, I'm going to have this conversation.

309
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,400
 My dad is asking me to really take over

310
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,440
 or play a role in his company in hopes that, you know,

311
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,800
 eventually I'm gonna transition off into his company.

312
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,680
 And it's like a very, it was one of those like,

313
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:02,720
 dude, you are gonna be set for life, that is amazing.

314
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,760
 And I wish that I was just going, that's incredible.

315
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,440
 But in my heart of hearts, I was like,

316
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,520
 oh, man, I wish I was you.

317
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,300
 Is your dad, will he hire me?

318
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,720
 Is he looking to adopt?

319
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:17,260
 And it was just jealous.

320
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:19,140
 I mean, what is that?

321
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:23,000
 It's a selfishness, self-seeking, just disgusting thing

322
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,080
 that can pop up where you're like,

323
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:27,040
 man, I can't even be happy for you,

324
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,640
 really genuinely happy for you

325
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:33,400
 because of a selfishness that robs me of contentment.

326
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,080
 I have no reason to be jealous of him.

327
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,240
 I've got more than enough,

328
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,840
 but it's just the fact of knowing

329
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,240
 that that had just happened for him

330
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,200
 that it leads to a discontentment.

331
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,200
 I mean, you ever seen like someone,

332
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,480
 I mean, people's day gets ruined over the fact

333
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,440
 that they found out their roommate

334
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,120
 just got a raise or a promotion.

335
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,880
 People's day gets ruined over the fact that,

336
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,680
 oh my gosh, of course, he asked her out.

337
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,560
 I cannot believe this.

338
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,160
 I just need some time alone right now.

339
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,000
 Think about that.

340
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,120
 Like how dark and gross is that in all of us?

341
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,840
 And it's a selfishness that leads to a discontentment

342
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:06,520
 because selfishness will rob you and I of contentment.

343
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,920
 There is a solution that we're gonna get to at the end.

344
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,560
 But the first idea of what it will take from you

345
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,600
 anytime you and I allow ourselves to slip in there

346
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,400
 is contentment and an inability to celebrate

347
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,060
 others in our life,

348
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:22,360
 that we just like the first group don't truly trust

349
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,560
 that God will give his people whatever is right.

350
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,160
 I mean, this is also what appears whenever,

351
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,000
 I mean, we see this a lot of the ports

352
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,080
 where all of a sudden somebody would represent,

353
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,240
 if you will, the 9 a.m. group.

354
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,440
 It's like, look, I've been here at Watermark six years.

355
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,480
 I've been serving.

356
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,800
 I'm in a community group.

357
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,960
 I'm serving in 19 different places.

358
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,920
 I'm all in.

359
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,760
 I've been here.

360
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,580
 I've been faithful.

361
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:44,680
 I've been getting it done.

362
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,880
 And this girl showed up.

363
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,880
 She's been here like a week.

364
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:51,200
 And all of a sudden, she's getting married to Mr. Right.

365
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,860
 She's got everything going, everything.

366
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,320
 And she hadn't even proven herself.

367
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,480
 Like she just got safe,

368
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,600
 still smells like the world, just got here.

369
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,440
 And I'm--

370
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,400
 (congregation laughing)

371
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,840
 She's a 5 p.m. girl.

372
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,880
 I've been here since 9 freaking a.m.

373
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,000
 Ain't got nothing.

374
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,040
 I mean, that is a bitterness

375
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,040
 that's a result of selfishness.

376
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:12,880
 (laughing)

377
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,720
 I don't know what the world smells like, so.

378
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,880
 (congregation laughing)

379
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,200
 But it's a bitterness that comes from selfishness

380
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,360
 robbing you of contentment.

381
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,860
 Jesus continues and he says something else.

382
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,900
 And what happens next is almost comical,

383
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,180
 tragically comical.

384
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:28,460
 But where he goes next is so he just tells this story

385
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:29,300
 about like, man, how terrible it is.

386
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:32,180
 And so it's like me first, me first, me first,

387
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,220
 positioning himself and what about me, what about me?

388
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,300
 And he just tells this parable

389
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,260
 and he gives us that principle

390
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:38,180
 of just the grossness of that mentality.

391
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:41,420
 And then he goes into this really intimate moment

392
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:42,980
 with his 12 disciples.

393
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,280
 Stops the story and he goes

394
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,580
 and he's walking with his guys.

395
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,520
 And he goes in and he begins to tell them like,

396
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,140
 man, I'm about to go get killed.

397
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:54,380
 And what happens after that is two of his disciples

398
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:56,740
 in a way that is beyond my ability to understand,

399
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:58,500
 decide, man, this is the perfect moment

400
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,300
 to ask him for a favor right now.

401
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,860
 We're gonna get our mom involved.

402
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,300
 True story, mom involved.

403
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,540
 Here's what happens next.

404
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:08,500
 Now Jesus was going up to Jerusalem

405
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,340
 and on the way he took the 12 aside.

406
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:13,340
 So he grabs just the 12 of them and he said to them,

407
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,080
 we're now going up to Jerusalem

408
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,600
 and the son of man, that's Jesus,

409
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,420
 will be delivered over to the chief priests

410
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,020
 and the teachers of the law.

411
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:22,020
 They will condemn him to death

412
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:24,000
 and will hand him over to the Gentiles

413
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,220
 to be mocked, to be flogged or brutally whipped

414
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:29,560
 and to be crucified.

415
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,940
 Essentially killed through torture.

416
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:36,700
 And on the third day he will rise.

417
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,620
 So Jesus pulls, I mean, it's super intimate,

418
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,460
 like, hey, I'm about to go die.

419
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,960
 I'm about to be killed.

420
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,540
 This would be like someone pulling you in and saying,

421
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,260
 man, I have cancer

422
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,820
 and I only have a certain amount of time to live.

423
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:47,860
 That's what Jesus just said.

424
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:50,140
 I only have a certain few days.

425
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:54,140
 And here's where his disciples go next.

426
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:56,540
 Then the mother of Zebedee's sons,

427
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:59,560
 which is James and John, freaking mother of Zebedee,

428
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,260
 came to Jesus with her sons,

429
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:04,380
 kneeling down and asked a favor of him.

430
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,380
 What is it you want, he asked.

431
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:09,100
 She said, so the mother of James and John,

432
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,500
 for whatever reason, they're like, man,

433
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,620
 not sure what he's talking about, the whole dying thing,

434
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:14,800
 but this feels like a great time to pop the question.

435
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,420
 Mom, let's do this.

436
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:18,740
 And so they come, get before Jesus,

437
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,500
 just them and their mom, and he says,

438
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,940
 my mom has a request, you know,

439
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,800
 maybe she's elderly, you wanna give it to her?

440
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,740
 And it relates to us, so they're right before Jesus,

441
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:28,420
 and here's what they say.

442
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:32,020
 Grant that these two sons of mine may sit at your right

443
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:34,400
 and at your left hand in your kingdom.

444
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:39,900
 So Jesus just says, hey, I'm about to go be killed.

445
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,460
 This is like, hey, your best friend saying,

446
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:45,420
 I'm about to die, and they're worried about seats?

447
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:46,260
 They're worried about, hey, where,

448
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:47,820
 they're positioning themselves,

449
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,500
 hey, where am I gonna sit for all of eternity?

450
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,020
 I mean, this is like your best friend dying,

451
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:53,380
 and you being like, hey, I'm sorry about that shotgun,

452
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,380
 and that's what just happened.

453
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,840
 Or they're going, hey, can we sit here,

454
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,880
 and can we sit here?

455
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,160
 And Jesus responds, and he says,

456
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,740
 you don't know what you're asking.

457
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:08,760
 Jesus said to them, can you drink the cup

458
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,780
 that I'm going to drink, talking about his death?

459
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,900
 We can, they answered, so they're like,

460
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,420
 yeah, totally, love that idea.

461
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,900
 I can totally drink the cup.

462
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:19,540
 I have no idea what that means, but yes, we can do it.

463
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,180
 Just focused on themself.

464
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:25,200
 Jesus said to them, you will indeed drink the cup,

465
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,780
 talking about suffering and dying for him,

466
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,700
 but to sit at my right or left is not for me to grant.

467
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,940
 These places belong to those for whom

468
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:34,620
 it has been prepared by my Father.

469
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,540
 When the other 10 heard of these two boys

470
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,180
 taking this moment where Jesus says,

471
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:40,820
 man, I'm about to go die, and they're like,

472
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,380
 hey, yeah, that's great, sorry about that.

473
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,620
 Can we sit here and here?

474
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:47,280
 When the other 10 heard, they became indignant

475
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,600
 with these two brothers.

476
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:52,380
 Like, they don't come rushing to Jesus' aid and go,

477
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,020
 man, I cannot believe that you just said,

478
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,520
 just told us he was about to die, guys.

479
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,660
 You brought in your freaking mom, really?

480
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:58,740
 You think this is the best time?

481
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,220
 They're not angry at the brothers

482
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:03,360
 for being not compassionate towards Jesus.

483
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,080
 They're angry because they wanna sit in those seats.

484
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:11,020
 Because they too, like those, like James and John,

485
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:13,380
 had a selfishness that was taken from them.

486
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:16,020
 They couldn't even think about what Jesus was saying

487
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:18,380
 'cause they were consumed with themselves,

488
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:22,860
 with their own future, with what they would get.

489
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,300
 The second idea from this text that it gives us

490
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:27,280
 is just the selfishness will rob you and I of compassion.

491
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,480
 Like, in this side of the text,

492
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,500
 they're unable to be compassionate towards Jesus

493
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,720
 who just said, man, I'm about to go die,

494
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,020
 'cause all they can think about is like,

495
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:35,600
 yeah, that's pretty rough, but hey, quick question.

496
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,300
 Can I sit here and can we sit here?

497
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,260
 Just can we get your top positions?

498
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,580
 You can be on the middle throne,

499
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:42,460
 but how about we're kind of on each side of you?

500
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:43,980
 It'll be great.

501
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:46,380
 They're unable to be compassionate

502
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,100
 because of a selfishness that was robbing them

503
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,140
 of compassion.

504
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,180
 A second idea is that,

505
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:53,940
 that selfishness will rob you and I of compassion.

506
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:57,040
 I mean, it's not clear to, or it's not hard to see

507
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,120
 that in your life and my life,

508
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,880
 one of the key things that robs us of compassion

509
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,500
 is a self-focus.

510
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,020
 Like, I think it looks a lot different

511
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,020
 than these two guys standing before Jesus

512
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,540
 where you're like, man, that's so awkward.

513
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:11,620
 They're just socially unaware.

514
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:13,660
 Man, James and John, how could you do that?

515
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,680
 In our life, it manifests itself like this,

516
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:20,680
 a anxiety that makes us unable to care

517
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,740
 or be compassionate towards other people around

518
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,580
 'cause I'm so worried about what I'm going through

519
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:27,020
 and does God even know what I'm going through?

520
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:27,860
 Where's my job?

521
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:29,580
 Am I ever gonna get promoted here?

522
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:30,660
 Am I ever gonna get married?

523
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,140
 And when am I gonna get married?

524
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:34,460
 And my biological clock is ticking

525
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:36,740
 and I'm just so consumed with what other people

526
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:38,100
 are thinking about me and I wonder what they thought

527
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:41,900
 about me and what happened to my past relationship

528
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,360
 or is he, maybe he's not gonna,

529
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,540
 maybe we're not gonna get married.

530
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:46,380
 Anytime there's anxiety, it creeps in

531
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:50,220
 and leads to this focus on self where it's impossible

532
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:53,540
 when you're anxious to begin to take your eyes

533
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:55,880
 off of yourself and care for those around you.

534
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:59,840
 Or insecurity, think about how much insecurity

535
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,700
 has robbed our ability to be compassionate.

536
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,660
 You walk into a room and all you can think about

537
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:07,440
 is man, I don't, what are they thinking about me?

538
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,500
 Do they like me?

539
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,100
 Where should I sit?

540
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:13,220
 And you're unable to just look at other people around you,

541
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:17,180
 care for them, engage with them, see them as people

542
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:18,940
 who have stories, who have pains,

543
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,420
 who have things that they're walking through.

544
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:23,380
 I mean, just think about it in all of us, in me.

545
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:25,300
 Busyness, a focus on self.

546
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,960
 Some of the ways that selfishness manifests itself

547
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,300
 is just how busy we can be.

548
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,020
 Like hey, I don't have time right now.

549
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:30,980
 I'm kinda rushing to church

550
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,180
 and I gotta do this ministry stuff.

551
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:34,540
 I don't have time to stop and care for this person.

552
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:37,440
 That selfishness can rob you and I of being compassionate

553
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,200
 or the ability to be compassionate.

554
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,760
 I, man, I like, this one is so hard for me

555
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,000
 and so convicting to talk about, honestly,

556
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,500
 'cause this is a hard one for me.

557
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,680
 I can very easily be insensitive

558
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,560
 and those who know me well know that.

559
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:54,200
 I can be, I can frustrate teammates

560
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,200
 or people that I work with.

561
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,080
 I even asked our team today and I was like,

562
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,000
 hey, I'd love to know and I want the truth

563
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,120
 the ways that I have hurt you

564
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,460
 or the ways that I consistently,

565
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:07,020
 the parts of me that I just, I can hurt you.

566
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:10,480
 By the time they got done answering,

567
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,880
 I was like, I'd like a little less truth in this.

568
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,780
 (congregation laughing)

569
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,840
 And one of 'em, true story, one of 'em,

570
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,000
 I was like, I just wanna know,

571
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,800
 how does that manifest itself in me?

572
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,720
 How am I not compassionate or how am I not caring for you?

573
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,960
 And one, literally, she goes, oh, man, easy, got this.

574
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,840
 Ah, and I was like, (congregation laughing)

575
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,920
 maybe you take some time to think about it a little bit.

576
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,280
 And some of the ways that they said was,

577
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,840
 hey, you can be so distracted that you're not in the moment.

578
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,760
 You're like there, but you're not really,

579
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,800
 you can tell that your mind's somewhere else

580
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:42,080
 or you can cut people off and you don't listen fully

581
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,180
 to what they're trying to say

582
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,240
 'cause you think that they know

583
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,480
 or you think you know already what they're about to say.

584
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,480
 And I was like, man.

585
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,140
 Another one was, hey, sometimes,

586
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,940
 you can be distracted by your phone

587
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:58,320
 or by somebody emailing or somebody text messaging

588
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,360
 or something else going on.

589
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,920
 Another one said, you can just be insensitive

590
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,960
 to people with the words that you say.

591
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,160
 I can have a really strong first step

592
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,320
 in things that I don't, I'm just wired

593
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,440
 to where I have a strong first step

594
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,440
 and I don't always believe in it.

595
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,880
 I'm like, dude, we should get rid of these screens,

596
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,560
 get everything off the stage.

597
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,660
 And then in an hour, I'm like,

598
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:18,360
 ah, I don't even know if that's a good idea.

599
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,560
 But I can, in doing so, really wound people

600
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,960
 who put a lot of work into whatever

601
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,400
 my strong first step can attack.

602
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,620
 And it's just an insensitivity, not compassionate.

603
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,240
 And I, you may be like me, I need,

604
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,720
 this is an area where I go, thank God,

605
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,080
 I need you to just, I need you to take ground in my heart

606
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,160
 because I don't wanna be robbed

607
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,520
 of being able to be compassionate towards people.

608
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:43,520
 And I am, I'm insensitive and I hate it.

609
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,760
 We talk on our team a lot about,

610
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,760
 hey, the type of person that you wanna be here

611
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,920
 is not a James and John.

612
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,440
 You don't wanna be a, hey, here I am, look at me person.

613
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:55,720
 You wanna be a, man, there you are type of person.

614
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,240
 Like, if we divided everyone in the room,

615
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,920
 we said, man, there's two types of people in the world.

616
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:02,320
 There's the here I am, look at me, come on, check it out,

617
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,360
 holler at your girl, holler at your guy, here I am.

618
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,700
 This has got it going on.

619
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,880
 That type of person that's fighting for the spotlight,

620
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,580
 fighting for the attention.

621
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:12,840
 And then there's a, man, there you are person.

622
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,540
 Gosh, look at him, they're, oh, they're amazing.

623
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:17,380
 My whole day's made right now.

624
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:20,520
 And how we don't wanna be a here you are,

625
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,380
 the Bible and scripture unleashes,

626
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:25,900
 or says Christians are this type of there you are person

627
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,960
 unleashed into the world.

628
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,960
 And even that, man, is convicting as we just discussed.

629
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,160
 'Cause I, in neutral, I am not a there you are person.

630
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:38,120
 I'm a here I am person.

631
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:38,960
 And I hate it.

632
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,880
 There's people on our staff,

633
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,400
 there's a guy named John Elmore who's like,

634
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,920
 dude, he's like the best there you are person in the world.

635
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,840
 If you know him, you know that.

636
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,820
 If you don't, I can like, I can imitate him.

637
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:51,160
 He's like, oh my gosh, you're here.

638
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:54,200
 Oh, my day's made, look at it, he's here again.

639
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:57,000
 Look, he put on a shirt, this is amazing.

640
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,040
 He's incredible, he shaved today.

641
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,440
 Ah, you did it.

642
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,960
 And I'm like, man, that's awesome.

643
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,800
 Although I'm easy on the other end, I'm like,

644
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,280
 I am here, look at me.

645
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,660
 Yes, I put on a shirt, this is great.

646
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:12,040
 I'm like, gosh.

647
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,840
 Man, John, I wanna be more like you.

648
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,640
 I wanna be more like, man, there you are.

649
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,760
 My God is a God who's like, man, there you are.

650
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,860
 And even in telling that to John,

651
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:24,240
 if you tell John, man, I wanna be more like you, John,

652
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,280
 he'd be like, you wanna be more like Jesus.

653
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,220
 We all need to be.

654
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:32,080
 But a question for you is, man, are you a there you are

655
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,980
 or here I am person?

656
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:36,440
 And what ways do you need to surrender that?

657
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:40,120
 Like me, God, just take ground in more of our hearts.

658
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,680
 Jesus continues and he gives us the last thing

659
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:45,560
 that really selfishness will rob us of

660
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:50,240
 as he finishes up responding to these brothers.

661
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,960
 So he called all the disciples together,

662
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,020
 seeing their selfishness and seeing the way

663
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:58,120
 that they saw the world or sought to seek personal gain.

664
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,400
 He calls all of them together and he says,

665
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,760
 man, you're thinking wrong.

666
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:05,280
 He said, you know that the rulers of the Gentiles

667
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,920
 lord it over them.

668
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,840
 Like the rulers of this world, he essentially says,

669
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,140
 you know how the way that the world thinks?

670
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:14,680
 Where if you're in leadership or if you have power,

671
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:18,400
 whatever you can do to get me, me, me, me, me, you do it.

672
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,440
 They exercise authority over them.

673
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:24,240
 That's not how you're gonna think, not so with you.

674
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:27,100
 Instead, whoever wants to be great,

675
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:29,900
 and he introduces maybe the most revolutionary idea

676
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:33,940
 about greatness in history in the next sentence.

677
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:38,200
 That whoever wants to be great must be your servant.

678
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,900
 Whoever wants to be first must be your slave.

679
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:44,160
 Just as the son of man did not come to be served,

680
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,940
 that's Jesus, God in a bod shows up and he says,

681
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:50,280
 I'm not here to be served, but to serve

682
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:53,280
 and to lay down his life, to give it as a ransom for many.

683
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:57,820
 Jesus says, man, you guys,

684
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:59,660
 you think just like the world thinks.

685
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:04,440
 Like me first, me, me, me.

686
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,880
 How can I get first in line?

687
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,560
 What do they think about me?

688
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,880
 And he says, man, among my followers,

689
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,800
 it's not to be that way.

690
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,800
 You're not to be someone who seeks

691
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,800
 to get in the front of the line,

692
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,840
 you seek to serve those around you just like the savior

693
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,300
 that you worship and that you follow is.

694
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:25,320
 The third idea that really selfishness will rob you

695
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,880
 and I of is true greatness.

696
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,160
 The third thing that he says, man,

697
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,640
 if you wanna be robbed from selfishness,

698
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:33,320
 it will inhibit you to experiencing true greatness.

699
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,760
 You will never experience it.

700
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:39,160
 If you allow the greatness of the world to be your standard,

701
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,360
 or if you don't kill the selfishness inside of you,

702
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:45,280
 if you don't learn to be a servant of all,

703
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:48,400
 that selfishness will rob you and I of true greatness.

704
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,680
 But he says, my followers are to be revolutionary,

705
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:56,180
 unordinary in a world where selfishness is ordinary.

706
00:26:56,180 --> 00:27:01,180
 They are to unleash extraordinary selflessness

707
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:04,300
 and serve the world around them just like God did

708
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,220
 when he showed up on the planet.

709
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:07,980
 Just like Jesus did when he showed up,

710
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:08,980
 not going in and saying, man,

711
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:10,740
 do these people know how important I am?

712
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:13,680
 I'm freaking God, I created this place.

713
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:16,260
 But he said, I came here to serve, to care.

714
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:20,620
 And so it will be for my followers that they show up

715
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:23,040
 and the mentality that they have is not to be served,

716
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,860
 but in every situation to serve.

717
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:29,900
 And he redefines even what greatness is,

718
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:33,700
 which is so relevant and so hard for me to believe.

719
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,960
 Where he says, look, you guys think that greatness

720
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,720
 is whenever you have the job title,

721
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,200
 whenever you have the future marriage,

722
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,360
 if you're a super mom, if you're a super model,

723
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,720
 if you are a celebrity someday, if you're an athlete,

724
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:46,160
 a professional sports athlete,

725
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:49,920
 if you drive a certain car, you finally bought the house,

726
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:53,000
 you look a certain way, you have certain number of abs

727
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,060
 that can show through, whatever that is

728
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:57,960
 that you think greatness is, he says, you're off.

729
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,860
 If you want to be great,

730
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:01,160
 if you wanna wake up tomorrow morning,

731
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:05,040
 and man, this is like so huge for all of us

732
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,760
 to know and to believe.

733
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:09,660
 If you wanna be great tomorrow, you wake up and you serve.

734
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:13,420
 You seek to serve Jesus by serving others.

735
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:16,680
 I mean, here's what I know.

736
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,860
 I'm not the smartest cat in the book.

737
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:22,280
 I'm not the most talented, not the wealthiest,

738
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,820
 don't have the most resources, don't have the most gifts,

739
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:25,660
 but here's what I know.

740
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:27,920
 I can wake up tomorrow and I can be truly great

741
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:30,560
 because it doesn't involve any of those things.

742
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:34,040
 It involves being a servant in the name of Christ.

743
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,260
 And you can wake up, regardless of your story,

744
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:37,580
 regardless of where you are,

745
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:39,280
 regardless of where you work or don't work,

746
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,600
 regardless of the classes that you're in or not in

747
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,020
 or the major you didn't get into,

748
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:44,440
 you can wake up and you can experience,

749
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:47,880
 Jesus would say, true greatness.

750
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:51,900
 But it won't come from you serving yourself.

751
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,060
 You'll never get there.

752
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:56,140
 Crazy thing is like, I think we look,

753
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:58,760
 even the people who finally arrive in Standard of the World

754
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,400
 of like, man, that's so great up there,

755
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,580
 a celebrity or whatever.

756
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:04,700
 They always look back and they say, man, this thing is empty.

757
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,580
 There's no life here.

758
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,320
 This is not what greatness is.

759
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,180
 And down here, you're like, oh, dude,

760
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:13,140
 I can't really believe that.

761
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:14,680
 If I was there, it would be, I mean,

762
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:17,200
 the most recent example or most relevant example

763
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,440
 probably comes from Tom Brady, who,

764
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,740
 you guys watch the Super Bowl?

765
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:22,860
 Everybody see this?

766
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:26,860
 Dude, crazy, Brady, gosh, man, retire already, buddy.

767
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:27,860
 You're over the hill.

768
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:32,320
 And Tom was, I mean, unbelievable comeback.

769
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,980
 If you didn't watch it, man, you gotta get a TV or something

770
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:38,060
 but inside of the game, he did what no person

771
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:39,100
 has ever done in NFL history.

772
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,660
 First quarterback with five Super Bowl rings.

773
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:43,220
 They're calling him the GOAT, the greatest of all time.

774
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:45,980
 They're saying, or he set records in terms of,

775
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:47,880
 hey, it's never been that big of a deficit

776
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,120
 that someone's come back for.

777
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,640
 I mean, just unbelievable.

778
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:55,960
 And you would think that him and even just like his story,

779
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,320
 his life, that he would be someone

780
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,280
 that looks around at the world and says,

781
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,880
 man, yeah, this is pretty, this is where life is.

782
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,400
 I mean, he's married to Gisele,

783
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,960
 who's not just like, not just any model.

784
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,760
 She's like the supermodel of supermodels,

785
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,080
 Victoria's Secret model.

786
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,360
 He's got the life that you would think,

787
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,960
 hey, $60 million.

788
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,560
 It's like, dude, if anybody would say,

789
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,960
 man, this is what greatness is, it would be you.

790
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:20,100
 And yet, in interviews that you read that he's done,

791
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,260
 he would say the very opposite.

792
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:22,340
 Man, this is not where life is.

793
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:23,180
 There's something else out there.

794
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:25,820
 In fact, 60 Minutes did an interview with him not long ago

795
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:27,580
 where he said this inside of the interview,

796
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:29,080
 and I just thought I'd read it.

797
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:33,300
 Why do I have three, Tom Brady speaking,

798
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,220
 he's been interviewed.

799
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,820
 Why do I have three Super Bowl rings,

800
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:37,940
 or you could insert five now,

801
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:41,900
 and still think there's something greater out there for me?

802
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:45,300
 I mean, a lot of people would say, hey, man, this is it.

803
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:49,220
 I reached my goal, my dream, my life.

804
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:52,220
 But me, I think, God, there's gotta be

805
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:54,420
 more than this out there.

806
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:59,100
 I mean, this can't be all that it's cracked up to be.

807
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,840
 It's got everything that everyone wants,

808
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,940
 and I'm still not satisfied.

809
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:05,140
 It's not that great.

810
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:09,120
 And the reporter asked him, what's the answer?

811
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:14,080
 I wish I knew, Tom says.

812
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,380
 I wish I knew what the answer is.

813
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:21,380
 But Tom will eventually find out,

814
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,360
 if he doesn't find out on this side of eternity

815
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,440
 is the answer to where greatness is found

816
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,040
 is always found in a person named Jesus.

817
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,880
 And if he ever experiences that greatness,

818
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,120
 if he ever experiences just that satisfaction,

819
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,360
 you can hear it in the aching of his words.

820
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,080
 You almost just wanna leap off the page and say,

821
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,960
 Tom, it's Jesus!

822
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,760
 It's only in him that you're gonna find it.

823
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:46,120
 It's no Super Bowl rings, no amount of success,

824
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,160
 no marriage, no woman, no man

825
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,000
 that's ever gonna satisfy you.

826
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,720
 It's only in knowing and serving Jesus.

827
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:56,040
 And if you ever experience that, Tom,

828
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:59,400
 or insert your name, it'll be found in knowing Jesus

829
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,460
 and serving him.

830
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:02,720
 By serving the world around you,

831
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,120
 Jesus says you wanna be great.

832
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,920
 You wanna wake up tomorrow and experience greatness.

833
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,040
 Don't fall for the same selfish lie

834
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,480
 the world around you of looking out for me first,

835
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:14,920
 me first, but seek to serve, and you'll experience that.

836
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:18,520
 I think a message like this, it begs the question of,

837
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,880
 like, man, how do I do this?

838
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:22,600
 How do I just become less self-focused?

839
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,720
 Like, I don't wanna be this.

840
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,520
 I wanna be like, oh man, that's amazing.

841
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,400
 I wanna genuinely celebrate stuff

842
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,300
 that God's doing in your life.

843
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:29,800
 I wanna be compassionate.

844
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,600
 I wanna be experiencing true greatness.

845
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,700
 My knee jerk is I just wanna serve.

846
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:37,840
 Or just try harder.

847
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,880
 Just say, man, I'm not gonna do it anymore.

848
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:40,800
 I'm not gonna care about me.

849
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,920
 I'm gonna stop looking at me

850
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,880
 and look over there and care for people.

851
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,400
 It doesn't work.

852
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,800
 Scripture never teaches that.

853
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:52,180
 Scripture tells us that the way that you and I

854
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:55,720
 take our eyes off of ourself is by placing them on Jesus.

855
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,200
 We redirect our focus.

856
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,920
 We take the way that we'll experience freedom

857
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:02,040
 from all of just the wants and the desires and the self,

858
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,960
 me, me, me, me, me, me, me, and I'm so worried about me,

859
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,680
 me, me, the way that we stop looking at ourself

860
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,600
 is not by just trying harder, shutting our eyes,

861
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:11,800
 is by redirecting our eyes or redirecting our attention

862
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,000
 and placing it on Jesus.

863
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,920
 And the more that you and I look at Jesus,

864
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:18,320
 the more we begin to look like Jesus.

865
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,560
 Now stay with me 'cause you're like, man,

866
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,880
 it's so like, it's tweetable,

867
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:24,560
 but I don't know what that means.

868
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,380
 Stay with me.

869
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:28,640
 Because in Jesus, we find the answer

870
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,760
 to the thing that we really want.

871
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,880
 All these different like things,

872
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,240
 our heart's crying out for, I want this,

873
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,300
 I want this, I want this.

874
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,320
 It's in a moment where we turn our attention

875
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:37,120
 and day by day, turn our attention to him,

876
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,720
 we experience the thing we've always wanted,

877
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:43,480
 the thing we most deeply want, which is him.

878
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:47,980
 My son is 13 months old and I'm gonna land the plane here.

879
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:49,520
 We are about to land the plane.

880
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,700
 He is at the stage where he's like

881
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:54,960
 trying to figure out how to talk and he can't talk.

882
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,560
 And so when he wants things, he's also going through this,

883
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,120
 like, hey, I want everything.

884
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,200
 So he will just go, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma,

885
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,600
 whatever the thing is, whether it's like,

886
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,400
 hey, that's a knife, you can't have that, buddy,

887
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,280
 you'll poke yourself.

888
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:10,640
 Or it's this plate or these keys or milk or whatever, ball.

889
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,760
 And so we'll just walk around and he's constantly going,

890
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,360
 I want, I want, I want.

891
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:18,680
 And there's one thing that we have that like

892
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:21,360
 is the only thing that whenever it's in front of his face,

893
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,760
 that's the only thing that he wants.

894
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,440
 He always wants it more than everything else there.

895
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,440
 It's this like stuffed animal doll that he sleeps with,

896
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:31,280
 they puppy, it's actually a dog toy, but he loves it.

897
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,440
 And so anytime he's like, oh, I want, I want,

898
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,400
 we'll like pull out puppy and he just grabs it

899
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,280
 and he holds on.

900
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,640
 It's the thing that no matter what he says I want,

901
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:42,880
 he always wants it more,

902
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:46,400
 whether or not he even realizes it until he sees it.

903
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,520
 This is the way that it is with Jesus in your life

904
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,160
 and in my life, whatever you think like, man,

905
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:54,480
 I just want that so bad, God, give it to me.

906
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,320
 At the end of the day, the thing that all of us

907
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:00,220
 want more than any of that, whether or not you realize it,

908
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,880
 it's him, it's Jesus.

909
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,600
 Like a child who in a moment says, look,

910
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,520
 whatever I was wanting, all of a sudden,

911
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:12,260
 when I see that stuffed animal, my attention is redirected.

912
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:13,480
 I want that more.

913
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,440
 In the same way, you and I,

914
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,920
 whatever that you find yourself going,

915
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:17,960
 I'm just can't get over this.

916
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:18,880
 I'm so worried about this.

917
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,040
 The more that you see, the more your attention,

918
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,380
 once it is placed on Jesus,

919
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:25,420
 you see the thing that you've always wanted more.

920
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:26,880
 You always will want more.

921
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,680
 The thing that whether or not you realize it,

922
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:32,380
 you want more than anything in this world, which is him.

923
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:38,200
 And the level to which you and I will experience that

924
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:42,520
 will be found in our turning attention on him.

925
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,440
 Now, how do you do that?

926
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,160
 Because you're like, man, that sounds so good,

927
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,320
 but how do I actually do that?

928
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,540
 That's why we do everything that we do here at Watermark.

929
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:50,720
 That's why we do community groups.

930
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,760
 That's why we do the ports.

931
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,480
 That's why the Shane sing the songs that they do

932
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,440
 is to get all of our attention.

933
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,620
 We're just gonna look at Jesus.

934
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,240
 We're gonna help one another, look at Jesus.

935
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,280
 I need to look at his character, at his love,

936
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,840
 at who he is revealed in God's word.

937
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,360
 I need to be reminded of what is true,

938
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,240
 what he says about me, what he did on the cross,

939
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,320
 how he changed the world,

940
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,240
 and on the calendar I dated today,

941
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,680
 it spoke of the time that he was on this planet.

942
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,720
 I need to look at him, and in doing so,

943
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,120
 I begin to experience freedom

944
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:15,180
 from all these things that I think that I want,

945
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:17,120
 and I begin to experience satisfaction

946
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,900
 by looking at the one that I've always wanted more,

947
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:23,560
 that we help one another.

948
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,080
 That involves looking at his word,

949
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:28,160
 knowing who he is, walking day by day in prayer,

950
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,500
 studying his word with other people in our life,

951
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:34,280
 walking with him, and you begin to see him.

952
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:38,440
 The scripture says you begin to be changed when you see him.

953
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:41,280
 If you've ever wondered how people have changed here,

954
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,760
 that's the answer.

955
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:46,600
 They begin to see Jesus, and the things of this world

956
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:52,360
 begin to grow dim in the light of his glory and grace,

957
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,240
 and they're changed.

958
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:57,480
 And if you experience that, you will be too.

959
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:00,600
 I'm afraid that would be the case.

960
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,120
 Father, we love you, we thank you

961
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,400
 that you are patient with us,

962
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:08,760
 that you, despite our selfish,

963
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,760
 my selfish, self-centered heart,

964
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:15,280
 full of entitlement and pride and envy,

965
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,920
 man, God, you are slow to anger,

966
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,400
 abounding in steadfast love.

967
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,780
 You are patient with us.

968
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,400
 Thank you that you came and you died in our place,

969
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,160
 that you're God, man, I don't even know

970
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,520
 how to say thank you for that,

971
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,780
 that you're God who didn't come to be served,

972
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:33,160
 but to serve, you gave your life for me,

973
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,200
 for my friends here.

974
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,880
 What kind of love is this?

975
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:38,360
 What kind of God are you?

976
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:41,560
 The one who is there.

977
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:44,280
 Father, would you allow us to see Jesus more in our lives?

978
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,000
 For anyone who doesn't know Jesus,

979
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,520
 would tonight be their night?

980
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,480
 They step into a relationship with a God

981
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,480
 who doesn't want something from them,

982
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,400
 but wants them to know what he did for them.

983
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,240
 Would that happen?

984
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,320
 Father, we worship you now in song, amen.
