[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:18.320]   - Love it, hey, welcome friends in the room,
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.540]   friends of Fort Worth, Houston, El Paso,
[00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:22.580]   Rogers, Arkansas, Phoenix, wherever you're joining us from,
[00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:23.420]   we're so glad that you're here,
[00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.940]   and especially friends here, we're glad that you are here.
[00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.460]   Tonight, we have got a treat, a friend of ours,
[00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.340]   a young adult pastor in town named Tripp Lee is joining us,
[00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.660]   we're gonna take a departure,
[00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.380]   and he is from Concord Church,
[00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:36.900]   a church that we love dearly.
[00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.580]   So will you guys put your hands together for Tripp,
[00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.380]   who's coming to teach us from God's word.
[00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.380]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.860]   - Thanks, man.
[00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.140]   All right.
[00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.500]   How's everybody doing?
[00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.820]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.100]   Good, excited to be here with you tonight.
[00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.220]   Um, I just wanna shout out real quick,
[00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.740]   my wife is here, y'all say hi Jess.
[00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.020]   - Hi Jess.
[00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.500]   - And we also got some folks from Concord,
[00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.660]   some of our young adult leaders
[00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:09.940]   who are here hanging out in the front,
[00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.140]   y'all just make some noise for them real quick,
[00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.980]   hanging with us.
[00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.220]   (audience cheering)
[00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:17.580]   Excited to be here with y'all.
[00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.780]   One of the ways that we know
[00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.380]   there may be some cultural difference
[00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:21.900]   between the churches is
[00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.320]   that when the sports activities were listed,
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.520]   it was like soccer and softball,
[00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.520]   and ultimate frisbee,
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.940]   and spike ball.
[00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.180]   What is spike ball?
[00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.660]   I've never even heard of that.
[00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.500]   There are whole sports
[00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.140]   that y'all are keeping from black people.
[00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.820]   All right, first,
[00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.420]   ours would have been like basketball,
[00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.660]   three on three basketball,
[00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:52.020]   knockout, you know, those kinds of basketball related things.
[00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.060]   Again, I'm excited to be here with y'all tonight
[00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.180]   and to preach God's word.
[00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.540]   I'm grateful for Watermark,
[00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.340]   grateful for the porch,
[00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.420]   love what y'all are doing
[00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.460]   and excited to serve you.
[00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.220]   So I wanna pray one more time
[00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.900]   and we'll dive right in.
[00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:11.040]   Father, we thank you so much for your word.
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.020]   God, thank you for everybody who's here tonight, Lord.
[00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.580]   Thank you for bringing them.
[00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:17.940]   God, we know that you love them,
[00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.020]   you care for them, Father.
[00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.060]   So we pray this will be a good use of our time.
[00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.420]   We pray you would speak through your word, Father.
[00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.260]   We pray you would unearth the stuff in our life
[00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.580]   that doesn't look like you.
[00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.140]   God, I pray for my friends who don't know you,
[00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.340]   help them to see you, God.
[00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.740]   I pray for my friends who know you,
[00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.460]   help them to see you more.
[00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.000]   We ask in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.660]   Amen.
[00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.740]   Well, David just gave me a,
[00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.580]   just told you real quick who I am,
[00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:46.700]   just to tell you a little bit more
[00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:47.980]   so you know who you're listening to.
[00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.860]   I'm from Dallas, grew up here,
[00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.260]   lived a couple other places before I just came back.
[00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.980]   But God has been really gracious,
[00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.940]   and when I was really young,
[00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.000]   I was maybe about 14 years old,
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.780]   the Lord took someone like me,
[00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.580]   who I had assumed, because I grew up in Dallas,
[00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.340]   which as you know is a really churchy place,
[00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.420]   and I grew up just assuming that I was a Christian,
[00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.500]   just because I went to church with my family
[00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.380]   and I had repeated a prayer after a children's pastor,
[00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.940]   and that made me think that I was a Christian.
[00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.460]   And so I assumed it for a long time,
[00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:22.840]   and then fast forward,
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.260]   you know, I got drugged to church by my parents
[00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.460]   when I was 13 and 14,
[00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:30.580]   and you know, there was a sign up
[00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.740]   for like a summer retreat for the youth,
[00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:34.460]   and I was like, I'm not trying to sign up for that,
[00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:36.500]   and then I seen some cute girls in line,
[00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.020]   I was like, I'm gonna go sign up for that,
[00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.860]   and I did.
[00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.460]   [audience laughing]
[00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:43.900]   Really bad reasons, but the Lord had better ones,
[00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.540]   because the youth pastor at Concord,
[00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.900]   Concord is a church where I met Jesus,
[00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.660]   and the youth pastor was a good youth pastor,
[00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.420]   meaning we did more than just have fun,
[00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.700]   he also opened a Bible and preached the gospel of Jesus.
[00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.800]   And as he opened a Bible and preached the gospel,
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.420]   the stuff that I hadn't understood
[00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.400]   that I assumed about myself being a Christian before,
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.700]   about who God was, who I was, what Jesus did,
[00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.620]   the Lord made that stuff clear to me.
[00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.140]   And so since then, the Lord has given me the opportunity
[00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.600]   to be able to, yeah, do what my heart beats for,
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.300]   which is I wanna help people see the same Jesus
[00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:18.820]   that I've been shown.
[00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.180]   And so I'm praying we have the opportunity
[00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.180]   to do that tonight, I've tried to do that in a lot of ways,
[00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.820]   with music and with preaching God's word,
[00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.060]   and I'm excited to do that tonight.
[00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.500]   What I wanna talk about tonight is the state of your faith.
[00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.000]   I wanna talk to you about the state of your faith,
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.140]   and it'll become clear what I mean by that.
[00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:42.060]   One of the problems with talking about something like this,
[00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.500]   one of the problems with how we think about our faith
[00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.660]   is this, is that those who call themselves Christians,
[00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.380]   we sometimes see our faith as a finished product
[00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.700]   instead of a work in progress.
[00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.060]   We think about our faith, we just think of it
[00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.420]   as a finished product instead of a work in progress,
[00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:00.900]   and when we are confused about what stage we're in,
[00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.340]   everything is thrown off, and this is in every area
[00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:04.940]   of our life.
[00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.920]   So we're all familiar with the phrase
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.540]   that kids will say on a long trip.
[00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:11.820]   What is that phrase?
[00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.060]   Are we there yet?
[00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.960]   You know, before I had kids, I thought that this was fake.
[00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.320]   I thought this was like a funny thing in movies,
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.160]   and if you don't have kids, I just wanna let you know,
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.080]   this is real.
[00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.320]   The kids actually say this, and they say it so often
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.720]   that you really wanna be like, if you wanna be there,
[00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.120]   you can just get out right now,
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.460]   and we can just keep going where we're going.
[00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.500]   But kids ask that over and over again,
[00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:37.440]   but it's not just kids.
[00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.400]   We all do this too in different ways.
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.480]   Just think about when you're on a trip somewhere,
[00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.640]   even if you know, so like, you know,
[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:48.640]   we're on the way from Dallas up here,
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.680]   and we're looking at our phones, and as we drive,
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.240]   even if you know how long it's gonna take,
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.200]   you keep looking.
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:58.020]   Even if you know you got a good 45 minutes left,
[00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:01.320]   you still looking like, well, how long we got left?
[00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.160]   Just hoping that it gets there a little bit closer.
[00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.940]   You know, some of us, while we're at school or at work,
[00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:07.740]   we spend more time looking at the clock
[00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:10.560]   than we do our actual work, just hoping that somehow
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.000]   we can will time to go a lot faster.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.440]   We're constantly asking this question, are we there yet?
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:16.720]   And here's what happens.
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.340]   Once we assume that we've arrived, what do we do?
[00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:21.560]   We relax.
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:23.640]   You're happy when you make it to your destination.
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:24.680]   So it's a good thing.
[00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:27.300]   The only problem comes in is when you think
[00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:29.380]   you've already made it to your destination,
[00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:30.400]   but you're still on the way,
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.520]   because then you've relaxed way too early,
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.160]   when you think the task is over.
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:37.200]   So here's what happens.
[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:40.680]   When we assume that our faith is just this one-time event
[00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.840]   that gets us entry into the kingdom,
[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.640]   when we assume that with our faith,
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:47.800]   we've already arrived, that's a problem,
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.360]   because I think what scripture shows is
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.800]   just because we believed doesn't mean we've arrived.
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.440]   If you walk away with one thing today,
[00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:57.520]   I want it to be that just because you've believed in Jesus
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:59.120]   does not mean you've arrived,
[00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.800]   because when we treat our faith like a finished product
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:05.300]   instead of a work in progress, it will get neglected.
[00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.100]   It means we will relax too early
[00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:09.560]   because we think we will have arrived.
[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:12.700]   So what I wanna do is I wanna look at just two points
[00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:13.720]   in a particular text.
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.880]   If you turn with me to 1 Thessalonians chapter three.
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:19.880]   1 Thessalonians chapter three, that should be on the screen.
[00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:24.040]   And I'll read.
[00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:30.280]   In this text, Paul is writing to some Christians
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:34.560]   in Thessalonica, and here's what he says to 'em.
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:37.360]   He says, "So when we could stand it no longer,
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:40.360]   "we thought it best to be left by ourselves in Athens.
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.520]   "We sent Timothy, who's our brother and coworker
[00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:45.200]   "in God's service and spread in the gospel of Christ,
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:48.000]   "to strengthen and encourage you in your faith
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.440]   "so that no one would be unsettled by these trials.
[00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:53.920]   "For you know quite well that we are destined for them.
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:54.940]   "In fact, when we were with you,
[00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:56.920]   "we kept telling you that we'd be persecuted,
[00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:59.280]   "and it turned out that way, as you well know.
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.460]   "For this reason, when I could stand it no longer,
[00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:04.400]   "I sent to find out about your faith.
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:07.400]   "I was afraid that in some way the tempter had tempted you
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:10.480]   "and that our labors might have been in vain."
[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:13.160]   We'll stop there, we'll read a little bit more as we go.
[00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:16.120]   But I wanna look at this passage in two points
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:19.120]   to remind us that just because we believe
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.200]   doesn't mean we've arrived.
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:23.200]   And the first one is this, your faith needs work.
[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:25.440]   So I don't assume that everybody in this room
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:27.100]   is a believer in Jesus.
[00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:31.320]   But for those of us who are, I don't want you to think
[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:32.360]   that because you're a believer,
[00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:34.600]   you've arrived at the end destination.
[00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:37.240]   So the first one is this, your faith needs work.
[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:38.300]   Here's what I don't mean.
[00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:40.600]   I don't mean that Jesus will not save you
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:42.280]   until you do a bunch of good works.
[00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:44.080]   What we know about Jesus is,
[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:47.920]   Jesus is perfectly capable of saving us on his own.
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:49.520]   And what Jesus did on the cross
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:51.840]   is he purchased our salvation.
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:53.480]   So I'm not saying for Jesus to save you,
[00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:56.020]   you have to add some stuff to what he's already done.
[00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:59.440]   But I am saying this, faith is not a one-time event
[00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:00.560]   that we look back on.
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:02.200]   Faith is a lifestyle.
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:04.760]   Faith is a lens that we see everything else through.
[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:08.400]   Faith is fuel for every good work that we do.
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:11.380]   And so I wanna ask you how you would respond
[00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:13.700]   and if I was to ask you just a simple question,
[00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:15.540]   how's your faith?
[00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:16.380]   Just think about that for a second.
[00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:19.400]   How would you respond if I asked you, how's your faith?
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:24.280]   And when I ask you that, do you just think about
[00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:26.780]   some one-time event that happened a long time ago
[00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:28.420]   when you walked down an aisle
[00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:31.220]   and you repeated a prayer like I did when I was a kid?
[00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:32.940]   And I hope not.
[00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:35.220]   Because as Paul writes to these Christians
[00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:37.360]   in Thessalonica, he's writing to these folks
[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:40.640]   who he went there and he preached the gospel, right?
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:43.220]   And Jesus saved some people.
[00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:45.820]   And what happens is people get mad at Paul
[00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:46.660]   for preaching the gospel.
[00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:48.020]   So he ends up getting pushed out
[00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:50.980]   and Paul writes back to them, right?
[00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:53.860]   And he sends Timothy to go check on them, right?
[00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:55.700]   So this is why he says in verse one,
[00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:56.820]   "We could stand in no longer.
[00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:59.000]   "We thought it best to be left by ourselves in Athens.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.600]   "We sent Timothy, who was our brother and coworker
[00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:04.140]   "in God's service and spread in the gospel of Christ
[00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:06.360]   "to strengthen and encourage you in your faith
[00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:08.960]   "so that no one would be unsettled by these trials.
[00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:12.760]   "For you know quite well that we are destined for them."
[00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:15.740]   Paul sends Timothy almost like a doctor making a house call
[00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:18.260]   to check on their spiritual health,
[00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:19.780]   to give them a little bit of a dose
[00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:22.780]   of what they need to continue to grow in health.
[00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:25.860]   But the fact that Timothy was sent to check on their faith
[00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:28.940]   should tell us something about what faith is like,
[00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:32.000]   that faith is something that needs to be sustained
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.440]   and checked in on.
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:36.560]   So I know y'all are in this series talking about self-care.
[00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:39.800]   Well, Paul wants the Thessalonians to understand
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:41.680]   that even though you've believed in Jesus,
[00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:44.440]   there's still some care that needs to happen, right?
[00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:47.160]   You're not at the end yet.
[00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.520]   So why does Paul think that the Thessalonians' faith
[00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:51.200]   would need to be checked in on?
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:53.860]   There's something specific about the Thessalonians.
[00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:55.640]   Well, what Paul understands about them
[00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:58.280]   is that their faith is fragile.
[00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:00.880]   That they are fragile, and the same thing is true about us,
[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:03.420]   that we are fragile.
[00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:06.360]   I wonder if you ever think of yourself as fragile.
[00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:10.400]   That's not a way we like to think of ourselves.
[00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:11.820]   We like to think of ourselves as strong,
[00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:13.400]   especially dudes in here.
[00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:15.720]   We don't like anybody to see any weakness ever.
[00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:16.840]   That's why half of y'all get hurt
[00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:18.240]   every time you go to the gym.
[00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:21.720]   You just trying to live all kind of way.
[00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:24.320]   You know you, like you have never lifted this before, bro.
[00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:25.280]   Why do you think?
[00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:29.040]   Just praying before like the Lord is,
[00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:30.600]   if the Lord wants you to stop being a fool,
[00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:32.720]   that's what he would like.
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:35.040]   That's what you need power for.
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:36.560]   We don't like to think of ourselves as fragile.
[00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:38.800]   We like to think of ourselves as strong,
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:40.600]   and our pride blinds us to this.
[00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:43.440]   But there's a reason why when people trust Jesus,
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:46.200]   the Bible uses the language of new birth, right?
[00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:49.160]   'Cause when a new child is born, they're fragile.
[00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:50.960]   My sister had a baby recently,
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:54.000]   and I was just reminded that babies are so fragile.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.720]   And you know, not to be rude to babies,
[00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:58.020]   but they can't do nothing.
[00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:02.280]   I mean, they can't do anything.
[00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:05.640]   You know, like my niece, she can't even hold her head up.
[00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:07.720]   It's like, if there's one baseline
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:08.820]   of something you can do for yourself,
[00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:10.400]   just keep your head up.
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:11.720]   And she can't even do that.
[00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:14.040]   And there's nothing wrong with her, she's just fragile.
[00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:16.120]   But this is the kind of language the Bible uses
[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:18.080]   of those of us who just started to follow Jesus,
[00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:19.920]   is we're babies.
[00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:21.680]   We're fragile, we need to be cared for.
[00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:24.320]   And it's not that the life hasn't really begun,
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:26.380]   it's that that life needs to be cared for
[00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:28.520]   in order to be sustained.
[00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:30.120]   It needs to be looked after.
[00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:31.480]   And there are all kinds of strength
[00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:34.440]   that's needed to build that up.
[00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:35.880]   So let me give you another example.
[00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:39.480]   My wife is here tonight, and she's great at many things.
[00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:42.320]   And she has given me permission to say this.
[00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:45.240]   But my wife is great at so many things.
[00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:47.240]   I mean, I could give you a long list.
[00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:49.240]   One of the things that she's not good at
[00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:52.200]   is keeping plants alive.
[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:53.680]   [audience laughs]
[00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:56.420]   My wife, she loves plants.
[00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:59.900]   I'm of the belief that plants are outside for a reason.
[00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:02.060]   That's why they should stay in the ground outside.
[00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:06.460]   My wife loves to have plants on the inside of our house.
[00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:08.700]   But what happens is, they always die
[00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:10.940]   terrible, painful deaths.
[00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:14.660]   And so she always kills them.
[00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:15.900]   And you know how the Bible says,
[00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:18.020]   you say you love your brother, but do you really?
[00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:19.220]   That's how I feel about her and plants.
[00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:21.140]   I'm like, you say you love them, but do you?
[00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:24.240]   Because she's a serial plant killer.
[00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:25.460]   And because of that,
[00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:30.240]   I felt like I had to put my foot down and be like,
[00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:32.940]   I don't think we can have plants in our house anymore.
[00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:35.180]   Because it's unjust.
[00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:38.080]   And though the exception I made was this,
[00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:40.020]   if those plants are fake.
[00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:42.800]   Because here's the great thing about fake plants,
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:44.120]   is that they're fake.
[00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:46.200]   And you don't have to pay attention to them.
[00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:47.720]   You can't kill a fake plant.
[00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:48.880]   You don't have to water it.
[00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:50.480]   You don't have to put it in front of the sun.
[00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:54.180]   You can forget that the plant exists for four years
[00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:56.680]   and come back and the plant looks exactly the same.
[00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:59.320]   Fake plants are wonderful in that way.
[00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:01.480]   And here's what happens.
[00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:05.260]   Is sometimes we treat our faith like it's that fake plant.
[00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:06.580]   Like it's something that exists
[00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:08.460]   that we can forget about entirely.
[00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:09.680]   That we don't have to water.
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:11.620]   That we don't have to put in front of the sun.
[00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:14.280]   It doesn't need anything to thrive and grow or flourish.
[00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:16.460]   And we expect to show up and for it to be
[00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:18.240]   in exactly the same state.
[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:19.260]   But that's not true.
[00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.940]   Our faith is more like a real living plant
[00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:23.700]   that needs stuff in order to grow.
[00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:26.980]   That needs things in order to thrive and to flourish.
[00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:28.580]   And what Paul is saying is,
[00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:30.580]   I've sent Timothy to check up on you
[00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:32.340]   because there are things that need to happen
[00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:34.740]   if your faith is gonna survive.
[00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:40.140]   Timothy's checking in on them to see how they're doing.
[00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:42.660]   'Cause believing in Jesus doesn't mean that you've arrived.
[00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:45.580]   And so Paul understands that there are dangers in our world
[00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:47.700]   that are a threat to our faith.
[00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:48.540]   One to attack.
[00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:50.020]   And Paul talks about two threats.
[00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:52.420]   In verse three, he says he doesn't want anyone
[00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:54.860]   to be unsettled by these trials.
[00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:56.100]   In verse five he says,
[00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:59.800]   I was afraid that in some way the tempter had tempted you.
[00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:02.100]   Our faith is under attack by temptation,
[00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:06.140]   pushback from the world and from the devil.
[00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:08.420]   So this is part of what is important about
[00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:09.900]   not seeing our faith as a finished product
[00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:11.660]   is not ignoring the threats.
[00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:14.400]   And so I wanna talk about those two threats he talks about.
[00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:16.700]   One of them is trials.
[00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:19.140]   This is one of the things that's a threat to our faith.
[00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:21.100]   He's talking mainly about affliction
[00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:23.360]   that comes from persecution.
[00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:25.940]   People opposing them because they follow Jesus.
[00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:28.400]   'Cause remember, Paul got pushed out of this place
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:29.820]   for preaching Jesus.
[00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:31.140]   And they were persecuted
[00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:33.420]   in ways much harder than we are today.
[00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:39.180]   But even so, that pushback can make us wanna leave Jesus.
[00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:40.660]   Because people do push back
[00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:42.200]   when you are serious about Jesus.
[00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:44.060]   I remember when I first started following Jesus
[00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:44.900]   in high school,
[00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:46.860]   there was a lot of people who,
[00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:48.820]   they were cool with me liking Jesus,
[00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:50.440]   as long as I didn't like him enough
[00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:51.940]   to actually do what he said.
[00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:55.580]   When I began to try to do what Jesus said,
[00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:56.460]   that's when people were like,
[00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:57.700]   Tripp, what are you doing, bro?
[00:15:57.700 --> 00:15:59.280]   You're doing too much.
[00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:00.620]   You extra.
[00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:01.460]   I'm a Christian too.
[00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:03.820]   Why you out here trying to be a super Christian?
[00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:07.460]   But I thought I was just doing what Jesus called me to do.
[00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:09.860]   He's saying these trials, this pushback,
[00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:12.100]   and the reason that that's a threat to our faith
[00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:13.620]   is because this human instinct
[00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:17.780]   to always wanna lead towards whatever seems easier to us.
[00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:20.020]   Right, if you touch the stove and it hurts you,
[00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:21.460]   try not to touch the stove again.
[00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:23.940]   In the same way, there's something in our minds and hearts
[00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:26.900]   that says, if I said that and I got this kind of pushback,
[00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:28.520]   I just won't say that anymore.
[00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:30.940]   So Paul is saying that could tempt us
[00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:33.740]   to walk away from Jesus.
[00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:38.240]   But avoiding trials and avoiding pain is not worth that.
[00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:40.380]   The other kind of trials too, besides persecution,
[00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:43.180]   that can threaten our faith, losing a loved one,
[00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:48.100]   losing a job, mental illness, disease,
[00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:51.580]   being broke, being lonely, right?
[00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:53.760]   That kind of stuff, those kind of trials can shake us
[00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:54.600]   if we're not careful.
[00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:56.940]   Not only trials, but also the tempter.
[00:16:56.940 --> 00:16:59.020]   He talks about the tempter, Satan.
[00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:01.020]   Satan can also tempt us away.
[00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:03.340]   Satan can make all kind of stuff seem
[00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:05.060]   more appealing to us than Jesus.
[00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:06.160]   He'll throw sin at us.
[00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:08.340]   He'll throw doubts at us.
[00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:11.180]   Satan, he has authority in this world.
[00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:13.300]   I don't know if we recognize that Satan
[00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:15.820]   is a master of false advertising.
[00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:18.820]   He knows how to make stuff look better than Jesus.
[00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:21.740]   This is why Paul is saying this is danger for the tempter.
[00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:25.700]   You ever seen like a commercial for some food on TV
[00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:27.480]   and then when you see it in person, you're like,
[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:30.060]   that is not what y'all said.
[00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:31.820]   Every time I see Wendy's with them pictures
[00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:34.280]   of them perfectly square burger patties, I'm like,
[00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:36.340]   now y'all know them patties don't look like that.
[00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:38.900]   Them others is never square, they look real jagged.
[00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:43.260]   Or you know, one time me and my wife was watching TV
[00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:46.060]   and they, Taco Bell, was it Taco Bell?
[00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:48.480]   It's probably good that I don't remember where it was from.
[00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:51.560]   But they were advertising Mac and Cheetos.
[00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:54.460]   Ew, that's right, whoever said that.
[00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:57.940]   Ew, that's not how I would have said it, but it's true.
[00:17:57.940 --> 00:17:59.860]   Mac and Cheetos, which sounds disgusting,
[00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:01.200]   but they were trying to make it seem like
[00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:03.900]   it was revolutionary and amazing.
[00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:05.260]   And this is what Satan does,
[00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:07.620]   is he will all the time,
[00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:10.420]   Satan came up with Mac and Cheetos, just playing.
[00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:13.460]   No, but this is what Satan does though,
[00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:16.220]   is he will take something that's not good,
[00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:17.740]   that's not good for your soul,
[00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:19.620]   that's not good for the people around you,
[00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:23.020]   and he will try to sell it to us like it's good.
[00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:24.940]   This is what he does.
[00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:27.700]   And convince us that it won't make shipwreck
[00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:29.300]   of our life and our faith.
[00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:30.900]   And Paul is saying, look,
[00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:32.620]   I'm sending Timothy to check on y'all.
[00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:35.340]   My prayer is that trials and temptation
[00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:37.140]   won't have pushed you away from Jesus.
[00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:40.580]   And I'll say this, that whenever I've talked to people
[00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:43.420]   who don't wanna follow Jesus anymore,
[00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:45.760]   it's always because of one of these two dangers,
[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:48.500]   because of some kind of pain or some kind of sin.
[00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:50.540]   That we're hurt by something,
[00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:52.980]   or hurt by somebody that makes us reassess
[00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:54.260]   what we think about Jesus.
[00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:56.260]   Or some kind of sin draws us away
[00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:59.020]   and it makes us reassess what we think about Jesus.
[00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:01.900]   And we are vulnerable in those moments.
[00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:05.660]   So if you are in a season of trial or season of temptation,
[00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:08.340]   I wanna ask you to guard yourself.
[00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:10.020]   To watch out for these dangers.
[00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:13.060]   I wanna encourage you to watch out for each other.
[00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:15.860]   Right, if you know a friend who's in a season
[00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:17.720]   of a lot of trial or temptation,
[00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:19.940]   I wanna encourage you to watch out for each other.
[00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:21.980]   Because when we understand we're under attack,
[00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:23.560]   it changes our posture.
[00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:25.780]   Changes our posture.
[00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:27.580]   Because most of the time,
[00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:30.140]   we don't live like our faith is actually under attack.
[00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:33.500]   We casually stroll and we should be treading carefully.
[00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:36.500]   Right, when you know your faith is under attack,
[00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:37.340]   you're careful.
[00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:39.940]   When you think everything is good, you're careless.
[00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:42.260]   And too many of us are careless with our faith.
[00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:44.500]   We don't think about the fact that it's under attack.
[00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:48.940]   My son, one time, he started to have some cold sores.
[00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:50.340]   He was like six months old,
[00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:51.940]   so we didn't think it was a big deal.
[00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:53.880]   But what happened was it got infected
[00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:55.420]   and he ended up in the hospital
[00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:56.900]   and he was in the emergency room.
[00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:57.940]   And so when we realized,
[00:19:57.940 --> 00:19:59.420]   oh, this is more than just cold sores,
[00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:00.860]   our whole posture changed.
[00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:02.240]   It went from just being at the house
[00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:03.460]   like it was no big deal
[00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:06.260]   to going to the emergency room to get it taken care of.
[00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:10.820]   But the problem would be if we treated the emergency
[00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:12.540]   like it was something regular.
[00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:14.300]   When you know something is under attack,
[00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:16.020]   it changes your whole posture.
[00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:17.420]   You're not careless anymore.
[00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:20.380]   So what are some ways that you might know
[00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:23.060]   that you're a little careless with your faith?
[00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:27.000]   Never showing up to worship with God's people.
[00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:30.460]   Not keeping up with relationships,
[00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:33.700]   people who are in your life who can check on you.
[00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:35.660]   Hiding our sin.
[00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:37.740]   You know how sometimes we'll have some sin,
[00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:38.580]   we're struggling with it.
[00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:40.300]   We don't want nobody else to know about it.
[00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:42.540]   And we like to hide it in the corner in the darkness
[00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:44.020]   where nobody else can see it
[00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:45.820]   'cause we think we're protecting ourselves
[00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:48.260]   and really we're putting ourselves in danger.
[00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:51.500]   Not reading the word at all,
[00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:53.060]   just kind of coasting.
[00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:55.020]   Not praying.
[00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:57.540]   I mean, there's so many ways we can be careless
[00:20:57.540 --> 00:20:58.380]   with our faith.
[00:20:58.380 --> 00:21:00.940]   And I'm not trying to call you to be afraid and fearful,
[00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:03.020]   I'm just calling you to be careful.
[00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:05.300]   I'm not saying retreat, I'm saying watch out
[00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:07.140]   because the danger is real.
[00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:10.060]   But God has said that he'll keep those who are his,
[00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:11.540]   like he'll hold on to us.
[00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:16.780]   But he's told us some ways that we need to hold on to him.
[00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:17.900]   I wanna look at verse six.
[00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:18.820]   This is what Paul says.
[00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:20.180]   He said, "I sent Timothy to check."
[00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:21.700]   Here's what Timothy found out.
[00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:24.060]   "But Timothy has just now come to us from you."
[00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:26.060]   He's brought good news about your faith and love.
[00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:29.060]   "He told us that you always have pleasant memories of us,
[00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:31.640]   "that you long to see us just as we long to see you.
[00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:32.980]   "Therefore, brothers and sisters,
[00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:35.040]   "in all our distress and persecution,
[00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:38.200]   "we were encouraged about you because of your faith.
[00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:39.440]   "For now we really live
[00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:41.240]   "since you were standing firm in the Lord.
[00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:43.400]   "How can we thank God enough for you
[00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:45.420]   "in return for all the joy we have
[00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:47.920]   "in the presence of our God because of you?
[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:49.780]   "Night and day we pray most earnestly
[00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:51.380]   "that we may see you again
[00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:53.780]   "and supply what is lacking in your faith."
[00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:58.380]   I know these are a lot of verses, stick with me.
[00:21:58.380 --> 00:21:59.860]   Timothy brings back a good report.
[00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:01.300]   They're doing good, right?
[00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:02.340]   They're doing well.
[00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:03.660]   They have fine memories.
[00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:04.860]   So people are trying to convince them
[00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:06.260]   that Paul and them were lying to them.
[00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:08.060]   They remember what's going on.
[00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:09.180]   And he says, verse eight,
[00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:13.140]   "We really live since you were standing firm in the Lord."
[00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:13.980]   Before that, he was saying,
[00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:16.060]   "We didn't want you to be unsettled by trials."
[00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:18.900]   There's a big difference between being unsettled by trials
[00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:22.340]   and standing firm in the Lord.
[00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:25.220]   It's kind of like the terminal trains at the airports
[00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:28.020]   where before it moves, it always says,
[00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:30.380]   "This train is about to move.
[00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:31.300]   "Hold on."
[00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:33.500]   And it's always somebody who don't hold on,
[00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:35.540]   who just looking at their phone
[00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:38.060]   and the train goes and then they go.
[00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:39.860]   And I never feel bad for them
[00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:43.980]   because I'm like, "They told you to hold on, bro."
[00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:45.880]   So before it goes, I just kind of look around like,
[00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:46.980]   "Who about to fall?"
[00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:51.820]   Y'all should probably pray for me, that's not nice.
[00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:54.860]   Saying it out loud, it didn't sound very nice.
[00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:56.100]   But it's the same way.
[00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:59.820]   And that God is saying, "Look, this world is difficult.
[00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:01.540]   "There's threats for us to be unsettled."
[00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:03.540]   He's saying, "Hold on."
[00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:05.860]   And the way that we hold on, we hold on to God.
[00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:07.220]   We hold on to his people.
[00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:09.500]   We hold on to the stuff he's given us
[00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:11.620]   for our faith to be able to persevere.
[00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:15.580]   God's voice, God's people are telling you to hold on.
[00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:17.700]   And he says he wants to see them face to face
[00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:19.980]   to complete what is lacking in their faith.
[00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:22.140]   Again, the implication is something is lacking
[00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:23.300]   in their faith.
[00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:25.780]   Their faith needs to mature and grow.
[00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:28.280]   And so he's not saying there's something lacking
[00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:30.380]   from their faith for them to be saved,
[00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:32.940]   but he's saying that there's some maturity
[00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:34.860]   that needs to occur, right?
[00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:37.380]   So I just want to remind you that what saves you
[00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:40.980]   is not the power or perfection of your faith.
[00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:42.340]   It's not just 'cause you believe a lot.
[00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:45.900]   I want you to know that faith itself is not even a virtue.
[00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:49.900]   What saves you is not faith, what saves you is Jesus.
[00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:51.940]   Faith is not good unless you believe
[00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:53.380]   in something worth believing in.
[00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:55.020]   What saves us is Jesus.
[00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:58.100]   The object of our faith is what saves us.
[00:23:58.100 --> 00:24:02.460]   That faith needs to grow and mature.
[00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:05.900]   Jesus is a great savior, and so we want our faith
[00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:06.860]   to be in good shape.
[00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:08.680]   We know it's in good shape when it's thriving
[00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:12.080]   and growing and standing firm and holding on.
[00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:14.740]   Just before I go to this next point,
[00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:15.900]   I just want to ask you how often
[00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:17.780]   do you check in on other people?
[00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:20.600]   How often do you ask somebody else, how's your faith?
[00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:23.960]   [audience member mumbles]
[00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:26.280]   But the scripture seems to say that our responsibility
[00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:29.480]   isn't just our own growth, but one another, right?
[00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:32.700]   And I also want to say this, how often do you let
[00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:34.240]   other people ask you how your faith is?
[00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:36.080]   'Cause some of us, if someone sends you a text saying,
[00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:37.360]   how's your faith, you're gonna be like,
[00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:38.200]   how's your faith?
[00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:40.440]   What you mean, how's my faith?
[00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:41.860]   I'm good, how are you?
[00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:45.120]   I seen your Instagram, who is that?
[00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:45.960]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:47.400]   Like, you don't have to do all of that.
[00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:48.680]   [audience laughs]
[00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:51.840]   But we want our lives to be open and vulnerable enough
[00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:53.280]   that we can check in on each other
[00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:56.640]   and we care enough to check in on each other.
[00:24:56.640 --> 00:25:00.040]   So number one, right, your faith needs work.
[00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:02.200]   Just because we believe doesn't mean we've arrived.
[00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:05.320]   And the last point is this, you need God to work.
[00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:08.280]   You need God to work.
[00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:09.640]   'Cause your faith needs work,
[00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:11.880]   but you cannot do that work on your own.
[00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:14.500]   I do not want you to hear me saying
[00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:18.080]   that we play some part in saving ourselves.
[00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:21.360]   Our faith needs work, but what we don't do
[00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:24.520]   is just kinda assemble our faith to some perfect level
[00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:26.760]   and then just present it to God.
[00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:28.280]   God is behind all of it.
[00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:30.840]   I'll give you an example.
[00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:32.880]   I know I talk about my wife and my kids a lot,
[00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:35.160]   it's because I like them.
[00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:36.520]   But here's the example, my son.
[00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:40.400]   My son, he's loved Legos as long as he could.
[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:43.840]   And he, you know, when he was younger, he liked Legos,
[00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:46.840]   he just wasn't good enough with them to do anything.
[00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:48.960]   And so, you know, we would build stuff together,
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:50.320]   which really meant I would build it
[00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:51.720]   and I would let him put his finger on it
[00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:53.600]   and I would press it down, that kinda thing.
[00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:55.960]   And so there was sometimes he wanted to hurry up and do it
[00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:58.280]   and I just wasn't, I was doing something.
[00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:01.160]   And he'd be like, "Daddy, can I just do it by myself?"
[00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:03.920]   I was like, "I don't think it's gonna turn out the same."
[00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:05.040]   He was feeling himself.
[00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:07.400]   I was like, "I don't know."
[00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:08.540]   He's like, "No, can I just do it?"
[00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:09.840]   I was like, "Okay, go ahead."
[00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:12.120]   And so, you know, it was a Batmobile and he came back
[00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:15.160]   and, you know, it looked like a bunch of black bricks
[00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:16.240]   stuffed on top of each other.
[00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:18.280]   It did not look anything like the Batmobile.
[00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:21.000]   And here's the thing, he started to feel good about it
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:22.920]   and he thought he could go and do it by himself.
[00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:24.600]   And this is what we do with God, where we say,
[00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:26.880]   "Oh, I think I'm at a point where I can go
[00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:28.380]   "put my whole situation together
[00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:29.920]   "and present it back to God,"
[00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:31.960]   not understanding that it's really God
[00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:33.360]   who was putting this thing together,
[00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:35.480]   that he just graciously included you
[00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:37.880]   in the process of your growth.
[00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:41.280]   I mean, how foolish and proud can we be
[00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:43.800]   to think that we need Jesus to save our souls
[00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:45.900]   and then we could just take it from there?
[00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:48.940]   I can sanctify myself, I can grow myself,
[00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:50.460]   I can make myself more holy.
[00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:52.180]   You cannot.
[00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:54.320]   We're still dependent on God for that.
[00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:55.460]   We need God to work.
[00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:57.480]   That kind of I got this mentality
[00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:59.860]   may seem like it works in other areas of our life.
[00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:01.700]   It does not work with our pursuit of God.
[00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:03.100]   Listen to verse 11.
[00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:06.900]   He says this, "Now may our God and Father himself
[00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:09.200]   "and our Lord Jesus direct our way to you.
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:12.720]   "And may the Lord cause you to increase and overflow
[00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:14.700]   "with love for one another and for everyone
[00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:16.700]   "just as we do for you.
[00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:18.980]   "May he make your hearts blameless and holiness
[00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:20.500]   "before our God and Father
[00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:23.700]   "at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints."
[00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:25.380]   Amen.
[00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:27.100]   This is a prayer for them, right?
[00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:29.980]   So he's praying God will allow them to go visit them.
[00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:31.880]   Then he asked that God would cause them
[00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:34.820]   to increase and overflow with love for one another, right?
[00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:36.700]   That God would cause them, right?
[00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:39.380]   God is the one working this within them.
[00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:41.940]   And I want you to know that he's not just talking
[00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:43.440]   about their faith, right?
[00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:45.660]   They'll overflow also with a love for one another.
[00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:47.340]   I want you to know that faith is always
[00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:49.020]   side by side with love.
[00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:50.940]   It's almost like faith and love are best friends
[00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:51.980]   who are inseparable.
[00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:54.420]   Whenever you see one, you see the other.
[00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:57.020]   Right, the greatest commandment is to love God
[00:27:57.020 --> 00:27:58.060]   and to love neighbors.
[00:27:58.060 --> 00:28:01.620]   So Paul is saying he's praying they'll overflow with that.
[00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:04.540]   Jesus is always the main example we have
[00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:06.540]   of love in scripture.
[00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:08.520]   And we wanna look more and more like him.
[00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:10.180]   So sometimes when we begin to gauge
[00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:11.820]   even our own maturity as disciples
[00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:13.080]   and what our faith looks like,
[00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:15.320]   we'll just look to particular activities.
[00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:18.040]   Like oh, did I go to this and did I read this?
[00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:21.760]   But we rarely really look in our lives for love.
[00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:25.000]   Sometimes the questions you need to ask yourself
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.200]   to see whether or not you're growing
[00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:28.640]   and how you're doing with Jesus
[00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:31.120]   isn't just do I show up in a building sometimes,
[00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:33.780]   it's do I actually love my neighbor?
[00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:35.480]   Do I actually love my brothers and sisters?
[00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:39.300]   Do I seem to even be growing in affection for God?
[00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:41.880]   Right, is God at work in my life in that way?
[00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:45.200]   Faith and love are always side by side.
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:50.120]   Your love for God shows up in a way that you love others.
[00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:52.280]   And then the third thing he prays is this.
[00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:56.000]   May he make your hearts blameless in holiness
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.180]   before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus
[00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:00.180]   with all his saints.
[00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:03.500]   Blameless in holiness.
[00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:07.040]   With anybody, when they're just putting in,
[00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:08.600]   you know, like they're dating profile
[00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:09.860]   or something, dating that,
[00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:11.360]   be like how would you describe yourself?
[00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:15.400]   They'd be like, short, blameless in holiness, right?
[00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:16.460]   No one would do that.
[00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:19.640]   Because that's a high standard.
[00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:22.680]   Blameless in holiness means there is no fault
[00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:23.880]   to be found in you.
[00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:26.000]   There's nothing you can be blamed for.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.120]   He's talking about a perfect holiness.
[00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:33.320]   You know, it's one thing for us to seem blameless
[00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:36.180]   in holiness before our friends, our coworkers,
[00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:40.000]   but he's saying may God make us blameless in holiness
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.100]   before our God and Father at the coming of Jesus.
[00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:45.940]   That is a high standard.
[00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:47.940]   We're talking about the God in the universe
[00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:49.780]   who knows everything about you,
[00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:51.300]   who knows what you're thinking right now,
[00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:54.700]   who knows your thoughts, your actions, your past,
[00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:56.980]   the stuff you feel like you can hide from other people.
[00:29:56.980 --> 00:30:00.700]   And he's saying that Jesus is gonna make us blameless
[00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:03.220]   in holiness before him.
[00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:05.900]   Again, if you have tricked yourself into thinking
[00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:09.140]   that you can do this on your own, I'm just not sure how.
[00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:12.940]   God has to do this work in us.
[00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:16.620]   I wonder if you ever think about your faith
[00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:19.260]   in light of the second coming of Jesus,
[00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:20.920]   that Jesus is coming back.
[00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:24.620]   And the only way that we have this eternal joy
[00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:26.860]   to look forward to is if we're blameless
[00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:28.620]   in holiness before him.
[00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:31.380]   But the good news is our future,
[00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:33.840]   that future of us being blameless in holiness before God
[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:37.400]   is secure by what Jesus has already done in the past.
[00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:38.800]   Right, that you're not trying to come up
[00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:41.120]   with some new strategy and plan to get yourself
[00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:43.120]   to perfect holiness and blameless.
[00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:45.120]   You need to do what God has commanded you
[00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:46.380]   and it'll grow you in your faith,
[00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:47.480]   but at the end of the day,
[00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:50.160]   our confidence is in the work of Jesus.
[00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:53.120]   Our confidence is in the power of Jesus.
[00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:57.000]   So that some of us, it's hard for us to look forward,
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.680]   to have joy, because all we see is the ways
[00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:01.680]   that we fall short and we see our flaws
[00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:04.480]   and we see our failures, but I wanna encourage you
[00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:07.200]   not to base your confidence mainly on yourself,
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:08.240]   but in Jesus.
[00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:11.560]   When the Bible talks about our boast being in Jesus,
[00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:15.180]   our glory being in Jesus, our confidence being in Jesus,
[00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:17.880]   it's in part having to do with this.
[00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:19.940]   Jesus is gonna work this in you.
[00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:24.380]   Right, that he can finish the work that he begun in you.
[00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:28.040]   Blameless in holiness.
[00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:31.760]   If you're here today and you know Jesus,
[00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:35.280]   I wanna encourage you not to let your current sin
[00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:38.160]   overshadow the power and promises of God.
[00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:43.080]   Don't let the fact that you're weak doubt the strength,
[00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:44.680]   make you doubt the strength of Jesus,
[00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:47.480]   just 'cause you're weak doesn't mean that Jesus is.
[00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:49.840]   And I promise you, Jesus can do this work in your life
[00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:50.960]   and he's promised to.
[00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:52.960]   If you're here and you don't know Jesus,
[00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:56.080]   I wanna ask you whether or not you think
[00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:58.640]   that you can live a life that is blameless
[00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:01.800]   and holiness before God.
[00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:05.280]   Do you think that when the judge of the universe,
[00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:10.200]   you stand before him and he knows everything about you,
[00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:12.320]   do you think that you would come off
[00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:13.920]   as blameless and holiness?
[00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:21.960]   That's a really high standard, one that we cannot meet.
[00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:23.900]   There's plenty of stuff that we should be blamed for.
[00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:26.720]   Even when we try, there's ways we wanna do better
[00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:28.740]   but we find ourself falling short.
[00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:30.280]   We try and fail.
[00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:33.400]   We try to do better on our mistakes.
[00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:35.100]   But we know we can't, even if we could
[00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:36.840]   from this point forward live perfect,
[00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:39.360]   we can't go back in time and erase our mistakes.
[00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:43.520]   But I want you to know you can have hope
[00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:46.480]   that you will be blameless and holiness before God,
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:47.880]   before Jesus himself.
[00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:50.560]   You might say I'm guilty of making a lot of mistakes.
[00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:54.200]   I want you to know Jesus says I can make you blameless.
[00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:57.300]   You might say oh, but I've made a lot of people hurt
[00:32:57.300 --> 00:32:59.740]   but Jesus says I can make you blameless.
[00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:01.420]   You might say I'm guilty of lies.
[00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:03.140]   Jesus says I can make you blameless.
[00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:05.000]   You might say I'm guilty of lust.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.660]   Jesus says I can make you blameless.
[00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:09.420]   You might say I'm guilty of bitterness.
[00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:11.220]   Jesus says I can make you blameless.
[00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:13.180]   You might say I'm guilty of unforgiveness.
[00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:14.940]   Jesus says I can make you blameless.
[00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:17.140]   Put whatever you want to at the beginning of that sentence.
[00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:18.300]   I want you to know at the end
[00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:20.720]   is this Jesus can make you blameless.
[00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:23.080]   (audience applauding)
[00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:24.860]   And not based on what you can do
[00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:26.320]   but what he's already done,
[00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:30.140]   that Jesus on the cross paid for our sins.
[00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:34.040]   And so if you don't know Jesus,
[00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:36.200]   I want to invite you to begin this journey
[00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:38.100]   that begins with faith in Jesus.
[00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:42.680]   In the perfect life he's already lived on our behalf.
[00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:45.320]   If you don't know him, I want to encourage you
[00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:46.840]   to talk to some folks tonight
[00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:49.400]   about what it means to know Jesus.
[00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:53.280]   So we're always asking that question,
[00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:54.240]   are we there yet?
[00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:57.720]   When it comes to our faith in Jesus.
[00:33:57.720 --> 00:34:00.360]   And I would say this, no, we're not there yet
[00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:01.440]   but we will be.
[00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:05.960]   We will reach the end and it'll be by God's power
[00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:06.920]   and God's strength.
[00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:10.180]   And the anticipation, knowing what Jesus is gonna do in us,
[00:34:10.180 --> 00:34:13.200]   knowing what Jesus desires, knowing what Jesus paid for
[00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:15.240]   should be part of what fuels our obedience.
[00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:19.040]   We should be excited about the opportunity to obey Jesus
[00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:20.880]   knowing that we're getting a little foretaste
[00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:23.600]   of who God saved us to be.
[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:26.000]   I don't want holiness to feel like a burden to you,
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.980]   I want it to feel like an opportunity, a goal,
[00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:30.800]   something that God has in mind for you,
[00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:33.560]   a beautiful dream and vision that you get to be
[00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:35.060]   who God called you to be.
[00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:37.240]   I don't want you to feel like you'd be throwing away
[00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:39.760]   your years while you're young by being a holy
[00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:41.400]   and being obedient to Jesus.
[00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:44.560]   Instead, you'll be throwing away your years
[00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:47.760]   if you don't pursue holiness and obedience to Jesus.
[00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:51.600]   I want you to be who God created you to be right now
[00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:54.820]   and God has invited us and given us the chance to do that.
[00:34:54.820 --> 00:34:57.680]   Just because you believe doesn't mean you've arrived
[00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:00.480]   but by the power of Jesus, you can.
[00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:01.300]   Let me pray.
[00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:05.200]   Father, we thank you so much for Jesus.
[00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:14.240]   God, we know that the only solid hope we have
[00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:15.320]   is Jesus.
[00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:19.600]   God, we know that our only boast is Jesus,
[00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:21.120]   our only glory is Jesus.
[00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:24.200]   So Father, we thank you so much for Jesus.
[00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:26.600]   Father, I pray for my friends here tonight
[00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:29.040]   who don't know Jesus, Lord, that you would help them
[00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:31.520]   to see him in a way they've never seen him before.
[00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:35.200]   God, that they would see him as a gracious,
[00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:38.080]   loving, kind, powerful savior.
[00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:42.960]   Father, I pray if there's hesitation for what it means
[00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:46.200]   to let things go that we love to follow Jesus,
[00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:49.200]   God, you'd show us that Jesus is far greater.
[00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:51.360]   Father, I pray for my brothers and sisters in here
[00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:53.480]   who do know Jesus, Father, that you would help
[00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:56.940]   the power of Jesus to be shown as stronger
[00:35:56.940 --> 00:35:58.440]   than our own weakness, God.
[00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:01.840]   Father, give us the grace to love each other enough
[00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:04.380]   to help each other to grow in our faith.
[00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:08.840]   Father, we pray that you would be honored in our lives.
[00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:10.120]   Thank you so much for Watermark.
[00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:11.680]   Thank you so much for the porch, Father.
[00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:14.320]   We pray you continue to work in them, Father.
[00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:16.920]   We pray you continue to glorify yourself in them.
[00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:22.640]   And God, we pray that we care for these folks well.
[00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:25.480]   We ask in the name of your son, Jesus, amen.
[00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:28.560]   (congregation applauding)
[00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:31.320]   - You guys can stay standing for a second.
[00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:33.480]   I, man, what a tree, dude.
[00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:35.720]   It was awesome, so encouraging.
[00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:36.560]   I,
[00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:43.360]   I don't know if it's just women in general
[00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:45.300]   or I just have the same coincidental thing
[00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:48.140]   that I also married a serial plant killer.
[00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:51.480]   And as I was listening to that story
[00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:53.520]   and I was thinking about just the truth
[00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:55.320]   of just that idea of the fake plant,
[00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:59.280]   I couldn't help but think that there are some of you
[00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:03.560]   in the room that you think you have a living faith.
[00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:08.760]   And just like you could go into someone's house
[00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:10.160]   and you see a plant and you're like, is that real
[00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:11.000]   or is it not?
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.560]   You get a little closer and you see it
[00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:15.440]   and you're like, oh, that's a fake plant.
[00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:19.440]   Some of you, and I hope you hear this
[00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:22.240]   with as gentle of a way as I can say it
[00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:23.600]   and as loving as I can say it,
[00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:27.000]   you think you have a real faith and you have a fake faith.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.420]   And the reason it stays the same,
[00:37:28.420 --> 00:37:29.480]   just like year after year after year,
[00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:31.120]   if you see a fake plant, it never changes.
[00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:32.400]   It's not growing.
[00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:34.560]   It's not changing at all.
[00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:37.320]   The reason that your faith,
[00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:39.960]   you're not seeing any growth and any change inside of it
[00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:41.760]   is 'cause you don't have a real faith.
[00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:46.440]   And maybe that's because you never actually accepted
[00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:48.140]   the free gift that God offers you.
[00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:50.720]   Maybe it's because you just grew up in church.
[00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:52.520]   Some of you, honestly, you've given up on the church
[00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:53.720]   and you've given up on Jesus
[00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:55.120]   and you grew up in the church and you grew up
[00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:56.320]   and you're like, I've been there, I went to youth camp,
[00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:58.320]   I tried all those things, and then, you know,
[00:37:58.320 --> 00:37:59.580]   it just didn't work.
[00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:03.840]   And so you walked away and you walked into the world
[00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:09.200]   and you step back into places like this tonight
[00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:15.300]   and there's scars in your back, rear view mirror,
[00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:18.920]   and you hear messages like this, you know, like,
[00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:21.880]   dude, I feel like I've tried it before and it didn't work.
[00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:26.040]   And the truth is, you never tried it to begin with.
[00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:30.800]   You never accepted that free gift that God offers
[00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:32.060]   'cause it's not just a one-time thing,
[00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:34.000]   it's a relationship, day after day after day.
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.400]   Let me be abundantly clear.
[00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:37.560]   You are not saved by anything that you do.
[00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:40.160]   You are saved by, in a moment, placing your faith
[00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:43.880]   in the object of Jesus, the Savior of the world
[00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:45.400]   and his death and resurrection on a cross.
[00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:47.480]   That is what saves us and that gives us access
[00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:49.160]   to have a relationship going forward
[00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:51.240]   and to have a living faith.
[00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:53.100]   But some of you need to hear me clearly,
[00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:57.040]   as lovingly as I can say it, you do not have a real faith.
[00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:58.280]   You have a fake faith.
[00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:03.920]   And the problem is not Jesus and it's not the church
[00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:05.800]   and it's not Christianity, it's that you've never
[00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:07.040]   tried those things.
[00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:10.720]   And you've never stepped into the relationship
[00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:14.320]   that God wants you to experience day after day.
[00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:16.560]   Not because he's angry or disappointed
[00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:20.220]   or anything other than crazy in love with you.
[00:39:20.220 --> 00:39:24.980]   And tonight is your night, man.
[00:39:24.980 --> 00:39:27.680]   And the God of the universe brought an incredibly gifted
[00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:30.960]   friend and co-laborer in Christ to come
[00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:33.100]   and share that message to you
[00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:34.240]   because he didn't want you to wake up
[00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:36.440]   and spend another day without experiencing
[00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:38.460]   a real living, growing faith.
[00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:40.820]   So if that's you inside of this room,
[00:39:40.820 --> 00:39:42.000]   there's gonna be a team of volunteers
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:43.800]   that'll be down front here right after the message.
[00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:46.320]   We would love to pray with you, we'd love to talk with you.
[00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:47.900]   There'll be volunteers that are wearing shirts
[00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:50.600]   just like this all throughout the lobby.
[00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:52.560]   Had to make sure that I'm wearing this shirt right now.
[00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:56.320]   All throughout the lobby, they would love to talk with you.
[00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:57.520]   If you're just walking through a season
[00:39:57.520 --> 00:39:59.240]   where you're walking through the valley of the shadow
[00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:04.160]   of job loss or heartbreak or a loved one dying,
[00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:05.720]   and we can just pray with you,
[00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:06.880]   answer questions you maybe have,
[00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:09.280]   maybe you're just wrestling with who is Jesus in general,
[00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:10.800]   anything we can do to serve you.
[00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:13.060]   If you wanna just know what the best tacos in town,
[00:40:13.060 --> 00:40:13.920]   we'd love to talk to you.
[00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:15.240]   Anything that we can do to provide for you,
[00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:17.000]   we'll have men and women that will be down here
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.120]   and spread all throughout, they'd love to connect with you.
[00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:22.000]   In addition to that, there's something called First Step,
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:23.560]   where if you are interested in making this place
[00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:25.680]   that can feel so big, and we know that you walk in here
[00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:27.760]   and it feels overwhelming and it seems like everyone
[00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:29.400]   knows each other and they've all got
[00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:32.040]   the secret handshake down, this is just not the case.
[00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:33.840]   Our heart is to make this place that feels big
[00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:35.820]   feel really, really small and help you get connected
[00:40:35.820 --> 00:40:38.400]   with other people who you are checking in on,
[00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:40.800]   just like he said, and who can check in on you.
[00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:41.960]   And so one of the ways that we do that
[00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:45.440]   is every month or so, we offer something called First Step.
[00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:47.560]   If you wanna take the First Step and get it connected here,
[00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:49.540]   you can go right outside of these doors right here
[00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:51.060]   and you can get plugged into,
[00:40:51.060 --> 00:40:52.920]   or be a part of something called First Step
[00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:55.940]   of finding out what it looks like to take your First Step
[00:40:55.940 --> 00:40:57.720]   and get plugged in here, answer questions,
[00:40:57.720 --> 00:41:00.040]   hear some of the vision and values of Watermark.
[00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:03.560]   In addition to that, we are so just grateful
[00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:04.480]   for Tripp being here.
[00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:06.800]   He will also be joining us at Awaken,
[00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:11.800]   and hope that you will be joining us there as well.
[00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:13.960]   There are limited, there have already been thousands
[00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:16.680]   of tickets sold, and so we want everyone in this room,
[00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:18.840]   and really everyone who wants to be there to be there.
[00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:20.400]   And so I would take advantage of that opportunity
[00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:21.480]   and go to awaken.live.
[00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:24.120]   Can we give it up one more time for our friend Tripp?
[00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:27.140]   All at Concord. (audience cheering)
[00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:29.100]   And that is it, we love you guys so much.
[00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:31.500]   Go in peace and love and serve the Lord this week!
