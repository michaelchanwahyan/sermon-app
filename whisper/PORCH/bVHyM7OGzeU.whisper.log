[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   [Music]

[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   I LOVE IT.

[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   WE'VE GOT SOME OF THEM IN THE HOUSE.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   HEY, IT'S GOING TO BE AN AMAZING NIGHT.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   WE'RE BACK IN OUR SERIES IN THE BOOK OF COLOSSIANS.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   BUT TO GET THINGS STARTED, I WANTED TO SHARE A QUICK STORY,
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   AN OPENING ILLUSTRATION WITH YOU.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   HOW MANY OF YOU IN HERE HAVE EVER BEEN WHITE WATER RAFTING?
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   ANYBODY SHOW OF HANDS?
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   YEAH, SOME OF US.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   FAIR NUMBER.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   IF YOU'VE EVER BEEN WHITE WATER RAFTING, THERE'S PROBABLY A LOT
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE YOU STILL REMEMBER TO THIS DAY.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   I KNOW THAT'S TRUE FOR ME.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   LIKE WHEN I WENT, I CAN STILL REMEMBER IN VIVID DETAIL,
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   LIKE THE ANTICIPATION OF THAT FIRST RAPID.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   OH MY GOSH, LIKE THERE IT IS.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   I REMEMBER THE INTENSITY OF OUR TEAM.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   LIKE PULL!
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   LIKE WE WERE ALL ROWING IN ONE DIRECTION,
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   AIMING ACCORDING TO THE COURSE OF WHAT OUR GOD WAS GIVING US.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   I REMEMBER THE CANYON WALLS.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   LIKE THEY WERE JUST SOARING UP AROUND US.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   WE FELT SO SMALL IN THE BASE OF THAT CANYON.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   AND I REMEMBER THE INTENSITY OF JUST TRYING TO NAVIGATE
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   ALL OF THE DIFFERENT AREAS OF THIS RAPID.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   LIKE THIS RIVER WAS WIDE AND THEN IT WAS NARROW
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   AND THEN IT WAS SMOOTH AND THEN IT WAS RUSHING.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   LIKE I REMEMBER ALL OF THE STRATEGY THAT WENT INTO IT.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   I REMEMBER LIKE THE COLDNESS OF THE WATER, YOU KNOW?
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   LIKE I REMEMBER EVERYTHING ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   BUT YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT I REMEMBER MOST CLEARLY OF ALL?
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   THE SAFETY TALK
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   THAT OUR TOUR GUIDE GAVE US BEFORE WE EVER EVEN STEPPED FOOT IN THE BOAT.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   WHY?
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   WHY DID I PAY SO MUCH ATTENTION TO THE SAFETY TALK?
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   IT SEEMS KIND OF ODD.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   WELL, WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW IS IN MY BACKGROUND
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   THE CLOSEST THING TO A WHITE WATER RAPID I'D EVER GOTTEN
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   WAS JUST LIKE KIND OF FLOATING DOWN THE LAZY RIVER
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   AT THE LOCAL WATER PARK.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   YOU KNOW LIKE I HAD NOT HAD ANY EXPERIENCE OR EXPOSURE
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   TO THE GREAT OUTDOORS
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   AND TO WHAT AWAITED ME IN THAT COLORADO RIVER IN SPECIFIC.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   AND SO WHEN HE WENT INTO A FULL DISSERTATION
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   OF THE DANGERS THAT WE COULD EXPECT
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   I PAID ATTENTION.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   LIKE I LEANED IN AND I LEARNED AS MUCH AS I COULD
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   BECAUSE I WANTED TO MAKE SURE
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   I WAS WELL PREPARED FOR WHAT WAS OUT AHEAD OF US.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   AND SO AS HE WALKED THROUGH IT ALL
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   I KNEW.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   LIKE MAN IF THE BOAT'S ABOUT TO CAPSIZE
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   I WAS SUPPOSED TO THROW MY BODY WEIGHT THAT DIRECTION
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   SO THAT WAY WE CAN RELEVEL THIS THING OUT.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   OR IF I FIND MYSELF FOR SOME REASON OUTSIDE OF THE BOAT
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   WHICH IS REALLY NOT RECOMMENDED
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   YOU SHOULD MAKE SURE YOU STAY IN THE BOAT AT ALL COSTS
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   IF AT ALL POSSIBLE.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   BUT IF YOU ARE OUTSIDE OF THE BOAT
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   WHAT YOU SHOULD DO
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   IS YOU SHOULD MAKE LIKE MICHAEL PHELPS BABY
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   AND YOU SHOULD SWIM TO WHATEVER SHORE IS CLOSEST TO YOU.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   AND IF YOU CAN'T DO THAT
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   LIKE IF YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF IT ALL
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   AND THINGS ARE GETTING DICY OUT THERE
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   YOU ASSUME THE PROPER POSITION
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   YOU GET ON YOUR BACK
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   AND YOU FLOAT WITH YOUR LEGS POINTED DOWNSTREAM
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   AND YOUR KNEES SLIGHTLY BENT
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   THAT WAY YOU CAN PUSH OFF OF ANY ROCKS
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   YOU MAY FIND YOURSELF BUMPING UP AGAINST
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   BUT YOU DON'T JUST SIT LIKE THIS
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   YOU SPREAD YOUR ARMS OUT WIDE
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   BECAUSE THIS IS HOW YOU NAVIGATE
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   AND MANEUVER THROUGH THE WATER
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   I REMEMBER ALL OF IT
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   LIKE I AM SO STILL TO THIS DAY
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   LIKE I HAVE SUCH CLARITY OF WHAT THAT MOMENT FELT LIKE
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   WHY?
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   BECAUSE I WAS AFRAID
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   BUT I WAS ALSO EXCITED
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   I KNEW I WAS SETTING OUT INTO SOMETHING
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   THAT WAS SO MEANINGFUL
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   LIKE THIS IS GOING TO BE AMAZING
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   BUT I ALSO KNEW
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   BECAUSE OF THAT SAFETY TALK
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   I WAS STEPPING OUT INTO SOMETHING
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   THAT WAS DANGEROUS TOO
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   YOU SEE MY GOD SAID IT BEST
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   IF YOU WANT TO ENJOY LIFE INSIDE THE BOAT
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   THEN YOU NEED TO PREPARE FOR DANGERS
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   OUTSIDE THE BOAT
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   WHY DO I TELL YOU THAT?
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   BECAUSE THE SAME THING IS TRUE
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   IN THE CHRISTIAN LIFE
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   I AM NOT A BAD GUY
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   I AM NOT A BAD PERSON
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   I AM NOT A BAD PERSON
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   I AM NOT A BAD PERSON
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   I AM NOT A BAD PERSON

[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   I AM NOT A BAD PERSON
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   I AM NOT A BAD PERSON

[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   I AM NOT A BAD PERSON
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   I AM NOT A BAD PERSON
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   I AM NOT A BAD PERSON
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   I AM NOT A BAD PERSON

[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   I AM NOT A BAD PERSON
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   This is what all of these religious observances are.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   They're really good.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   They're really beautiful.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   So what does Paul mean when he says
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   they're a shadow of the things to come?
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   What's he mean by that?
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   Well, think about a shadow.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   What's a shadow?
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   A shadow is an immaterial shape
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   of a material subject.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   Y'all tracking with that?
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   In my green room just a minute ago
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   I was just kind of working through the rhythm of this thing, you know?
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   And as I'm doing it, I looked to my left
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   and my shadow is just kind of dancing along with me.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   I can see it right now. It's right here in front of me.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   This shadow has no substance in and of itself.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   But it points to that which does have substance.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   You tracking?
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   That's what he's saying here.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   He's saying, "Hey, all of these Old Testament religious observances,
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   every rule, every regulation that God gave,
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   they were never the point.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   But they were pointing to the point."
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   It's like this.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   In the Old Testament, they would sacrifice
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   perfect, spotless lamb
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   because it was through the sacrifice of that lamb
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   that they would receive forgiveness for their sins.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   That was a shadow of the substance, which is Jesus Christ,
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   the Lamb of God,
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   which has come to take away all the sins of the world.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   We don't have to repeatedly sacrifice any longer
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   because His sacrifice was enough,
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   fully and finally sufficient forever.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   Sabbath.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   God instituted a day where we would take time
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   and we would rest in His goodness.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   We would rest from any work in which we would do.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   But in Christ, we see the fullness of that.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   That He has become our rest.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   That we don't have to earn and work and strive and strain
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   and sweat by the toil of our brow any longer.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   We can rest in the fact
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   that everything He's done,
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   all the work He's performed, it's enough.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   We don't have to strive any longer.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   Do you see it?
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   All of these things, they're shadows of the substance.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   Jesus is the one that all of it's pointing to.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   He has come and He has fulfilled every letter of the law.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   And so guess what?
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   We don't need to pay attention to them.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   We need to pay attention to Him.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   That's what Paul's pointing to.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   That's what he's saying.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   He's looking at me saying,
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   "Hey, there's a bunch of people around you
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   "and there's a bunch of things you should do."
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   And he's like, "Don't do those things."
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   Because Christ already did them.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   He already completed them.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   He already accomplished them.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   You don't need to pay attention to them any longer.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   You need to pay attention to Him.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   That's why he's saying,
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   "Hey, don't indulge the shadow amidst the substance."
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   It would kind of be like this.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   Say it's date night at the Perry house.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   And your boy, he's got plans, all right?
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   Like I've decided to work up like a three-course menu.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   I'm working in the kitchen all day.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   I bought fresh flowers.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   I lit some candles.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   I made sure the place was picked up and cleaned for my bride.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   And then she walks in the door
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   and she sits down to dine and delight.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   And I look at her and say, "What are you doing?
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   "That seat's not for you."
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   And I go and I grab a picture of her
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   and I set it across from me.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   This is what it's about.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   That would be crazy.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   That would feel so ludicrous.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   And yet, that's the point Paul's making.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   That's the kind of thinking he's exposing.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   He's looking at them and he's saying,
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   "Hey, do not let anyone illegitimize your faith
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   "because you're not following a bunch of
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   "unnecessary regulations."
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   Like you don't value the picture.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   You value the subject, right?
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   It's not about what's in the frame.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   It's about the one whom the frame depicts.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   He says it like this in a different verse.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   He says in Galatians 3, 3, "Are you so foolish?
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   "Having begun by the spirit,
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   "are you now being perfected by the flesh?"
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   What's he getting at?
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   It is impossible, it is impossible
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   to perfect yourself by your own strength.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   Say impossible with me.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   Impossible.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   It's impossible, do you get it?
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   It is impossible to perfect yourself by your own strength.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   Like we don't deepen our spirituality
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   with a can-do attitude
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   and by giving it the good college try.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   That's not how you grow.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   You grow by loving him.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   That's how it happens.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   Like all the religious observance
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   that he's speaking to here,
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   any obedience you feel the need to adhere to,
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   it is a response from your love for God.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   Not an action you're working up
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   to earn his favor,
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   to merit his approval.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   And yet here's what's so fascinating.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   This is such a prevalent issue in the church today.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   And well beyond the walls of this place,
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   it's a prevalent issue in the world today.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   But what I think is crazy is the fact that
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   if you look around and you observe what ministers are saying,
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   this is nothing new.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   Like people today are prescribing
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   a variety of steps you should take
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   or they're peddling some solution you should adopt
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   so that way you can become like Jesus.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   So they look at you and they say things like,
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   "Hey, here's how to kill porn.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   "Here's how to overcome your laziness.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   "Here's how to live a stress-free life.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   "Here's six steps to make sure you're never lazy again."
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   They start prescribing all of these steps,
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   all of these how-tos,
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   all of these lists of to-dos,
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   so that way you'll adhere to them
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   and you'll buy into the promise,
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   "This is going to make me like Jesus."
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   And yet what happens is you've only signed up
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   for another religious observance.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   Your effort doesn't make you like Him.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   Your love for Him
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   and desire to walk with Him and be with Him in due time
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   will make you like Him.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   You see, here's what's fascinating about this idea,
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   that we can merit our Christlikeness.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   We can kind of grit and bear our way into becoming like Him.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   The interesting thing about it
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   is it ultimately just leaves us with something to brag about.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   That's all it does.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   Like, man, I've never missed a Sunday service.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   I'm always the one that speaks up in community group.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   Every time we go around and we confess sin,
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   I confess three.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   We think that doing all of these things
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   makes us more like Jesus,
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   and yet here is the issue.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   If it all depends upon you,
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   what ends up happening is it either leads to your pride,
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   because, boy, you did it.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   You kept all six steps,
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   or it leads to your despair
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   because you can't do it.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   Jesus is trying to free us from that,
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   and that's what Paul is advocating for in this section.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   He's saying, "Hey, don't subscribe to a self-help gospel
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   that God helps those who help themselves,"
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   which sounds right.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   Like, man, yeah, I think God is going to help me
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   if I do help myself, but here's the thing, porch.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   God does not help those who help themselves.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   He helps those that cannot help themselves.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   That's the nature of the gospel.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   God looks upon people, and He says,
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   "No, you can't do it, but I can do it,
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   so you cling fast to me.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   You stay connected to me,
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   and as we walk together, you know what's going to happen?
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   You're going to become like me,
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   but you stay close. You hold fast."
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   Now, am I looking at you and saying, "Man, you know what?
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   Yeah, so you should just indulge in revelry
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   and be completely disobedient.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   You should never try a day in your life."
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   No, like that's not the point of all of this.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   Again, I just said it a minute ago.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   Obedience is a response to the one we love.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   I love you, God, so let me live my life.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   My identity is in Christ.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   Now, look at my activity, which reflects His own.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   I don't obey so that way I can become like Him.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   That's not how this thing works.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   Paul says it like this in Philippians 2, 12 and 13.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   He says, "Therefore, my beloved,
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   as you have always obeyed, so now,
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   not only in my presence, but much more in my absence,
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   work out your own salvation with fear and trembling."
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   Do you feel the sense of responsibility on your life for that?
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   Like, work it out, baby. Like, get after it.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   You've got a sense of duty here,
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   and yet catch what it says in 13,
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   'cause you can never divorce these verses from each other.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   "For it is God who works in you,
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   both to will and to work for His good pleasure."
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   We have a role to play, no doubt.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   But here's the point I need you to take away.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   If the influential voices in your life,
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   whoever it is you listen to,
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   if all they ever do is prescribe behavior
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   and they never provoke the heart,
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   stop listening to them.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   That is not the gospel.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   The gospel is not, "Hey, He needs your help."
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   The gospel is, "You couldn't help yourself,
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   so He stepped down from heaven to help you in every way
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   you did not deserve."
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   This is the first threat that Paul's warning us away from.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   He wants us to know, man,
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   it doesn't matter how good, wise, or well-meaning the advice is.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   It doesn't matter how much you love that pastor,
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   but specific rhythms that podcast is recommending,
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   you become like Christ by beholding Christ.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   But that's not the only thing.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   It's not only that we don't grow through religious observances.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   As Paul keeps going, he's going to tell us
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   that we also do not grow by way of mystical experiences.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   So read this with me. It's in verse 18.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   He says, "Let no one disqualify you
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   insisting on asceticism and worship of angels,
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   going on in detail about visions,
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   puffed up without reason by his sensuous mind,
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   and not holding fast to the head,
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   from whom the whole body, the whole body,
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   nourished and knit together through its joints
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   and its ligaments, grows with a growth that is of God."
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   As Paul keeps going, we get to verse 18.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   He shifts his warning away from focusing on religious activity
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   to focusing very specifically on mystical sensitivity,
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   which actually reflects the spiritual spectrum
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   of our current context.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   I did a lot of research.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   I actually had it all built out in here.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   We just don't have time to walk all the way through it.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   But if you go and you look at the national surveys,
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   who do you think composes the group
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   that is most predominantly considered
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   spiritual but not religious?
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   Who do you think it is? I'll give you one guess.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   You.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   It's the 20 and 30-somethings of our world.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   It's those that are your age.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   It's those that are here in this room.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   They are you.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   You are the ones that would say, "I'm spiritual.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   I have an interest in spirituality.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   Sure, I have a decreasing interest in religiosity,
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   but I am very open to spirituality,"
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   which gives a lot of explanation for the eruption
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   of things like crystals and angel numbers
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   and manifestation and the law of self-attraction, right?
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   And the idea of like the rebirth of Ouija boards
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   and tarot cards and horoscopes,
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   the rise of seances and spiritualism.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   These things, they are making their way back
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   to the center of society, into the mainstream of our world.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   I was reading a national publication
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   that is revered for representing the interests
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   of young adults, and it was saying, yeah,
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   young adults today, the young people of America,
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   they have a belief in a higher power,
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   a stronger desire to be engaged with the supernatural
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   and an interest in personal spiritual experience
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   that transcends decades and times past.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   And so Paul's looking at you, and he's saying,
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   "Hey, the issues of this room
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   look a lot like the issues of this room."
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   The things that we feel, the pressures we face,
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   the desires we have, man,
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   I want to be a part of something transcendent.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   It's really not all that different
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   from what the believers in Colossae were confronted with.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   And yet it's interesting as you read through this,
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   just to add to the similarities between what they're facing
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   and what we're facing, is there's this idea of syncretism,
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   right, where I take a blend
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   of all of the different religious influences,
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   spiritual influences that I like,
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   that I admire, that I prefer,
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   and I just kind of mix them together
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   and I accept them as my own.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   Like, that's what's weird about this passage.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   When you read through it, it's like, man, Paul,
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   what are you talking about?
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   You're talking about legalism,
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   you're talking about asceticism,
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   you're talking about spiritualism, moralism.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   Where does it end?
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   Like, there's so many different philosophies,
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   and that's the point.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   They are looking at a massive, a massive spiritual interest,
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   the likes of which we can relate.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   And so Paul looks at them and he says,
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   "Hey, you need to beware
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   "of seeking a spiritual feeling instead of Christ.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   "You need to beware of seeking a spiritual feeling
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   "instead of Christ."
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   He tells these Colossian Christians to be careful
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   of people who delight in asceticism
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   and the worship of angels.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   What does that even mean?
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   Well, asceticism is the idea that I attain spirituality
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   by way of self-denial.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   And the worship of angels is like on the other end
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   of the spectrum from that,
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   that it's not an issue of self-denial,
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   but it's a desire for self-enlightenment,
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   that there are a series of inferior spiritual beings
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   that all descend from God above,
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   that if I worship them, if I engage with them,
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   if I interact with them,
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   what happens is I get the chance
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   to spiritually enlighten myself.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   I get to reach and touch something that is supernatural
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   and otherworldly to my regular experience.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   That's why Paul's confronting it.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   You see, these people, they're looking,
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   they're looking at Jesus and they're saying
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   to this young group of people,
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   "He's fine.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   "Jesus is great,
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   "but we're a syncretistic bunch.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   "You should add some things onto him.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   "He's not sufficient in and of himself.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   "You probably need to mix and match
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   "a couple of other philosophies that'll help you
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   "to actually feel everything you were wanting for
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   "because we know, man, sometimes he kind of lets you down.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   "You know, it's just sometimes the day's really good
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   "and sometimes the day's really hard.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   "Sometimes he feels really close
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   "and sometimes he feels really far.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   "And so what you should do is you should just add some stuff.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   "You should pile on some more spirituality.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   "And what's going to happen is you're going to feel
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   "more transcendent, more spiritually enlightened,
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   "more inclined to the Godheads."
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   Like, they're promoting an idea that I remember facing
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   whenever I went to buy my wife and I's new car recently.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   Like, I showed up and I knew exactly what I wanted.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   I knew what I needed to take me from point A to point B.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   Like, whenever I, like, get my eyes set on something,
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   I've got a job to do, like, I'm pretty obsessive.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   Like, I do a ton of research.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   And so I made sure, like, I looked at all the comps
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   in the surrounding area.
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   I made sure that I had checked the make and the model.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   I knew the styles and the trims that I wanted in specific.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   I understood the gas mileage and knew, man,
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   this is the right car for me.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   And so I showed up and after test driving it
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   and visiting with the salesman a little bit
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   and feeling like the guy was on my side
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   because that's just his job, I ended up sitting down
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   and saying, "Let's do it, man. Let's close the deal."
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   And so I knew exactly the price that I had walked into
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   and yet he slides across the vehicle invoice
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   and that price does not match at all what I'd shown up for.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   Why?
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   Because he put a bunch of add-ons to the thing.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   He looked at my car and he said, "Man, it's great,
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   "but it's just not enough.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   "You know what you need? You need a windshield repair kit.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   "That's what you need because you're going to catch a rock man
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   "on the way home and you're going to be so upset
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   "you didn't get this. I already put it on there for you, brother.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   "I took care of it.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   "You also, you're going to want that Primo wax
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   "that I love to put on all my clients' cars.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   "I added that in there for you, just common courtesy."
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   You know, like he just walked through these
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   and I was like, "Man, I don't need any of this stuff.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   "This stuff does not enrich my experience of the car.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   "It's just an add-on.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   "It's just a supplemental improvement
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   "that does not improve anything at all."
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   In the same way Paul is saying to these young believers in Colossae,
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   "I mean, it's all the add-ons
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   "that everybody wants to add on to Jesus."
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   He's saying he's sufficient.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   He's enough.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   You don't need to add anything to him.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   You don't need to supersize your spirituality
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   through a bunch of spiritual experiences.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   That's not what you need to do to feel intensely connected to God.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   There's no secret knowledge you need to learn,
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   no mystery you need to uncover
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   to find a deeper intimacy with God.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   Listen to me.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   You want intimacy with God?
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   It's not hard to find.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   It's so much simpler than we think.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   I remember a couple years ago,
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   I preached a message similar to this.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   I came down front.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   The joy of preaching appears
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   I get to visit with you down there.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   And so I was standing on the floor following service
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   and a young lady came up to me
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   and I was anticipating what her question might be.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   Like I'm very comfortable with the fact
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   that most people will come down
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   and they have a circumstantial issue.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   And so they just want biblical guidance
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   on how to navigate through that.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   Man, what's God's will for my job?
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   Or how do I navigate this struggling relationship?
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   Or whatever it may be, overcome this sin?
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   And so I'm standing there,
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   I'm totally expecting that that's what she's gonna do.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   She's gonna come down,
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   she's gonna ask me one of those questions.
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   But it's not at all what she did.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   She just came up to me and she was like,
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   "How do I get what you have?"
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   Like, you love God.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   I can see it.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   Like how do I get that?
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   I want that.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   Now I don't normally make myself the point
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   or topic of any example.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   I get far more unimpressive with time.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   Just stick around long enough and you'll see it.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   But I point to it tonight
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   because she didn't come to me asking for some formula
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   she needed to complete to find intimacy with Jesus.
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   That's not what she was doing.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   She came asking what simple steps she needed to take.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   And what I was delighted to tell her
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   is it's rather underwhelming.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   You pray.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   You pray not to get things from God
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   but because you get God when you do it.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   You read.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   You read his word not because you want to accrue
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   a bunch of head knowledge
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   but because you want to hear the words
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   of the one whom you love.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   You spend time with him.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   And not just a fleeting moment or a passing prayer
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   while you're driving in the car.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   You take time and you walk with him
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   and you listen to him and you speak with him.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   And what you'll find through these very simple steps
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   is intimacy.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   And I just love that.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   I love that God wants to be intimate.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   Wants to be connected with you and me so bad
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   that he's like, "I'm going to make it so simple
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   they can't mess it up.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   I'm going to put it on the bottom shelf."
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   It's not that they've got to learn some secret knowledge
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   or ascribe to some elitist formula of spirituality.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   No, you don't need any of that stuff.
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   What you need is just to spend time with me.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   That's what he's saying.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   How do you get close to anybody?
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   You spend time with them.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   [pop]
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   [laughter]
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   That's what he's saying.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   He's saying spend time.
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   That's what he's wanting for.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   And that's why Paul is saying, "Hey,
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   if you want to come close to God,
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   it's not by spiritually ascending.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   It's by seeing the fact that he's spiritually descended."
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   Why? To get to you.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   Now listen, I'm not saying that Christians don't engage
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   in spiritual realities or experience.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   That's not what I'm saying at all.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   I hope you do not hear that.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   I have said from this platform myself,
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   I pray that God gives you transcendent touches
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   here on Tuesday nights.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   Because that's what he'll do.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   Like you'll walk in this room and then one night,
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   it's just going to come.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   Like the roof is going to blow off the building for you.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   It's going to be like a Tuesday that you've never before seen.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   It's going to be crazy.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   And yet you're going to come back on another Tuesday
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   and it's just going to feel like a Tuesday.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   Why? Because growth isn't always about the burning bush moment.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   It's also about the mundane moments in between.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   Like Moses grew not just because he came face to face with God
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   at the bush, at the pillar of fire,
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   at the parting of the Red Sea.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   No, he grew with God by way of wandering in the wilderness
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   for 40 years and learning to shepherd sheep.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   Some of you deeply want to grow.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   The mundanity of your spirituality,
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   it can be richer, it can be hotter.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   But don't let it discourage you.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   God's working in the waiting.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   He's working in the mundane.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   He's wanting to meet with you at all times and in all ways.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   How do you spot a spiritual fraud?
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   1 John 4, 1 through 3 tells us.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   It says, "Beloved, do not believe every spirit,
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   but test the spirits to see whether they are from God.
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   For many false prophets have gone out into the world.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   By this you know the spirit of God.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   Every spirit that confesses Jesus Christ has come in the flesh
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   is from God."
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   Catch that.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   Every spirit that confesses Jesus has come in the flesh
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   is from God.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   And every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   How do you tell if someone or something is spiritually fraudulent?
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   When the emphasis moves away from the simplicity of knowing Christ.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   It's all about Him, man.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   And when the emphasis ever becomes about anything else,
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   you get as far away from that as possible.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   And this is the reality, man.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   I fear in our desire and desperation to be connected to something that feels real.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   That feels spiritual.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   We have in fact gotten connected to things that do feel real and do feel spiritual.
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   But are not good.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   We have given ourselves over to things that fall within the list I said earlier.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   I said, you know what, I can have this crystal.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   I can manifest this idea.
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   I can indulge these other spiritual curiosities and walk with Jesus.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   No.
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   Paul is decrying that reality.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   If you want inclined spiritual experience,
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   why would you look anywhere else than the man that is the fullness of the deity?
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   Like all the fullness of God dwells in Jesus.
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   If you want something transcendent, then get intimate with him.
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   Because he will lead you to it.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   Final point.
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   Pick it up in verse 20.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   If with Christ you died to the elemental spirits of the world, why,
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   as if you were still alive in the world, do you submit to regulations?
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   Do not handle, do not taste, do not touch.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   That feels a lot like religion, right?
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   Referring to things that all perish as they are used,
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   according to human precepts and teachings.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   These have indeed an appearance of wisdom in promoting self-made religion
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   and asceticism and severity of the body,
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   but they are of no value in stopping the indulgence of the flesh.
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   As Paul moves into the final few verses of this chapter,
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   he picks up an idea that he addressed earlier on,
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   but we didn't really unpack in full detail.
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   He comes back to this idea of asceticism.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   Earlier I said that asceticism is the teaching that you spiritually attain
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   by way of self-denial.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   And yet here's what's interesting.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   Like Paul is, he's going to talk about, yeah, you know,
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   like self-denial in this context is bad,
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   but self-denial in every context isn't always bad.
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   Like if you look throughout the Bible,
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   there are multiple examples of ascetic practices, of self-denial,
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   things like fasting and abstinence and celibacy,
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   that people are, that people ultimately adopt
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   for the sake of growing closer to God.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   You can look at the words of Jesus himself.
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   He says in Luke 9, 23, "And he said to all,
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   'If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   and take up his cross daily and follow me.'"
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   Let him deny himself.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   Is self-denial intrinsically bad?
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   Is asceticism inherently wrong?
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   No, it's not.
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   But here's the thing.
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   The act of self-denial is not intrinsically wrong,
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   but what can be wrong is the motive behind your self-denial.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   That's what can be wrong.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   Which feels kind of like, yeah, man, of course.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   Like it's always about motives.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   It's always about my heart.
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   But here's what we need to grab hold of,
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   because I think that this is where the point really stands out.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   If you look at the word asceticism in the original language,
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   it's a weird word,
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   because the word actually just means humility,
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   which we hear, and we're like, "That's a really good thing, man.
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   I'm supposed to be humble."
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   God gives favor to the humble.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   He gives grace to them.
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   And yet in this context, as you read through this,
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   through these verses,
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   what Paul's unpacking is not the idea of pure humility,
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   but impure humility.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   He's unpacking this idea of false humility.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   For the Colossians, asceticism is synonymous with false humility.
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   What's false humility?
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   False humility is pride in disguise.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   It's pride in disguise.
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   I'm going to make myself look low.
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   I'm going to sound like I don't know.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   And yet in the process of doing these things,
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   they're going to think I'm awesome.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   Like one of my friends, he was saying earlier,
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   it's as if Jordan walked in and said,
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   "Man, I'm no good at basketball."
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   It's like, "Shut up, Jordan.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   You're amazing at basketball."
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   That would be false humility.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   He would be saying something that is not true.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   Why? Because he's baiting compliments.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   That's what Paul's pointing at here in this chapter.
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   He's saying, "Hey, you need to beware
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   of seeking an impressive appearance instead of Christ.
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   You need to beware of seeking an impressive appearance
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   instead of Christ."
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   When he says, "Hey, when you submit to regulations
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   that have the appearance of wisdom
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   and promoting self-made religion and asceticism
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   and severity to the body, they have no value."
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   Like when you promote your own self-made godliness,
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   your false humility,
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   when you make yourself look low like Christ,
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   but simply so you can receive acclaim
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   and accolade and approval,
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   there's no value in that.
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   That has no worth whatsoever.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   Which, Porch, if I can just deal honestly with you
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   for a second, for those of you in the room
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   that do know Jesus,
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   this is a problem that is especially prevalent
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   in our culture today, because what we know
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   is that people have bought full-heartedly
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   into the commodification of Christ
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   and viral posturing for the sake of approval,
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   all on the basis of Jesus' name.
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   You see it.
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   Just pull up Instagram right now.
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   You can see someone with lights, camera, action,
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   making sure that people look in and say,
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   "Golly, I wish I was godly like them."
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   And yet the truth of the matter is,
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   that's false humility, not in every sense,
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   but it certainly can be,
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   that people will prop themselves up
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   on the foundation of Jesus Christ's name,
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   Jesus Christ's ministry,
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   simply for the hope that you will follow them
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   more so than you'll follow him.
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   I am begging you,
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   do not be a life that follows in that vein.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   That's what Paul is drilling home.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   He's saying, "Hey, don't aspire to look
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   "like your favorite Christian influencer."
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   You don't need to always speak in quotable captions
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   and strategic sound bites.
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   He says in 1 Timothy 6, 7,
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   "Ask for the rich in the present age."
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   The rich, those that have everything they want.
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   "Charge them not to be haughty,
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   "nor to set their hopes on the uncertainty of riches,
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   "but on God who richly provides us
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   "with everything to enjoy."
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   It's not in riches, it's not in acclaim,
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   it's not through approval,
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   it's not by recognition that you enjoy, it's by God.
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   God is the source of all joy.
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   And listen, I know that feels especially specific
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   to the believer, but for the unbeliever here,
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   if you don't know Jesus,
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   if you're still trying to figure this all out,
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   Paul is pleading with you too,
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   to not just stand on the right side of history
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   and agree to today's truth,
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   but to align with the author of all history
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   and follow his objective truth.
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   That's what Paul is arguing for your sake.
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   He's saying, "Hey man, God has everything you want and more,
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   "everything you've longed for,
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.000]   "everything you've angled to get,
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   "He's the one that has it, so you come to Him."
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   Paul, I'm sorry, Jesus says in the gospel of John,
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   He says to the Jews who had believed in Him,
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   "If you abide in my word, you are truly my disciples
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   "and you'll know the truth and the truth will set you free."
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   You see the truth of Jesus Christ
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   is the one that sets us free.
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   Believer, non-believer, it's the one that sets us free.
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   Free from being enough for people,
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   free from feeling the need to position myself
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   or posture my life so people will look at it and say,
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   "Hey, that looks awesome, man, how do I get like that?"
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   Free from any need to hold up the mask
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   and hide behind it any longer,
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   like Jesus is the one that sets you free from all of it.
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   I just wish we would believe it.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   I wish we would believe the fact
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   that He is the one that has come to set us free.
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   Free from sin, yes.
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   Free from slavery and bondage of those things
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   which we know we should not do yet we have done anyways
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   and are in absolute and utter rebellion to God.
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   He has come to free us from that,
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:35.000]   but He hasn't just come to free us from our sin,
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   He has come to free us to new life,
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   to a new future, to a new hope, to a new glory.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   How do we know that that's the case?
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   How do we know that Jesus has set us free
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   from anything that would threaten our identity in Him?
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   Because Jesus Christ,
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   He did every moral activity you and I could not do.
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   He was perfect in our place.
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   He lived absolutely perfectly on your behalf.
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   But not only that, Jesus Christ, the fullness of God,
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   become man.
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   He has brought in full a spiritual experience
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   the likes of which you will find nowhere else.
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   He says, "I know that you want for something deep
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   "and meaningful and rich, and I've come to give it to you."
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   But not only that, Jesus,
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   He did not concern Himself with an impressive appearance.
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   Instead, He took on our likeness,
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   humbled Himself by becoming like one of us
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   for the very purpose of living, dying, rising,
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   that you might have an appearance the likes of which
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   you wouldn't dare dream find.
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.000]   One that is so impressive
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   that the world will look upon and not say,
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.000]   "Man, you're awesome,"
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:21.000]   but will look to Him and say, "He is awesome."
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:24.000]   This is the gospel.
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   Christ has come to set you free from every threat
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   by enduring your threat
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   that you might be with Him where He is forever.
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   Do you believe Him?
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   Do you know Him?
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   Then walk with Him, trust in Him,
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   and He will make you like Himself in due time.
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   Let me pray for us.
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.000]   Father,
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   God, there are so many
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   traps and temptations in this world,
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   so many things, God, which seek to
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   dissuade us from walking with You,
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:19.000]   lead us to seek satisfaction elsewhere.
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   And yet, God, tonight we're reminded of the reality that
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:31.000]   true love, deep joy,
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:35.000]   and uninhibited freedom
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   is found in You and You alone.
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:43.000]   And because, God, this truth still remains true,
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   and it reigns over us tonight by Your Son, Jesus Christ,
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:59.000]   we can take such courage in heart
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   that though, God, in this world we will have trouble,
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:09.000]   we can take heart, for You have overcome it,
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   and, God, we will be with You where You are one day.
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   Lord, I know that there are people in this room tonight
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.000]   that don't know You,
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:22.000]   and yet, God, they've walked in tonight,
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:24.000]   and they've asked questions
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:27.000]   that, God, I myself have asked in times past.
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   Why is life so hard?
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:31.000]   What's all this about?
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   What even is my purpose?
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.000]   And I pray, God, they would know that
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:38.000]   You are the one that has the answers to these things,
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:40.000]   and those answers, God,
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:42.000]   they're better than they could ever imagine.
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:47.000]   For the believer in the room, God,
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:49.000]   there are many of us here that,
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.000]   man, we have fallen prey to some of the dangers
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:52.000]   we've talked about tonight, God.
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:57.000]   We have absolutely fallen prey to legalism,
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:58.000]   religious observance, God,
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.000]   just doing the right thing
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:02.000]   and hoping to get good out of it,
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:04.000]   trusting, God, that that's gonna make me like Jesus.
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:06.000]   Lord, that's not gonna make us like Jesus.
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:08.000]   It's Jesus that makes us like Jesus.
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:12.000]   Sure, we gotta work out our salvation with fear and trembling.
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:15.000]   We've gotta come along and be a part of the process,
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:16.000]   but we can trust in You, God,
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:19.000]   to complete the work that You've already begun.
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:23.000]   Others of us, it's not moral activity.
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   It's spiritual sensitivity, God.
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:26.000]   We want an experience.
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:29.000]   I pray, God, that we would know
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:32.000]   in You is all the fullness we could ever seek,
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:36.000]   that Jesus, You are the image of the invisible God,
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   and so we need seek transcendence nowhere else but in You.
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:44.000]   For others, God, we feel this need to be impressive,
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:46.000]   to put up a front,
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:52.000]   to make sure, God, that we impress and appeal to people,
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:54.000]   and yet, God, we can know
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:57.000]   that we don't need to pursue impressive appearance,
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:02.000]   for You, Jesus, have given us a likeness to that of Yourself.
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:06.000]   God, would You work amongst us?
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:08.000]   Would You have Your way in this space?
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:10.000]   Would You lead us to take the next step, we pray.
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:13.000]   It's in Jesus' holy name, amen.
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:15.000]   Amen.
