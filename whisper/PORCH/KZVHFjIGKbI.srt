1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:21,400
 - Well, what's up Porch fam?

3
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,160
 Y'all, I wanted to let you know how excited I am

4
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,000
 for tonight's message.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,880
 Y'all, I get the joy in introducing our guest speaker

6
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,000
 for the night.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,760
 He comes from Southern Seminary as a former professor.

8
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,120
 Y'all, he has his PhD in theology and in the New Testament.

9
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:43,280
 He's our very own senior director of equipping

10
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,800
 here at Watermark.

11
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,200
 And lastly, y'all, he was my teacher

12
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,780
 in the Watermark Institute,

13
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,120
 which is our 10 month discipleship program.

14
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,360
 And a big part of that program is academic level training.

15
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:00,040
 And so y'all, we are in for a treat, let me tell you.

16
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:04,200
 So Porch, join me in encouraging and welcoming

17
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,560
 to the stage, Dr. Orrin Martin.

18
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,560
 (audience cheering)

19
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:18,960
 - Well, good evening Porch.

20
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:19,880
 Is that how you say it?

21
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:20,700
 Porch.

22
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,640
 Young adults, Porch Live, if you're joining us,

23
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,600
 I'm so glad that you are.

24
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,440
 If you have a Bible,

25
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:30,000
 please turn in them to Ephesians chapter one.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,880
 If you're new to the Bible,

27
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,320
 that's about two thirds, three quarters of the way in.

28
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,640
 If you get to the gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke, John.

29
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,960
 If you get to Acts, keep going, a couple more books.

30
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:44,800
 It's Ephesians.

31
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,320
 If you get to like Hebrews and Revelation, that's too far.

32
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,760
 If you have a Bible like mine, it's page 976.

33
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,780
 If you don't, you are out of luck, right?

34
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:58,600
 I do want to thank, man, just the Porch team

35
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,720
 for inviting me to speak.

36
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,320
 I'm so honored.

37
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,100
 I can't even tell you how I felt singing

38
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,800
 with you all tonight,

39
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,360
 because I just kept thinking about, Lord,

40
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,360
 if you set on fire, these people here tonight in this room

41
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,240
 and Porch Live and all those locations,

42
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,860
 if there are people who are fully surrendered

43
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:23,520
 to Jesus Christ and the life that he provides,

44
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,080
 what could happen?

45
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,240
 Imagine the nations might know and be glad in Christ.

46
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,940
 So it is a joy to be with you all.

47
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:36,040
 Let me pray for us and we can jump in.

48
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,520
 Lord, in your words, Psalm 121 says,

49
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:45,000
 when I look and lift my eyes to the hills,

50
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,200
 where does my help come?

51
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,180
 Maybe there are people in here tonight

52
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,580
 who when they look around, all they see is hills.

53
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:55,540
 They can't see past their circumstances.

54
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:58,300
 They can't see past conflict in their life,

55
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:01,420
 brokenness, addictions,

56
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:07,420
 depression, anxiety.

57
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:10,220
 But Lord, thank you for the psalmist who says,

58
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:12,420
 when we look to the hills, where do we look?

59
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:15,600
 We look to you, our God.

60
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,180
 Our help comes from the Lord,

61
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:19,540
 who is the maker of heaven and earth.

62
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:24,540
 We look to the one who exists higher than those hills.

63
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,320
 He made those hills by simply speaking words.

64
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:31,900
 And so we ask you tonight to help us by your power

65
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:35,060
 to understand your word.

66
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:37,200
 Open our eyes to the glories of Christ,

67
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,400
 we pray in his name, amen.

68
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,640
 So a couple of years ago,

69
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,240
 my wife and I went with my cousin and his wife to LA.

70
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:50,120
 It was an amazing trip because it was free to us.

71
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,160
 It was a totally a gift of my cousin, it was great.

72
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,600
 We went to Hollywood, we went to a Dodgers game.

73
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,480
 I got Mike Trout's autograph.

74
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,600
 He literally walked over to me, signed my baseball.

75
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,480
 It was amazing, my son's have it now.

76
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,180
 It was a once in a lifetime trip.

77
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,380
 One of the days that we went there,

78
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:09,240
 my cousin suggested that we go to Six Flags.

79
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,460
 It's like, great, I grew up going to Six Flags in Houston.

80
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,720
 Astroworld, maybe, I don't know.

81
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,800
 It's a Travis Scott album now, but anyways.

82
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,460
 So we go to Six Flags and my cousin,

83
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:25,400
 he gets us VIP access, which I'm like, great,

84
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,840
 whatever that means.

85
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,500
 Basically what it means is you get to ride roller coasters

86
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,320
 back to back to back to back to back to back to back

87
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,020
 without waiting in line at all.

88
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,640
 And I was like, I'm in.

89
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,760
 When I was 12, I used to dominate those things.

90
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,200
 So he was like, I got a challenge for you.

91
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:45,960
 How about we try to ride 10 roller coasters

92
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,240
 back to back without stopping,

93
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,000
 starting with the hardest, most difficult roller coaster.

94
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,200
 And by the time we get to the easiest,

95
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,200
 it'll be a piece of cake.

96
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,580
 I was like, great, let's do it.

97
00:04:58,580 --> 00:04:59,420
 So here we go.

98
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:01,240
 This was the challenge.

99
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,540
 First roller coaster.

100
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:05,280
 It was a good one.

101
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,280
 I must say, I was feeling pretty good.

102
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:12,640
 My stomach was, it was okay.

103
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,880
 But then we get off that one and we go immediately,

104
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,080
 there's probably a one minute walk to the next one.

105
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,000
 Right to the second one.

106
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,600
 And I began to notice a kind of an intensifying feeling

107
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,820
 right in this area.

108
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,840
 It's called nausea.

109
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,960
 And it just kept building.

110
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,240
 We go to the third one.

111
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,160
 We go to the fourth one.

112
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,680
 I mean, in there, just back to back to back.

113
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:42,600
 There's no time for my body to settle down

114
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,860
 and kind of get my equilibrium acquainted with the ground.

115
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:51,560
 And by the fifth roller coaster, I was done.

116
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,960
 But there's this little thing in me called pride.

117
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,740
 And I was like, dude, I'm making it to 10.

118
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:58,900
 So let's go another round.

119
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,400
 So we get on the sixth roller coaster

120
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,560
 and it was all I could do.

121
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:08,120
 I was praying like I have never prayed before in my life.

122
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:12,000
 Lord, help me keep whatever is in me down.

123
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,300
 And you will get all the praise.

124
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:20,440
 And by God's grace, he did it.

125
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,360
 And I stepped off that roller coaster

126
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:26,520
 and immediately I lost everything.

127
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,240
 I mean, people were around us.

128
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,780
 It was awesome.

129
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,700
 It was terrible.

130
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,860
 (congregation laughing)

131
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,940
 There was just this overwhelming feeling

132
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:40,280
 of I just kept growing and building and growing

133
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:45,280
 and building until, well, not good things happened.

134
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,220
 And then we drove home through the hills of Hollywood.

135
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,580
 That was great.

136
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,400
 'Cause we thought being on a roller coaster all over again

137
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,300
 for the next hour and a half drive.

138
00:06:54,300 --> 00:07:00,700
 And it was an amazing, overwhelming experience.

139
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,460
 Now, what does that have to do with our passage tonight?

140
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:08,860
 Well, I want to tell you that our passage tonight

141
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:12,360
 should have a similar effect in our lives.

142
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:17,420
 That there should be an overwhelming feeling

143
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,960
 when we read through our text,

144
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:23,060
 that it just continues to build and build and build

145
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:26,880
 until it just culminates and erupts in praise.

146
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,580
 When we read this passage,

147
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:32,220
 I want us to keep just a couple of things in mind.

148
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:36,700
 In the original in Greek, it is one unbroken long sentence.

149
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,700
 We're gonna read in Ephesians chapter one,

150
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,020
 verses three through 14.

151
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:44,080
 That whole, in our Bible, that's two paragraphs.

152
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,140
 That's one sentence.

153
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:48,380
 And mind you, in Greek, there is no punctuation.

154
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,860
 There's no periods, no commas.

155
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:54,880
 It's just one long sentence

156
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,940
 with crazy grammatical things happening.

157
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,900
 If you're into that, come talk to me afterwards.

158
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,660
 Those things kind of bring me joy.

159
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:04,020
 If you're like into grammar and participles

160
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:07,620
 and prepositions and phrases and how it all fits together,

161
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,620
 it's an amazing experience, kind of like that rollercoaster.

162
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:17,380
 Twists and turns, and it just builds and builds and builds.

163
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,300
 In fact, I will challenge you,

164
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,980
 maybe when you get home tonight or sometime this week,

165
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:26,020
 try to read verses three through 14 in one breath.

166
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,100
 I told them earlier, I was gonna try it.

167
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:31,180
 I actually practiced it in my office about an hour ago,

168
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:33,100
 and I almost passed out.

169
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:36,180
 I made it to verse 13 and I couldn't make it.

170
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:37,220
 So I'm not even gonna try it here

171
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:39,160
 because you don't want me passing out here.

172
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,900
 But just try to read it in one breath.

173
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,180
 It does something.

174
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:45,640
 You just get overwhelmed with what Paul's saying.

175
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:49,780
 It's like Paul's walking through a room

176
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:54,100
 filled with unending treasures,

177
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,420
 and he's just trying to grasp at words,

178
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:00,280
 attempting to describe what he sees.

179
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,580
 There's this treasure and this treasure and this treasure.

180
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,480
 And if that's not enough,

181
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,540
 there's more treasure as he walks us through these verses.

182
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:11,500
 And what he wants to tell us tonight,

183
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,560
 and what I think the Lord wants to tell us tonight

184
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:17,260
 is there is an all-sufficient,

185
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:20,660
 life-possessing God who saves,

186
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:25,140
 and he is worthy of your life and of your praise.

187
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:29,540
 The all-sufficient, life-possessing God who saves

188
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:32,620
 is worthy of your life and my life,

189
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:35,020
 and he is worthy of our praise.

190
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,860
 So let's read our passage.

191
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:39,160
 Ephesians chapter one, beginning in verse three.

192
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:43,220
 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,

193
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,940
 who has blessed us in Christ

194
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:48,380
 with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places.

195
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,180
 Even as he chose us in him

196
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,820
 before the foundation of the world,

197
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:54,940
 that we should be holy and blameless before him.

198
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:57,940
 In love he predestined us for adoption through Jesus Christ

199
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,560
 according to the purpose of his will,

200
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,380
 to the praise of his glorious grace

201
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:04,360
 with which he's blessed us in the beloved.

202
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,860
 In him we have redemption through his blood,

203
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,500
 the forgiveness of our trespasses

204
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,660
 according to the riches of his grace,

205
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:13,140
 which he lavished upon us in our wisdom and insight,

206
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,500
 making known to us the mystery of his will.

207
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,860
 According to the purpose which he set forth

208
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:20,620
 in Christ as a plan for the fullness of time

209
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,180
 to unite all things in him,

210
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:25,140
 things in heaven and things on earth.

211
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,780
 And he ain't done yet.

212
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:30,300
 And in him we have obtained an inheritance

213
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:33,100
 having been predestined according to the purpose of him

214
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,460
 who works all things according to the counsel of his will.

215
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:40,100
 So that we who were the first to hope in Christ

216
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,660
 might be to the praise of his glory.

217
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:45,520
 And in him you also, when you heard the word of truth,

218
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,580
 the gospel of your salvation

219
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,700
 and believed in him were sealed

220
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,700
 with the promised Holy Spirit,

221
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:54,100
 who is the guarantee of our inheritance

222
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,260
 until we acquire possession of it,

223
00:10:56,260 --> 00:11:00,400
 to the praise of his glory.

224
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:04,140
 Now, before we jump into tonight's text,

225
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,780
 I want us just to observe a couple of things

226
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:06,860
 from these verses.

227
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:10,980
 One, if you notice the phrase in Christ or in him

228
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:14,620
 or through Jesus Christ or in the beloved,

229
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:17,260
 you'll notice that in these 12 verses,

230
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:22,260
 11 times Paul says in Christ, in Christ, in Christ,

231
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,300
 in Christ.

232
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,700
 And this is a marker for Paul.

233
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,860
 Actually, if you go to account for the New Testament,

234
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,700
 there are over a hundred times from Jesus,

235
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,540
 think about Jesus in John chapter 15.

236
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:37,340
 If you abide in me and I in you through Paul,

237
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,700
 all the way through the book of Revelation,

238
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,780
 there are literally over a hundred times

239
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:44,300
 where this phrase in Christ is used.

240
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,860
 And it is used to describe Christians

241
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:51,180
 to say, if you are in Christ, you have a new identity.

242
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,300
 You are not defined by your past.

243
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:56,020
 If you have put your trust and fully surrendered

244
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,940
 to Jesus Christ as your Lord and savior,

245
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:00,140
 you are no longer defined by your past.

246
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:02,740
 You are now defined by Christ's past,

247
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:06,860
 his life, his death, his burial, his resurrection.

248
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,500
 And now he's seated at God's right hand.

249
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,780
 And scripture can say of the Christian, if that's true,

250
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,900
 and you put your faith in Christ,

251
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,580
 then you have died with Christ.

252
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,620
 You've been buried with Christ, Romans 6.

253
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,540
 You've been raised to walk in the new civil limb.

254
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:22,060
 You've been seated with him in the heavenly place

255
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,220
 as Ephesians 2 says.

256
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:27,260
 And so your identity is now in Christ.

257
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:29,980
 That's who you are.

258
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:35,020
 And so if you're here tonight and you are not in Christ,

259
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,900
 if you can say tonight, this is between you and the Lord,

260
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,660
 that's not me, I'm not a Christian.

261
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:42,580
 I just showed up, I was invited by a friend

262
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:43,980
 or I thought I was coming someplace.

263
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:47,580
 And here I am in this room, God has you here for a purpose.

264
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:49,140
 It's that purpose is so that you can hear

265
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,940
 about what it means to be in Christ

266
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:53,420
 and to find your life in him.

267
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:56,820
 But I just want you to consider what's being said tonight.

268
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:00,580
 Listen in on a conversation that God is having

269
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:05,580
 with his people in Christ and consider and respond to him.

270
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:10,300
 So let's look at our first point.

271
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,380
 Our first point is praise the father

272
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,300
 from whom all blessings flow.

273
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:18,380
 You'll see this in verses three through six.

274
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:24,300
 Blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ

275
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:27,560
 who has blessed us in Christ.

276
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:30,420
 Do you see those two statements?

277
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:35,420
 God is blessed and God has blessed us, his people.

278
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:39,720
 And between those two statements

279
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:43,820
 lies the glorious gospel of God's infinite grace.

280
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:46,460
 Listen, he's blessed us in Christ.

281
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:47,900
 He chose us in Christ.

282
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:50,900
 He's predestined us for adoption in Jesus Christ.

283
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:53,100
 He's working all things according to the counsel

284
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,940
 of his will in Christ.

285
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:57,140
 That's what Paul says God is and who he is

286
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,260
 and what he's done.

287
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,500
 Paul's not giving a command or a wish

288
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,420
 that God will be blessed.

289
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:04,660
 He's not saying, oh, I really wish that God was blessed.

290
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:07,340
 He's not asking a question, is God blessed?

291
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:13,080
 No, Paul is declaring what is in fact true.

292
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:17,120
 God is blessed because as Psalm 36, nine says,

293
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:22,120
 he is a fountain of life and in his light do we see light.

294
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,440
 Acts 17 says that God doesn't live

295
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,680
 in a temple made with hands.

296
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:30,480
 He's not served by human hands as though he needed anything

297
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,920
 for he himself gives to mankind life and breath

298
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,760
 and all things.

299
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,720
 What's Paul saying there in Acts 17?

300
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,480
 He's saying God doesn't receive anything

301
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,800
 from outside of himself like we do.

302
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,640
 We receive life.

303
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,980
 We need things outside of ourselves for life,

304
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:49,120
 but God is a fountain of life.

305
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,840
 He doesn't need anything outside of himself,

306
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,720
 but he gives life to his people.

307
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,120
 And the God who has life in himself is the God

308
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,340
 who has given life from himself.

309
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:04,400
 Now notice what it does not say.

310
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:08,360
 It's good to linger and to just pay attention to words.

311
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:12,080
 It does not say blessed be the porch

312
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:15,480
 who has blessed God with every spiritual blessing

313
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:19,140
 just as the porch chose God

314
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,400
 before the foundation of the world.

315
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,440
 It doesn't say that.

316
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:26,080
 It doesn't say that God loved us because we were lovely

317
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,500
 or because we were sons and daughters

318
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,440
 or because we were holy and blameless.

319
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,240
 No, if you keep reading in Ephesians in chapter two,

320
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,480
 it says quite the opposite.

321
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,760
 It says that we were dead in our trespasses and sins

322
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:41,400
 and that we were by nature, children of wrath

323
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,880
 because God is holy and righteous.

324
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,200
 He must punish sin.

325
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:50,080
 He cannot even stand for sin to be in his presence.

326
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,120
 He must punish it.

327
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,680
 But God, Ephesians two says,

328
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:58,360
 being rich in mercy chose us in Christ

329
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,100
 before the foundation of the world,

330
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:05,800
 before he made you Christian, he chose you.

331
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:09,580
 Now notice what Paul focuses on here.

332
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:15,040
 I don't want us to get caught up in there's age old debates

333
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,600
 on what is the doctrine of election and predestination

334
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,920
 and what's the relationship between God's sovereignty

335
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,120
 and our choice and all these kinds of things.

336
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,840
 I wanna bypass those things.

337
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:27,040
 If you wanna talk to it afterwards, I'd love to.

338
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,840
 Been debated for hundreds and hundreds of years.

339
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,600
 Let me just say, we're not gonna figure it out tonight.

340
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,320
 But Paul does not focus on the logic of election,

341
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,320
 but on its lavishness.

342
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:44,240
 In love, it says God predestined us,

343
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,440
 not as an angry father, but as a loving father

344
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:53,440
 who looked at people who only deserved his just judgment

345
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,120
 and wrath and he says, I will lavish

346
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,800
 and pour out my grace on you.

347
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:05,240
 Friends, people have tried to solve the problems

348
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,080
 of God's sovereignty and our free will

349
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:10,440
 for centuries and centuries and centuries.

350
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,360
 You can go back to Augustine in the fourth century

351
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,860
 and he's having those debates.

352
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:16,120
 But let me tell you this,

353
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:19,520
 if it doesn't cause you and me the fact

354
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,320
 that what scripture says that he chose us in Christ

355
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,320
 before the foundation of the world,

356
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:26,480
 if that doesn't cause us to sing more wholeheartedly

357
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,600
 the song of redemption, we've missed it.

358
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 Election is not for arguments, it is for adoration.

359
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,600
 It's to adore God because of his great love for us.

360
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,920
 So get Paul's point, if you have turned

361
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:44,480
 from your sin tonight and you have trusted in Jesus Christ,

362
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,700
 if you have fully surrendered to him,

363
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:52,080
 the one who lived the life that you and I couldn't live,

364
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,920
 the one who died the death that you and I deserve to die

365
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,040
 because of our sin against God,

366
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,640
 who paid the penalty that we should have paid

367
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:03,280
 and couldn't pay, if we put our trust in Jesus Christ

368
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,720
 who lived that life, who died that death,

369
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,480
 who paid that penalty and who was raised from the dead

370
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,940
 as the only righteous one,

371
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:15,860
 then what Paul says can be said of you.

372
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:19,280
 The God, the father who from eternity past

373
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:23,340
 has been father of the son is your father.

374
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,520
 Does that amaze you?

375
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,520
 Martin Luther, the great reformer from the 1500s

376
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,000
 once said, "The life of Christianity consists

377
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,560
 "in possessive pronouns."

378
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,040
 Now, some of you just got lost when I said pronouns.

379
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,960
 You're like, "I haven't seen pronouns since grammar school."

380
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,520
 And I don't even know what grade that was in.

381
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,820
 Third grade, I don't know.

382
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:46,600
 But listen to it again, "The life of Christianity

383
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,880
 "consists of possessive pronouns."

384
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,680
 It's one thing to say, Luther says, "Christ is a savior."

385
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,080
 It's quite another thing to say,

386
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,820
 "He is my savior and my Lord."

387
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:59,720
 Luther says, "The devil can say the first,

388
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,860
 "but the true Christian and the true Christian alone

389
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,000
 "can say the second."

390
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,600
 If you have Christ as your savior,

391
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,680
 then you have God as your father.

392
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:16,240
 Don't ever take that for granted.

393
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,720
 Maybe you're in here tonight

394
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:22,800
 and when you hear the word father, you kind of cringe.

395
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,480
 You get anxious because you didn't have a good father.

396
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:29,200
 Maybe you're in here tonight like me

397
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,800
 and you lost your father.

398
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,480
 When I was 18, my father died.

399
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,380
 And he was a wonderful father.

400
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:40,920
 Though after he died, we found out he lived a double life

401
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,880
 and he was unfaithful to my mom

402
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,740
 and died as a result of a sexual sin.

403
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:48,320
 And so I've had struggles thinking about,

404
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,200
 is God really who he says he is?

405
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,200
 Can I just tell you tonight that God is who he says he is?

406
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,760
 And we don't have to look any further

407
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,920
 than the cross of Christ,

408
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,880
 that God demonstrated his own love toward us

409
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,040
 in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.

410
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,720
 We don't have to look to our circumstances.

411
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,400
 We don't have to look to our bank accounts.

412
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,000
 We don't have to look to our jobs or positions

413
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,520
 or possessions or anything else to know

414
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,040
 that God is our father who loves us.

415
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,040
 We look to the cross of Christ

416
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,520
 and the objective fact of history

417
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,880
 to tell us that he loves us.

418
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:26,160
 And for what purpose has God done this work?

419
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:29,480
 Well, Paul says in verse four,

420
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,680
 that we should be holy and blameless before him.

421
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:38,560
 Listen, God did not save us

422
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,400
 so that we could go on living the same life we always lived.

423
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:45,600
 No, he saved us so that we would go on to be holy

424
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,840
 and blameless before him to the praise

425
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,880
 of his glorious grace.

426
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,680
 Friends, holiness is not an option.

427
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:55,880
 God chose us before the foundation of the world

428
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:00,520
 that we should be more and more and more like Jesus,

429
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:03,480
 made more and more and more like him.

430
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:09,160
 And we should understand that the gospel is so powerful

431
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:12,000
 that it not only has the power to save us,

432
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 the gospel has the power to save us.

433
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 To save us, the gospel has the power to change us

434
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 and to transform us, the second Corinthians three says,

435
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,360
 from one degree of glory to another.

436
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,320
 And so I ask you tonight,

437
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,160
 is there an area of your life

438
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,160
 that is not holy and blameless?

439
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:33,520
 Now don't mistake me.

440
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,560
 Holy and blameless does not mean sinless.

441
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:42,880
 Rather, it means a life that's not holding onto sin.

442
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,480
 It's letting go of sin.

443
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,680
 It's turning from sin and it's surrendering to Jesus Christ.

444
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:53,440
 And what's the good news for us?

445
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,080
 The good news for us is that we can repent.

446
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,600
 We can give that sin to Jesus who's taken it on his cross.

447
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:05,320
 But here's the thing, God the father began our salvation,

448
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:08,880
 but he did not purchase our salvation.

449
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,960
 That work belongs to the son, which is our second point.

450
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:15,240
 Praise the son from whom all blessings flow.

451
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:20,920
 We see this in verses seven through 12.

452
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:23,640
 And we see it all throughout, but specifically those.

453
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:26,440
 And it's interesting that Paul can't talk about the father

454
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:29,320
 without making a beeline for the son.

455
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,680
 Again, listen, he says we are blessed in Christ,

456
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,880
 chosen in Christ, adopted through Christ,

457
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:37,160
 redeemed in Christ, and we have an inheritance in Christ.

458
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:40,840
 If God the father is the source of blessing,

459
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:45,160
 God the son is the center and place of blessing.

460
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,920
 As the father planned our salvation,

461
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:51,040
 so the son accomplished and purchased our salvation.

462
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,560
 And how did he do this?

463
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:57,120
 Well, Philippians 2 tells us that the son,

464
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,680
 the second person of the Trinity,

465
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,560
 though he was in the form of God,

466
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,400
 though he was equal with God,

467
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:07,000
 did not regard a quality with God, a thing to be grasped,

468
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,400
 a thing to be seized and used for his advantage.

469
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,160
 But what did he do?

470
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,720
 He humbled himself.

471
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:17,680
 He made himself nothing by taking the form of a servant

472
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:21,240
 and being found in the likeness of man.

473
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:24,280
 He humbled himself to the point of death,

474
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:29,280
 even death on a cross for our salvation.

475
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:37,000
 The eternal son became a servant so that servants to sin

476
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,500
 could become children of God.

477
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,000
 That's what Paul means when he says

478
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,080
 that God predestined us for adoption.

479
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,680
 It's a wonderful word.

480
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:48,080
 Paul used this over and over and over.

481
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,920
 I have a good friend that I taught with for about 10 years

482
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,200
 who adopted a little boy.

483
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,080
 And Brian was telling me one day

484
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,360
 that his son, Stephan, ran away from home

485
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,240
 because he did something wrong.

486
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,640
 He stole some food out of their pantry.

487
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,560
 And he thought because he did that,

488
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,820
 when his parents found out,

489
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:06,640
 they would send him away back to the orphanage

490
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,960
 because that happened to him before.

491
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,400
 And they searched for Stephan for hours and hours and hours.

492
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,040
 And all of a sudden they got a call from the police saying,

493
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,240
 "We found your son."

494
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,480
 And they drove to Stephan and Brian, my friend,

495
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,840
 he played football for Alabama.

496
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,360
 He gets down on one knee and he says to Stephan,

497
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,320
 "Stephan, what have you done?"

498
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,640
 And Stephan says, "Well, I thought that if you found out

499
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,280
 what I did, you would send me away."

500
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,840
 And Brian took him and put his hands on his shoulders

501
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:35,920
 and said, "Stephan, you need to stop thinking like an orphan

502
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,440
 and begin thinking like a son."

503
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,520
 (congregation murmurs)

504
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,320
 You see, Stephan in that moment thought

505
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,440
 that Brian was a different kind of father.

506
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:48,940
 And he wasn't a good and gracious and heavenly father.

507
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:54,240
 And Christian, that can be true of us, can it?

508
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,160
 Brothers and sisters in Christ.

509
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,100
 Sometimes we can live like orphans too.

510
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:02,920
 Sometimes when we sin and we feel that guilt

511
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,520
 or we feel that shame, we think,

512
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:08,480
 "Oh, the worst place for us is to run to our father.

513
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,960
 He'll send me away."

514
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,460
 And that's not who the father is.

515
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:16,000
 We know that from the parable of not just the prodigal son,

516
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,200
 but the father who runs after his son,

517
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,600
 who clothes them with his very robe.

518
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,760
 It's what God has done for us in his son.

519
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:27,400
 He's clothed us with the very righteousness of Christ

520
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,920
 so that when we feel guilt and shame,

521
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,400
 what's the best thing we can do?

522
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,720
 We run to our father 'cause he's the only one

523
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,720
 who can take our sin away and cleanse us

524
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,040
 from all unrighteousness so that we might have fellowship

525
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,240
 and walk in the light, as he is in the light.

526
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:43,000
 And Paul goes on in verse seven and says that in him,

527
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,960
 we have redemption through his blood.

528
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,440
 That word redemption, you see,

529
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,200
 Paul's just like stacking terms,

530
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,760
 predestined, adopted, redeemed.

531
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:55,360
 Redemption is a word that takes us all the way back

532
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,200
 to the book of Exodus.

533
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,440
 Do you remember that story when God delivered his people,

534
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,680
 Israel, from the hands of the Egyptians?

535
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,840
 They were in slavery and they were enslaved

536
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:05,920
 to the Egyptians, forced to do hard labor.

537
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:09,580
 And God delivered them with an outstretched arm,

538
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:11,640
 with mighty signs and wonders.

539
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,240
 And you remember how he saved them.

540
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,640
 He saved them by saying, Israel,

541
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,320
 I'm gonna come for judgment.

542
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,720
 I'm gonna judge those who have rebelled against me.

543
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,040
 But if he put the blood of a lamb above your doorpost,

544
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:27,960
 if your house is covered with the blood of a lamb,

545
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:31,200
 you'll be spared and I'll pass over you in judgment

546
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,360
 and I will save you into the promised land.

547
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:37,920
 But as great as that reliverance was,

548
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,740
 if you remember the story, by the end of Exodus,

549
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:41,600
 I mean, just literally chapters later,

550
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,780
 within days of God delivering them,

551
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:46,480
 it didn't solve their problem.

552
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,320
 What were they doing?

553
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,140
 They were grumbling.

554
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:53,560
 It culminates in a full-out worship of a golden calf

555
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:56,580
 in Exodus 32 and 33, that they're committing idolatry.

556
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,560
 And by the end of Exodus,

557
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:01,640
 we're shown that the fundamental problem of Israel

558
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:05,640
 was not the idolatry and the worship outside of them,

559
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:08,100
 but the idolatry and false worship in them.

560
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:11,500
 And friends, that's our problem too.

561
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:14,220
 We may not make idols of gold and worship them,

562
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:16,360
 but we share our good, our putting our confidence

563
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,520
 and other things, finding our identity

564
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:21,880
 and things outside of our creator and status or power

565
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:25,680
 or influence or possessions or pleasure or our abilities

566
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:30,080
 or positions or relationships or body image or followers

567
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,720
 or accomplishments, or you fill in the blank.

568
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,080
 And we miss the fact that we were created

569
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,520
 to find our life in Him.

570
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,520
 And instead we try to find it elsewhere.

571
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,360
 And like the end of Exodus shows us,

572
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,920
 a better Exodus is needed.

573
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,200
 And that's what Jesus Christ came to do,

574
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,000
 to provide a better redemption.

575
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,960
 Because it's not just the blood of bulls and goats,

576
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,860
 it's the blood of His own body.

577
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:59,240
 The spotless blood of the Lamb.

578
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,200
 That's why John the Baptist, when he sees him in John,

579
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,800
 he says, "Behold the Lamb of God

580
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,700
 who takes away the sin of the world."

581
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:08,880
 Because Christ was a better Lamb.

582
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,860
 Christ provides a better redemption.

583
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:15,740
 And God has provided it in Jesus.

584
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:19,520
 My wife and I watched a documentary

585
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,400
 on the life of Caliph Browder somewhat recently.

586
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,240
 And if you've never seen it, it's a documentary

587
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,720
 made by Jay-Z.

588
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:29,000
 And Browder as a teenager, I think 13, 14,

589
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,720
 was wrongfully accused of stealing a backpack.

590
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,080
 This is just a young teenager, my son's age, 14 years old.

591
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,800
 Gets accused of stealing a backpack,

592
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:43,140
 gets wrongfully accused, put in prison in Rikers Island,

593
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:45,160
 which is one of the worst prisons to be put in.

594
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,560
 He was there for three years, during which time

595
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:51,360
 he was subjected to horrible abuses.

596
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:55,800
 Violence, inhumane treatment and isolation.

597
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,000
 This was a kid.

598
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,600
 And when given the chance to plead guilty

599
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,880
 and reduce his prison time,

600
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,480
 he refused because he knew he was innocent.

601
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,480
 And after three years of fighting the injustice,

602
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,720
 he was finally released.

603
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:13,120
 And imagine the way that he felt when he was released.

604
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,880
 Imagine the way he felt when he was freed and vindicated.

605
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,900
 Imagine the commitment that he wanted to live differently.

606
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:26,500
 Unfortunately, he could not escape the horrors

607
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:30,800
 that plagued him and he ended up taking his own life.

608
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:35,800
 Friends, you and I are not wrongfully accused,

609
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,000
 like Khalif Browder was wrongfully accused.

610
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,380
 Each of us has sinned against an infinitely holy God

611
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:43,820
 and we are slaves to sin.

612
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:47,660
 We are in bondage to sin and we deserve his punishment

613
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:50,580
 because we're guilty.

614
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:54,180
 But God has provided a way to change that verdict

615
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,540
 from guilty to innocent

616
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:59,300
 because Jesus has provided a better redemption.

617
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:02,500
 Colossians 1, 12 tells us that God delivered us, or 13,

618
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,300
 he delivered us from the domain of darkness

619
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:07,740
 and has transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved son,

620
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,380
 the righteous one,

621
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:12,780
 in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.

622
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:14,300
 Do you see that?

623
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:16,460
 Because God has delivered his people

624
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:19,860
 from the domain of sin and Satan and death

625
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:23,900
 and transferred him to be in the place of his son.

626
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:27,620
 Now, when God looks at us, he looks at us as his children.

627
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:29,700
 And Paul goes on in verse 11 to say

628
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:32,700
 that we have obtained an inheritance.

629
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:37,260
 Do you know who gets an inheritance?

630
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:40,260
 Not orphans, but sons and daughters.

631
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:45,380
 Now, imagine that you're an orphan and you owe a great debt

632
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:51,380
 and someone steps in and pays that debt off.

633
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:54,580
 Now, you might be thinking that's great at all,

634
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:56,780
 but do you see two problems with that?

635
00:30:56,780 --> 00:31:00,620
 You may have no debt, but there's two problems.

636
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:03,120
 You're still an orphan and you ain't got no money.

637
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,060
 Do you see that?

638
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:08,260
 Well, that's not what it means to be adopted in Christ.

639
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:11,460
 Not only has God removed our debt,

640
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:15,460
 God has deposited in our bank account, so to speak,

641
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:19,380
 the very righteousness and obedience and life of Christ.

642
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:21,420
 Not only has our debt been paid,

643
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:24,580
 but we've been adopted and given an inheritance.

644
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:28,340
 And I think a great temptation for us as Christians

645
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:30,780
 to think is that too little has happened to us

646
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:32,500
 by God's grace.

647
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,300
 I mean, we struggle.

648
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:36,260
 We stumble in many ways, as James says.

649
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:39,500
 We sin for the thousandth time we sin

650
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:43,260
 and we think, will there ever be freedom?

651
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:45,380
 And the answer is yes, maybe not in this life,

652
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:47,180
 but certainly in the life to come.

653
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:48,020
 And why?

654
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:51,540
 Because God has guaranteed it with an inheritance,

655
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:53,100
 the inheritance of his son,

656
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:55,020
 who the son is by nature,

657
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:57,500
 has made us sons and daughters by grace.

658
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:01,620
 We receive his status as son and his riches as son.

659
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:08,260
 But notice finally, God the Father began your salvation.

660
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:11,100
 God the Son purchased and accomplished your salvation,

661
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:14,060
 but God the Father and the Son do not apply

662
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:15,820
 or perfect your salvation.

663
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:18,580
 That work belongs to God, the Holy Spirit.

664
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:20,620
 Look with me at verses 13 and 14.

665
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:22,180
 It says that in him, you also,

666
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,180
 when you heard the word of truth,

667
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:25,700
 the gospel of your salvation and believed in him,

668
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:28,180
 were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit,

669
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:30,180
 who is the guarantee of our inheritance

670
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:31,860
 until we acquire possession of it

671
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:33,780
 to the praise of his glory.

672
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:35,660
 Do you see that?

673
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:38,660
 If getting the Father and the Son weren't enough,

674
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:43,260
 we get all of God for all of our salvation.

675
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:46,980
 We enjoy every spiritual blessing by the Spirit.

676
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:51,420
 The presence of the Spirit is connected

677
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:53,660
 to the work of the Father and of the Son.

678
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,780
 It's like Jesus said in John chapter 15.

679
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:59,380
 But when the helper comes, speaking of the Holy Spirit,

680
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:01,900
 when Jesus goes away after his death and resurrection

681
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,640
 and he ascends to the Father,

682
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,620
 when the helper comes,

683
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:07,340
 whom I will send to you from the Father

684
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:10,020
 and the Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Father,

685
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:12,460
 he will bear witness about me.

686
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:14,340
 He will guide you in the truth.

687
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:16,940
 He will take from me, Jesus says,

688
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:18,580
 and he will make it known to you.

689
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:21,620
 And so Jesus says in these chapters

690
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,980
 that the one who is from the Father and the Son

691
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:28,100
 brings us into saving life-giving fellowship

692
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,500
 with the Father and the Son.

693
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:34,220
 And that fellowship, that communion

694
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:38,540
 flows from the very life of Christ.

695
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:40,900
 You see, because to have the Spirit

696
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,380
 and to walk by the Spirit

697
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,980
 and to be filled with the Spirit

698
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:47,580
 is to be filled with the all-satisfying joy

699
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:49,020
 and life of Christ,

700
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:51,740
 the very all-satisfying life and joy

701
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:53,220
 that Jesus prayed to his Father

702
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:55,380
 before he was betrayed and crucified.

703
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:57,900
 He says, "With the glory that we shared from before

704
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:00,660
 the foundations of the world," in John 17.

705
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:03,460
 He brings us into that relationship

706
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:07,340
 and we share in that glory and joy.

707
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:09,500
 And Paul says two things about the Holy Spirit

708
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,060
 specifically in our passage.

709
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:15,580
 First, he says that after hearing the gospel and believing,

710
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:18,940
 we are sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise.

711
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:23,180
 In other words, the indwelling presence

712
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:26,340
 of the Spirit in our lives is evidence.

713
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:29,540
 It is the proof of belonging to God.

714
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:32,580
 Not church involvement.

715
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:34,780
 If your name is on a membership role,

716
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:36,820
 that's not proof that you belong to God

717
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:40,140
 or any earthly relationship for that matter

718
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:44,620
 or any one-time decision, as good as those things might be.

719
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:48,900
 It's the Spirit's presence and work in our lives

720
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:52,900
 that assure us that we are children of God.

721
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:55,940
 So Romans 8 says that the Spirit bears witness

722
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:57,580
 with our spirit that what?

723
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:59,900
 That we are children of God.

724
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:04,740
 This is how we know that we abide in him, 1 John 4 says.

725
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:06,540
 This is how we know that we abide in him

726
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:09,500
 and he abides in us, that he's given us his Spirit.

727
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:13,300
 Do you thank God for the gift of himself

728
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:14,940
 in the person of his Spirit?

729
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:22,820
 He came to intercede, comfort, help, fill,

730
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:27,340
 gift, guide, lead, and he does all these things

731
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:29,100
 that we might know and rest in

732
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:32,100
 and proclaim Christ to others.

733
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:36,180
 And secondly, Paul says that the Holy Spirit is the deposit.

734
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:37,900
 All right, do you see that in verse 14?

735
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:41,580
 He is the guarantee, the deposit,

736
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:46,100
 the down payment of our inheritance to come

737
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:48,820
 until we acquire possession of it.

738
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:52,100
 All right, the point here is that God is so determined

739
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:54,500
 to save you and to save me

740
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:58,220
 that he has put down the deposit.

741
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:03,180
 He has laid down the guarantee of himself

742
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:04,740
 that guarantees its completion.

743
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:07,260
 Maybe you've heard stories like this,

744
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:09,020
 but I've heard stories about guys

745
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:11,860
 who can't afford engagement rings.

746
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:13,300
 I won't ask anybody in this room

747
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:15,180
 to raise their hands with that to you.

748
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:17,540
 Maybe you know somebody who can't afford engagement rings,

749
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:18,500
 so what do they do?

750
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:24,060
 Guys are geniuses, so they use things like string,

751
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:28,820
 key rings, candy rings as imitations,

752
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:31,260
 maybe as a down payment to guarantee

753
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,380
 that something better is coming.

754
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:34,180
 Now, if you're thinking about doing that,

755
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:36,460
 can I just say real quickly, don't.

756
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:40,020
 (congregation laughing)

757
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:42,500
 But you get the point, right?

758
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,180
 They guarantee, right, it's the down payment,

759
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:45,620
 something better is coming.

760
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:48,020
 It better be, am I right, ladies?

761
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:49,620
 Yeah.

762
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:54,620
 Friends, friends, think about this.

763
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:59,100
 Something better than this world is coming.

764
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:02,100
 Do you feel the brokenness in your own body,

765
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:05,620
 in your own life, inside and outside of you?

766
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:08,380
 Something better is coming.

767
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:11,780
 A whole new world where there will be no more brokenness,

768
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:15,260
 no more sin, no more pain, no more cancer,

769
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:19,700
 no more conflict, no more death, no more grief.

770
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:22,620
 Scripture tells us in Revelation that when Christ returns

771
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:25,180
 to judge the living and the dead,

772
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:26,820
 he will make all things new.

773
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:30,380
 He will wipe away every tear from our eye.

774
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:34,460
 He will finally destroy sin, Satan, and death,

775
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:38,220
 and we will finally enjoy our inheritance,

776
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:41,420
 a new world full of joy and life

777
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:44,300
 in the presence of our God and Savior,

778
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:46,220
 where we will say he will be our God

779
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:49,200
 and we will be his people, no more sin.

780
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:54,260
 So friends, don't settle for cheap substitutes.

781
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:56,860
 If you're looking for life and joy,

782
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:59,380
 don't settle for cheap substitutes.

783
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:02,380
 Don't look to other places to give you life

784
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,720
 and reassurance of God's love.

785
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,260
 Don't look to your obedience.

786
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:08,140
 Don't look to your circumstances.

787
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:11,340
 Don't look to any temporal blessing.

788
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:15,900
 By the work of the Spirit in you,

789
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:18,100
 by the presence of the Spirit in you,

790
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:21,940
 look to Christ, who guarantees

791
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:23,900
 that a new creation's coming,

792
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:26,540
 and you have his Spirit to make sure

793
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:29,260
 that it will be complete.

794
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:32,620
 So as we close tonight,

795
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:35,540
 let me just encourage you once again, just think.

796
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:40,300
 Just take a moment and think about the blessings.

797
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:42,220
 If you place your trust,

798
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:44,860
 if you have given your life to Jesus,

799
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:47,940
 think about the blessings that are yours

800
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:49,620
 in him by his Spirit.

801
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:53,500
 Every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places,

802
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,780
 chosen in Christ, holy in Christ,

803
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:58,740
 adopted in Christ, redeemed in Christ,

804
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:02,220
 and guaranteed of a bright future.

805
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:06,580
 And as you think about those blessings

806
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:09,780
 that God has given you in Christ by his Spirit,

807
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:12,380
 think about why he gave you them.

808
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:17,020
 Three times Paul says it in that constant refrain,

809
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:19,300
 "To the praise of his glory,

810
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:21,660
 "to the praise of his glorious grace,

811
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:25,140
 "to the praise of his glory."

812
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:30,260
 May we live lives to the praise of his glory.

813
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:32,180
 Let's pray.

814
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:39,820
 Father in heaven, thank you for every spiritual blessing

815
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:44,140
 that's ours in the heavenly places in Christ.

816
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:50,460
 Thank you for doing what we could not do for ourselves.

817
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:53,140
 Thank you for sending Jesus to live the life

818
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:56,240
 that we couldn't live, who obeyed you perfectly,

819
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:59,460
 that through his life and obedience and righteousness,

820
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:02,540
 his suffering and death and burial and resurrection,

821
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:06,100
 through surrendering, through giving our lives to him,

822
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:08,580
 through trusting and relying upon him,

823
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:12,260
 we receive his gift of righteousness.

824
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:14,260
 We receive his gift of sonships

825
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:16,380
 so that we can be children of God,

826
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:20,260
 sons and daughters who can call you our Father.

827
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:25,300
 And I'm just reminded of Psalm 67,

828
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:30,060
 of why you've been gracious to us and why you've blessed us.

829
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:35,780
 Psalm 67 says, "May God be gracious to us and bless us

830
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:37,920
 "and make his face to shine upon us."

831
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,320
 Why?

832
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:42,920
 "So that your way may be known on earth,

833
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:45,880
 "your saving power among the nations."

834
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:50,240
 God, may that be true of every young adult

835
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:53,460
 in this room tonight and every Porch Live location.

836
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:57,220
 That we would take time to pause

837
00:40:57,220 --> 00:41:01,380
 and consider how blessed we are,

838
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:04,140
 and that we would not hoard your blessings,

839
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:06,700
 but we would know you have blessed us

840
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:08,580
 so that the nations might know

841
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:10,780
 how to find this blessing in Christ.

842
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:15,180
 I pray that you would stir in our hearts tonight

843
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:19,160
 to go to our neighbors and to go to the nations,

844
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:21,680
 that the nations might find their joy

845
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,800
 and blessing in Christ.

846
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:29,480
 So we ask that you would do that work.

847
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:32,440
 Thank you for your grace.

848
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,180
 Thank you for your blessing.

849
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:35,320
 Thank you for Christ.

850
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,280
 In his name we pray, amen.

851
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:47,280
