1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,960
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:03,380
 - What is joy, buddy?

3
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:04,220
 - I don't know.

4
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:05,380
 - It's a dream!

5
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:07,960
 (upbeat music)

6
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:27,080
 - All right, hey, Porsch, how we doing?

7
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,740
 We doing okay tonight?

8
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,640
 Great to see ya, welcome back.

9
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,060
 So glad to have you in the room.

10
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:34,660
 So great to have everybody tuning in online as well.

11
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:37,680
 We do not take it for granted that everybody here

12
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,480
 and everybody there, wherever it is you are,

13
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,720
 would be a part of what God is doing here on Tuesday night

14
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:47,320
 or whatever time of the week you might be listening to this.

15
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,080
 Special shout out to all of our Porsch Live locations.

16
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:52,640
 We love that we're united to what God is doing

17
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,480
 in multiple major cities across the United States.

18
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,280
 Particularly, special shout out to Porsch Live,

19
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,120
 Springfield, Indy, and Fresno.

20
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:05,720
 Well, I am not the most seasoned traveler.

21
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,000
 So several years ago, when Brooke and I got the opportunity

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,440
 to go to Italy, I knew that there were several things

23
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:14,200
 that I, and we, of course, wanted to do.

24
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,040
 I knew that I wanted to tour the Colosseum.

25
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,760
 I'd heard of it, and so this was my chance

26
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,040
 to actually experience it.

27
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,880
 I knew that I wanted to drive through the hills of Tuscany

28
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,520
 and take in all of its majesty.

29
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,880
 I really wanted to go and swim in the Blue Grotto.

30
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,060
 We didn't quite get to swim in it,

31
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:34,920
 but we did get to kind of paddle along through it,

32
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,760
 which was incredible.

33
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:39,000
 I wanted to wind our way down the Amalfi Coast

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,060
 and take in all of the scenery.

35
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,160
 I wanted to make sure that we could go

36
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,440
 and we could see the Sistine Chapel and behold its glory.

37
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:50,400
 Like I wanted to take in as much of Italy as I could,

38
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,240
 and yet one thing that did not make my bucket list

39
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,520
 for this Italian trip was an authentic cooking class

40
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,420
 that we somehow found ourselves in the middle of.

41
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:04,600
 No shade to cooking.

42
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,600
 I just admittedly prefer eating to cooking,

43
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,240
 and so whenever the opportunity came for us

44
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,880
 to slide into some family friend's reservation

45
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,600
 that they weren't able to make in Florence,

46
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,420
 you know, we decided, why not win in Rome,

47
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,480
 or Florence in this case?

48
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,420
 And so we went and we took this class.

49
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,120
 Now, this class was awesome, truly.

50
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,520
 Like I'm not a cook.

51
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,400
 I've been working on it here recently,

52
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,280
 and yet this thing was incredible.

53
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,840
 Like we were rolling the dough

54
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,400
 and we were making the ravioli, getting lost in the sauce,

55
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,480
 and yet the class was actually not the best part

56
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,400
 of the experience.

57
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,400
 It was the location of this class.

58
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,440
 You see, the class itself was not located

59
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,520
 in some professional kitchen or a boutique restaurant

60
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,360
 like you might expect.

61
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:50,520
 Instead, it was located in a medieval watchtower

62
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,880
 on the hillside of Florence.

63
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,280
 So just picture a castle,

64
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,920
 and you pretty much have the right idea.

65
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,120
 That's where this class was taking place.

66
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,040
 And so once we finished our cooking,

67
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,320
 part of the experience was we got

68
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,400
 to actually tour the property.

69
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,140
 And so we finished up all of our cooking.

70
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:11,120
 We also concluded the eating,

71
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,480
 and as we made our way to the rooftop of the watchtower,

72
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,520
 bellies full, the sun going down,

73
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:19,580
 taking in the landscape around,

74
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:22,080
 the Arno River cutting through the city,

75
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,400
 Florence glistening in the distance.

76
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,000
 I noticed for the first time since we had arrived,

77
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,680
 because we were finally at a vantage point high enough

78
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,560
 that I could take it all in,

79
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,520
 that we were one of many other watchtowers

80
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,800
 littered across the landscape.

81
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:39,320
 And so I naturally look at our cooking instructor,

82
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,800
 and I asked her, "What's with all the watchtowers?"

83
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,960
 And she said, "Well, it's funny you should ask.

84
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,720
 "In Florence, there are watchtowers all over,

85
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,440
 "both within the city and outside of the city,

86
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,980
 "because these watchtowers exist to protect Florence

87
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,640
 "whenever enemies would invade the area.

88
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,720
 "They work like a defense system.

89
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,100
 "If one tower ever lit their fire,

90
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:05,700
 "it would serve as a notice to the surrounding towers

91
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,660
 "that danger had come."

92
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:11,140
 Similar to what you might have seen in Lord of the Rings,

93
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,940
 or in Mulan.

94
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,700
 This is what would happen in Florence.

95
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,040
 They would light a fire to announce

96
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,300
 to the surrounding area that danger was here,

97
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:23,900
 that the region was under attack, that help was needed.

98
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,380
 Now, why do I tell you that?

99
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,340
 Because in a similar way,

100
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,700
 our conscience works like this too.

101
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:31,260
 You see, whenever something goes wrong,

102
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:36,100
 or danger begins to arise,

103
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,180
 or you find that you need to be on guard,

104
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:40,140
 your conscience begins to trigger.

105
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,260
 And when you look at the data,

106
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,260
 and you consider the studies,

107
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:45,060
 when you look at some of the studies on young adults

108
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:45,980
 in the last few years,

109
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:48,760
 there is an entire generation of conscience,

110
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,460
 all signaling the same fire,

111
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:55,980
 that we are in danger, that you are under attack.

112
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:58,380
 You see, there is an enemy,

113
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:02,340
 one that has decided to darken your door,

114
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:05,620
 pillage your life, and plunder your pleasure.

115
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,520
 What do they want?

116
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:10,120
 The enemy, he wants your joy.

117
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:13,420
 Your joy is under attack.

118
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,380
 And tonight, what I wanna do is,

119
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:17,340
 I actually wanna teach you how to fight back.

120
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,180
 So if you have a Bible,

121
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:21,660
 you can open it and turn with me to Psalm chapter 32.

122
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:22,860
 Psalm chapter 32.

123
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:27,380
 While you turn there, we've been in a series called Joy.

124
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:29,700
 And the reason that we've been working through this series,

125
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:32,180
 is because I genuinely believe there is more life

126
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:35,900
 on the table than many of us are actually living.

127
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,300
 I've become increasingly convinced,

128
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,880
 as I've studied through this topic,

129
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,420
 that there might not be a more important paradigm shift

130
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:45,380
 for our generation than this idea

131
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:47,660
 that God is the source of all happiness,

132
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:51,180
 and all the joy that you want is in fact found in him.

133
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,800
 And that's not just a nice religious platitude

134
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,520
 for me to preach on a stage like this.

135
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:00,520
 It's actually something to be found and experienced.

136
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,820
 You see, I won't bore you with the research,

137
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,180
 and yet what we know is that in simplest terms,

138
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:07,860
 our generation is experiencing a joy crisis.

139
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:12,140
 We are experiencing historic levels of joylessness,

140
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:14,020
 the likes of which we've not seen,

141
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:16,580
 and yet we don't have to actually experience.

142
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,140
 Like scientists generally agree

143
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:20,160
 that while 10% of your happiness

144
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,020
 is circumstantially dependent,

145
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:25,220
 and somewhere around 40% is dependent

146
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,100
 upon your genetic makeup,

147
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:30,060
 50% of your happiness in life

148
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:33,020
 is the product of the decisions you make.

149
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:36,100
 How you choose to think, how you choose to act,

150
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:39,020
 and how you choose to react.

151
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:42,960
 Which means that, yes, 50% of your joy is on God.

152
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,140
 Like he has to be entrusted with over half of the joy

153
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,780
 and happiness you experience in life.

154
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:51,200
 And just side note, he's not going to let you down.

155
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,020
 The other 50% is on you.

156
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,580
 Like you actually have some agency,

157
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:59,980
 some control over the joy you experience in life.

158
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,660
 And that's an empowering reality.

159
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,620
 Like that's something that you probably

160
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:04,860
 should want to know tonight.

161
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:07,500
 That man, you actually do have a thumb

162
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,420
 on the trigger of the happiness

163
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,980
 you do in fact find in life.

164
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:14,320
 You see, so much of your happiness

165
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,740
 is not simply subject to circumstance,

166
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:20,580
 nor is it a victim to your genetics or personality makeup.

167
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:23,300
 It is the product of your decision making.

168
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:26,740
 You actually have some control.

169
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:29,180
 Which is why we talked a few weeks ago

170
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:31,620
 about how you can find joy.

171
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,860
 If you remember, and I'll resist the temptation

172
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,660
 to re-preach that message right now.

173
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:38,980
 You can find joy by way of three different steps.

174
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:41,860
 You pursue innocence, you walk in obedience,

175
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,740
 and you make a discipline out of celebration.

176
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:45,900
 This is how you do it.

177
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,580
 And yet what we know is that while we should

178
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,640
 make good decisions, we often instead

179
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,100
 find ourselves making not so good decisions.

180
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:56,340
 Decisions instead that are slightly lackluster

181
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,000
 and leave something to be desired.

182
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,700
 You see, although we know that we should pursue innocence,

183
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:04,500
 sometimes we do things that are corrupt.

184
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,500
 Instead of walking in obedience,

185
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:11,020
 occasionally, occasionally, we behave in disobedience.

186
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:14,260
 And when we should be making a discipline of celebration,

187
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:18,180
 sometimes we slide into making a discipline of debauchery.

188
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:21,260
 Put most biblically, we sin.

189
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:25,640
 And it's not just because we wanna be bad people

190
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,820
 and we delight in wrongdoing.

191
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,500
 That's not why you sin.

192
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,720
 You don't sin because you just wanna be

193
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,400
 the most evil version of yourself you can be.

194
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,820
 No one's doing that.

195
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:38,100
 Why then do we sin?

196
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,660
 Think about it for yourself.

197
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:42,300
 The answer may surprise you.

198
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:46,760
 You sin because you are seeking happiness.

199
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,140
 That's what you're looking for.

200
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:51,300
 Like when we talk about coping, what are you doing?

201
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,300
 You're trying to make the best

202
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,500
 of a less than ideal circumstance.

203
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,540
 Like why do you drink too much?

204
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:02,480
 Because you wanna have fun with your friends.

205
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,900
 Why do you stress out at work?

206
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,300
 Because you wanna do good at your job.

207
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,240
 Why do you cut yourself?

208
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,160
 Because you just wanna relieve some pressure.

209
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,860
 Why do you obsess over social media?

210
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:15,100
 Because it feels good to be approved of.

211
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,180
 Why do you masturbate?

212
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:19,780
 Because it releases dopamine, that happy hormone.

213
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,860
 Why do you talk about other people?

214
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,740
 Because it feels good to be on the inside of something.

215
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:27,180
 Don't you see the irony?

216
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:31,700
 We want something good, but we do something bad.

217
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:36,700
 We love the right things just in all the wrong ways.

218
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:41,420
 And the consequence is rather than finding joy, we lose it.

219
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:44,620
 Sure, sin can make you happy,

220
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:47,900
 but it will not leave you happy.

221
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:51,380
 Sin can make you happy, but it will not leave you happy.

222
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:54,860
 Instead, it only leaves you to be tempted again and again,

223
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:55,900
 that this time will be different.

224
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:58,600
 And yet what happens, that time is never different.

225
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,020
 It's the same as the last time.

226
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,100
 And the time before that, and the time before that,

227
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,740
 it always over promises and it consistently under delivers.

228
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:08,660
 We indulge our cravings, we gratify our insecurities,

229
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,140
 we oblige our carnal nature

230
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,500
 in the misguided pursuit of happiness

231
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,980
 in some place that it is impossible to find.

232
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:17,300
 I love the way that Randy Alcorn says it.

233
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,740
 Randy is an author, as well as a professor

234
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:22,100
 of a class called Happiness 101 at Western Seminary.

235
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:25,020
 He says this, he says, "These two premises,

236
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,760
 "that God is the source of all happiness,

237
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,380
 "and that sin separates us from God,

238
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,980
 "leads to this conclusion."

239
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:30,820
 Are you ready?

240
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:33,780
 Sin separates us from happiness.

241
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:37,220
 Meaning, if you want to fight for joy,

242
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,420
 then you have to learn to fight against sin.

243
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:43,240
 And as I even say that,

244
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,740
 some of you have been raised in the church,

245
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,820
 and you know exactly where this is going.

246
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,780
 You might even be familiar with Psalm 32,

247
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:50,820
 and you're like, you know what?

248
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,700
 I get it, brother.

249
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,700
 Like, you just want me to confess my sins

250
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,780
 that I might be forgiven.

251
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:58,660
 Yes, that's exactly what I want for you.

252
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:01,100
 And yet, what I'm trying to help you understand tonight

253
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:04,140
 is that confession is not just leading you to a place

254
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,360
 where you're doing the right things,

255
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,700
 it's actually walking you back in the path of pleasure

256
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,060
 that you want so badly for yourself.

257
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:13,060
 Like, that's what's on the table tonight.

258
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,540
 When you sin, perhaps,

259
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,180
 it's not just that you're doing a bad thing.

260
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:20,900
 Maybe, in fact, it's indicative that you're a sad person.

261
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:24,500
 Have you ever thought about it like that?

262
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,500
 That you're wanting for happiness,

263
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,060
 and yet you're looking in all the wrong places.

264
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:33,240
 And so God, in his kindness, through his scripture,

265
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,100
 is going to tell us, hey,

266
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:38,120
 there is a way to find the kind of joy you want.

267
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,580
 So let's look at it together.

268
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:44,180
 We're gonna see here in Psalm 32

269
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:48,260
 that David is going to teach us the path to pleasure.

270
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:52,060
 He's going to reveal to us the sadness of sin.

271
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,500
 And he's a really good teacher for it,

272
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,780
 because David, though a man after God's own heart,

273
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,860
 did some pretty bad things,

274
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:01,700
 one of which was he slept with Bathsheba.

275
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:04,060
 Like, he grabbed one of his buddy's wives

276
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,140
 that slept with her, got her pregnant,

277
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,780
 and had that guy killed.

278
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:10,820
 And what we know is that he confesses all of that sin

279
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,380
 in Psalm chapter 51.

280
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:15,620
 Psalm chapter 32 is proposed

281
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:18,260
 as being the response to Psalm 51.

282
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:20,300
 It's the relief he feels

283
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,860
 from having confessed those things to God.

284
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,900
 And so here's what it says as we get into it.

285
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,220
 He says this, starting in verse one,

286
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:30,220
 "Blessed or happy is the one

287
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:33,180
 "whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered.

288
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,160
 "Blessed or happy is the man against whom

289
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,900
 "the Lord counts no iniquity,

290
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:40,140
 "and whose spirit there is no deceit."

291
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:42,740
 You see, David makes it very clear

292
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:46,460
 that honest sinners have the happiest hearts.

293
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:49,340
 Honest sinners have the happiest hearts.

294
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,580
 Contrary to popular belief,

295
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:52,840
 it's not perfect people with perfect lives,

296
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,420
 and perfect homes, with perfect jobs,

297
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,080
 and perfect relationships, and perfect families

298
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,600
 that live the perfect life and have the happiest outcomes.

299
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,440
 That's not the case.

300
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,060
 You know who has the happiest outcomes?

301
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,920
 It is imperfect people that are acquainted

302
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,820
 with a perfect God that ultimately find

303
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,820
 the greatest happiness in life.

304
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:08,660
 But why?

305
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:09,480
 Why is that?

306
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,140
 Because when, not if, but when we fail,

307
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:15,580
 when our imperfections rise to the surface

308
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,380
 and our failures pile up

309
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,540
 and our mistakes are littered all around,

310
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:21,460
 it's then and it's there

311
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,560
 that God's forgiveness is found.

312
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,840
 Now, how does forgiveness impact your happiness?

313
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,400
 Let's just talk about that for a minute.

314
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,200
 Why would forgiveness ultimately matter

315
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,680
 and be consequential in the pursuit of your happiness?

316
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,000
 Well, if you think about it,

317
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,880
 forgiveness is about so much more than releasing resentment.

318
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,100
 Yes, it is about that.

319
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:45,340
 There is a lot of power in you offering forgiveness

320
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:47,600
 where you're taking back control,

321
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,400
 where you're releasing resentment

322
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,440
 and you're regaining authority.

323
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,260
 That is 100% true,

324
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:56,360
 but it's more than just releasing resentment.

325
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,360
 It's restoring relationship.

326
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,200
 That's the heart of forgiveness.

327
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,260
 And without a relationship to God,

328
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,600
 who is, as we've described,

329
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,120
 and I tell you again tonight,

330
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,800
 the universal source of all happiness,

331
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,560
 without a relationship to him,

332
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:17,960
 the richest kind of joy,

333
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:22,600
 the realist form of happiness is impossible.

334
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,360
 Now, you might hear that and think,

335
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,320
 "Kylin, I don't need God to be happy in life."

336
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,200
 You would be right.

337
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:36,800
 Didn't think I was gonna say that, did you?

338
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,680
 You would be correct.

339
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,880
 You do not need God to be happy.

340
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,800
 You see, it's interesting, Dr. David Murray,

341
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,340
 he defined six different kinds of happiness

342
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:48,920
 that are available to all people everywhere.

343
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,720
 Like regardless of background,

344
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,280
 regardless of history,

345
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,920
 no matter where you come from,

346
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,240
 there are six kinds of happiness

347
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,120
 which are fully available to you right now,

348
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,640
 regardless of where you are

349
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,000
 on the spectrum of spirituality.

350
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,820
 Here's what they are.

351
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,520
 The first one is nature happiness,

352
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,660
 joy that's derived from creation.

353
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:06,900
 You know that feeling.

354
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,220
 Why do you like to be outside so much?

355
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:10,920
 Because it feels good to,

356
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,180
 especially in the season we're in right now,

357
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,440
 to be outside when the weather is nice

358
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,320
 and go for a walk and hear the birds chirping

359
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,560
 and flying in twos.

360
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:23,160
 And nature produces some joy.

361
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,800
 The second is social happiness.

362
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,340
 Like that's joy from being with friends and family.

363
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:30,640
 How many of you, when filling out your bio,

364
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,240
 put something along the lines of,

365
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,480
 "What are your hobbies or interests?

366
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:37,260
 "Hanging out with friends, spending time with family."

367
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,760
 There's good reason for it

368
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:42,280
 because it actually does produce happiness.

369
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,920
 The third is vocational happiness.

370
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,440
 Ever heard of job satisfaction?

371
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,800
 Oh man, maybe not.

372
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,400
 But there is such a thing as joy in your work.

373
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,680
 It's worthy of searching after and ultimately finding.

374
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,840
 Number four is physical happiness.

375
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,300
 Now I know that happy doesn't necessarily describe

376
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,440
 many of your gym going experiences,

377
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:04,780
 and yet there is joy in being healthy, fit, and strong.

378
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:06,980
 The fifth is intellectual happiness.

379
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:08,800
 The joy that comes from understanding something,

380
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,280
 like putting the pieces together, right?

381
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,240
 The light bulb going off.

382
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:16,640
 I remember as a young boy, I loved brain teasers

383
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,560
 because I loved whenever I would figure them out.

384
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,800
 It was like the greatest rush of excitement.

385
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,520
 Like I knew something nobody else did.

386
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,000
 It was so great.

387
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,980
 That is intellectual happiness.

388
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:29,480
 The sixth is humor happiness, which feels really obvious.

389
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,500
 It's the joy of laughing.

390
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,460
 But really, according to the science,

391
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,320
 laughter is the best medicine.

392
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,600
 Like it boosts mood and it strengthens your immune system

393
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,840
 and it diminishes pain and it protects you from stress.

394
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,160
 And contrary to popular belief,

395
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,080
 you don't have to get laughed at someone else's expense

396
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:44,920
 in order to feel happy,

397
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,020
 but that's another sermon for another day.

398
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:52,020
 These six joys can be experienced by all people everywhere.

399
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:54,920
 Christians, non-Christians alike.

400
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,520
 And here's the thing that's amazing about it.

401
00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:01,520
 How incredible is God that he would make this much happiness

402
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:06,840
 and this many different kinds of happinesses

403
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:09,780
 so that way we could experience great joy in life.

404
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:10,980
 That's awesome.

405
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,320
 What a kind God.

406
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,040
 What a good God.

407
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:18,080
 And yet, there is a seventh kind of happiness.

408
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,120
 Wouldn't you know it?

409
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:24,800
 And that happiness is known as spiritual happiness.

410
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:30,120
 This is the joy of being in relationship to God.

411
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:33,600
 Dr. Murray describes it as containing more pleasure

412
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,340
 and delight than the other six combined at times.

413
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:44,340
 Meaning sure, you can be a happy version of yourself

414
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:50,080
 without God, but you cannot be the happiest version

415
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,180
 of yourself without God.

416
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:59,600
 He is the only one who offers infinite delight,

417
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:06,160
 eternal satisfaction, everlasting joy.

418
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:11,100
 It's found in Jesus and you have to find it

419
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,180
 by way of relationship with him,

420
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:16,800
 which is only possible through forgiveness of sin.

421
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,060
 Why?

422
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:21,940
 Because there is a rift in the relationship

423
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:23,900
 between you and God.

424
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,240
 It is the product of your sin.

425
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:31,240
 You have sinned against a holy, just, good,

426
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,780
 beautiful, true God.

427
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,760
 And yet in his kindness, by way of his son,

428
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,820
 should you believe in him for the forgiveness of your sins,

429
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,900
 you can be reunited.

430
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:46,040
 The rift can be repaired.

431
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:50,840
 Relationship can be restored and joy can be found.

432
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,400
 That's why forgiveness matters.

433
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,600
 That's how it impacts your happiness.

434
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,040
 And that's what David says.

435
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:00,080
 He says, "Happy is the one whose sin is forgiven."

436
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,320
 But he doesn't just say that.

437
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,160
 He could have.

438
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,480
 He could have been like, "Happy are you.

439
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,480
 Blessed are you if you're forgiven."

440
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,320
 Good night, everybody.

441
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,140
 But he doesn't do it.

442
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,360
 He goes on to verbally flourish

443
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,840
 over the course of this couple of verses.

444
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,680
 How does he say it?

445
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,200
 He says, "Blessed or happy is the one

446
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,880
 whose transgression is forgiven,

447
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,320
 whose sin is covered,

448
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,860
 in whom the Lord counts no iniquity."

449
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,440
 Why?

450
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,300
 Why would you overcomplicate this?

451
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:26,560
 Why all the aspirational speaking, David?

452
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,880
 Just say what you mean, man.

453
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,520
 Preach it plain for me, would ya?

454
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,000
 He does it very purposefully.

455
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,880
 You see, it's interesting.

456
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:41,300
 Sin is so radically evil

457
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,720
 that there are actually 15 different words

458
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,860
 in the Hebrew for it.

459
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:49,160
 And yet David picks three.

460
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:52,060
 And he picks them very purposefully in this moment.

461
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:55,640
 He picks the words transgression, sin, and iniquity.

462
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,160
 It's a very strategic selection

463
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,980
 because out of all the 15 words he picks,

464
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:03,980
 these three describe the most all-encompassing form of sin.

465
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:07,140
 You see, transgression is an attack against God.

466
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,820
 Sin is an attack against yourself.

467
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:14,240
 And iniquity is an attack against morality or goodness.

468
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,120
 David covers the widest range of wrongdoing possible

469
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,100
 by using these three words.

470
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,620
 But he doesn't stop there.

471
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:24,140
 Like, he not only chooses three words to describe sin,

472
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,940
 he chooses three words to describe forgiveness.

473
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:30,020
 Forgiven, covered, and cleared.

474
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:33,660
 Or doesn't count, right?

475
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:36,180
 In whom the Lord counts no iniquity.

476
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:37,820
 Which are all encompassing themselves.

477
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:40,700
 Like, to be forgiven is to have the weight of shame

478
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,260
 on your life lifted.

479
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,460
 You know what that feels like

480
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,780
 when you've done something wrong

481
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,980
 and it just feels like everywhere you go,

482
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:50,040
 there's just a looming cloud over your head.

483
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,020
 Misery is your company.

484
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,820
 You can't seem to shake the fact

485
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:58,620
 that you feel perpetually sad, weighed down.

486
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,460
 That gravity is a little bit heavier

487
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,420
 wherever it is you stand.

488
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,660
 That's what he's unpacking.

489
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:07,660
 When you're forgiven, that weight is lifted off.

490
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:10,100
 To be covered is to have it removed from sight,

491
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,140
 as if it never happened.

492
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,540
 Wouldn't you love that?

493
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:15,620
 That man, that thing you're so desperately trying to hide,

494
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:17,340
 keep away so nobody ever sees it,

495
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:20,860
 it's actually, when covered by God,

496
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:23,580
 removed as if it never even existed.

497
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:27,140
 And to be cleared is to have the debt paid in full.

498
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:28,900
 What does all of that mean?

499
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:32,740
 It means very simply, the totality of your sin

500
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:37,060
 receives the totality of God's forgiveness.

501
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:40,180
 The totality of your sin

502
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:42,740
 receives the totality of God's forgiveness,

503
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:46,420
 which is a wild idea when the totality of our sin

504
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:49,540
 actually deserves the totality of God's wrath.

505
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:50,820
 But that's not what he does,

506
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:53,740
 for in Christ Jesus, forgiveness is available,

507
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,220
 not just for some of your sin,

508
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,740
 not just for those things over there,

509
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:58,780
 not just when you were a semi-good person.

510
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:02,700
 No, it is available for the totality of your sin.

511
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:05,660
 Everything you've done, every sin you've made,

512
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:08,580
 every ill word you've spoken, every hurt you've ever caused,

513
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,580
 he heals all of it

514
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:14,420
 because he offers forgiveness without discretion.

515
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:17,980
 He can forgive any sin, any time from any person.

516
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:21,260
 And the amazing news is it keeps us near him.

517
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:22,220
 Like, that's the thing.

518
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:25,020
 It's not just, you know what, you did wrong,

519
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:25,920
 now you're better.

520
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:30,620
 No, it's you did wrong, and now we're together.

521
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:32,620
 We're together again.

522
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:36,980
 You were separate from me in a land of loneliness,

523
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:39,420
 completely divorced from delight,

524
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:41,220
 and now, because of my forgiveness,

525
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:44,340
 you're brought close again, and we are united,

526
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:48,480
 not just in loving relationship, but joyful union.

527
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,220
 That's what's available to you by way of Christ.

528
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:56,220
 But, and there's always a but, there's a condition.

529
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:58,720
 What's the condition?

530
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,800
 We must have a spirit without deceit,

531
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:06,100
 meaning we have to be honest and truthful

532
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:10,380
 and genuine and sincere and transparent about our sin

533
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:13,780
 as we live our life and we walk with God.

534
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:16,500
 So put in the most simple of terms,

535
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,100
 we have to stop being fake,

536
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:25,020
 justifying sin because it feels good,

537
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,020
 and you just need a release.

538
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:27,500
 Man, you don't know what I've been through.

539
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,720
 Like, I just, I need this.

540
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,980
 It'll be okay this time.

541
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,180
 Like, I've been through the ringer.

542
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:35,000
 This thing's gonna give me the kind of relief I need.

543
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,780
 You try to justify it, and yet you are living with deceit,

544
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:40,620
 putting up a front because you don't want others

545
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:41,980
 to actually find you out.

546
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,700
 Because if they knew, Kylan, what I did,

547
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,820
 if they actually, if they knew the things that I said,

548
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:48,420
 the places I've been, the acts that I've caused,

549
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:50,300
 they would not accept me.

550
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,580
 They would reject me.

551
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:53,420
 And so what you do is you put up a front

552
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:55,660
 which is spiritually deceitful,

553
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:59,020
 scrolling through reels, because, Kylan, that's not porn.

554
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,020
 Like, they're just reels.

555
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:02,880
 Like, sure, yeah, she could wear more clothes,

556
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,060
 but I've seen way worse.

557
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,440
 You know, actually, this is progress

558
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,980
 from where I've been in the past.

559
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,340
 This used to be a huge problem for me.

560
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,740
 This is a step in the right direction,

561
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,380
 not in the wrong direction.

562
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:14,940
 That is spiritually deceitful,

563
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:15,940
 flirting with him just because

564
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:18,180
 he gets your emotional needs met.

565
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:20,020
 You know what, I'll scratch his back, he can scratch mine.

566
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:21,300
 Like, I'll text him occasionally,

567
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,300
 and he wants to hear from me, and you know what,

568
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:25,540
 like, I actually like to feel wanted, needed,

569
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:29,020
 desired by someone speaking a certain way

570
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:30,180
 just because we know that person

571
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:31,860
 or those people will approve of it.

572
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,420
 Yeah, you know what, when I'm in a religious context,

573
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:34,720
 I'm gonna speak religiously.

574
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,900
 Whenever I'm in my workplace, I'm gonna speak

575
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:39,180
 in a way that approves, or gains the approval

576
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,980
 of all of my coworkers.

577
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,700
 When I'm hanging out with my friends on a Friday night,

578
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,900
 I'm gonna make sure to talk in a way, act in a way,

579
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:48,780
 live in a way where they all approve of me instead.

580
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:50,820
 But here's the thing.

581
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:56,700
 There is no pulling the wool over God's eyes on any of it.

582
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,980
 There's no sleight of hand where it's,

583
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,980
 I'm doing good things over here, God.

584
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:03,240
 Look at this, be distracted,

585
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,820
 while I do bad over here instead.

586
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:07,980
 He sees it all.

587
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:10,060
 God and sin are like oil and water.

588
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:14,660
 They do not mix, meaning you cannot have life in God

589
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:17,980
 and life in sin simultaneously.

590
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:21,020
 You can't do it, which is why David goes on

591
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,820
 and he says in verses three through four,

592
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:26,540
 he says, "For when I kept silent,

593
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:30,140
 my bones wasted away through my groaning all day long.

594
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:32,220
 For day and night, your hand was heavy upon me.

595
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:36,700
 My strength was dried up as by the heat of summer."

596
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:39,720
 Like when David tried to hide his sin, what was the result?

597
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:43,380
 Well, the report's in, it's joylessness.

598
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:46,940
 Like God in his kindness does to David

599
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:48,060
 what he will do to you.

600
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:50,580
 He will zap your zeal, he will steal your strength

601
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:53,260
 because he knows that your secret sin

602
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,800
 is going to lead to lost joy.

603
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,980
 The second point.

604
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:03,360
 He knows secret sin leads to lost joy.

605
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:07,100
 Like God so kindly wants us to come back to himself,

606
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,260
 like into the presence of pleasure.

607
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:10,940
 He is the happiness of heaven.

608
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:13,000
 He is the source of all satisfaction.

609
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,940
 The glory of his gladness is available

610
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,080
 when we are close to him.

611
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:20,380
 And yet when we sin, we remove ourself from his presence

612
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:22,820
 and all that it promises.

613
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,000
 He's saying, "No, no, no, no, no.

614
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,060
 I want you here next to me."

615
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:28,860
 And yet when we do things that lead us away from him,

616
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:30,220
 he will prompt us back.

617
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,420
 He will command us back.

618
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:32,980
 He will tell us to come back.

619
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:36,420
 But here's the thing, he will never force us to come back.

620
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:37,380
 That would not be loving.

621
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:41,220
 God does not force your hand and cause you to return.

622
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:42,660
 Like he doesn't just forgive our sins

623
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:44,820
 and clean our conscience and wipe our worries away

624
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:47,100
 whether you ask him or not.

625
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:47,940
 Why?

626
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,780
 Because God knows your response to sin

627
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:55,220
 proves what matters most to you in life.

628
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:58,620
 Your response to sin will prove to you

629
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:01,220
 what matters most in life.

630
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,140
 What's God's response to sin?

631
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:05,420
 Forgiveness.

632
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:06,260
 Why?

633
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:08,620
 Because you matter most to him.

634
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:11,780
 Like his response to every error

635
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:15,420
 and any egregious decision you make against him

636
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:19,380
 is he lavishes forgiveness because he wants you most.

637
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:22,680
 What about our response to sin?

638
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:25,900
 At times it's like David.

639
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:29,420
 It's not confession, it's concealment.

640
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:31,060
 It's secrecy.

641
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:35,540
 Because what we want is this and not him.

642
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:41,540
 That's why David kept silent.

643
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:46,100
 Which is very different than David was silent.

644
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,900
 One is passive, the other active.

645
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:51,660
 The word here for kept silent,

646
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:54,860
 it actually carries the picture of engraving something.

647
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:58,780
 Like you would engrave your initials into a piece of wood.

648
00:27:58,780 --> 00:27:59,700
 How do you do that?

649
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,880
 By way of persistence and effort.

650
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,640
 When I went to Texas A&M there was a tradition

651
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,800
 where you would go and you would carve your name

652
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,820
 into the wooden tables of a local restaurant

653
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,700
 called the Dixie Chicken.

654
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,120
 And so being a senior in school,

655
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,200
 I wanted to go and participate in this tradition.

656
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,720
 Yet I did not have a knife with me.

657
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,700
 I had a paper clip.

658
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:21,000
 So how did I get it done?

659
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,440
 With persistence and effort, baby.

660
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,560
 You know, like I went to work to make sure

661
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:28,880
 that my mark was left on the wood at the Dixie Chicken.

662
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,840
 That's what David is doing here with his sin.

663
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,800
 He is persisting in his silence.

664
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:37,160
 He is making every effort to keep his sin hidden.

665
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,320
 And some of you know exactly what this feels like

666
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,780
 because you're living it right now.

667
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:43,600
 You know what you did today or yesterday

668
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,280
 or last week or the week before.

669
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:48,800
 You know that you're making every effort under the sun

670
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,780
 to cover your tracks, to wipe your browser history,

671
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:53,720
 to rationalize the fact that I was just processing

672
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,720
 with a friend, Kylan.

673
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,200
 I needed someone to really work through the details

674
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,640
 of what happened with that person.

675
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,280
 You're justifying him staying over

676
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,320
 because it's just cheaper for us to stay in one room

677
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,920
 as opposed to paying for two rooms.

678
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,400
 You're telling half truths to get by the whole truth

679
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,340
 because if I told the whole truth,

680
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:09,360
 they really wouldn't like what they heard.

681
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:14,140
 David didn't want anyone to know, and neither do we so often.

682
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:16,000
 We don't want God, we don't want family,

683
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,040
 we don't want friends, we don't want our colleagues.

684
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:22,760
 We don't want anyone to know what in fact we've done

685
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,000
 that we should not have done.

686
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 But here's the thing, when we start doing this,

687
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:34,160
 we start managing sin, and we start managing decline.

688
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:37,520
 When you start managing your sin,

689
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,280
 you start managing decline, the decline of your joy,

690
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,280
 the decline of your satisfaction,

691
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,600
 the decline of your peace, the trust you have

692
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,540
 with other people, the kind of energy

693
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:47,740
 that you have available to give to people

694
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:51,940
 and places in life because sin is consequential.

695
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:56,080
 David, he says that right here.

696
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,840
 David says, "My bones wasted away."

697
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,000
 That sounds pretty bad.

698
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 You see, that's a physical effect.

699
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,760
 Like the stress of concealing his sin was so toxic

700
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:11,120
 that it led him to feel like, man, my bones are withering.

701
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,060
 Whatever I've done, it's eating me from the inside out.

702
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:18,480
 It's produced sleepless days and sick nights.

703
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,940
 Like through my groaning all day long,

704
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:21,760
 that's a mental effect.

705
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,280
 Like he's in emotional upheaval.

706
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,320
 All day is misery and sin for David.

707
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,480
 He is what many of you can relate to.

708
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,080
 He is anxious and insecure, and he is despairing,

709
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,640
 distraught, and paranoid that people will find out.

710
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,280
 Your hand was heavy upon me.

711
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,360
 My strength was dried up.

712
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,040
 That's a spiritual effect.

713
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,040
 He's in a spiritual drought.

714
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,300
 Do you feel that?

715
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,800
 Like, man, I just can't seem to find water.

716
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,440
 Brother, the living water is right here.

717
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,280
 Maybe you just need a drink of it.

718
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,720
 Maybe you're not actually in a drought.

719
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:54,880
 You're just choosing sin.

720
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,000
 His vitality was gone.

721
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,240
 His strength was zeroed.

722
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,220
 His energy was exhausted.

723
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:06,220
 You see, when we conceal our sin, we erode our soul.

724
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:10,460
 So why do we do it then?

725
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:17,900
 Because we think, if they knew what I did,

726
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:22,140
 my reputation would be finished.

727
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:25,560
 God, if they knew what I did,

728
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,100
 they would never wanna keep me around.

729
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:29,720
 God, if they knew what I did,

730
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,960
 then everything I've worked so hard to earn,

731
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,160
 it would be forfeited.

732
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,840
 Like, if they knew what I did,

733
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,300
 then I'm not even sure life would be worth living,

734
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:42,360
 and yet here's the thing nobody may know right now,

735
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:46,660
 and yet life isn't worth living anyways.

736
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:51,660
 You see, so often, we focus on the sin we did

737
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,580
 and making sure it never gets out,

738
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,640
 rather than focusing on what that sin is doing to us

739
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:02,620
 in the way it's eating us from the inside out.

740
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,760
 David is looking at you, he's saying,

741
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:07,760
 "Hey, I'm not so concerned about what you did,

742
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,000
 "but what it's doing to you,

743
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,740
 "because so long as you keep it locked up inside,

744
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:14,520
 "pushed down into the depths of who you are,

745
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:18,960
 "it will rot you away."

746
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,320
 We have to stop hiding.

747
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:24,280
 We have to start confessing because our joy is at stake.

748
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:30,240
 I love the way that Saint Augustine said this.

749
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,880
 He said that the beginning of knowledge

750
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,420
 is to know oneself to be a sinner.

751
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:39,720
 The beginning of knowledge

752
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:42,400
 is to know oneself to be a sinner.

753
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,080
 You see, so many people fear that confession,

754
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:47,200
 that'll be the end of everything for me,

755
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,520
 but according to Augustine,

756
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:51,440
 it's only the beginning of everything for you,

757
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,000
 because the freest person in the room

758
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,720
 is the person that has nothing to hide.

759
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,040
 It's the person that walks into a space like this

760
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:01,400
 and isn't trying to manage facts or control the narrative

761
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:05,240
 or monitor people's perceptions.

762
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:09,580
 It's when we're honest with ourself, with God, with others,

763
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:13,040
 that life and truth and joy and happiness and satisfaction

764
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:17,400
 actually come racing into the recesses of our soul

765
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,760
 for when we admit that we're a sinner,

766
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,960
 there awaits a Savior, Christ,

767
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,680
 He who is happiness Himself

768
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:28,000
 and gives without discrimination

769
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,720
 to any who would seek Him,

770
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:33,080
 confess their sins, and receive the love He has to offer.

771
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:38,080
 First John 1:9 says, "If we confess our sins,

772
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:41,040
 "He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins

773
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:43,580
 "and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness,"

774
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:45,640
 which is exactly what David does next.

775
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,920
 Verse five, "I acknowledged my sin to you

776
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:54,600
 "and I did not cover up my iniquity.

777
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,900
 "I said, 'I'll confess my transgressions.

778
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:59,900
 "'I'll confess my transgressions to the Lord,

779
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:02,960
 "'and you forgave the iniquity of my sin.'"

780
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,080
 This is the longest verse in the entire Psalm

781
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,880
 because it's the center, the heartbeat

782
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,080
 of everything David wants you to understand,

783
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,680
 and it's summarized very simply in this,

784
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:14,520
 that confession is never easy, but it is always worth it.

785
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:18,160
 Confession is never easy, but it's always worth it.

786
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,000
 Why?

787
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,160
 Because it is the first step on the road to rejoicing again.

788
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:24,240
 That's what confession is.

789
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:26,480
 It's the first step on the road to rejoicing.

790
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,120
 It puts us on the path of repentance.

791
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,120
 And how many of you are so disenchanted

792
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,600
 with the idea of repentance,

793
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,400
 that man, you just want me to return to where I was?

794
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:40,560
 No, I want you to go where you were always meant to be,

795
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,480
 not back into a life where I guess Jesus is enough,

796
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:46,240
 but into a life where Jesus is better,

797
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,720
 where you move into an existence

798
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:50,560
 where you can stack up anything in comparison,

799
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,960
 and he outclasses them all

800
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,000
 because the satisfaction he gives

801
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,560
 is greater than that than the world.

802
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,680
 He is more satisfying.

803
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,720
 He is more gratifying.

804
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,840
 He is more energizing than anything

805
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,700
 this world could ever offer.

806
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:04,940
 So how do we do this?

807
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:07,700
 Very quickly, how do we actually move

808
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,080
 through a process of confession?

809
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,240
 Because it's not just a matter of,

810
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,720
 well, let me just tell you what I did.

811
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:12,920
 That would be wrong.

812
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,360
 David gives us three steps

813
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:18,080
 on how to actually confess well, a blueprint of sorts.

814
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:21,360
 He says, "I acknowledged my sin to you."

815
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,160
 Like David doesn't just keep the knowledge

816
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,120
 of his sins pent up inside.

817
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,640
 He doesn't bury them down deep.

818
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,000
 He doesn't try to conceal them from God.

819
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,560
 No, he openly admits them before God

820
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:34,840
 because sin must be acknowledged.

821
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,240
 That's the first thing.

822
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:40,240
 If you want to confess well and return to rejoicing,

823
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,080
 the way that you do it

824
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,120
 is you have to acknowledge your sin.

825
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:43,960
 That's one.

826
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:47,180
 Two, I did not cover my iniquity.

827
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:48,660
 David doesn't hide it.

828
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:50,420
 He doesn't veil it from view.

829
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:52,720
 No, he outs it and then he owns it.

830
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:56,040
 He says, "This is what it is, and it is in fact mine."

831
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:59,300
 You see, sin, secondly, must be exposed.

832
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:03,440
 It has to be acknowledged and then it has to be exposed.

833
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,240
 And then he says, "I will confess my transgressions."

834
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,480
 That word for confess,

835
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:10,160
 it carries the idea of casting something off,

836
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,200
 like throwing something down.

837
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,280
 He says, "I will confess my transgressions.

838
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,220
 "I will empty it all out.

839
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:17,960
 "I've been carrying this too long.

840
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,360
 "The weight is too heavy,

841
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,960
 "and the natural result is for me to just give it over

842
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:26,480
 "and lay it out flat because sin must be released."

843
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,840
 That's the third.

844
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,840
 Sin must be released.

845
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:29,800
 It has to be acknowledged.

846
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,680
 It has to be exposed.

847
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:33,120
 It has to be released.

848
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:35,360
 We have to acknowledge,

849
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,260
 "God, I've done something wrong."

850
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:40,220
 Like, "I've been hiding this from you, Lord.

851
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:42,420
 "I've been keeping this under wraps

852
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:45,060
 "because I know it's not good.

853
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:49,300
 "And I fear God what you'll say about it.

854
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:51,220
 "And yet, Lord, I know in your word,

855
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:54,660
 "by way of your son, I should acknowledge this is in me."

856
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:55,940
 You already know, God.

857
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:58,340
 Like, it's not the fact that this is unknown to you.

858
00:36:58,340 --> 00:36:59,300
 You know what I did.

859
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:02,420
 It's just that I don't want you to know what I did.

860
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:05,340
 But God, I acknowledge that.

861
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:08,060
 But God, I acknowledge it.

862
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:11,740
 And as he leans into you, you expose it.

863
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:14,460
 God, let me tell you what it was.

864
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:16,420
 Let me give you vivid detail.

865
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:18,100
 Let me confess, not generically,

866
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:22,300
 but very specifically what I did to you, God.

867
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:26,940
 Let me not use cagey language or generic terminology.

868
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,460
 Well, I was struggling.

869
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:29,700
 That doesn't work.

870
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:30,900
 Well, I was wrestling.

871
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,420
 That doesn't work either.

872
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:33,740
 Like, we have to move past

873
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:37,660
 broad blanket categorical ideas of lust and anger

874
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:39,180
 and control and pride.

875
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:41,980
 We've got to get specific.

876
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:44,060
 We've got to be willing to say what it is.

877
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:46,700
 Too often, we are processing the things

878
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,660
 we're confessing to God and to other peoples,

879
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:51,060
 and we're wondering, "How much should I say?"

880
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,060
 Why don't you ask a different question?

881
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:55,300
 How much can I say?

882
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:57,380
 Like, how much detail can I give?

883
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:58,980
 Like, let me tell you where I was.

884
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:00,740
 Let me tell you who I was looking for

885
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:01,660
 when I went to that place.

886
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:05,020
 Let me tell you what it was I searched into my browser.

887
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:07,500
 Let me tell you what I consumed and where I got it from.

888
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,860
 Let me tell you who I'm jealous of

889
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:10,340
 and what I'm jealous of about them.

890
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:11,220
 Let me make sure I give you

891
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:15,020
 as much specific clarity as possible,

892
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:17,660
 because what we know is that the more of this

893
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:19,460
 I can get out of my heart,

894
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:22,020
 the more of God I can get into it.

895
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:25,260
 How much of God do you want in?

896
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:28,940
 How much happiness do you want right now?

897
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:31,140
 Then get rid of the sadness.

898
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:35,860
 Like, remove the sin, that which breeds insecurity

899
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:37,820
 and paranoia and anxiety and stress

900
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:40,220
 and all those ill-rotten feelings.

901
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:44,380
 Get them out, and God will fill you up.

902
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:47,420
 That's the way this works.

903
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:50,580
 And then, like David, we have to throw it down.

904
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:53,660
 Before you can receive forgiveness from God,

905
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:56,540
 with two hands, you have got to empty those hands

906
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:59,380
 which are carrying these sins for far too long.

907
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:02,660
 Anybody hate taking multiple trips

908
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:04,300
 to the car to get your groceries?

909
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:08,660
 My men are like, "I'm vibing now.

910
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:10,320
 "I'm locked back in.

911
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,100
 "I know all about that."

912
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,540
 What do you do?

913
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:16,460
 You load up, you race inside,

914
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:19,700
 and then you throw them down because they're heavy,

915
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,660
 even though you don't want to admit it.

916
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:24,540
 You cast it off.

917
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:25,580
 You get rid of it.

918
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:27,820
 That's how we're supposed to approach our sin.

919
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:31,260
 Psalm 86 5 says, "For you, O Lord, are good,

920
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,360
 "and you're forgiving.

921
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,740
 "You're abounding in steadfast love

922
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:35,460
 "to all who call upon you.

923
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:38,120
 "Why then would we not confess?

924
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:42,160
 "For when we confess fully, we're forgiven freely."

925
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,260
 We're forgiven freely.

926
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:45,660
 Now, some of you hear that,

927
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:48,780
 and you think to yourself, like,

928
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:50,980
 "Kylin, it's too late for me, though.

929
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:53,600
 "You don't know what I've done.

930
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,660
 "You don't know where I've been."

931
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:57,420
 Sure, this is a good message for everybody else.

932
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:59,180
 I actually even believe that God might have a heart

933
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:00,680
 like this for all of these people,

934
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,680
 but that's not the heart that I think God

935
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,180
 would in fact have for me.

936
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:06,020
 Like, my list of sins is long.

937
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:08,260
 My past is littered with mistakes.

938
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:10,020
 My road is filled with regret.

939
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:10,860
 I've done some things,

940
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:13,860
 the likes of which I could never come back from.

941
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:16,780
 This may work for them, but it will never work for me.

942
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:19,340
 If that's you, then you need to know joy

943
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:22,460
 is never too far off,

944
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:24,980
 and it's never too late for you,

945
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:29,820
 because although your past may consist with sin,

946
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:32,580
 your future can be filled with joy.

947
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:34,980
 How do I know that?

948
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:37,320
 Well, science supports it.

949
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:40,080
 According to Jonathan Grant,

950
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:44,140
 neurologists have shown that while most brain development

951
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:45,780
 stops sometime in childhood,

952
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:47,540
 the brain's joy center,

953
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:49,860
 located and observable in the right orbital

954
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:51,460
 prefrontal cortex,

955
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:53,100
 is the only part of the brain

956
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:55,980
 that never loses its capacity to grow,

957
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:59,060
 which is fascinating.

958
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:02,020
 Like God has hardwired into you

959
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:03,500
 what's known as the emotional command center

960
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:04,600
 of your entire being,

961
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:08,880
 infinite levels of joy.

962
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:12,900
 You can have joy,

963
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:15,260
 which begs the question, then how do we get it?

964
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:18,580
 Well, this is where it gets really fascinating,

965
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:20,280
 and we part ways with the science,

966
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:23,340
 and we connect it to the scripture,

967
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:27,140
 because from a neurological perspective,

968
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:31,080
 joy is always relational.

969
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:34,300
 It's always relational,

970
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:36,980
 meaning it isn't found in what you have,

971
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:41,540
 what you do, where you go, how much you get.

972
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:43,740
 No, joy is found in who you know.

973
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:46,580
 Joy is found in who you know.

974
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:50,140
 I've noticed this with our newborn, Cash.

975
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:52,580
 I've taken it as my personal mission

976
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:54,680
 to make him the happiest boy in the world,

977
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:59,100
 and yet I have a minister's salary,

978
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:02,860
 and so that will not come by way of me spoiling him rotten

979
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:05,220
 with all manner of different things he can own,

980
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:07,460
 places I can take him,

981
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:11,100
 things he can do,

982
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:13,020
 how much he can have.

983
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:16,940
 Sure, I can give him more baby paper.

984
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:19,720
 I can even change his diaper.

985
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:24,260
 I can unwrap the latest whatever, that toy,

986
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:26,460
 which will stimulate him for a moment,

987
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,060
 but you know what gives him joy?

988
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:33,440
 Time with me and time with his mom.

989
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:38,940
 I've noticed his joy center fires

990
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:41,380
 when he sees me,

991
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:46,540
 when we connect,

992
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:48,140
 when we're together,

993
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:50,400
 when we relate to one another,

994
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,860
 when we enjoy each other's presence,

995
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:58,640
 and yet here's what I've also come to learn.

996
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:03,140
 If my goal is to make him the happiest boy in the world,

997
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:08,180
 then my presence, even my presence,

998
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:09,620
 will be insufficient for him

999
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:12,860
 because he needs a better father than I am,

1000
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:17,880
 and praise God that there is one.

1001
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:21,620
 There is a God that loves my boy

1002
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:23,300
 and loves you too,

1003
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:26,260
 and wants more than to lavish you

1004
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:29,180
 with all manner of material

1005
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:31,580
 that might produce something good in you,

1006
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:34,340
 some feeling or excitement.

1007
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:39,540
 He wants to give you the very best thing he has,

1008
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:40,780
 which is himself.

1009
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:42,580
 God is so loving

1010
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:45,700
 that should there be anything better than him,

1011
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:49,000
 I firmly believe he'd be like, "Go, get to it."

1012
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:54,140
 But because there is not, he says, "You come to me."

1013
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:56,360
 And it is through our relationship

1014
00:43:56,360 --> 00:44:00,400
 that all the joy you want and more can be found,

1015
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:04,240
 for it is in his presence

1016
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,140
 that there's fullness of joy.

1017
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:07,720
 It is at his right hand

1018
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:11,760
 there are pleasures forevermore.

1019
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,760
 For in a world that wants to take our joy,

1020
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:18,220
 we can be assured our Jesus came to give it back.

1021
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:23,740
 He came to pursue not perfect people,

1022
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:26,800
 but imperfect people to give them a happy heart,

1023
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,500
 the kind of heart he himself had.

1024
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:32,800
 He came to broach our secret sin

1025
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,820
 and give us the very joy that we had lost,

1026
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:37,280
 a joy that can only be found in him.

1027
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:41,280
 And though he knows confession is never easy,

1028
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:44,560
 he has made it so very worth it

1029
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,560
 that any who would confess and believe him as Lord

1030
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,200
 might be with him forever,

1031
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:50,520
 and not just have eternal life,

1032
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:55,520
 but have joy both today and tomorrow and forevermore.

1033
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:58,760
 Sin isn't a bad thing we do.

1034
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:03,040
 It isn't just a bad thing we do.

1035
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:07,960
 It is the response of the sad people we are.

1036
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:09,960
 Where then is our joy found?

1037
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:12,260
 It is found in Christ.

1038
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:15,440
 Look to his cross for that tells you

1039
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:20,360
 how much he wanted you to have it and find it in him.

1040
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:21,760
 Let me pray for us.

1041
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,000
 God, we love you.

1042
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,040
 Thanks for tonight.

1043
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:30,600
 God, I just, I acknowledge

1044
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:33,040
 that coming into this evening,

1045
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:38,040
 I knew this message is heavy and it's hard.

1046
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:40,460
 (soft music)

1047
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:47,120
 The room might feel weighty and even worried,

1048
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:50,360
 but God, I think it's too important

1049
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:53,680
 to look at these people, your people,

1050
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:56,240
 and tell them the road back to joy

1051
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:00,720
 is found in Jesus,

1052
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:07,040
 whom we not only find everlasting life,

1053
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:09,640
 but the forgiveness that makes it possible.

1054
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:12,520
 If you don't know Christ,

1055
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:16,360
 I pray you would confess your sin

1056
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:18,840
 and believe he is Lord,

1057
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:21,960
 for it is in him that all satisfaction is found.

1058
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:27,480
 And if you're here and you've not told somebody,

1059
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:30,640
 you've not told him,

1060
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:34,760
 it's time to confess and get your joy back.

1061
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:36,440
 That's where the fight begins.

1062
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:39,040
 And God, we want to start right now.

1063
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:39,880
 We love you.

1064
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,480
 It's in Christ's name, amen.
