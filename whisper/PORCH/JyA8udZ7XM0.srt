 [APPLAUSE]

102
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:52,800
 Sometimes in life you look at things and

103
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,800
 you just kind of see a mess.

104
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,800
 And inside you're like, I think it's supposed to be beautiful.

105
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,800
 Maybe it's a dove. I don't know, man.

106
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,800
 Beauty's in the eyes of the beholder.

107
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,800
 Beauty's in the eyes of the beholder.

108
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,800
 Maybe it's something, maybe I'm missing it.

109
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,800
 Maybe everybody sees it.

110
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,800
 Some are acting like it's good.

111
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,800
 But I just, I don't know, it's kind of ugly.

112
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,800
 I don't get it.

113
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:24,800
 And then it gets flipped.

114
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,800
 How many of you, by show of hands, saw that coming?

115
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,800
 How many of you have seen that before

116
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,800
 and you knew it was something?

117
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,800
 Keep your hands up.

118
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,800
 So some of you, you've seen that illustration

119
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,800
 or you've seen Lance's gifts before

120
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,800
 and you're like, okay, I know what's going to happen.

121
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,800
 I see Jesus' face there.

122
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,800
 I know how this is going to go down.

123
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,800
 Let me tell you something.

124
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,800
 Those of you that knew it was coming,

125
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,800
 you had a very different attitude than the rest of us.

126
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,800
 Because there towards the end,

127
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,800
 those of you that didn't see it coming,

128
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,800
 you started to feel embarrassed.

129
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,800
 You started like, oh man, I think he messed up

130
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,800
 or he's the big eraser, you know.

131
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,800
 Can we just start over?

132
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,800
 Shane, start singing again.

133
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,800
 Let's give this guy another shot.

134
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,800
 You feel bad for him.

135
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,800
 And you're like, oh no, things just went awry.

136
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,800
 That's what you were feeling.

137
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,800
 But those of you that knew what was coming,

138
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,800
 you felt something completely different.

139
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,800
 You thought, okay, just wait for it.

140
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,800
 Just wait for it, man. It's coming.

141
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,800
 It's going to be amazing.

142
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,800
 Life is that way.

143
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,800
 Life is that way for believers,

144
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,800
 you know God is going to do something good.

145
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,800
 You just need to wait.

146
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,800
 You just need to hold on. Hold fast.

147
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,800
 Wait for it. Wait for it. He's not done yet.

148
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,800
 He's going to make this good.

149
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,800
 He's going to make this right.

150
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,800
 You hold on with that hope.

151
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,800
 While others are looking at it,

152
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,800
 all I see is something ugly, man.

153
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,800
 So if you're here for the first time,

154
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,800
 we want to welcome you.

155
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,800
 Fort Worth, we want to welcome you.

156
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,800
 Houston, I know that you're streaming from your homes

157
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,800
 because of the flooding situation there.

158
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,800
 We welcome you guys. We're praying for you guys.

159
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,800
 If you're here with the Church Leaders Conference,

160
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,800
 welcome. We are talking tonight.

161
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,800
 We're going through a series, Romans 8,

162
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,800
 walking by the Spirit.

163
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,800
 We're talking tonight

164
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,800
 how God can flip

165
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,800
 everything for good.

166
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,800
 The scripture we're going to be in tonight

167
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,800
 is just where we're landing in this series.

168
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,800
 It just happens to be where we're at.

169
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,800
 It is overflowing with hope.

170
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,800
 It shows how God can flip the script

171
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,800
 in any given situation.

172
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,800
 If you're not in troubles right now,

173
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,800
 and you're like, "Well, I don't really need that right now.

174
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,800
 Life is good right now.

175
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,800
 I just got a raise,

176
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,800
 and I'm in a new relationship,

177
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,800
 and everything's working out."

178
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,800
 If that's where you're at right now, just wait.

179
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,800
 Jesus says, "In this world,

180
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,800
 you will have troubles."

181
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,800
 It's one of the promises He makes us.

182
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,800
 Troubles are coming your way, unbearable, unthinkable,

183
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,800
 unfathomable troubles.

184
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,800
 I'm not wishing that on you.

185
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,800
 That's not a prophecy or anything.

186
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,800
 As a matter of fact, if God gives you long enough,

187
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,800
 you are going to face sickness,

188
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,800
 death of loved ones,

189
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,800
 hurts, deep, deep,

190
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,800
 sorrowful hurts that you will need

191
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,800
 help getting through.

192
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,800
 This verse offers you the help.

193
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,800
 If that's where you're at right now,

194
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,800
 I hope you cling to every word in this verse.

195
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,800
 We're in Romans 8, if you want to turn there.

196
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,800
 I'm going to be in verse 28 through 30 this evening.

197
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,800
 Just as a reminder, Paul wrote this

198
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,800
 in about 57 AD

199
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,800
 to the church in Rome

200
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,800
 whom he had not met.

201
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,800
 There's a very turbulent culture

202
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,800
 going on in Rome as Paul writes this

203
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,800
 letter to them, offering them

204
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,800
 hope. Last week,

205
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,800
 David talked about how creation

206
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,800
 groans for the return of Christ

207
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,800
 and how the resurrection offers us this

208
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,800
 hope. Tonight, we're going to elaborate on that

209
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,800
 hope. I'll just read these verses.

210
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,800
 He says this in verse 28, "And we know

211
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,800
 that in all things God works for the good

212
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,800
 of those who love Him, who have been called

213
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,800
 according to His purpose.

214
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,800
 For those God foreknew, He also

215
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,800
 predestined to be conformed to the image

216
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,800
 of His Son, that He might be

217
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,800
 the firstborn among many brothers

218
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,800
 and sisters. And those He

219
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,800
 predestined, He also called. And those He called,

220
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,800
 He also justified. And those He justified,

221
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,800
 He also glorified."

222
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:07,800
 From these three verses, we're going to look at three promises

223
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,800
 from the text.

224
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,800
 How He makes good from our bad.

225
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,800
 What that good

226
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,800
 actually is.

227
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,800
 And how the best is yet to come.

228
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,800
 And so in

229
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,800
 verse 28, he says, "And we know

230
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,800
 in all things God works for the good

231
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,800
 of those who love Him, who have been

232
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,800
 called according to His purpose."

233
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,800
 My first point this evening is that God

234
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,800
 works the bad out for your good.

235
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,800
 God works the bad out for your good.

236
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,800
 Just hold on to that promise, okay?

237
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,800
 God works the bad out for

238
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,800
 your good. That is what He does. That is a

239
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,800
 promise to you from the Scriptures. It says

240
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,800
 this, we'll go section at a time, "We

241
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,800
 know." This is a very matter

242
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,800
 of fact for Christians. We know.

243
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,800
 We have this knowledge. It is a

244
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,800
 matter of fact to us. Like we know

245
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,800
 that gravity pulls us down. That we

246
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,800
 know the stars hang in the sky. That we know

247
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,800
 the grass is green. We know that

248
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,800
 God works all things

249
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,800
 for the good of those who love Him, who have been called

250
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,800
 according to His purpose. If you are here, you

251
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,800
 are a follower of Christ. This is a foundational

252
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,800
 truth to you. We know it.

253
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,800
 The Scripture says. Paul just talks about

254
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,800
 it like it's a matter of fact.

255
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,800
 What do we know? We know that God works in all

256
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,800
 things.

257
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,800
 Think about this. He hasn't just put

258
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,800
 you here to flail

259
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,800
 through life on your own. That you don't have help.

260
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,800
 But God, the Creator of the

261
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,800
 heavens and the earth. The one who spoke things

262
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,800
 into existence. The one who said

263
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,800
 it was and it was good.

264
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,800
 Is actively and intimately

265
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,800
 involved

266
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,800
 in your life right now. Involved in your

267
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,800
 relationships right now. Involved in your

268
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,800
 work right now. He knows

269
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,800
 you. He knows everything about you.

270
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,800
 Where you've been and where you're going.

271
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,800
 He's at work.

272
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,800
 In all those things.

273
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,800
 Specifically

274
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,800
 in your life.

275
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,800
 And He's working it out

276
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,800
 for your

277
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,800
 good.

278
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,800
 So He's

279
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,800
 working it out for your good.

280
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,800
 This is an unbelievable

281
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,800
 truth. And so here's what I'm telling you.

282
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,800
 If it doesn't seem

283
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,800
 good, He's not done.

284
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,800
 Because He's working it

285
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,800
 out for your good.

286
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,800
 So if what you have is not good, God's not

287
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,800
 finished.

288
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,800
 If it doesn't seem good, then He's not

289
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,800
 done. Right? And so this is what

290
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,800
 God is doing. And so I want to

291
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,800
 differentiate this from everything

292
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,800
 happens for a reason. That's the worldly version.

293
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,800
 Well, everything happens for a reason.

294
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,800
 That's also true.

295
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,800
 It's just not as hopeful. It's certainly

296
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,800
 not as helpful.

297
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,800
 Right? When my radio was stolen

298
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,800
 out of my car, car broken

299
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,800
 into, someone says, "Well, everything happens for a reason."

300
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,800
 I'm like, "I know the reason.

301
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,800
 They wanted my radio."

302
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,800
 That's not helpful.

303
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,800
 That gives me no hope. You're right.

304
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,800
 Everything happens for a reason. There's a dude who

305
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,800
 wanted my radio. It's a nice radio. He took it.

306
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,800
 That was the reason. That's not helpful.

307
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,800
 This verse says, "No, Him

308
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,800
 taking your radio is working

309
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,800
 out for your good."

310
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,800
 And you can believe that

311
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,800
 as much as you can believe anything

312
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,800
 in life.

313
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,800
 You can hold on to that truth. That's

314
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,800
 unbelievable. And so,

315
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,800
 who's good? There's two conditions

316
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,800
 on this statement.

317
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,800
 Those who love God.

318
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,800
 And that's

319
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,800
 the promise. It's for those who, it's not for

320
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,800
 anybody. It's for those who love God and for those who

321
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,800
 have been called according to His purpose.

322
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,800
 That God

323
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,800
 didn't save you

324
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,800
 so that you could kick up your feet and take life

325
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,800
 easy. He didn't save you so that

326
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,800
 you can sulk in your sorrows. He didn't save

327
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,800
 you so that you can sit in your home alone. God

328
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,800
 saved you for a purpose. It's why He didn't

329
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,800
 save you and then call you home to glory

330
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,800
 instantly. But He saved you and He left

331
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,800
 you there so that you would continue

332
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,800
 to work out His purpose. Continue to walk

333
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,800
 through the good works which He's prepared in advance

334
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,800
 for you to walk in.

335
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,800
 That He's called you to a purpose. That your life

336
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,800
 has purpose. And you've got to find that

337
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,800
 because, you know, where your city that you

338
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,800
 live in will tell you your purpose is this. Your work will

339
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,800
 tell you that your purpose is this. Your mom and dad will tell you

340
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,800
 that your purpose is this. And God says, "No, your purpose is this."

341
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,800
 And you need to know, "I would trust God over

342
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,800
 anybody else

343
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,800
 what your purpose actually

344
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,800
 is."

345
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:15,800
 And so this verse,

346
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,800
 it can come across as trite.

347
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,800
 I'd be cautious to stick this

348
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,800
 verse in front of someone who is

349
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,800
 suffering.

350
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,800
 It can feel like you're writing off their

351
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,800
 suffering. It can feel like you're not suffering

352
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,800
 with them. But I would not

353
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,800
 lose sight of the promise. And I would

354
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,800
 continue to offer this promise to

355
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,800
 someone who is suffering. The promise behind

356
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,800
 this verse that God is at work

357
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,800
 in their suffering. Not to be

358
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,800
 insensitive, but to help them.

359
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,800
 To remind them. To help them carry that

360
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,800
 burden. To sit in the suffering

361
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,800
 with them and wait. Tell them to wait

362
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,800
 so that we can see God's promise

363
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,800
 come to fruition.

364
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,800
 But I want to show you

365
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,800
 what this verse does if we believe it. Because it

366
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,800
 has unbelievable power

367
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,800
 behind it.

368
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,800
 It really unlocks a lot

369
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,800
 of other verses in the scripture. There's all

370
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,800
 of these verses in the scripture that say that

371
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,800
 we can have joy in suffering. Now the

372
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,800
 world will never tell you that you can have

373
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,800
 joy in suffering. That doesn't make sense to science.

374
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,800
 That doesn't make sense to the way that

375
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,800
 the world is wired. That you can experience joy

376
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,800
 in suffering. But Romans 8.28 unlocks

377
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,800
 these verses. Verses

378
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,800
 like Romans 5 verse 3.

379
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,800
 "Not only so, but we also glory

380
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,800
 in our sufferings because we know that

381
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,800
 suffering produces perseverance."

382
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,800
 We can glory in our suffering. James 1 verse

383
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,800
 2 and 3. "Consider it pure joy

384
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,800
 my brothers and sisters whenever you face trials."

385
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,800
 Who considers trials joy? James.

386
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,800
 Romans 8.28

387
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,800
 will help you do that. 1 Peter

388
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,800
 4 verse 13 says, "But rejoice

389
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,800
 in as much as you participate in the

390
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,800
 sufferings of Christ

391
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,800
 so that you may be overjoyed

392
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,800
 when his glory is revealed."

393
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,800
 Colossians 1 verse 24.

394
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,800
 "Now I rejoice in what I am suffering for you."

395
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,800
 Hebrews 10 verse 34.

396
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,800
 "You suffered along with those

397
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,800
 in prison and joyfully accepted

398
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,800
 the confiscation of your property."

399
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,800
 My radio. "Because you knew

400
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,800
 that you yourselves had better

401
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,800
 and lasting possessions."

402
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,800
 Do you see that

403
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,800
 what it's saying is that your emotions,

404
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,800
 listen, that your emotions do not

405
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,800
 have to be tied to your experiences.

406
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,800
 Life says that your emotions have to be tied

407
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,800
 to your experiences. Romans 8.28 says that

408
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,800
 your emotions do not have to be tied to your experiences.

409
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,800
 Are you following me? That you can

410
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,800
 experience a trial

411
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,800
 and still

412
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,800
 experience joy. So let me just

413
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,800
 show you, okay, this is a picture of

414
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,800
 two knobs. Picture like oven knobs

415
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,800
 if you will. You see the little red arrow.

416
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,800
 And so you can see there that

417
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,800
 knob is pointed to trial

418
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,800
 and that knob is pointed to sadness, right?

419
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,800
 And so if I turn that knob, because it's connected

420
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,800
 by a belt, this is just an imaginary

421
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,800
 illustration, because it's connected to a belt

422
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,800
 if I turn that knob slowly, the other

423
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,800
 one's going to turn slowly. So that when I

424
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,800
 experience fun, I'm also going

425
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,800
 to experience joy. But when I

426
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,800
 experience trials, then I'm going to

427
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,800
 experience sadness. What Romans

428
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,800
 8.28 does guys is it

429
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,800
 takes that belt off.

430
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,800
 And it says that in trials

431
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,800
 there is a joy that believers

432
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,800
 can have that comes from a future

433
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,800
 hope that you can experience

434
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,800
 joy in trials because of what

435
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,800
 God promises you.

436
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,800
 Because you know something

437
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,800
 better is coming. That's the promise

438
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,800
 of this verse. That whenever

439
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,800
 you are in trials, you can experience

440
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,800
 joy because you know that God is

441
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,800
 working that trial out for your good.

442
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,800
 You know it. As a matter of fact,

443
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,800
 you know it. For certainty

444
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,800
 you know it.

445
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,800
 I've seen this demonstrated through the years.

446
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,800
 Lots of examples.

447
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,800
 I'll give you one. In my own

448
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,800
 personal life, when I

449
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,800
 I guess

450
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,800
 I was just about to get married

451
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,800
 to Monica. It was one month

452
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,800
 before our wedding.

453
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,800
 I was sitting at my desk at AT&T

454
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,800
 and my phone

455
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,800
 rang and it was my mom.

456
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,800
 She said, "Jonathan?"

457
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,800
 I said, "Yes." And then she said three

458
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,800
 words you never want to hear someone you love

459
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,800
 say. See I thought she was just calling to catch up.

460
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,800
 How's the wedding planning going? What's going on?

461
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,800
 How's work? But you know we were just talking

462
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,800
 like normal. She says, "Jonathan,

463
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,800
 I have cancer.

464
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,800
 I need

465
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,800
 to start chemotherapy right away."

466
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,800
 Now cancer was like this

467
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,800
 thing to me that other people had

468
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,800
 and people died from and no one

469
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,800
 close to me had ever had cancer. Now my mom

470
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,800
 is on the other end of this phone saying that

471
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,800
 she has cancer and my whole

472
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,800
 world has fallen apart but hers isn't.

473
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,800
 She says, "Don't

474
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,800
 worry. My hair will

475
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,800
 grow back before the wedding.

476
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,800
 And besides,

477
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,800
 I think wig shopping would be kind of fun."

478
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,800
 I'm like, "Mom, what are you?"

479
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,800
 I'm like angry at her. I'm like, "What are you talking about?

480
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,800
 You've got cancer."

481
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,800
 She says, "Hey, God's at work in this."

482
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,800
 She held fast to the

483
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,800
 truth of this verse.

484
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,800
 My dad says about her that she has more

485
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,800
 faith than sense.

486
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:59,800
 But she clung, she

487
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,800
 clung to the promises of

488
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,800
 God here, right? She knows

489
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,800
 that God has a plan in this and so

490
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,800
 she's showing me this,

491
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,800
 right? I want to be really

492
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,800
 careful here. I don't know where you're at. If you're

493
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,800
 in a trial, I'm not even talking to you right now.

494
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,800
 I'm talking to those of you

495
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,800
 who just want to look

496
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,800
 at the theology behind this passage. This is a theological

497
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,800
 statement, not a pastoral statement.

498
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,800
 Let me just say this.

499
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,800
 I think

500
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,800
 you can say things one

501
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,800
 to many that you wouldn't say one on

502
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,800
 one.

503
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,800
 It's this. In certain

504
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,800
 circumstances, I should say. Because

505
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,800
 I would be kind and compassionate and

506
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,800
 shepherd those people.

507
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,800
 Is your

508
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,800
 cancer the result

509
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,800
 of your lack of faith?

510
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,800
 No.

511
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,800
 That would be a heresy.

512
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,800
 But your discouragement

513
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,800
 might be.

514
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,800
 But your

515
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,800
 discouragement, your despair

516
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,800
 in your experience

517
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,800
 may be the result

518
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,800
 of a lack of faith. Now I'm not saying you can't

519
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,800
 experience sadness. I'm not saying

520
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,800
 that you can't be upset at the trial.

521
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,800
 I'm not saying that you can't be angry

522
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,800
 that the world that we live in has fallen

523
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,800
 because sin has come into the world. We know that

524
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,800
 Jesus looked at the grave of his friend Lazarus

525
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,800
 and he wept.

526
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,800
 We find hope that Jesus experienced

527
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,800
 and displayed those emotions.

528
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,800
 So we can be compassionate. We can weep

529
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,800
 with our friends. We can mourn with

530
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,800
 those who mourn and rejoice with those

531
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,800
 who rejoice. Suffer with those who

532
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,800
 suffer.

533
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,800
 But

534
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,800
 you cannot

535
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,800
 doubt God's goodness.

536
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:41,800
 And I would encourage you

537
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,800
 not to stop believing

538
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,800
 that God is at work in your circumstance

539
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,800
 for your good.

540
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,800
 And this is the hope that Paul held

541
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,800
 onto and why he had

542
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,800
 the power to say

543
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,800
 things like these light

544
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,800
 and momentary troubles.

545
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,800
 So that's kind of

546
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,800
 the punchline. Now how do we get there?

547
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,800
 That's the solution to the problem

548
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,800
 but we don't really know how we got

549
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,800
 to that solution. So what is the good

550
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,800
 that God is at work in? Because it's a

551
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,800
 very specific good. It's not a general good.

552
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,800
 Let me show you now from the scriptures.

553
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,800
 Verse 29 it says, "For those God

554
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,800
 foreknew." That "for" there means "because."

555
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,800
 Think "because." Because

556
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,800
 I'm telling you God is working this out

557
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,800
 for your good, for those who love him,

558
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,800
 those who have been called according to his purpose.

559
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,800
 "Because those God foreknew,

560
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,800
 he also predestined to be conformed

561
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,800
 to the image of his Son." Ding, ding, ding,

562
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,800
 ding, ding. Here's the good.

563
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,800
 "That he might be the firstborn

564
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,800
 from among many brothers and

565
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,800
 sisters."

566
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,800
 And so God has started something

567
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,800
 since the beginning

568
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,800
 that he's going to carry out in you. And so my second

569
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,800
 point is this. It's this good,

570
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,800
 the good that we're talking about in Romans

571
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,800
 8-28. This good is

572
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,800
 God's end goal for you.

573
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,800
 This good is something very specific

574
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,800
 and the very specific good thing

575
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,800
 that God is working out in your life

576
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,800
 is his end goal for you

577
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,800
 that you would be conformed to the image

578
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,800
 and the character of his Son

579
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,800
 Jesus Christ for all eternity.

580
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:13,800
 You're being made into something

581
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,800
 that you were being made into

582
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,800
 since the beginning of time.

583
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,800
 So this is not a

584
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,800
 "I lost my job." That's okay.

585
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,800
 "God has a better job for me."

586
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,800
 #Romans8-28

587
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,800
 That's not what's going on here.

588
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,800
 That's not what this verse teaches.

589
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,800
 This is a

590
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,800
 "I lost my job." It's okay.

591
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,800
 God is conforming

592
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,800
 me to the image of Christ through this

593
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,800
 circumstance and he has set up for me

594
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,800
 an eternal glory. And a hundred

595
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,800
 years from now, it won't matter

596
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,800
 that I lost my job. A billion

597
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,800
 years from now, it won't matter that I lost

598
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,800
 my job. I will not be in heaven

599
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,800
 10,000 years from now

600
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,800
 sulking because I lost my job.

601
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,800
 I know it's going to be okay because

602
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,800
 God has set up for me an eternal glory,

603
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,800
 eternal riches with him in his

604
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,800
 presence forever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever

605
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,800
 and ever and ever and ever.

606
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,800
 And that's the hope I cling to as I sit here

607
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,800
 frustrated

608
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,800
 that this didn't

609
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,800
 go as I wanted, but hopeful

610
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,800
 and even joyful.

611
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:17,800
 And even joyful.

612
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,800
 And so let's define some terms.

613
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,800
 Those he foreknew.

614
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,800
 Now I want to confess to you that for a number

615
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,800
 of years when I came into the faith, I read

616
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,800
 this foreknowledge as like God knowing

617
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,800
 what was going to happen in the future. Maybe some of you

618
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,800
 thought that's what this is.

619
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,800
 This he foreknew, this means that God knows

620
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,800
 what's going to happen. That's not what this foreknew means.

621
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,800
 This is a he foreknew you.

622
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,800
 He

623
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,800
 before creation looked

624
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,800
 ahead and existed in relationship

625
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,800
 with you before you ever were.

626
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,800
 In his mind, you were his.

627
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,800
 He knew you like he

628
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,800
 knew Israel in Amos 3 verse 2.

629
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,800
 Like he knew Israel before

630
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,800
 or among all of the nations, he knew

631
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,800
 Israel as his in the same way

632
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,800
 before you were created, before your mama

633
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,800
 was created, before your parents ever

634
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,800
 lived and your grandparents ever lived and before

635
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,800
 he shaped the earth.

636
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,800
 He knew you like he knows

637
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,800
 you today.

638
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,800
 He foreknew

639
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,800
 you.

640
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,800
 See, God doesn't

641
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,800
 exist in a chronological timeline.

642
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,800
 We exist

643
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,800
 in Monday, porch

644
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,800
 day, Wednesday, Thursday,

645
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,800
 Friday, Saturday, Sunday.

646
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,800
 God

647
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,800
 stands outside of that chronology

648
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:35,800
 and he just sees

649
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,800
 the end result. He sees it like a

650
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,800
 painting, candidly. Not

651
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,800
 like a movie, but like a picture, somehow.

652
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,800
 I can't even get my head around that.

653
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,800
 It says those he

654
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,800
 foreknew, he also predestined. Lots of debate

655
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,800
 around this verse, so I really want to explain to you what it

656
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,800
 means, predestined.

657
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,800
 What this word here, predestined

658
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,800
 means, is it means

659
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,800
 predestined.

660
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,800
 Destined ahead

661
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,800
 of time, if you would rather that.

662
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,800
 It means

663
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,800
 determined beforehand.

664
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,800
 Don't be

665
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,800
 so concerned

666
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,800
 that God

667
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,800
 is in control.

668
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,800
 Don't be so confused or concerned

669
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,800
 that, "Well, wait a minute, but I can't understand that."

670
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,800
 Good. Do you want a fathomable God?

671
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,800
 I want an unfathomable God.

672
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,800
 I think we would all say, "No, I want an unfathomable

673
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,800
 God. God is unfathomable." But I hate that he's unfathomable.

674
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,800
 I wish he was fathomable.

675
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,800
 No, "But God is

676
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,800
 so big and sovereign and huge,

677
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,800
 but I wish he fit in my little box

678
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,800
 nice and neat, so that I could completely

679
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,800
 understand everything about him."

680
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,800
 You don't want to worship a God you understand.

681
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,800
 Man,

682
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,800
 you don't even understand women, much less

683
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,800
 God, right? I mean, you don't want to

684
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,800
 worship a God that you don't understand.

685
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,800
 You don't want to worship a God that

686
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,800
 you understand, right?

687
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,800
 God is God, right? He's

688
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,800
 all-powerful. You don't know anything. There is

689
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,800
 nothing else in this world

690
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,800
 like him. And so here's

691
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,800
 what I would tell you. If God is not sovereign, you are

692
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,800
 not secure.

693
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,800
 Like, if you could do

694
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,800
 anything to be saved, then you could

695
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,800
 certainly do something to lose your

696
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,800
 salvation. If you are in control of your

697
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,800
 salvation, you'll lose it. I

698
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,800
 can't even keep up with my keys, much less

699
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,800
 my salvation, right? And so I need God

700
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,800
 to be in complete control of that.

701
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,800
 His sovereignty

702
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,800
 is the only force in this

703
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,800
 universe strong enough to hold

704
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,800
 me secure

705
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,800
 in heaven, in his kingdom, with him.

706
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:33,800
 It's the God who called you

707
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,800
 at the beginning of time.

708
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,800
 That God you will not slip through

709
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,800
 his fingers. That's meant to give you hope.

710
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,800
 And so what is the goal

711
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,800
 that he's working towards? As I said, it's you

712
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,800
 being conformed to the image of his

713
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,800
 son. The good that he is

714
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,800
 working out in your life is

715
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,800
 you being made like Jesus, who is firstborn

716
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,800
 over all creation. Firstborn means that

717
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,800
 others are to come. His

718
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,800
 brothers and sisters, that's you.

719
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,800
 That you have been adopted into his family.

720
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,800
 We said the other day that the entire Bible

721
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,800
 is about God getting his children back,

722
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,800
 and I'll add to it tonight, and placing

723
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,800
 Jesus as head over a new tribe

724
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,800
 that belongs to God and was

725
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,800
 always going to belong to God.

726
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,800
 That's

727
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,800
 the story being written. God getting his kids

728
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,800
 back and putting Jesus over them

729
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,800
 as the head, his siblings, the

730
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,800
 church, your

731
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,800
 brothers and sisters.

732
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,800
 And so it raises the question,

733
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,800
 "JP, what if I'm not predestined?"

734
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,800
 I don't know.

735
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,800
 But, before

736
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,800
 you lose hope, let me just offer you something.

737
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:37,800
 Consider where you're at tonight, on a Tuesday.

738
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,800
 When

739
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,800
 your friends are having $2 margaritas

740
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,800
 somewhere, and maybe you

741
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,800
 stumbled into this place thinking it was a restaurant

742
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,800
 and you hoped to get a good burger, and all of a sudden you find

743
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,800
 yourself in church, and I just, "Hey, God's

744
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,800
 in that. He's

745
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,800
 after you."

746
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,800
 And so, if you're here, and you're

747
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,800
 Hindu, good luck.

748
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,800
 God's pursuing

749
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,800
 you. If you're here, and you're atheist,

750
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,800
 I just got a feeling you're not going to

751
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,800
 be atheist long.

752
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,800
 Because God is radically pursuing

753
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,800
 you. If you're here for all

754
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,800
 the wrong reasons, you want to take

755
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,800
 advantage of someone, you want to

756
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,800
 pray on God's people, watch

757
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,800
 out.

758
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,800
 He's a huge God.

759
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,800
 And he's going to get you, and the way that

760
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,800
 he's going to punish you is he's going to save you.

761
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,800
 And make you do his will for the

762
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,800
 rest of your life. I mean, that's what he does, right?

763
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,800
 It's amazing.

764
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,800
 That's how

765
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,800
 he punished me. Praise God.

766
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,800
 And so,

767
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,800
 you might be here,

768
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,800
 "Well, what if my loved one is not predestined?

769
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,800
 What if somebody I love very much is not predestined,

770
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,800
 JP, that keeps me up at night?"

771
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,800
 I don't know.

772
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,800
 But consider who's in their life.

773
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,800
 Consider who God

774
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,800
 and his sovereignty placed

775
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,800
 in their family tree, or next to them,

776
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,800
 or in a relationship with them,

777
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,800
 so that he might call

778
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,800
 them into a relationship with him. He uses

779
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,800
 those he's called.

780
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,800
 And it's beautiful.

781
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:07,800
 And so here's what this means, right?

782
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,800
 It means that when life

783
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,800
 is hard, God is working towards

784
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,800
 something, some end goal.

785
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,800
 You ever seen somebody that's like, really

786
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,800
 out of shape, and they're like, "Man, 2016

787
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,800
 is my year." And they go to the gym,

788
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,800
 and they get a trainer, and they go all out, they get the

789
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,800
 workout clothes, they go to Lululemon and spend

790
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,800
 like $20,000, and then they go

791
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,800
 to the gym, and they're just like, "I'm gonna go

792
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,800
 big, I'm gonna do it right," you know, and they're there,

793
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,800
 and they're like, "Oh, it's so hard, I don't

794
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,800
 wanna quit." They just constantly wanna quit, and they're out of

795
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,800
 shape. And I've seen these people,

796
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,800
 I've been in a gym before, I know where it is.

797
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,800
 And so I've seen these people, right?

798
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,800
 And it's like, I've been

799
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,800
 in those people, and so, and

800
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,800
 they're just like, "Okay, I wanna give up, I wanna give up,

801
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,800
 I wanna give up." But something happens as they don't

802
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,800
 give up, as they press through, they begin

803
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,800
 to feel better. And they begin to

804
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,800
 look better, and they begin to lose weight,

805
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,800
 and begin to have more energy, they begin to reap the benefits.

806
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,800
 And all of a sudden, they're an addict, they're a gym rat,

807
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,800
 "I'm not going anywhere, I'm in the gym," you know,

808
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,800
 and they're just, they're loving it, they can't get enough

809
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,800
 of the gym, because they, all of a sudden, they're like

810
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,800
 the icon of health.

811
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,800
 And you're like, "How did this happen?" It's because

812
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,800
 they began to see the benefit.

813
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,800
 And the benefit

814
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,800
 began to,

815
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,800
 it became worth the cost.

816
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,800
 And that's what this verse is saying,

817
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,800
 it's saying, "Hey, here's the benefit."

818
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,800
 And so,

819
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,800
 in the trial, know that it's worth it.

820
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,800
 Press forward, because something

821
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,800
 good is coming, something

822
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,800
 good is coming for you, right?

823
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,800
 God, through every trial, He's sculpting

824
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,800
 you, He's turning you to

825
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,800
 something, so trust this truth in

826
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,800
 trials, that God is

827
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,800
 turning you into something.

828
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,800
 The best way I know how to illustrate this is the story

829
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,800
 of Michael Angelo.

830
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,800
 He's a sculptor in the 1500s,

831
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,800
 and maybe his most famous work of all time

832
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,800
 is the statue of David.

833
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,800
 Not David Marvin, but

834
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,800
 David.

835
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,800
 And,

836
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,800
 he was asked

837
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,800
 this question,

838
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,800
 "How did you create such a beautiful monument?"

839
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,800
 And listen to his amazing response.

840
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,800
 He said,

841
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,800
 "Just chip away the stone that doesn't

842
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,800
 look like David. In every

843
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,800
 block of marble I see a statue

844
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,800
 as plain as though it stood before me,

845
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,800
 shaped and perfect in attitude

846
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,800
 and action. I have only to

847
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,800
 hew away the rough walls

848
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,800
 that imprison the lovely apparition

849
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,800
 to reveal it to the other

850
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,800
 eyes as mine see it."

851
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,800
 And in your life,

852
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,800
 God is taking this statue

853
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,800
 called you, and chipping away

854
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,800
 everything that does not look like Jesus,

855
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,800
 and it may not feel good

856
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,800
 as you get hit with a hammer,

857
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,800
 and a chisel, and a spike, and

858
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,800
 rocks are falling off, but

859
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,800
 you are being mold and shaped into the

860
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,800
 image of Jesus for eternity.

861
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:49,800
 And in a hundred years,

862
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,800
 two hundred years, two hundred

863
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,800
 thousand years,

864
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,800
 the pain won't even be a memory

865
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,800
 that you carry.

866
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,800
 You will just be perfected

867
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,800
 like Christ in all your glory

868
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,800
 for eternity,

869
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,800
 and it will be worth it.

870
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,800
 See, God doesn't always

871
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,800
 change your circumstance.

872
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,800
 His promise is to change you

873
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,800
 in your circumstance.

874
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,800
 He doesn't always change

875
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,800
 your circumstance. His promise is to change you

876
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,800
 in your circumstance, and so if it's painful,

877
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,800
 hold on.

878
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,800
 If it doesn't feel good, hold fast

879
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,800
 to the hope of glory.

880
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,800
 Verse 30,

881
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,800
 "And those he predestined, he also

882
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,800
 called, and those he called, he also

883
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,800
 justified. Those he justified,

884
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,800
 he also glorified."

885
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,800
 He glorified.

886
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,800
 The third and final point

887
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,800
 is that the best is yet to come.

888
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,800
 The best is

889
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,800
 yet to come. This progression

890
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,800
 that Paul writes here to the church in Rome,

891
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,800
 it's very matter of fact.

892
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,800
 It is meant to offer you hope

893
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,800
 and security that God doesn't miss anyone

894
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,800
 that he's accounted for in the beginning.

895
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,800
 No one slips through the fingers

896
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,800
 of God. Everyone

897
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,800
 is accounted for. Everyone

898
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,800
 that he predestined, he called,

899
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,800
 and he called, he justified, he justified,

900
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,800
 he glorified, that glorified

901
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,800
 there. That's his end goal. That's

902
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,800
 the good that he's working toward. That's you

903
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,800
 in the character, or in the image rather,

904
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,800
 of Christ. And so let's just define

905
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,800
 this. This word called, right, this

906
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,800
 is not a...

907
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,800
 Come here, Spot.

908
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,800
 Spot, come here.

909
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,800
 It's not that kind of called.

910
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,800
 It's like this. "Lazarus, come

911
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,800
 forth!"

912
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,800
 This call brings

913
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,800
 about the thing that it requests.

914
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,800
 This call,

915
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,800
 this word call, it brings

916
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,800
 into reality the very request

917
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,800
 that it makes. When Jesus says,

918
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,800
 "Lazarus, come forth," Lazarus cannot

919
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,800
 say no. He's

920
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,800
 just coming. Against his will

921
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,800
 he's coming. He's forth,

922
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,800
 out of the grave, it's done. This is

923
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,800
 the call here. It's not a

924
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,800
 "Hey, come here and you might miss it." It's not

925
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,800
 a phone ringing.

926
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,800
 It's something that your soul and your

927
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,800
 body and your heart has to

928
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,800
 obey. That sin

929
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,800
 no longer has power

930
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,800
 over you. And you walk

931
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,800
 from that grave forward.

932
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,800
 This justified, this word

933
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,800
 means declared righteous.

934
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,800
 It's a beautiful word.

935
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,800
 It happens in a moment that

936
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,800
 Jesus' righteousness is imputed

937
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,800
 on you. That all of the

938
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,800
 righteousness from his account is

939
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,800
 accredited to your account.

940
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,800
 That you in a moment are

941
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,800
 seen as righteous, even though you're an adulterer.

942
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,800
 Even though you had an abortion.

943
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,800
 Even though you're addicted to pornography.

944
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,800
 Even though you're having sex with your significant

945
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,800
 other. Even though you're getting drunk. Even though

946
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,800
 you're legalistic. Even though you're self-righteous.

947
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,800
 You're justified.

948
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,800
 You don't have to pay for that.

949
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,800
 You don't

950
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,800
 have to pay for that.

951
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,800
 You are no longer

952
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,800
 under the penalty

953
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,800
 of sin.

954
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,800
 Yeah.

955
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,800
 And those who justified, he also

956
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,800
 glorified. You know what's amazing about

957
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,800
 this word? It's

958
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,800
 past tense.

959
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,800
 But it hasn't happened yet.

960
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,800
 But it has. But it hasn't.

961
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,800
 But it has. God sits

962
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,800
 outside of time.

963
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,800
 He's not operating

964
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,800
 in your chronological order.

965
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,800
 He sees you as glorified.

966
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,800
 Perfect.

967
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,800
 Like Jesus.

968
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,800
 Pure and holy.

969
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,800
 Before himself.

970
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,800
 Forever and ever and ever.

971
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,800
 That one day you would be somewhere

972
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,800
 absent of the presence

973
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,800
 of sin. This is the reality

974
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,800
 that Jesus on the cross, you remember what he said?

975
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,800
 "To tell is died."

976
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,800
 It is finished.

977
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,800
 What is finished, Jesus?

978
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,800
 It's not finished. You haven't raised from the grave.

979
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,800
 What's finished? Your sin is

980
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,800
 paid for. God in his wrath,

981
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,800
 in his fullness, is satisfied

982
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,800
 on me. The bill is paid.

983
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,800
 Every image you've looked at. Everything

984
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,800
 you've done wrong. It's been paid

985
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,800
 for to tell is died.

986
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,800
 But it ain't over.

987
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,800
 The best is yet

988
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,800
 to come. I'm going to

989
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,800
 raise from the grave. This is the

990
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,800
 truth that we walk in. That it's finished.

991
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,800
 My sins are paid for.

992
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,800
 And the best is yet to come. This already

993
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,800
 and not yet.

994
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,800
 Sins paid for and the reward

995
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,800
 for those sins being paid

996
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,800
 for in its fullness is

997
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,800
 coming my way of glory.

998
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,800
 Praise God.

999
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,800
 And so we're

1000
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,800
 free from the power of sin.

1001
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,800
 Free from the penalty of sin.

1002
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,800
 And one day

1003
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,800
 much sooner than we'll ever expect, we're

1004
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,800
 free from the presence of sin forever

1005
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,800
 and ever and ever. This perspective

1006
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,800
 is so powerful.

1007
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,800
 Perspective is powerful.

1008
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,800
 That eternity with God,

1009
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,800
 the perfect, awaits you

1010
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,800
 my friend. It awaits you my friend.

1011
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,800
 You're here on a Tuesday. I know your whole life's in front

1012
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,800
 of you. Maybe you've got 20, 30 years. Maybe 40

1013
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,800
 years. And eternity

1014
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,800
 in glory with the Father awaits

1015
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,800
 you. And so you can see your cancer.

1016
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,800
 You can see your sickness.

1017
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,800
 Your hurt. Your breakup. You can see it

1018
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,800
 through that lens.

1019
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,800
 I mean as we look back, like let me

1020
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,800
 tell you something man. In the 6th grade,

1021
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,800
 oh man, in the 6th grade,

1022
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,800
 I was dating Ann Marie. Let me

1023
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,800
 just start here. No one

1024
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,800
 should be dating anybody in the 6th grade.

1025
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,800
 Okay?

1026
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,800
 It's stupid. But I

1027
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,800
 was. And

1028
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,800
 Ann Marie, I loved her.

1029
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,800
 I wanted to marry Ann Marie

1030
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,800
 and she dropped

1031
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,800
 me like a bad habit in front of everybody

1032
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,800
 man. I mean I'm talking just like

1033
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,800
 looked at me in front of all my friends and just

1034
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,800
 said hey it's over. No reason, no

1035
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,800
 excuse. I mean she liked somebody else. But I

1036
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,800
 was there and I was, I like

1037
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,800
 couldn't get myself together.

1038
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,800
 I remember walking to the bathroom

1039
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,800
 and wishing it had a lock on the door because

1040
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,800
 I was like snot crying, like

1041
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,800
 ugly crying in the mirror. I remember like looking

1042
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,800
 at myself in the mirror at my

1043
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,800
 little school and said what is wrong

1044
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,800
 with you that Ann Marie doesn't like you anymore?

1045
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,800
 And I'm embarrassed to tell you this part.

1046
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,800
 But I remember,

1047
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,800
 I remember hitting my

1048
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,800
 head against the wall.

1049
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,800
 Thinking that life as I knew it

1050
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,800
 was over. And that anybody

1051
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,800
 that would come after Ann Marie would just be

1052
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,800
 a significant step down.

1053
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,800
 (Laughter)

1054
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:19,800
 And you laugh.

1055
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,800
 But the

1056
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,800
 pain to me was very real.

1057
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:27,800
 Now if I was talking about a miscarriage

1058
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,800
 my hunch

1059
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,800
 is you wouldn't laugh.

1060
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,800
 If I was talking about being laid

1061
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,800
 off yesterday you might not laugh. If I was talking

1062
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,800
 about man I just got diagnosed with cancer

1063
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,800
 you probably wouldn't laugh.

1064
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,800
 But can I tell you something crazy?

1065
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,800
 The pain that I felt in the 6th grade

1066
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,800
 was just as real to me

1067
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,800
 than any of those things.

1068
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:51,800
 And the only thing that makes it silly

1069
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,800
 is perspective.

1070
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,800
 Like I'm removed from it by time

1071
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,800
 now I'm married to Monica.

1072
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,800
 Upgrade!

1073
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,800
 (Laughter)

1074
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,800
 Just kidding Ann Marie you're great. Made in the image of God.

1075
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,800
 (Laughter)

1076
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,800
 But upgrade.

1077
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:13,800
 And

1078
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,800
 so I'm removed from that situation. I look back

1079
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,800
 and it's silly now. We can laugh about it.

1080
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,800
 It's funny and I'm not trying to be insensitive

1081
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,800
 but I'm just telling you 100 years

1082
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,800
 from now you're going to feel similar

1083
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,800
 about your trials.

1084
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,800
 I really am. I'm just speaking

1085
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,800
 from a theological truth of a verse

1086
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,800
 and I'm not trying to upset you or frustrate

1087
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,800
 you. I'm just telling you

1088
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,800
 that glory

1089
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,800
 is coming.

1090
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,800
 And you can have hope

1091
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,800
 in the midst of that.

1092
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,800
 And so if it seems like an ugly

1093
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,800
 painting,

1094
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,800
 wait for it.

1095
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,800
 Hold on.

1096
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,800
 Because you are watching the most amazing

1097
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,800
 artist I know.

1098
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,800
 He makes all things

1099
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,800
 beautiful.

1100
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,800
 Wait for it. You can believe that.

1101
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,800
 Take it to the bank.

1102
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,800
 So in summary, God's work

1103
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,800
 God works the bad out for your good.

1104
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:09,800
 God's good is his end goal for you.

1105
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:13,800
 Christ's glory

1106
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,800
 and the best is yet to come for those who love Him

1107
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,800
 who have been called according to His purpose.

1108
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:23,800
 Sunday night

1109
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,800
 sitting on

1110
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,800
 the bed, my little girl

1111
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,800
 and

1112
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,800
 Presley, the girl's

1113
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,800
 share room.

1114
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,800
 Presley says,

1115
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,800
 "Daddy, I want to become a Christian."

1116
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:41,800
 We've had these conversations

1117
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,800
 before. I've

1118
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,800
 asked her diagnostic questions before.

1119
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,800
 I'm like, "Presley, between 1 and 10,

1120
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,800
 how certain are you that if you die today that you go to

1121
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,800
 heaven?" She's like, "9.

1122
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,800
 9.5."

1123
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,800
 Something was

1124
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,800
 different Sunday.

1125
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,800
 She looked at me and

1126
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,800
 she said, "10."

1127
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:05,800
 I'm like, "Okay, she might have learned

1128
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,800
 the answer, so why?"

1129
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,800
 She just answered so differently. She said,

1130
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:13,800
 "Because..."

1131
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,800
 She said, "Daddy, not because of anything I've done."

1132
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:19,800
 She said, "But because of what Jesus

1133
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,800
 has done for me, that He died

1134
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,800
 for my sins and God raised

1135
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,800
 Him from the dead."

1136
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,800
 What a beautiful truth. I said, "Presley,

1137
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,800
 would you like

1138
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,800
 to pray?"

1139
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,800
 She said, "Yeah."

1140
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,800
 I said, "Let

1141
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,800
 God know that

1142
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,800
 you've done a lot of

1143
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,800
 things, that you've sinned against Him."

1144
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,800
 She said, "God, I've sinned against

1145
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,800
 You. I know I've sinned

1146
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,800
 against You." She thanked

1147
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,800
 Him for Jesus and His payment for

1148
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,800
 her sins.

1149
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,800
 She thanked Him. She thanked God

1150
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,800
 that He has the power to raise Jesus from the

1151
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,800
 grave.

1152
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,800
 She asked God, "Would

1153
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,800
 You come and live in my life? Would

1154
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,800
 You send Your Spirit

1155
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,800
 to guide me?" It was the most beautiful,

1156
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,800
 articulate, Gospel-centered prayer that a

1157
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,800
 nine-year-old could pray.

1158
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,800
 She said, "Amen."

1159
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,800
 I said, "Presley,

1160
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,800
 you're a Christian."

1161
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,800
 I said, "Presley, we're going to spend

1162
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,800
 forever and ever

1163
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,800
 and ever together in Heaven.

1164
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,800
 We're going to be there in God's glory, together

1165
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,800
 forever and ever. We get to be there

1166
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,800
 forever."

1167
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,800
 She started crying.

1168
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:39,800
 I said, "Why are you sad?"

1169
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:41,800
 She said, "No, Daddy. These are happy tears.

1170
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,800
 These are happy

1171
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,800
 tears."

1172
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:49,800
 I said, "Presley, this is what this means.

1173
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,800
 That now

1174
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,800
 that you've been called according to His

1175
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,800
 purpose. That whatever

1176
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:59,800
 circumstance life throws

1177
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,800
 at you, you know that you can

1178
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:03,800
 get through because God is working it

1179
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,800
 out for your good. You're going to be with

1180
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,800
 Him forever and ever and

1181
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,800
 ever. So just hold on because

1182
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:11,800
 much sooner than you think this world

1183
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,800
 won't matter as much as everyone's going

1184
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:15,800
 to try to convince you that it does,

1185
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,800
 God is saying He's doing

1186
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,800
 something bigger than it.

1187
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,800
 In your circumstance, Presley,

1188
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,800
 hold on. Let me tell you something.

1189
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,800
 As a dad who loves her very much,

1190
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,800
 I know what's coming her way.

1191
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,800
 I know heartbreak is coming

1192
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,800
 her way. I know that at some

1193
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,800
 time in the future when she's 30

1194
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:35,800
 that some idiot is

1195
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,800
 going to hurt her and I'm going to

1196
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,800
 want to hurt him. I know that's

1197
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,800
 coming her way.

1198
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:43,800
 Layoffs.

1199
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:45,800
 God forbid, sickness,

1200
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:47,800
 maybe cancer,

1201
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,800
 carriages.

1202
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:53,800
 She's going to face these types

1203
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,800
 of things, maybe bigger. She's going

1204
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,800
 to lose loved ones. She's

1205
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:59,800
 going to lose her parents. She's going to put her

1206
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:01,800
 daddy in the grave one day.

1207
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:07,800
 And let me tell you something.

1208
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,800
 This daddy can't fix those

1209
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:11,800
 things.

1210
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:13,800
 I can't make them good.

1211
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,800
 But that daddy can.

1212
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,800
 And that daddy will.

1213
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,800
 He promised.

1214
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:23,800
 He promised

1215
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:25,800
 that he would.

1216
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,800
 How incredible is that?

1217
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,800
 And friends, what I'm telling you is

1218
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:31,800
 he made you the exact same promise.

1219
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:33,800
 And so when you wake up

1220
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,800
 tomorrow and you're

1221
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:37,800
 looking at an ugly painting,

1222
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:39,800
 friends, you hold on.

1223
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:43,800
 God ain't done yet.

1224
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:45,800
 The best is yet to come.

1225
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:47,800
 And he's

1226
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,800
 going to turn it around. He's going to turn it for your

1227
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:51,800
 good. That's what he does.

1228
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:53,800
 He's always done that.

1229
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:57,800
 There was a painting one day of an ugly

1230
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,800
 dead

1231
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,800
 man on a cross.

1232
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,800
 And the enemy

1233
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,800
 was doing the happy dance.

1234
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,800
 He thought it was over.

1235
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:09,800
 And God

1236
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,800
 flipped the script.

1237
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:13,800
 And he made it

1238
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:15,800
 an empty tomb.

1239
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:17,800
 He made a salvation for all who

1240
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:19,800
 believe.

1241
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:21,800
 He's really good at that.

1242
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:23,800
 He's really,

1243
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:25,800
 really good at that. Let me praise him.

1244
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:27,800
 Let me thank him now.

1245
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:33,800
 Father, you make

1246
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:35,800
 everything beautiful.

1247
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:37,800
 Thank you

1248
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:39,800
 for the hope

1249
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:41,800
 that you've given us in this

1250
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,800
 passage, for the

1251
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,800
 truth that you've placed

1252
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:47,800
 in here for us to cling to, to hold

1253
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:49,800
 on to,

1254
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,800
 for the realities of Romans

1255
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:53,800
 828,

1256
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:55,800
 the truths of Romans

1257
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:57,800
 829, and the promise of Romans

1258
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:59,800
 830,

1259
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:01,800
 that we will be in glory

1260
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:03,800
 with you forever and ever and

1261
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:05,800
 ever and ever and ever and ever.

1262
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:07,800
 Oh, God.

1263
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:09,800
 You're

1264
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:11,800
 a great dad.

1265
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:13,800
 And I know

1266
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,800
 that we're going to be tempted to lose

1267
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:17,800
 sight of this very soon. And so,

1268
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:19,800
 would you and your sovereignty, by the power

1269
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,800
 of your spirit at work in our lives, would you just

1270
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:23,800
 remind us, please?

1271
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:25,800
 And would you help us to

1272
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,800
 believe it? Would you help

1273
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:29,800
 us to live it?

1274
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:31,800
 I know that some of you are here

1275
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:33,800
 tonight, and

1276
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:35,800
 that promise is not for you,

1277
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:37,800
 at least not yet.

1278
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:39,800
 You

1279
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:41,800
 don't love God. You haven't yet

1280
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,800
 been called according to His purpose

1281
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:45,800
 in the chronological timeline

1282
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:47,800
 that we live in.

1283
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:49,800
 And I'm

1284
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,800
 confident,

1285
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:53,800
 if I may say, that

1286
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,800
 He's calling you.

1287
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,800
 And I hope that

1288
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:59,800
 you would consider giving

1289
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:01,800
 your life to Him, that you would be

1290
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:03,800
 a new creation, that you would change

1291
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:05,800
 the way that you live, really,

1292
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,800
 that He would come in your life and begin to change

1293
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:09,800
 the way that you live, making

1294
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:11,800
 you, chipping away

1295
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:13,800
 in your life that which does not look

1296
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,800
 like Jesus. And you know if that's you.

1297
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:17,800
 You know if that's where you're at. There's going to be

1298
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:19,800
 a team of folks up here that would love

1299
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:21,800
 to talk to you. And if you're here and you're

1300
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:23,800
 asking the question, "Well, how do I know? How can I

1301
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,800
 trust God? How do I know that He's going

1302
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:27,800
 to make it good?" He's

1303
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:29,800
 showed us.

1304
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:31,800
 He's shown us that the

1305
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:33,800
 worst day in history

1306
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:35,800
 we would call Good

1307
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:37,800
 Friday.

1308
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:41,800
 Because He paid for our sins there.

1309
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:45,800
 Because He set us free there

1310
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:47,800
 2,000 years

1311
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,800
 ago. Set us

1312
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:51,800
 free.

1313
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:53,800
 And so we would love to talk with you about that

1314
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:55,800
 if that's where you're at. We would love

1315
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:57,800
 to wrestle with you. This is

1316
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:59,800
 a great, safe place

1317
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:01,800
 for you to ask any questions that you have.

1318
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:03,800
 And if you're sitting in your

1319
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:05,800
 life staring at an ugly

1320
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:07,800
 painting, hold on.

1321
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:09,800
 Wait for it.

1322
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:11,800
 The best is yet to come.

1323
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:13,800
 It ain't over yet.
