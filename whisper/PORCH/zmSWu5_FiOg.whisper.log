[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   All right, how we doing tonight, Porch?
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   Come on.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   Shout out to downtown, shout out to Houston, El Paso,
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   the other locations from around the country that are tuning in
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   to be with us tonight for The Porch Live.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   My name's Daniel Crawford.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   I lead our college ministry here at Watermark and work closely--
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   you're out there, that's cool--
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   work closely with the Porch team,
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   and so it is a joy to be with you guys tonight.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   Generally speaking, I would describe myself as more of a lover than a fighter,
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   but I did get in one fight one time.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   It was during my very prolific high school football career.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   We were sophomores.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   The game ended in somewhat of a controversial manner,
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   and the other team had a problem with that.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   The referees didn't have a problem, but the other team did,
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   and so as we're walking to the locker room,
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   I see our team and their team slowly start to converge on one another
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   until that first proverbial shot is fired, and then it's on, right?
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   And so I'm about two-thirds of the way back.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   I'm kind of surveying the scene.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   We're 16 years old, so some of us look 24.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   Others of us look 12.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   I'm post-puberty, 5'8", and so at this time I look like I'm 12,
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   and I'm like 120 pounds soaking wet.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   And so the survival instincts kick in, and you get one or two things, right?
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   You either fight or flight.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   And so I don't love--I'm not crazy about either of those two options in that moment.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   And so I'm figuring out what to do, and I decide I'm just going to kind of get in there
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   and kind of start like shoving people around a little bit
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   and maybe grab somebody by the back of the pads.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   That's illegal, but the referees have no more power anymore,
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   so I'm going to do some of that.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   And so I do that, and I'm kind of letting gravity work, and things are going well.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   I am gaining confidence.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   My confidence is becoming perhaps arrogance,
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   and in my arrogance something starts to swell in me,
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   and I'm overcome with this desire.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   And before I know it, I pop that helmet off, and I'm ready to go.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   And then not three seconds later, I get popped in the mouth is what I get.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   And so I look around to see who did it,
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   and then to my even further embarrassment, I realize I didn't even get punched.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Like my buddy who was wearing his helmet got shoved into me,
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   and it hit me in the mouth.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   So I get to go to school the next day with a fat lip.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   The fight actually made the news, and so people knew what it was.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   I totally said that I got into a fight,
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   and you should see the other guy that he was in way worse condition than I was,
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   which is not true.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   But afterwards, as I just got to think by myself, I'm like,
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   "Man, why would I take my pads off?
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Like why would I remove my helmet?
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Like the things that I just wore for an entire football game
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   that are scientifically engineered to protect me from harm,
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   when it's going down, I take it off.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   What was I thinking?"
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   And I suffered for it.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   And so as a man who has navigated his 20s
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   in close proximity to other people navigating their 20s,
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   here's what I know is that most of us in the room tonight
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   are kind of like me in that story,
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   where we realize we're coming up against adversity in different ways.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   It feels like we're in a fight,
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   and we are trying to go to battle without any sort of armor whatsoever.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   And we have suffered for it, and we will continue to suffer for it.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   The challenge is that we don't realize what is causing our anxiety,
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   what is killing our relationships,
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   what is driving our addictive behaviors,
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   and what is enslaving us to this sin in our life as we struggle.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   We don't realize that we are at war,
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   and that many of us are losing in this war
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   because we're not putting on the protective armor
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   that God has graciously provided for us.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   We're feeling beat up.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   We're feeling overwhelmed.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   But it doesn't have to be that way.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   And so my hope tonight is that we'll leave this room encouraged,
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   that we will continue in this series that David kicked off last week
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   that is called "The Unseen,"
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   and that specifically tonight,
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   as we're reminded that we have an unseen enemy,
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   we're going to learn how to fight in this unseen war.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   And so I'm going to reread real quick where David was,
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   and then we're going to keep going.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   But verses 10 through 12, this is in Ephesians chapter 6.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   If you have your Bible, you can turn there.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   Verses 10 through 12 said this,
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   "Finally be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   Put on the full armor of God
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   so that you may take your stand against the devil's evil schemes.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   For our struggle is not against flesh and blood,
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   but against the rulers, authorities, and powers of this dark world,
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms."
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   And so we're going to pick up with verses 13 through 20.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   And my hope is that tonight we're going to learn
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   how to fight in this unseen war.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   Specifically, we're going to see three things.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   We're going to see that we're all a part of this unseen war.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   We're going to see that we must prepare for this unseen war.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   And we're going to see that we must pray
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   in the midst of this unseen war.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   Let's dive in.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   Verse 13.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   "Therefore put on the full armor of God
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   so that when," not if, "when the day of evil comes,
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   that you may be able to stand your ground
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   and after that you have done everything to stand."
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   So Paul is saying there is a war going on,
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   that our engagement in being affected by this war is inevitable,
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   and that it is not a given that we will stand,
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   that we are at risk of being knocked down.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   So the first point tonight is that we are part of an unseen war.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   And so when I even say that, like if you're like me,
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   it's almost like, man, that's almost kind of hard to believe.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   Sounds a little like Lord of the Rings-ish,
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   like Hogwarts style.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   I did not attend Hogwarts.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   I wish I would have attended Hogwarts.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   I didn't go there.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   But I think it's because of just like where we are.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   Like being in America, we know that like the Republicans
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   and the Democrats don't seem to have very nice things to say
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   about each other.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   We know that there still remains some bad blood
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   between T. Swift and Katy Perry, apparently.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   And so, and as far as real war goes,
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   like we're used to rumors of war,
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   like North Korea might fire a missile at us or somebody else.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   We're used to reports of war about what ISIS is up to
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   over in the Middle East, far, far away from here.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   But it doesn't feel like we are actively engaged in real warfare.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   So even just like, if you just think through
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   like the last seven days, what did I do in the last seven days?
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   I went to work.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   I went and worked out.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   I went out with my boys.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   I watched, caught up on a couple shows,
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   stayed current with my social media feeds.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   Like all of that feels routine and ordinary and mundane.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   None of that feels threatening or dangerous.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   But I think the reality is that those things can be dangerous.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   Clint Bruce is a member here at Watermark.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   Clint also happens to be a Navy SEAL.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   And so he also happens to now train Navy SEALs.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   So this is something that Clint said.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   I want you to listen to this.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   He said, "To come home from war
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   "and believe that I was not at war anymore
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   "was very dangerous.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   "And so I needed to surround myself with people
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   "who understood that we were at war,
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   "and that this war is different,
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   "that there's no bullets or bombs,
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   "but there's temptation, there's alcohol,
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   "there's laziness, lust, materialism.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   "There's all of these other things
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   "that are as or more dangerous than a bullet."
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   Close quote, Navy SEAL.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   Physically, we are in the very prosperous,
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   very comfortable United States of America,
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   but the truth is that spiritually,
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   Scripture would say that this is the Middle East.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   The threats of bombs and wars,
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   catastrophes and victims lies all around us all the time.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   And when we think, when life seems most comfortable,
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   we might very well be at our most susceptible to attack.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   And so looking back at the last seven days,
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   looking forward to the next seven days,
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   you will go back to work,
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   but you will also be going to war.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   You're gonna be going to war with selfish ambition.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   You're gonna be tempted to chase money and comfort,
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   power and prestige, moving up the corporate ladder,
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   materialism, careerism.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   You may choose to go out to the bars,
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   but you're also gonna have a battle waiting for you there.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   There's gonna be temptation.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   Substance abuse, impaired judgment,
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   and a morning after routine that consistently has guilt
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   and has regret.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   And what was I thinking and why did I do that again?
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   You'll probably scroll through your social media
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   and depending on who or what you follow,
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   my guess is that your feed may end up feeding your insecurities
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   and that you're gonna get caught in the comparison trap.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   That it's gonna spark FOMO, that it's gonna spark jealousy,
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   that you're then gonna turn around
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   and try and illustrate how beautiful
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   and how awesome your life is in return,
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   when in reality, you're miserable, you're lonely,
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   you want somebody else's life,
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   and you're putting on a front.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   That is a battle and it is taking victims.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   So do not be deceived, friends.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   We are all part of an unseen war,
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   but God has not left the Christian unprotected and unarmed.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   Let's keep reading.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   Verse 14, "Stand firm then with the belt of truth
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   "buckled around your waist,
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   "with the breastplate of righteousness in place
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   "and with your feet fitted with the readiness
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   "that comes from the gospel of peace.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   "In addition to all of this,
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   "take up the shield of faith
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   "with which you can extinguish
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   "all of the flaming arrows of the evil one.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   "Take the helmet of salvation
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   "and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God."
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   Our second point tonight is that we must prepare
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   for this unseen war.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   And so you may read that description
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   and it's like, dude, armor.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   It's like, I've never been anywhere near armor.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   I watched some Heath Ledger movies back in the day, I guess,
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   but like closest I've ever gotten to armor is under armor.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   Right?
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   And that's because when we think of soldiers,
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   when we think of war, we think about a picture of Clint.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   We think about camouflage.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   We think about rifles, maybe some night vision goggles.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   But to the Ephesians back in the first century AD,
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   this is smack dab in the middle of the Roman empire.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   And so this is what it would look like
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   when somebody was going to war.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   And so Paul intentionally highlights,
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   he grabs and draws attention
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   to these different individual pieces of armor.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   And I wanna unpack them together
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   because each piece I believe he chose strategically
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   and they represent a piece of God's strength
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   that he offers to believers
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   as we live out our faith in Christ.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   The other thing I want us to notice,
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   and I think this is really important.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   This gripped me as I studied this text this week,
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   is that he's writing to Christians, right?
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   This is a church in Ephesus and he says,
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   "Put on the armor of God,"
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   which that would imply that even if we're believers,
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   we're not popping out of bed in the morning
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   ready to go to war.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   We got to put on these different pieces of armor
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   so you could really do a sermon on each one.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   I'm gonna go quickly through them.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   And so I would encourage you to dig into that later.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   But first we got the belt of truth.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   And so I know what you're thinking.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   It's like, that's pretty straightforward.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   I got a belt and that's the truth.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   It's right there, Calvin Klein.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   And these belts were like thick leather.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   Like they really tied the entire suit of armor together.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   Several of the other pieces would connect to the belt.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   It was the centerpiece of armor for battle.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   And so he starts with the belt
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   and he says that it represents the truth.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   The truth holds everything together.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   There is absolute truth.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   And it is absolutely critical that we know the truth
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   and that we wrap our lives in it before we do anything else.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   So we'll look into that a little bit more
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   when we get to the sword.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   I'm gonna keep moving.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   Next is the breastplate of righteousness.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   A typical soldier would have this chest plate
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   made out of bronze or some sort of a thick metal.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   And that's pretty straightforward.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   It was to guard and to protect the vital organs,
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   most vital of which was guarding the heart.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   And so Paul says that our breastplate
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   in the Christian life is righteousness.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   That we are to put on righteousness
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   and protect our hearts with it.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   And so Proverbs, Solomon was a king
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   way back in the day in Israel.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   He wrote the Proverbs,
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   a lot of good nuggets of wisdom in there.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   And he literally out of all of it, he says,
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   "Hey boys, listen, come here.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   "If you're gonna remember one thing I say
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   "and forget all of this other gold, listen to this."
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   Proverbs 4.23 says, "Guard your heart above all else
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   "for it determines the course of your life."
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   Okay, so guard my heart, put on righteousness.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   Cool, how do I do that?
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   What does that look like tangibly?
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   And to put it really simply,
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   here's how I think you know that you are guarding your heart.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   You are guarding your heart if you are really, really picky
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   about what you let in to your life.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   And so this may be your story.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   This may be what putting on the breastplate
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   of righteousness looks like for you is,
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   man, I had to stop watching "The Bachelorette"
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   because I'd find myself planning 17 weddings in my head
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   after the second date.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   And I just made the decision instead,
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   man, I'm just gonna pray for my future spouse
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   if the Lord would have me have a future spouse.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   And that's what I need to do.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   That's me putting on the breastplate.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   Man, I had to drop "The Game of Thrones"
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   even though it's like the best thing going
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   because I could not get the images out of my head.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   And I talked with community
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   and I just decided it had to be a hard and fast thing.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   If there are topless women involved, I'm out on it
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   'cause I struggle with that.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   That's gonna drive me in other ways
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   that I don't want to be driven.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   You may think he's straight up killing the game right now,
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   but I know more Drake verses than I know Bible verses.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   And these are two very different views on life
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   and what the good life looks like, right?
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   There's very different counsel on good living
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   from those two sources.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   And so you're not wicked if you bump Drake
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   and hop in your car right after this,
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   but you may not be able to do that, may not be helpful.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   Here's a personal one for me is with fantasy sports,
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   guys, listen, I would spend more time preparing
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   for my draft than my job.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   All right, this is before I worked here, don't judge me.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   But I'd spend more time like work in my roster
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   than talking to my wife.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   And just like, think about that,
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   like a fictitious sports matchup
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   with one of my idiot friends
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   consumed more heart capacity that week than my bride did.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   And that's crazy to me.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   So I can't play fantasy football anymore,
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   which kills me 'cause I love it.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   When we put on the breastplate,
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   we don't follow the longings of our heart,
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   we inform our hearts.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   We are very, very careful about what we consume
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   in the pursuit of righteousness.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   Next, he talks about putting on shoes
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   that are ready with the gospel of peace.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   A soldier's battle shoes would have like nails
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   or studs in the bottom, think cleats, think gospel cleats.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   And so those would help you dig in, keep your balance,
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   keep you from getting pushed backwards
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   and help you drive forward into enemy territory.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   And so he says that these cleats represent
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   the message of the gospel,
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   that the beauty of the gospel message
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   puts you in a ready position so that you are secure
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   because you're resting in your identity in Christ
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   and not your own performance and not your own works.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   You are firmly planted in him.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   Remembering who you were apart from Christ.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   Remembering how he reached down and pursued you
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   and saved you and how life has been so much different
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   and so much sweeter since then.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   When I preach the gospel to myself every day
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   that we just sang in those songs,
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   nothing keeps me grounded like that.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   Next, he says the shield of faith.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   Don't think Captain America, red, white, and blue,
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   Frisbee disc, cool thing, right?
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   Roman shields, these things were massive.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   They were like car doors that you could literally hide behind
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   and it would cover you.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   It would be a full on protective blanket
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   and it was the primary barrier between you
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   and the attacks of the enemy.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   As he had said, the flaming arrows of the evil one.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   That was a popular military tactic back then.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   So he says the shield that blocks those fiery arrows
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   represents our faith.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   That like a shield, our faith is a protective barrier
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   between us and the enemy's attacks.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   Simply put, faith, it's like, how would you,
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   I've heard that, how would you even define that?
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   Here's, I would just strip it down to this.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   Faith is just believing who God is,
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   that he is who he says he is
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   and that he's going to do what he said he's going to do.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   That he's good, that he loves you, that he cares,
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   that he only gives good gifts,
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   that he does not make mistakes.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   That is a mighty shield
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   that we have the opportunity to hide behind.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   Without it, we've seen the devastation that it causes.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   We have these stories either personally
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   or in people close to us.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   We have that person who got that diagnosis, right?
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   Mom got cancer, got less than a year to live.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   Cousin goes off to college,
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   starts being around professors that say
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   Christianity is a joke, that the Bible is stupid,
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   picks apart their faith.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   They come back, they're an atheist.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   Their faith is crumbled.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   They did not have the shield of faith.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   Essentially it revealed, and this is where it's so scary,
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   it can reveal an if-then kind of faith.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   If this happens, then I'll believe.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   If this doesn't happen, I'm out.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   So without the shield,
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   we're at risk of having an if-then faith
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   and being taken out.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   But hopefully you've also seen people
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   that have stood their ground
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   against the attacks of the enemy.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   That friend who, like man,
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   she lost her job and got dumped in the same week.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   And it's like, God, she's sad.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   She's okay.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   She's processing, she's like,
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   "Lord, I'm insecure.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   "I'm embarrassed that I got fired.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   "I thought I was gonna marry that guy.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   "Will I be single forever now?
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   "And yet I know that your plans are better than mine.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   "I can trust you when it's hard to trace your hand.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   "I know that I can trust your heart."
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   You have, rather than an if-then faith,
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   an even-if faith,
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   which says, "Even if fill in the blank,
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   "I will stand behind this shield of faith.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   "I will trust that God is good.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   "I will look back on his perfect track record
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   "of faithfulness through the years.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   "In the midst of seasons where I doubted his goodness,
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   "I can see now he was there.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   "He is with me, he is for me, he loves me."
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   Next, the helmet of salvation.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   Everybody knows that the one guaranteed kill shot
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   is the headshot, right?
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   That's gonna take you out faster than anything.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   And so the helmet is perhaps the most important piece
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   of armor, and Paul says that the helmet
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   represents our salvation.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   And so in reading this again,
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   I found it fitting that we talked about
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   the cleats being the gospel message
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   and the helmet being our salvation by grace through faith.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   It's as if they're saying from head to toe,
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   you need to clothe yourself and protect yourself
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   with the message of the gospel,
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   not about what you do to work yourself
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   or become good enough for God or to get to heaven,
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   but about what he has done,
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   how he has showed his faithfulness
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   and his love for you on the cross
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   and said, "It is finished."
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   And now for any person who would by grace through faith
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   turn from their sin and turn to God,
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   there is forgiveness and there is salvation.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   This is good news.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   Let's put on our helmets and with it, let's have assurance.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   And finally, the sword of the Spirit,
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   which he says is the word of God.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   We know what a sword is,
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   I don't have to describe that to you.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   What I do want us to see is it is the only offensive weapon
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   that was listed.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   Did you notice that?
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   All of these other pieces of armor are defensive in nature.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   The sword is the piece where we counterattack
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   and where we strike back.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   And he tells us that the sword,
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   our only weapon is the scriptures.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   Listen, this is why we read the Bible.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   You don't read the Bible to check a box.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   You don't read the Bible to seem holy
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   and tell people that you did.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   You don't read the Bible to become a smarter sinner.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   You don't read the Bible to please God.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   He doesn't love you more when you do or when you don't.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   He just knows that when you don't,
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   you're going to war without a weapon.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   The sword of the Spirit that is the word of God.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   This is exactly what Jesus did himself
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   when he faced his greatest temptation.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   In Matthew 4, you should go look it up and read it.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   He faces off with Satan.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   Three times Satan comes at him
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   with great promises and temptation.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   Three times Jesus replies, Bible verse, Bible verse,
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   Bible verse.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   He knew scripture.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   He wrote it on his heart.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   He articulated it in the moment
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   and he counterattacked when he was enduring temptation.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   So if you want to experience victory,
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   which I know that we all, if there's one thing I know,
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   it's that we want to experience victory
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   from temptation and from sin
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   and from being enslaved to our struggles.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   So if you want victory over that struggle with body image
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   and that eating disorder, you gotta know,
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   I am fearfully, wonderfully made in the image of God.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   Psalm 139.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   If you want victory over that porn struggle,
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   that really is a daily habit,
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   you gotta know 2 Timothy 2,
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   flee from sexual immorality and pursue righteousness.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   You gotta do that in those moments of temptation.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   If you're feeling cursed, I'm 29 and single.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   What's up with that?
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   You gotta know Matthew 7.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   God only gives good gifts to his children.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   In Romans 8, he is working all things together
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   for his glory and our good.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   That is not a curse.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   If you're wondering, do I take him back again,
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   even though he kind of says that he's a Christian
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   and yet he's constantly putting us in situations
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   where we're failing in sexual sin,
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   I would say that's not a good idea.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   I would say do not be unequally yoked.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   2 Corinthians 6.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   As we have seen, we are all part of an unseen war
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   that we must equip ourselves and prepare
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   to stand in the battle.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   We have been given protection, we've been given a weapon
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   and we have one more resource at our disposal
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   that is absolutely critical.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   So verse 18, before we finish up,
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   "And pray in the spirit on all occasions
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   with all kinds of prayers and requests.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   With this in mind, be alert,
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   always keep on praying for all the Lord's people.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   Pray also for me that whenever I speak,
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   words may be given me so that I will fearlessly make known
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   the mystery of the gospel
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   for which I am an ambassador in chains.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   Pray that I may declare it fearlessly as I should."
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   A third and final point is that we must pray
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   in this unseen war.
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   We must pray in this unseen war.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   Verse 18, it says, "Pray in the spirit."
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   And so just real quick, how do I pray in the spirit?
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   What does that mean?
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   I'll just say there is no evidence
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   that that indicates some sort of a prayer language,
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   some sort of an angelic language that's not English.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   There's no evidence that that's what that means.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   I believe that praying in the spirit,
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   if you wanna pray in the spirit, do this.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   Pray for God's will,
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   which is always consistent with God's word.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   Pray for God's will,
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   which is always consistent with God's word.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   Because here's what we're doing.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   Here's why this is so important,
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   is that what we're doing when we come before the creator
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   in the heavens of the earth, we're saying, "You are that.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   I am not the God of my own universe."
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   It is a posture of humility.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   It is a posture of dependence.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   There is an unavoidable connection
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   between prayer and dependence, and it is paramount.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   Because here's the truth, this whole spiritual war,
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   this whole thing that we're talking about, it's not hard.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   This spiritual war, it's not difficult.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   It's impossible.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   It is impossible without God
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   and without being fully dependent on the Lord
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   to strengthen us, to provide for us.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   We need him every hour of every day.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   We need him.
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   John Piper said it like this.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   "Prayer is not a domestic intercom."
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   This is so good.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   "Prayer is not a domestic intercom
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   where we can call up the butler and order room service
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   and get the thermostat adjusted.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   Prayer is a wartime walkie-talkie."
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   We are all at war.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   We have been given a mission,
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   and we have access to the God of angel armies.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   How crazy is that?
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   That we can pray to him and that he cares
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   and that he listens and that he wants to help us,
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   that he wants to equip us.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   So here's what this allows us to do.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   You can say, "God, I am struggling again
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   with comparison and with body image.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   Will you help me remember
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   that I am fearlessly, wonderfully made?
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   God, I'm struggling again.
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   Pornography is eating me alive.
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   Will you help me to flee from sexual immorality
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   and to pursue your righteousness instead?
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   Father, singleness is stealing my joy again every week.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   Will you help me trust that you are at work in all things,
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   that you only give good gifts,
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   that your plans are better than my plans,
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   that you don't make mistakes,
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   that your timing is perfect, that I can trust you?"
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   And honestly, this is a big one for me.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   Fear of man.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   Galatians 1 would say, "Am I trying to please man
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   or am I trying to please God?"
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   And just to be really vulnerable with you,
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   as I prepared to be with you guys this week,
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   one thing that the enemy was throwing at me
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   over and over and over again,
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   thoughts that occurred over and over and over again is,
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   "I wonder what these people are gonna think about me.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   I wonder what, when they get in their cars
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   to drive home with their friends,
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   I wonder what they're gonna say about Daniel Crawford."
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   And as I thought about that more, "Are they gonna like me?
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   Are they gonna think I'm funny?
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   Are they gonna think I'm awful?"
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   That started to mess with me so bad.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   And then that's when people came alongside me
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   with the word of God that just says,
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   "Hey, the only thing you got, bro,
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   the only thing you've got is the word of God.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   The only thing you can do on the front side
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   is to pray for this message,
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   that the Spirit would show up,
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   that His truth would come through loud and clear."
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   And so here's what I hope tonight.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   I hope that you remember what I've said,
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   and I hope that you forget that I ever said it,
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   and that it's as if I was never even here.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   So to close, we are all part of an unseen war.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   We must prepare for this unseen war
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   and that we must pray in this unseen war.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   So it's the end of August.
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   Fall is almost here.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   Fall is perhaps my favorite season for a few reasons.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   One is that it's slowly not gonna be 150 degrees anymore.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   The other is that another school year fires up,
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   and with another school year comes
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   another football season, am I right?
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   Got college game days.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   Get to see the Aggies go 6-0,
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   and then totally drop four out of the next five.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   Crush my soul year after year.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   Right now everybody's undefeated, right?
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   And so a lot of things could happen.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   We don't know what could happen,
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   but here's what I would probably say.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   I would guarantee I'd put money on this.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   Won't happen.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   And if it does, it'll go viral,
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   is that you won't see a quarterback
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   jogging out onto the field to go get under center
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   without being completely protected in full pads.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   Like if you don't have cleats,
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   you're gonna lose your footing, slip around,
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   maybe get stepped on by another cleat.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   If you don't have shoulder pads, hello cracked ribs,
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   hello broken collarbones.
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   You get sent to the side,
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   like if your helmet even comes off accidentally,
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   you like get sent to timeout,
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   you have to sit out for a play,
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   like that's a big deal, nobody would do that.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   There probably won't be any swords, and that's okay,
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   and so that's where the illustration
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   breaks down a little bit.
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   But you get the point, which is this,
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   that football armor has been literally
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   scientifically manufactured and engineered
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   to protect those athletes,
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   and that it is a full set, it is a package deal.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   To go out with some of it, but not all of it,
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   is not wise, and it leaves you vulnerable,
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   and it leaves you susceptible to attack.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   So my prayer for us is that we would wrap
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   our lives in the belt of truth.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   That you would guard your heart
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   with the breastplate of righteousness,
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   that you would plant your feet into the ground
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   with the message of the gospel of grace.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   You would reject the lies of the evil one
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   with the shield of faith,
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   that you would feel completely secure
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   as you wear the helmet of salvation.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   That you would fight back with the sword of the spirit,
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   which is the word of God,
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   and that you would constantly use prayer
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   as your wartime walkie talkie.
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   Let me do that for us now
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   as we go to war together this week.
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   Father, we just confess our brokenness,
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   Lord, we confess our need for you.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   We confess that we are prone to wander,
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:01.240]   to wander, that we are prone to go to war on our own strength, not depending on yours,
[00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:08.040]   and that it does not go well with us. God, I pray that we would be a people marked by humility,
[00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:14.920]   marked by dependence, marked by prayer, marked by those who would put on the full armor of God,
[00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:20.920]   that you love us, that you are with us, that you care, that you are good,
[00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:27.320]   that you are who you say you are, that you will do what you said you are going to do,
[00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:34.920]   and that you can be trusted. We pray all that in Christ's perfect name, amen.
