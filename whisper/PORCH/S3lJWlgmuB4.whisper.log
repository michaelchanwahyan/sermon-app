[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:34.540]   Man, I'm gonna start by reading the verses that'll give us a little bit
[00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.840]   of direction for what we're gonna talk about tonight.
[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.820]   This comes from Matthew chapter 14 verses 22 through 36.
[00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:42.500]   It says this.
[00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.740]   Immediately, Jesus made his disciples get into the boat and
[00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.420]   go ahead of him to the other side while he dismissed the crowd.
[00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.820]   After he had dismissed them, he went up a mountainside to pray by himself.
[00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.660]   Later that night, he was there alone and the boat was already a considerable
[00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.580]   distance from land, buffeted by the waves because the wind was against it.
[00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.940]   Shortly before dawn, Jesus went out to them.
[00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.220]   His disciples walking on the lake.
[00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.140]   When the disciples saw him walking on the lake, they were terrified.
[00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.180]   It's a ghost, they said, and cried out in fear.
[00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:21.500]   But Jesus immediately said to them, take courage, it is I.
[00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.300]   Don't be afraid.
[00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.700]   Lord, if it's you, Peter said, tell me to come out on the water.
[00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:27.580]   Come, he said.
[00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.740]   Then Peter got down out of the boat and he walked on water and came towards Jesus.
[00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.740]   But when he saw the wind, he was afraid and he began to sink.
[00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.020]   And he cried out, Lord, save me.
[00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.780]   Immediately, Jesus reached out his hand and he caught him.
[00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.460]   You of little faith, he said.
[00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:44.220]   Why did you doubt?
[00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.180]   And when they climbed into the boat, the wind died down.
[00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:54.460]   Then those who were in the boat worshipped him, saying, truly, you are the son of God.
[00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.500]   I'm gonna start by praying.
[00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:03.620]   But if we could, if friends in the room and friends in Fort Worth and
[00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.420]   friends in Houston would just spend a second first, I'm gonna ask that you
[00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.780]   would just pray right now by yourself alone, that you would pray for our city.
[00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.300]   You would pray for the families of officers.
[00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.700]   You'd pray for all those who have lost loved ones.
[00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.500]   And you'd pray for me in this message.
[00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:30.700]   Because honestly, I feel like I have a mixture of emotions and
[00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.540]   I'm afraid that's not gonna come out.
[00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.820]   Clear or helpful as we just navigate the storm and
[00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.940]   what we do in the storm as believers in Jesus together.
[00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:50.260]   No matter our background, the color of our skin, where we're from.
[00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.580]   And so, would you take a moment and pray and
[00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.500]   then I'm gonna close this and we'll pray and we'll dive in.
[00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:04.500]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:12.660]   Father, would you help us?
[00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.020]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:21.700]   Would you heal your church, your bride?
[00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.020]   Would you unite us?
[00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:31.460]   Would we be a portrait to a watching world of love and
[00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:37.260]   forgiveness, of being considerate of the feelings,
[00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.820]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:46.060]   Experiences, circumstances that others are going through.
[00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.620]   Would you make us humble, Lord?
[00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:50.660]   Would you make me humble?
[00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.140]   Would you help this message?
[00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.940]   And pray for Mike Smith, pray for the communities and
[00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.260]   families who right now don't have their father coming home to kiss him.
[00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.860]   Good night.
[00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:09.020]   For men in other states who won't be able to go home and
[00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.980]   kiss loved ones goodnight or hug them or see them again, Lord.
[00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.220]   We just mourn the loss of life in a hard week.
[00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:24.580]   And even now, Lord, would you help us to love one another?
[00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.620]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.660]   Whatever our community that we're from, help us to be sensitive,
[00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.860]   help me to be sensitive, heal any racism in my heart.
[00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.540]   Heal the racism that honestly exists in all of our hearts,
[00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.940]   regardless of the color of our skin, would you make us more like Jesus?
[00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.380]   Help this message to come out clearly, Lord.
[00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.420]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:49.660]   And may your body be strong.
[00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:55.620]   May the things that divide our world not be present in this place.
[00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.020]   Because as one of my pastor friends who was black said this past week,
[00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.740]   when it comes to the church, the most important color is not red, yellow, black,
[00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:08.980]   or white, or yellow, black, or white, but it is the color red.
[00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:13.740]   Symbolizing the blood of Jesus that unites us all.
[00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:18.140]   And so Lord, would you help us?
[00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:22.060]   In Jesus's name, amen.
[00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:34.380]   Man, it has just been such a hard week, and for so many reasons, and so many ways.
[00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:38.980]   And we were gonna start tonight, and I was gonna go another direction with another
[00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:44.380]   story, and I was like, man, I just, I didn't wanna start with this story of me
[00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:49.260]   being in a boat and all those, and that we normally would, just 'cause it's like,
[00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.660]   man, there's a storm we're in right now.
[00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:54.980]   You don't need an illustration.
[00:05:54.980 --> 00:06:00.260]   And I hope tonight that as the body of Christ, we'll be able to come together and
[00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.860]   look at what we do in the middle of the storm.
[00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:07.460]   And by storm, I mean the storm that's hit our city, not outside in the weather.
[00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.620]   I mean the fact that there was a shooting on Thursday night.
[00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:14.740]   I mean that it seems like racial tensions are more amplified than they've ever been
[00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:16.740]   before.
[00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:19.940]   And what does the body of Christ do?
[00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:23.300]   Because the body of Christ is a place where there is no grounds for racism,
[00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:28.100]   there's no grounds for hatred, but there is grounds to love one another, to listen
[00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:31.620]   to one another, and to care for one another.
[00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:34.180]   And so tonight, we're gonna look at that.
[00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:41.540]   This morning, even today as a staff, it has just been such a growing in my own heart the
[00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:46.020]   last few days, and even today as we got together as a staff for staff prayers we do on
[00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:49.860]   Tuesday mornings, and we were sharing in mourning.
[00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:59.780]   Mike Smith was a police officer who served on Tuesday nights, and he died, and gave his
[00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:03.620]   life on Thursday night in the middle of the protest.
[00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:06.980]   And he was a member here, he was amazing.
[00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:11.460]   And so we mourned that, and we mourned that, and more than that, we just mourned the
[00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:16.820]   division and the pain that exists in the black community.
[00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:19.940]   One of the black guys on our staff just shared, "This is what's been going on in my
[00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:22.260]   heart the past few days."
[00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:30.020]   And it just grieved my heart, and made me wanna go, "Man, I wanna know how I can love
[00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:31.220]   you more."
[00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:36.340]   Another police officer on our staff, we have a police officer on our staff who shared,
[00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:45.940]   and he just talked about the pain that the police community, which is not believers on
[00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:50.900]   a massive scale, is walking through.
[00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:54.500]   And we'll talk about a little bit more even specifically about some of the things they
[00:07:54.500 --> 00:08:02.980]   said towards the end of the message, but it just felt like this is a time where in the
[00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:07.220]   midst of the storm, believers need to know who to turn to, what to look at, what to focus
[00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:10.660]   on, because so many things are pulling for our attention.
[00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:14.900]   You go online, and you look and watch the news, and there's a million opinions, there's
[00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:20.740]   a million things and voices that are fighting to speak into your life, and to speak into
[00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:24.660]   my life, and to grab our attention and get our focus.
[00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:29.060]   And if it wasn't enough, just the voices, the circumstances in our world, the tragic
[00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:34.180]   events that took place in Louisiana and Minnesota, and not only just in our own nation, outside
[00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:37.580]   of this country, and all these different things that are focused, are pulling and fighting
[00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:38.580]   for our attention.
[00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:39.580]   And so where are we gonna focus?
[00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:45.860]   And tonight, I wanna talk about the idea of the church focusing on Jesus, what that actually
[00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:49.100]   looks like, and why that matters, and how we can actually do that.
[00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:54.140]   Because I think inside of that, we will find the remedy and the answer to the problems,
[00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:55.140]   to the solutions.
[00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:58.420]   We'll begin to find a place where we can begin to move in the direction of healing, as we
[00:08:58.420 --> 00:08:59.420]   focus on Jesus.
[00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:00.820]   So that's what we're gonna talk about tonight.
[00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:03.420]   We're gonna be in Matthew chapter 14.
[00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:07.020]   If you have a Bible, we just read it, you can flip open to Matthew chapter 14, as we
[00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:09.540]   continue this series, AD.
[00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:15.180]   AD is really a series all about encounters with Jesus, people who have these different
[00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:20.940]   encounters with Christ, and the ways that he steps in and he impacts the world.
[00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:25.980]   And we're doing it because we know that the most powerful thing for any of us to experience
[00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:29.100]   is to encounter Jesus.
[00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:31.380]   In doing so, we're forever changed.
[00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:35.220]   And the more that we encounter him, and the more fully we encounter him, we're forever
[00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:36.220]   changed.
[00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:37.220]   And so that's why we're doing the series tonight.
[00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:41.540]   We're looking at the encounter that Christ has with his disciple Peter on the water.
[00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:44.940]   It's a very famous story, if you're familiar with it.
[00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:51.580]   And I think inside of it, we are given a metaphor, a picture of how we are to face the storms
[00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:55.100]   of life that are coming for all of us, that exist for all of us, one that we're in right
[00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:56.340]   now as a city.
[00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:59.900]   How does the church face the storms of life?
[00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:01.100]   Where are we to look?
[00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:07.500]   And so inside of this story, which I believe with all my heart was preserved, to be a metaphor
[00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:10.060]   for what you and I are to do in the storms of life.
[00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:14.100]   What happens when we have faith and look towards Jesus, and what happens when we don't.
[00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:15.100]   And so we're going to look at that.
[00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:16.100]   We'll start in verse 22.
[00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:19.460]   If you have a Bible, you can flip open to the very first gospel.
[00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:26.660]   Matthew, if you hit Mark, Luke, John, or anything ends, Corinthians, Romans, Philippians, flip
[00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:28.860]   back and you'll hit Matthew, and we'll be in chapter 14.
[00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:35.300]   What happened, or what context we're in, is Jesus just fed 5,000 people.
[00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:38.180]   In fact, before that, he had just lost his cousin, John the Baptist.
[00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:39.820]   John the Baptist was cousins with Jesus.
[00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:40.820]   They were close.
[00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:42.200]   John ends up dying.
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:46.500]   And so Jesus is going through the grieving process of losing someone he loved.
[00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:49.900]   And he goes up to the mountain to pray and to have some time alone with his guys to just
[00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:50.900]   grieve.
[00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:53.900]   And all of a sudden, this huge crowd shows up, and they stay there, and they want Jesus
[00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:54.900]   to minister to them.
[00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:57.220]   And they stay long enough to where he just says, "Man, we got to feed these guys."
[00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:02.340]   And he takes this little kid's Lunchable, and he turns it into food for 5,000 men, and
[00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:03.340]   really 20,000 people.
[00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:04.340]   Thank you.
[00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:05.340]   Courtesy laugh.
[00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:06.940]   I love it.
[00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:12.140]   And really, after seeing this happen, Jesus says, "Hey, I still want to have some time.
[00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:13.600]   Allow myself to pray to the Father."
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:17.720]   And so he sends his disciples on a boat ride across the lake.
[00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:19.160]   And that's really where we're going to pick it up.
[00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:22.860]   So verse 22, "Immediately, Jesus made the disciples get in a boat."
[00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:23.860]   So he sends them ahead.
[00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:27.020]   "While he dismissed the crowd, then he went up the mountainside to pray.
[00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:28.680]   He was there that night alone."
[00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:29.680]   So the boat goes off.
[00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:33.520]   The disciples are like, "Man, I guess Jesus is going to take another boat, but we'll go
[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:37.000]   ahead and get a room or reservation for wherever we're headed next."
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.200]   So the disciples head off.
[00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:43.300]   "The boat was already a considerable distance from land, buffeted by the wind and the waves
[00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:44.700]   because the wind was against it."
[00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:49.240]   So what just happened is they were traveling along the north coast of the Sea of Galilee.
[00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:52.760]   The only reason that's relevant is it just told us that they were now further and further
[00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:56.000]   away from land, as in they were getting further from their destination.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.560]   As they rode, this storm all of a sudden shows up, begins to push the boat, so they're no
[00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:03.120]   longer making a headway on their journey.
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:05.000]   They're moving in the opposite direction.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.520]   They're rowing and rowing and rowing.
[00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:12.080]   We're told for hours in the other two places that this story is told, which is in John
[00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:13.560]   6 and Mark 6.
[00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:17.900]   If you want to go read those stories later, it's the same story just told from different
[00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:22.240]   disciples who were there or different points of view of people who had experienced it.
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:23.240]   So anyway, so they're in the boat.
[00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:26.440]   They've been pushed along, and so they're rowing in the middle of the night, and they're
[00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:27.520]   like, "Man, what are we doing?
[00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:28.520]   Jesus sent us alone.
[00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:29.760]   Did he know this storm was coming?
[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:31.320]   We're in the middle of the storm.
[00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:32.320]   Wind is going everywhere.
[00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:33.720]   I am so frustrated."
[00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:39.720]   It's the fourth watch of the night, so that means they are rowing so long that a couple
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:41.080]   of them are like, "Guys, I'm done.
[00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:42.220]   I'm going to take a nap.
[00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:43.220]   You guys got it.
[00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:45.080]   You take the first watch, second watch, third watch."
[00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:48.720]   This is the fourth watch, which means it's a couple hours before sunrise.
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:50.680]   Here's what it says.
[00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:56.760]   "Shortly before dawn, Jesus went out to them, walking on the lake."
[00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:57.760]   I love it.
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:59.160]   No big deal, just walking on the water.
[00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:02.920]   "When the disciples saw him on the lake," so it's pitch black at night.
[00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:03.920]   They're rowing in the water.
[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:05.600]   They're going, "Man, we're not making any Bartholomew.
[00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:07.640]   Will you please pick it up a little bit?
[00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:09.160]   They're not making any headway."
[00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:11.760]   All of a sudden, here's what happens.
[00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:16.520]   "When the disciples saw him walking on the lake, they were terrified."
[00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:17.600]   They see this figure.
[00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:20.080]   It's pitch black, beginning to be like, "What is that?
[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:21.080]   Oh my gosh.
[00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:23.240]   Is that like a humongous alligator?
[00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:25.200]   Do they have gators in the Sea of Galilee?
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:28.040]   What is that thing out of the water moving towards us?"
[00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:32.560]   One of them says, "It's a ghost," they said, and they cried out in fear.
[00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:36.800]   Now they're really afraid and probably rowing even harder, being like, "Guys, row quickly.
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:38.240]   There's a ghost over there.
[00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:39.240]   We got to move it."
[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:43.720]   As they look and they see this figure out in the distance, so they're terrified.
[00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:44.720]   I love this next.
[00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:47.360]   I don't know why this is so funny to me, but it is.
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:50.280]   But immediately, "Jesus said to them, 'Take courage.
[00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:51.280]   It is I.'"
[00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:54.560]   The reason that's so funny is that it doesn't tell you who it is.
[00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:57.200]   It's like the ghost has begun to talk to us.
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:59.200]   "Who is I?
[00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:01.080]   Keep moving, guys."
[00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:04.120]   And it says, "Don't be afraid."
[00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:05.520]   So now the wind is blowing.
[00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:07.840]   All of a sudden, this apparition just says, "It is I."
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:12.760]   It literally says, "It is I am," as though it's like, that's not even a complete sentence.
[00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:13.760]   I am who?
[00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:15.840]   Who is this apparition over here?
[00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:16.840]   And they keep rowing.
[00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:18.360]   And then Peter, it clicks.
[00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:19.720]   It's like, that's Jesus.
[00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:20.960]   Maybe you recognize this voice.
[00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:23.760]   I don't know what it was, but they see him walking on water.
[00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:25.480]   And man, I love this even more.
[00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:30.240]   "Lord, if it's you," Peter replied, "tell me to come out to you on the water."
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:33.040]   Here's why I love this.
[00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:37.960]   Because Peter is a little bit like I can be where like any verbal process is in the room
[00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:41.640]   where you're a little bit like, "Hey, I speak and then I think afterwards."
[00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:44.280]   It's a little risky, but it makes life more exciting.
[00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:46.400]   And I can be that way where I'm like, "Dang it.
[00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:47.720]   Why didn't I just say that?"
[00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:53.280]   Peter's like, "If it is you, Lord, well, an imposter ghost would not tell me to come out
[00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:54.280]   of the boat.
[00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:56.880]   If you tell me to come out of the boat, we will believe it's you."
[00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:02.280]   And Jesus just looks at him and he's like, "Come on."
[00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:06.440]   And so Peter begins to get out of the boat and he's looking at Jesus and he's stepping
[00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:09.440]   on the water and he's like, "Oh my gosh, doing the moonwalk.
[00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:10.880]   Boy, this is unbelievable.
[00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:12.120]   I'm walking on water."
[00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:16.040]   And he's moving and he's looking at Jesus and he begins to walk towards him and he takes
[00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:18.160]   the step of faith.
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:24.000]   And the first idea that really comes from this text is that faith comes from focusing
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.400]   on Jesus.
[00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:26.880]   Faith comes from focusing on Jesus.
[00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:28.360]   Like what did Peter do in that moment?
[00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:30.160]   He looked at Jesus, he responded.
[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:31.160]   Here's what faith is.
[00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:35.360]   If you've ever wondered what faith is in the biblical context and what is grace and what
[00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:37.000]   is faith?
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.400]   Grace is when God comes to mankind.
[00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:42.980]   Grace is God in the form of Jesus coming to mankind.
[00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:49.600]   In this story, you could say it's a picture of it where God, Jesus, comes out to the disciples.
[00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:53.760]   Faith is responding to God already coming to you.
[00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:54.920]   Faith is the response of mankind.
[00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:58.280]   If you've ever wondered, as a Christian, when I place my faith, what is that doing?
[00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:02.040]   It is responding to the God who's already reached out to you, who's already come to
[00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:03.040]   you.
[00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:05.840]   And faith comes from focusing on Jesus.
[00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:08.840]   What do I mean by the idea that it comes from focusing on Jesus?
[00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:12.840]   The way that you and I grow our faith, if you've ever said, "I want to grow my faith.
[00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:15.360]   I want to have stronger faith."
[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:19.480]   The way that we do that is not by focusing on faith or like, "Hey, I'm just going to
[00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:20.860]   trust more this time."
[00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:23.520]   It is by focusing on Jesus.
[00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:26.580]   The way that you and I grow our faith is not by focusing on faith.
[00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:28.160]   It is by focusing on Jesus.
[00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:30.220]   What do I mean by that and how does that make sense?
[00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:33.400]   In the same way, faith is the same word for trust in the New Testament.
[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:35.640]   It's the Greek word pistis.
[00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:37.100]   It's the same word for trust.
[00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:39.160]   How do you grow your trust?
[00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:42.560]   Not by focusing on like, "I'm really going to trust you more."
[00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:47.200]   By growing to know the thing that you're trusting and it's trustworthiness.
[00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:51.720]   Like if you're in a dating relationship, like my wife and Callie, when we were dating, I
[00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:57.800]   was enabled to grow in my ability to trust her the more that I got to know her.
[00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:02.120]   The more that I spent time with her and I saw, "Man, she's a trustworthy person."
[00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:04.240]   That enabled me to trust more.
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:05.800]   Not just me being like, "I'm going to choose.
[00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:07.420]   I'm going to really trust this time."
[00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:11.440]   But I was able, not only was she trustworthy, I spent time and I got to know her.
[00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:14.260]   In other words, like if you're in a dating relationship and you're like, you struggle
[00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:18.680]   with trust, the way that you struggle or get over your trust issues is not by just saying,
[00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:19.680]   "You know what?
[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:20.920]   I'm going to really trust more today.
[00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:24.600]   I don't want to look at his phone to see who has he been text messaging.
[00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:26.560]   I'm just going to choose to not, but I really do."
[00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:30.080]   The way that you get over your trust or the way that you get to trust that person is you
[00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:31.760]   get to know them.
[00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:33.480]   You spend time with them.
[00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:36.600]   And if you're dating someone who's trustworthy, you begin to see that.
[00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:43.840]   Side note, if you're dating someone who struggles with trust issue, the worst thing you can
[00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:47.280]   do is to demand trust and be like, "Girl, you are cray.
[00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:49.280]   You have got to start trusting me right now.
[00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:50.280]   Stop it.
[00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:51.280]   I'm going to demand it."
[00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:52.580]   You need to demonstrate trustworthiness.
[00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:56.680]   This is just for free in case you're a dating couple in the room, unrelated to the story.
[00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:58.200]   This has nothing to do with water.
[00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:03.200]   The way that you can work towards healing in that is for you to demonstrate, not demand
[00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:10.920]   trust, but demonstrate trustworthiness and allow by patiently helping them grow to trust.
[00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:14.760]   In the same way, the way that we grow our trust in that context is like, "Hey, I get
[00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:15.760]   to know that person.
[00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:16.760]   I can trust them more."
[00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:20.320]   In the same way with Jesus, the way that we can grow our faith or our trust in him is
[00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:23.160]   by getting to know him more and more.
[00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:24.160]   How do you get to know him?
[00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:26.280]   In other words, if you want to grow your faith, you want to have more faith, you got to know
[00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:28.100]   more of Jesus.
[00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:29.920]   And how do you get to know more of Jesus?
[00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:34.080]   One of the primary ways is by knowing his character, knowing who he is.
[00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:35.240]   How do you do that?
[00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:37.440]   You read scripture.
[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:41.960]   You inform your mind with what the Bible tells us about who Jesus is, who God is, what he
[00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:44.120]   has promised.
[00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:46.440]   And we turn to him, we know him, we look at him.
[00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:50.980]   Inside of the Bible, we find our ability, our trust grows the more that we know who
[00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:51.980]   God is.
[00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:53.040]   How do we know who God is?
[00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:54.920]   By looking at Jesus.
[00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:58.800]   In other words, the more that you know the promises that Jesus has given us, in whatever
[00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:02.640]   circumstances you're going through, you will turn to him and trust him.
[00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:05.600]   You'll be able to say, "Hey, look, I know how this thing ends up going because I know
[00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:07.120]   Jesus wins in the end.
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:10.460]   No matter what he promised, there's going to be trouble in this life, but I know who
[00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:11.460]   he is.
[00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:12.720]   I know that he has overcome the world.
[00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:15.480]   I know that at the end of the day, Jesus wins.
[00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:18.360]   And so I can trust him no matter what's going on right now.
[00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:22.520]   I know that he's a God who says, 'I'm in control,'" so I don't have to be anxious.
[00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:25.720]   That's easier said than done, but I know that that's actually, that's true.
[00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:27.080]   That's what God invites me to.
[00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:28.800]   He's a God that says, "I am a just God.
[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:31.180]   I will give justice to all nations.
[00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:34.000]   There will be a day where all things are made right."
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   And so I can trust him.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.120]   I'm not going to get angry.
[00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:39.540]   I can trust that God is in control because I know him.
[00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:45.800]   I'm able to grow my faith by knowing him more and more.
[00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:50.120]   The way that we grow our faith is by focusing on Jesus.
[00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:53.740]   But what amazed Jesus was not Peter's willingness to step out of the boat.
[00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:55.120]   It was what happened next.
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:56.120]   Here's what happens.
[00:19:56.120 --> 00:20:02.720]   "But when he saw the wind," so Peter is walking on water, "and he looks over at the wind,
[00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:06.640]   in the midst of this storm, and there's choppy waves, and he was afraid.
[00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:11.600]   And he began to sink, and he cried out, 'Lord, save me.'
[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:15.960]   Immediately Jesus reached out his hand, and he caught him, and he said, 'You of little
[00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:21.000]   faith, why did you doubt that Peter's walking on water?'"
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.280]   He stops focusing on Jesus, and all of a sudden, in the midst of his circumstances, he starts
[00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:30.480]   focusing on the wave, despite the fact that it's like, "Peter, you are walking on water.
[00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:32.280]   Why are you afraid of that wind over there?
[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:33.720]   Can you even see the wind?
[00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:35.440]   Can you even see a wave that would scare you?
[00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:37.120]   You're on H2O right now.
[00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:38.120]   Why would you be afraid?"
[00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:39.120]   Because that's just what fear does.
[00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:41.280]   It's irrational, and it grabs hold of him.
[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:44.600]   But the other thing that we see from fear in here is not just it's irrational, we see
[00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:46.440]   where it comes from.
[00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:51.720]   We see where faith moves out and fear moves in, is whenever we begin to focus in on circumstances.
[00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:56.360]   Our second point tonight, so the first point of faith comes from focusing on Jesus.
[00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:58.760]   If you want to grow your faith, you focus on Jesus.
[00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:04.640]   The second idea, we see where fear comes from, is fear comes from focusing on circumstances.
[00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:09.080]   Fear begins to flood in when we lose, and we're no longer occupied with Jesus, what
[00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:12.500]   he says about what we're going through, who he is.
[00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:19.240]   We become focused and narrowed in on our circumstances around us.
[00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:22.800]   And I think he would say to Peter what he would say to us, that you don't conquer fear
[00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:24.400]   by just saying, "I am not afraid.
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:25.400]   I am not afraid.
[00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:26.400]   I am not afraid."
[00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:31.640]   The way that you conquer fear is by focusing on the one who's in control.
[00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:35.040]   Even the fact that Jesus asks him, "Why did you doubt?"
[00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:36.040]   Like think about this.
[00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:39.520]   Like this, for whatever reason, was like really just so bizarre to me.
[00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:41.800]   It's like, and the storm is still going on.
[00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:45.080]   So Peter's sinking in the water, he's getting, "Jesus, help me."
[00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:48.120]   All of a sudden he's going under, Jesus reaches out, he grabs him and pulls him up, and he
[00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:49.120]   says, "Why did you doubt?"
[00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:54.000]   Really, he probably said it like this, because there's storm, wind is going, "Peter, why
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.720]   did you doubt?"
[00:21:55.720 --> 00:22:00.160]   Peter's got to be thinking, "There's a freaking storm around us right now.
[00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:01.360]   What do you mean, why did I doubt?"
[00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:02.360]   I mean, think about that.
[00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:04.720]   It's like, Jesus, why are you even asking that story?
[00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:07.880]   There's a storm, Jesus, and we're walking on water.
[00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:08.880]   People don't walk on water.
[00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:11.280]   Why are you asking me, "Why did I doubt?"
[00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:14.280]   This would be like me, you losing your job, and you being frustrated, and me being like,
[00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:15.280]   "Why are you frustrated?"
[00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:17.840]   And you'd be like, "I just lost my job."
[00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:21.400]   Or your relationship falling apart, and me being like, "Hey, yeah, why are you doubting
[00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:22.400]   God's goodness?"
[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:26.440]   Because I just lost the girl that I thought I was going to marry, why are you asking me
[00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:28.520]   why I'm doubting God's goodness?
[00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:29.520]   That's what's going on.
[00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:33.240]   It's though Jesus sends us the message that he's like, "Look, you are more afraid of that
[00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:36.360]   wave than you are of me."
[00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:39.840]   Like no matter what you and I are going through tonight, I think you would say, "Man, I know
[00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:43.520]   this at such a heart level.
[00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:46.400]   Why are you doubting?"
[00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:48.080]   Like whatever that is in your life.
[00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:50.360]   The answer, not a wave, answer not job.
[00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:53.000]   I don't know if it's like a parent with cancer loss.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:58.200]   All these like crazy things I would think he would say to all of us.
[00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:00.880]   Why would you doubt?
[00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:03.980]   Do you think I'm not in control?
[00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:05.080]   Do you think that I don't love you?
[00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:07.360]   Do you think that I'm not good?
[00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:12.840]   Just like he's saying to Peter, like, "Why are you doubting?"
[00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:17.040]   There's a place that I want to lead all of my followers to, Jesus is saying, where they
[00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:23.000]   can be totally okay on the inside, no matter what is going on on the outside.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:27.560]   There's a place that I think he wants to lead you and lead me to where I can be totally
[00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:30.080]   okay on the inside, no matter what's going on on the outside.
[00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:34.840]   And honestly, like, I just feel hypocritical even talking about that because that feels
[00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:36.160]   so far from me.
[00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:40.600]   I know people that have that type of faith and it like inspires me and I'm like, "Man,
[00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:41.600]   that's amazing.
[00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:42.600]   I'm not there."
[00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:44.320]   I'm like, "That guy is not there."
[00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:47.920]   And like Todd, our senior pastor, we talked about this before, like when Todd got this
[00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:52.520]   cancer on his foot that was malignant and he was like, "You know, I got cancer and you
[00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:54.280]   know, the Lord, he's going to do what he's going to do.
[00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:55.280]   And you know, I trust him.
[00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:56.280]   He's good and he loves me."
[00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:58.620]   And I'm like, "What?"
[00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:01.080]   When my eye hurts, I'm like, "Do I have eye cancer?
[00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:03.400]   Oh my gosh, this is not good."
[00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:06.680]   And I'm like, "That is so far, Lord, will you help me?"
[00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:10.120]   Because I think that wherever you are tonight on that spectrum, he wants to lead all of
[00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:14.640]   us to a place where we go, "Man, Lord, you're in control.
[00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:19.880]   And whatever is going on on the outside, I can trust you and have peace on the inside
[00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:25.240]   because you love me, you're in control, and I'm going to continue to know who you are
[00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:27.020]   and what you've promised.
[00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:31.520]   And this world that is broken will soon pass away as you come back and restore and heal
[00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:33.640]   everything."
[00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:37.920]   And that's the place I think he wants to lead all of us to.
[00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:42.800]   No matter what you are going through, what matters most is what you are looking to.
[00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:43.880]   I'm going to say that again.
[00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:46.120]   No matter what you're going to go through, no matter what you're going through right
[00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:49.720]   now, what matters most is what or who you're looking to.
[00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:52.520]   Like, what are you going to look to in the midst of like, where are you going to turn?
[00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:56.440]   Where are we going to turn as a city in the midst of our pain right now?
[00:24:56.440 --> 00:25:00.000]   Are we going to turn to further division?
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.680]   Where are you going to turn to in whatever storm you're in in the midst of your life
[00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:03.680]   right now?
[00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:04.680]   Are you going to turn to alcohol?
[00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:06.360]   Are you going to turn to codependency in a relationship?
[00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:10.240]   Are you going to turn to the only one who can actually give you peace in the midst of
[00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:12.800]   the storm, which is Jesus?
[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:13.800]   The one who never changes.
[00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:19.200]   The one who was always there, who's in control.
[00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:23.360]   I went not long ago to Mexico on a guy trip.
[00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:26.640]   It was JP and myself and a couple other guys and friends.
[00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:31.280]   We just had this guy trip for an extended weekend where we went and stayed at this like
[00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:33.640]   super questionable resort in Mexico.
[00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:37.680]   It was like, yeah, I'm going to be seeing all this food again in a couple hours.
[00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:39.400]   And we were staying there and it was awesome.
[00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:40.640]   It was kind of a guy trip.
[00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:43.360]   And one of the days we were like, we're going to go deep sea fishing.
[00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:44.360]   I'd never been deep sea fishing.
[00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:45.360]   I was like, this is awesome.
[00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:46.360]   We're going to go out there.
[00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:47.360]   What are we going to catch?
[00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:48.360]   We're going to get shark, marlin.
[00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:49.360]   I don't know what we're going to catch.
[00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:51.200]   It's going to be great.
[00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:53.160]   And so we get ready, we get up that morning, 6 a.m.
[00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:54.840]   We go out, we're sitting on the boat.
[00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:55.840]   It's awesome.
[00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:59.440]   We're fishing for different types of, I'm not a fisherman, so I don't even know what
[00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:00.440]   we fish for.
[00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:01.440]   I'm embarrassed by that.
[00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:02.440]   I'm going to give you my card.
[00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:04.880]   Let me just give it out right here.
[00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:06.480]   And so we're out there fishing and we're hanging out.
[00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:15.880]   And all of a sudden, all of a sudden this, this like wave of nausea hits me like any,
[00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:17.480]   unlike anything else I've ever felt.
[00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:21.440]   Well, I'm like, oh man, I'm, I'm that food that I was talking about, the hotel.
[00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:22.600]   It is, I'll be right back.
[00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:25.220]   And I'm in the, in the bathroom on the boat.
[00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:26.220]   So sick.
[00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:27.220]   I get seasick.
[00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:30.360]   The waves, this storm had actually come up and we're in the midst of like super choppy
[00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:31.720]   stuff and everyone else is fine.
[00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:34.000]   And I'm like, oh man, I am not fine.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.680]   Something is not okay in here.
[00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:36.680]   So I'm in the bathroom.
[00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:37.680]   I'm really sick.
[00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:40.640]   JP comes and gets me and he goes, Hey, look, look, I can tell you what, what you need to
[00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:41.640]   do.
[00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:42.880]   And I'm like, man, I just need to sit here.
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:44.400]   I just need, I just need a moment.
[00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:45.400]   Just need to think.
[00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:47.640]   And he's like, no, come with me out to the edge of the boat.
[00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:50.560]   And I'm like, that does not sound like I'm going to get in the center of the boat, center
[00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:51.560]   of gravity.
[00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:52.640]   That makes sense to me.
[00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:53.640]   And he's like, no.
[00:26:53.640 --> 00:27:02.000]   One of you is like, you pushed me off the boat.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:07.640]   We go out to the edge of the boat and while we're out there, he says, look at the horizon.
[00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:10.520]   I'm like, look at the, what is looking at the horizon going to do?
[00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:11.520]   He's like, look at that.
[00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:12.520]   Just look at the horizon.
[00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:15.640]   If you look at land, if you look at something that does not move, I promise you, you're
[00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:16.640]   going to feel bad.
[00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:17.840]   I'm like, that sounds like a great idea.
[00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:18.840]   Where'd you read that?
[00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:20.360]   Some blog somewhere, your grandma sent you that?
[00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:21.360]   Look at the horizon.
[00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:25.920]   I looked at the horizon and it was like insane how quickly everything began to feel better
[00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:27.420]   inside of my body.
[00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:31.240]   Like everything, despite the fact that we're in this choppy storm, despite the fact I looked
[00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:34.220]   at the one thing that did not move.
[00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:38.360]   And in the midst of the storm, I was able to be okay on the inside, despite the fact
[00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:41.400]   that we were in a storm on the outside in the same way.
[00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:43.640]   That's what we do as believers in Christ.
[00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:49.200]   Like we look at the one who the Bible says is the same today, yesterday, today, and forever,
[00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:53.960]   who never changes, who's the first and last, the alpha and the omega, the one who has said,
[00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:55.700]   I will never leave you nor forsake you.
[00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:57.300]   We fix our eyes on him.
[00:27:57.300 --> 00:27:58.780]   We look to the promises of God.
[00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:01.200]   We look to the character of Jesus revealed in the scripture.
[00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:03.160]   We're like, we look at that in the midst of the storm.
[00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:06.160]   I know what's going on, but I'm going to fix my eyes right there.
[00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:07.280]   I'm going to look towards him.
[00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:08.600]   I'm going to focus in on him.
[00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:12.800]   I'm not going to focus on the circumstances, but I'm going to fix my eyes on him.
[00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:17.320]   And in the same way that that almost immediately began to bring peace, that is the remedy for
[00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:23.960]   experiencing peace in the midst of the storm in this life.
[00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:30.360]   It says this as it finishes up where we explore what happens after Peter, man who just had
[00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:35.680]   to be feeling like, gosh, I cannot believe that that just happened.
[00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:41.320]   I'm like sinking over here in the water failing, and here's what happens next.
[00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:46.520]   Verse 32, "And when they climbed into the boat, the wind died down.
[00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:54.920]   Even those who were in the boat worshiped him, saying, 'Truly you are the son of God.'"
[00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:58.120]   That what happens next is not what I would think would happen where they would get back
[00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:02.640]   into the boat and they would begin to like turn their attention somewhat on Peter.
[00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:04.960]   Like man, Peter, what in the world happened?
[00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:06.280]   You were walking on water.
[00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:07.680]   That was super awkward.
[00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:11.480]   Oh man, you should have just kept looking at Jesus.
[00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:13.720]   Awkward guys, let's just turn the boat around and go back home.
[00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:19.200]   Peter needs to sit the next few days out and really recoup some of his self-esteem that
[00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:20.200]   he just lost.
[00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:21.200]   It doesn't happen at all.
[00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:24.360]   They're not like, "Oh Peter, man, now we know why he called you the rock, because you sink
[00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:25.360]   like a rock, buddy."
[00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:27.160]   None of that happens.
[00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:30.760]   What happens in a moment, they all get in the boat and Peter included, we're told from
[00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:35.480]   the other gospels, all of them turn their attention not on Peter, not on his failure.
[00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:36.640]   Peter doesn't look, "Hey, look at me.
[00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:38.240]   I can't believe I failed God in the moment.
[00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:40.360]   I'm soaking wet because I didn't trust God."
[00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:44.200]   In that moment, none of them turn, they all turn their attention on Jesus.
[00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:45.880]   They all begin to focus on Jesus.
[00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:53.320]   They all look at him and go, "Man, Peter, you are ordinary, but that guy is son of God
[00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:54.320]   right here.
[00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:55.320]   We should all worship him."
[00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:59.320]   They break out into a worship set like Shane and Shane is there on the boat right there
[00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:03.040]   where they're going, "Man, this Jesus is unbelievable."
[00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:07.160]   Even the failure of Peter is not something that leads them to say, "Man, I'm going to
[00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:08.160]   just focus on myself."
[00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:14.040]   Even in failure, it leads them to go, "Man, I am not that great, but that guy is great."
[00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:15.360]   They all begin to worship.
[00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:20.500]   Our third idea from the text is that even in our failure, we focus on Jesus.
[00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:22.960]   We focus on Jesus in our failure.
[00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:24.720]   Maybe I can even go as far as to say this.
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:31.040]   I think your failure can fuel your focus on Jesus.
[00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:35.900]   I think that if you can learn that no matter what the situation is, no matter what shame
[00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:40.240]   or guilt you feel from your past, it can fuel your worship of Jesus.
[00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:42.400]   When you're all of a sudden like, "Man, I cannot believe the things that I've done.
[00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:44.360]   I cannot believe that I made that decision.
[00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:45.600]   I cannot believe I slept with her.
[00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:46.600]   I had that abortion.
[00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:47.600]   I got wasted again."
[00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:51.200]   Whatever that situation was, or as I look back and the things that I've done and I'm
[00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:56.200]   so ashamed of them, even in those moments, it can fuel worship of Jesus.
[00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:57.200]   Because here's what I mean.
[00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:58.640]   "Oh my gosh, I'm a broken sinner.
[00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:01.400]   Thank goodness that I have a savior that came to die for me.
[00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:02.400]   It's not about me.
[00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:03.400]   It was never about me.
[00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:07.640]   The fact that I'm messed up and broken only further testifies to how good God is that
[00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:09.700]   he would save even someone like me.
[00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:12.540]   So even in my failure, I can worship Jesus.
[00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:16.280]   Even when I've blown it, I move to worship Jesus.
[00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:19.800]   We focus on Jesus even in our failure.
[00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:25.920]   All of life we turn and we focus on him."
[00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:31.920]   Even this whole story, I think Peter would say, "Man, this was not about two guys walking
[00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:32.920]   on water.
[00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:35.720]   It was about Jesus, the whole thing."
[00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:36.720]   How do I know that?
[00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:41.080]   Because in Peter's version of these events, he doesn't include his part in the story.
[00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:42.080]   Have you ever thought about that?
[00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:45.160]   Like the book of Mark, the different gospels are written by these different authors.
[00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:49.480]   Mark, we're told from church history, was really co-authored by Peter.
[00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:51.680]   Peter kind of gave him the script and was like, "Hey, and this happened next and this
[00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:52.680]   happened next."
[00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:56.400]   So Mark is kind of like, "Hey, we see it from Peter's point of view."
[00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:57.400]   That's what the book of Mark tells us.
[00:31:57.400 --> 00:32:01.240]   And in the book of Mark, this same story is recorded, but you know what is not in there
[00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:02.440]   when they get to the walking on water?
[00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:04.880]   I want you to think about this.
[00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:07.640]   Peter walking on water.
[00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:09.120]   Why would you not include that, Peter?
[00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:10.120]   It's your book.
[00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:13.480]   I mean, it was kind of like, "Whoa, only two people in history have ever walked on water,
[00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:16.720]   Jesus and you, and you're not going to include that in your own book?"
[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:18.240]   Let me just go on record here and say this.
[00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:27.160]   If I ever walk on water for the rest of my life, every message that I give, every note
[00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:31.360]   that I write, every book, if I ever wrote a book like Peter's help co-authored this
[00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:35.200]   book, I would include, "Oh yeah, this is David, the guy who walked on water."
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:38.800]   If I'm writing a birthday card, "Happy birthday again from David, the guy who walked on water."
[00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:39.960]   I'm including that in everything.
[00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:42.720]   Why would you not include it, Peter?
[00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:45.120]   Because Peter knows like, "This isn't a story about me.
[00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:47.960]   I'm not the focal point of this story.
[00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:49.840]   I mean, if anything, I'm like the failure in this story.
[00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:50.840]   I focus on Jesus.
[00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:52.200]   This story is about Jesus.
[00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:53.500]   Life is about Jesus.
[00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:56.520]   Focus on Jesus," Peter would say.
[00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:03.360]   And what happens next, despite the fact that Peter's wet, and man, I love this, is immediately
[00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:08.400]   we're told by John, the boat, as soon as they get in the boat, the storm stops.
[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:12.820]   And it's like they arrive at the port.
[00:33:12.820 --> 00:33:16.840]   And they arrive and all of a sudden there's this big crowd there and they go to ministering
[00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:18.300]   to people.
[00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:22.000]   In a minute, literally, Peter gets on the boat.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.200]   Jesus, they get on the boat.
[00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:25.360]   Peter just was sinking inside of the water.
[00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:27.640]   Peter is still soaking wet.
[00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:29.700]   And they go to begin to minister to people.
[00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:31.000]   They go to this crowd.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:34.880]   And even the fact that Peter is soaking wet reflects, "Man, what happened to that guy?
[00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:36.120]   Did he fall in the water?"
[00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:37.880]   No, he didn't trust God.
[00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:41.000]   And Peter immediately goes into ministering.
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:46.080]   If you think that your failure is the reason or a reason why God is done with you, that
[00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:50.360]   God can't use you, that God still doesn't want to be a part of your life and have you
[00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:55.200]   be a part of ministering to other people, even Peter's story here testifies to the fact
[00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:58.280]   that it is not our perfection that allows God to use us.
[00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:01.080]   He doesn't use us because he needs us.
[00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:08.120]   He uses us because he wants us and wants us to be a part of his purpose, his mission.
[00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:10.280]   And Peter, the boat touches shore.
[00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:11.960]   Peter's soaking wet.
[00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:14.240]   It gets out and they begin to minister to people.
[00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:21.960]   The Bible tells us that even in our failure, we can point others to Jesus and say, "Man,
[00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:22.960]   look at me.
[00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:23.960]   I'm the wet guy.
[00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:24.960]   I'm the guy who's failures.
[00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:31.080]   And there is one who is the son of God, who does not fall, who does not grow weary, who
[00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:35.400]   does not abandon, who will not leave you, who loves you so much he will die for you."
[00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:38.560]   Even in his failure, he's literally standing to a crowd going, "Look at me.
[00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:39.560]   I'm soaking wet.
[00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:40.560]   Anybody got a towel?
[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:41.760]   But look at Jesus.
[00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:42.760]   This guy's amazing."
[00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:47.400]   And even his failure points or allows him to point and focus his life and others' lives
[00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:49.280]   towards Jesus.
[00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:59.440]   I think this lesson takes more time to learn than just one incident though.
[00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:06.800]   Because in Peter's life, we know that at some point he forgot this.
[00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:15.480]   Peter's life continues and he is a part of maybe the most tragic betrayal in history.
[00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:24.040]   I mean, Peter is Jesus's best friend and Jesus shortly thereafter is arrested and he begins
[00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:25.800]   to be put on trial to be crucified.
[00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:28.000]   And Peter shows up at the trial and he's watching from the back.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.040]   And all of a sudden, these guys come up to Peter and they're like, "Hey, don't you know
[00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:32.040]   this guy?
[00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:33.040]   Don't you?"
[00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:34.040]   And Peter says, "No, I know.
[00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:37.280]   I've never met him before."
[00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:40.560]   And then all of a sudden, this little middle school girl shows up and she's dealing with
[00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:43.040]   acne and she's like, "Hey, don't you know him over there?"
[00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:45.240]   And he's like, "No," to a little middle school girl.
[00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:46.240]   "I'm afraid.
[00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:47.240]   I don't know that guy.
[00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:48.240]   I don't know."
[00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:51.320]   And he denies Jesus his best friend not once, twice, but three different times.
[00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:53.280]   He fails.
[00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:57.280]   And Peter, after Jesus has died and really resurrected, he thinks, "Man, God's done.
[00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:58.880]   He's not going to use me anymore.
[00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:05.760]   I don't know that God could use and would want to use me or needs me anymore."
[00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:08.320]   And the Bible tells us in John 21, what does Peter do?
[00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:13.840]   Because of his failure, he didn't believe that, "Man, even in my failure, I can point.
[00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:14.840]   He's amazing."
[00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:17.820]   It says he goes fishing.
[00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:18.820]   He leaves.
[00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:21.160]   He's the leader of the church at this point.
[00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:22.160]   He's the leader of the disciples.
[00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:26.480]   And he says, "Man, I don't know if God's going to want to use me."
[00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:30.640]   And the Bible tells us that he's fishing on that boat and out of nowhere, Jesus shows
[00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:36.640]   up and he says, "Peter, feed my sheep.
[00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:38.920]   Peter, I'm not done with you yet.
[00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:41.640]   Peter, despite the fact that you failed me, I mean, I don't know what you've done in the
[00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:42.640]   room.
[00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:43.640]   I don't know where you are.
[00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:44.640]   I don't know what to say."
[00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:45.640]   And you're like, "Man, but can God love me?
[00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:47.440]   Because I just feel, I don't feel like he would really love me."
[00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:50.680]   I promise you, whatever you've done is not as bad as Peter.
[00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:55.640]   God in the flesh is on earth and all of a sudden, his best friend in the world betrays
[00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:58.440]   him three times in his worst hour of need.
[00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:03.880]   Like whatever you have done, there's no past that God can't reach out and say, "Even that
[00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:08.600]   past, even that brokenness, I will use to be a part of ministering to a world that needs
[00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:09.600]   it."
[00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:14.200]   And Jesus shows up and says, "Peter, your failure has not ruled you out of being a part
[00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:19.280]   of my kingdom, of my church, of leading here, of ministering in my name."
[00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:24.760]   And he invites Peter and accepts him back into the group.
[00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:31.640]   I think for all of us, we have got to embrace this.
[00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:33.240]   Like I don't know what your past is.
[00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:37.080]   If you are a believer in Jesus, I don't know what you got going on right now, but whatever
[00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:40.640]   that is as the church, as it relates, as we come back to the topic of what's going on
[00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:46.400]   in our city, what's going on in our country, like whatever you're wrestling with, whatever
[00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:50.120]   shame you feel, this is the time where you go, "Look, I'm going to bring it out to the
[00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:51.120]   light.
[00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:52.120]   I don't care who knows.
[00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:53.120]   I don't care what I've done.
[00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:57.160]   I'm going to choose to believe what the scripture says, that God, no matter what I've done,
[00:37:57.160 --> 00:38:00.640]   can accept me, can forgive me, can use me.
[00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:02.480]   And I'm not going to hold onto these things anymore.
[00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:04.200]   I'm not going to drag them and hide them anymore.
[00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:05.200]   I'm going to bring them to light.
[00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:09.960]   I'm going to choose to trust that God who is there is inviting me to be a part of ministering
[00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:10.960]   to a hurting world."
[00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:21.600]   Man, the church, if there's any group on earth that's got to come together right now, that's
[00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:26.000]   got to come and say, "Look, we're going to choose to minister in our brokenness, in our
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   failures.
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   We're not going to be perfect.
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   We're going to be open.
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:33.800]   We're going to be free and we're going to love and extend grace, but we've got to come
[00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:36.000]   together in the world that we're in right now."
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:40.500]   I mean, if not the church, who's going to do that?
[00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:44.680]   I don't know if you look around at culture, what I see all the time is this message of
[00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:46.400]   like, "Hey, we're going to choose."
[00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:47.400]   Hate will not win.
[00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:49.440]   Love will not win.
[00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:52.040]   And that's a great message if it comes from the church.
[00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:53.040]   Here's why.
[00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:55.400]   Because every other group has no foundation they're standing on.
[00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:56.400]   Do you know that?
[00:38:56.400 --> 00:39:00.280]   Every other group that's like, "Hey, and this tragedy, hate will not win the day.
[00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:01.280]   Love will win the day."
[00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:04.000]   They do not stand on a foundation like we have in Christ.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:09.800]   Because we, in the scriptures, through Christian and the Judeo-Christian ethic, we are given
[00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:12.200]   a lens through which we can see the world.
[00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:16.720]   We are told that every single person, red, yellow, black, white, all has dignity in his
[00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:17.800]   sight.
[00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:19.680]   All are worth dying for.
[00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:20.980]   That there is no division.
[00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:23.440]   That all have been created equal in God's eyes.
[00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:25.360]   The church has been given that.
[00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:28.200]   Like any other group, like where else are you going to find that?
[00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:30.000]   You're not going to find that in the teachings of Islam.
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:34.080]   You're not going to find that in this like ethereal kind of, "Oh, everything is God and
[00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:36.640]   all roads lead to God in America."
[00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:38.680]   That is a man-made profession.
[00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:43.960]   The only place where you have the firm foundation that we have in the church is the church.
[00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:50.560]   And we've got to come together.
[00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:59.680]   As we sat this morning and we heard from Jason, is his name, one of the black guys on our
[00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:04.160]   staff, I was like so heartbroken.
[00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:06.640]   He just said, "Man, I'm going to be honest.
[00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:09.480]   I've been scared the last couple of days.
[00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:12.840]   I go out and I'm at the gas station and I'm not scared of police.
[00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:14.320]   I'm scared of like other white people."
[00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:17.600]   And I was like, "Oh my gosh, man."
[00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:19.320]   That like breaks my heart.
[00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:23.960]   And more than anything, I'm sad that I've never extended an arm to someone.
[00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:25.360]   I'll ask that or I didn't know that.
[00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:26.440]   Like that breaks my heart.
[00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:30.720]   I hate that with everything in me.
[00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:35.080]   I hate, like it grieves me to think the ways that honestly, I was sharing this in the green
[00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:39.560]   room that the black community has not felt supported and loved among brothers and sisters
[00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:40.560]   here.
[00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:41.560]   Like that grieves me to the heart.
[00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:46.200]   And even the fact that right now, as I say that, I'm worried about hurting in the black
[00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:47.200]   community.
[00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:53.120]   Like I'm so grieved that we haven't done enough to love and care because all are equal.
[00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:55.280]   There isn't any distinction.
[00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:58.200]   Jesus and the Bible teaches there's neither Jew nor Greek.
[00:40:58.200 --> 00:40:59.720]   There's neither male nor female.
[00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:02.480]   We are all one.
[00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:04.880]   And hearing it was just so grieving for our staff.
[00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:11.480]   And finally, man, it was like, that was helpful to me because for whatever reason it was fresh.
[00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:17.080]   Because I'm like, man, I do not see any racial tension, but knowing that you, because of
[00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:23.800]   the world around us, because of the fabric of just brokenness in American history, have
[00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:28.040]   different things where you may be seeing it through a different filter than I'm seeing
[00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:29.640]   it through.
[00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:31.540]   And it's a filter that is a painful one.
[00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:33.720]   And so I'm just thankful that he would even tell us.
[00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:39.480]   And if you're in the room and that's as black brothers and sisters, man, I'm sorry.
[00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:43.580]   And I want to know, and I would love for you to help us.
[00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:47.820]   Because for us, sometimes we're insensitive because we're going, we just don't know.
[00:41:47.820 --> 00:41:50.700]   We don't have the same fabric and filter that we see it through.
[00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:56.360]   And I'm like, I was crying during worship thinking about that.
[00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:59.780]   Because I'm so sad that that pain exists.
[00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:03.560]   And I hate that.
[00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:07.380]   And then the police officer shared.
[00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:12.380]   And he just said, man, it's been hard because psychologically, it's really hard to be a
[00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:14.540]   police officer.
[00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:23.340]   And he said, every day we go to work and like so many people that we have sworn to protect
[00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:25.820]   with even our life.
[00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:31.940]   They either hate us because they think we hate them.
[00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:35.860]   Or they like, just don't like us because we gave them a speeding ticket when they were
[00:42:35.860 --> 00:42:36.860]   17.
[00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:38.340]   And he said, that's really hard.
[00:42:38.340 --> 00:42:39.880]   It messes with your psyche.
[00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:44.300]   And he just began to talk about the police community and how like, they are wrestling.
[00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:46.860]   He just said like in a lot of the officers, they're just not believers.
[00:42:46.860 --> 00:42:49.820]   So they cope with it in other ways.
[00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:52.500]   Alcohol is an epidemic, he said.
[00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:55.980]   Divorce is rampant.
[00:42:55.980 --> 00:42:59.540]   As they deal with the pain of saying, man, I'm going to choose to lay my life down so
[00:42:59.540 --> 00:43:03.220]   that others can safely protest.
[00:43:03.220 --> 00:43:07.800]   And yet it's going to cost me my life.
[00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:11.900]   And it was just this moment in our staff that was so powerful of just like sitting there
[00:43:11.900 --> 00:43:16.700]   all brothers together, where we can just talk about that.
[00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:20.100]   And I think this, it's got to be something that we've got to embrace more and more.
[00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:21.260]   I've got to embrace more and more.
[00:43:21.260 --> 00:43:25.540]   I'm just saying the conversation of inviting and asking people, man, help me.
[00:43:25.540 --> 00:43:27.540]   I want to know how you feel.
[00:43:27.540 --> 00:43:32.060]   Because honestly, like I was raised in an environment where I just don't, I trust the
[00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:34.020]   police.
[00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:39.880]   And if I was in other circumstances, I don't know that I would.
[00:43:39.880 --> 00:43:40.880]   I'm sure.
[00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:43.880]   I mean, once you see things from the other point of view, it all makes sense.
[00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:45.280]   And so I just want to know, I want to care.
[00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:48.560]   And I know hundreds and thousands of people in this room do.
[00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:57.120]   And our silence that is hurt has not all necessarily been a result of apathy.
[00:43:57.120 --> 00:44:01.720]   And so regardless in this room, we've got to come together because like that black pastor
[00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:04.160]   friend said, I thought it was so beautiful.
[00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:11.080]   The most important color for the church is not white or black or any other color than
[00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:18.280]   red and the color of the blood that Jesus paid for us, that unites all of us in him
[00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:21.240]   together.
[00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:27.160]   And then, man, the last thing I would say, and if I'm, I haven't walked in your shoes
[00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:29.160]   if you're in the black community.
[00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:37.760]   But man, will you help us by leading in forgiveness of like past sins that I'm so grief that took
[00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:40.560]   place in the darkness of our nation.
[00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:43.880]   And I would not ask you to experience and walk through something that I, I wouldn't,
[00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:45.720]   I wouldn't just be like, man, you just got to choose to forgive.
[00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:48.800]   I've never, cause I can't relate.
[00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:55.440]   I haven't had to walk through all of that, but here's who I know can relate is Jesus
[00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:58.880]   who looked at enemies, who looked at those who mistreated him.
[00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:02.120]   And he said, I'm going to choose to forgive.
[00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:07.280]   I'm going to choose despite the fact that they're going to crucify me to forgive.
[00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:09.960]   And I'm going to move towards them.
[00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:14.200]   And man, no matter what your skin color is, no matter what, how much money you make, no
[00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:17.640]   matter what it is, we've got to come together.
[00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:21.440]   The church, if not us, then what other group will.
[00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:26.320]   And the only way that we do that is by looking and focusing and turning our eyes on Jesus.
[00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:30.940]   And in the midst of this hurting time, like, like our close with this, I was reading through
[00:45:30.940 --> 00:45:35.640]   scripture this past week and man, the verse that came to mind was such a, like, it just
[00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:38.800]   feels like this is where we are Lord.
[00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:42.160]   And it was this first, this comes from second Chronicles chapter 20, it's first 12.
[00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:46.080]   And it just says, well, we do not know what to do, but our eyes are fixed on you.
[00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:48.760]   We do not know what to do, Lord, but we're going to look at you.
[00:45:48.760 --> 00:45:49.760]   We're going to listen to one another.
[00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:50.760]   We're going to love one another.
[00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:52.280]   We're going to watch how Jesus loves.
[00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:53.880]   We're going to be patient with one another.
[00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:55.320]   We're going to care for one another.
[00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:57.080]   We're going to extend grace to one another.
[00:45:57.080 --> 00:46:02.480]   And we're going to try to move in the direction of one another as the church, because what
[00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:08.300]   unites us, the blood of Jesus is much stronger, much more significant, much more eternal than
[00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:13.000]   anything else that exists.
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:17.360]   And we're either going to come together and be a part of healing a nation that has nowhere
[00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:19.240]   else to look for it.
[00:46:19.240 --> 00:46:21.920]   Where else are you going to find that kind of love?
[00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:25.240]   And just this flowery love that the world communicates.
[00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:28.440]   We have the perfect love of God displayed on a cross.
[00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:32.800]   We actually have something to stand on.
[00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:36.700]   And what are we going to do, man?
[00:46:36.700 --> 00:46:43.240]   We offer the only, we offer the thing the world needs most.
[00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:50.080]   And I don't know about you, but my hunch is you don't want to see another generation get
[00:46:50.080 --> 00:47:00.160]   passed on the pains and the problems of the past.
[00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:05.760]   You want to be a part of providing a place to process pain, not push politics, to help
[00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:07.460]   and to heal one another.
[00:47:07.460 --> 00:47:08.760]   And that's what we want to do.
[00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:09.760]   That's what we're going to do.
[00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:13.400]   That's what we're going to do in Houston and in Dallas and in every single place that we
[00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:14.800]   gather together.
[00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:16.680]   And we need one another.
[00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:19.440]   I need you.
[00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:20.760]   We all need one another.
[00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:24.540]   We're stronger together.
[00:47:24.540 --> 00:47:28.800]   And by looking at Jesus, we're brought together.
[00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:42.160]   And we pray that that be the case.
[00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:47.800]   Lord would you help us?
[00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:52.200]   Would you heal your bride?
[00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:57.500]   Would you help us to be a part of healing the world around us?
[00:47:57.500 --> 00:48:07.160]   Would you forgive me for my insensitivity to brothers and sisters of all colors?
[00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:08.560]   Would you humble us?
[00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:11.420]   Would you make us humble, Lord?
[00:48:11.420 --> 00:48:17.080]   Would you make us more like your son?
[00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:23.640]   Father, we know that even in looking at you, we look more like you.
[00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:27.120]   It is when we look at you, the Bible says that we are changed from one degree of glory
[00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:28.120]   to the next.
[00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:30.560]   So would we all turn our attention on you, Lord?
[00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:32.520]   Would you use us to heal the country?
[00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:35.720]   Because God, I honestly, I don't know where else it's going to come from.
[00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:39.960]   I don't know that it can come from anywhere else and actually last and actually bring
[00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:43.160]   healing and actually bring change, Lord.
[00:48:43.160 --> 00:48:47.440]   So would you allow us to be a part of that?
[00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:54.040]   Allow us to be a part of bringing the very thing the world needs, unity, love, forgiveness,
[00:48:54.040 --> 00:49:00.360]   all things that are found from you or in you and are to be found in your church.
[00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:02.200]   Help us to trust you, Lord.
[00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:03.960]   Father, we love you.
[00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:04.760]   Amen.
