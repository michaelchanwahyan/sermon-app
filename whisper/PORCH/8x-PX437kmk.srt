1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:21,120
 - All right, Porch, how are we doing tonight?

3
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:21,960
 We doing okay?

4
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:22,920
 (audience cheering)

5
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,400
 Great to see you.

6
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,080
 Man, I love the energy.

7
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,160
 Welcome, it's so good to be with you this Tuesday night.

8
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,200
 Not just those of you here in the room.

9
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,520
 It is always a joy to see you here,

10
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,800
 but also everyone that's tuning in online.

11
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,440
 Like thanks everybody here and there,

12
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:44,000
 just for making time to be a part of what God is doing.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,680
 We just came out of a worship set that was really powerful.

14
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,120
 And it's not just because we got talented people up here

15
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,920
 or because man, the band sounds awesome.

16
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,680
 They got the PA tuned in perfectly.

17
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,320
 The reason it's powerful is because,

18
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,720
 is because the presence of God

19
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,560
 delights to meet with his people.

20
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,320
 He delights to meet with you.

21
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,760
 And so I hope if you haven't experienced that already,

22
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,000
 you can expect that for yourself tonight

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,640
 because that is absolutely what he wants.

24
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,320
 Davy said it, but we choose him

25
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,360
 in response to him choosing us.

26
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,120
 And so are you gonna choose him tonight?

27
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,240
 That's the question on the table for you.

28
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,760
 To help you get to that place,

29
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,620
 we've got a very special friend

30
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:27,200
 that's going to be teaching the word of God to us.

31
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,080
 I could not be more excited to introduce to you this person

32
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,400
 for the first time to the porch.

33
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,960
 He is one of the humblest men that I know.

34
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,840
 Genuinely, if you spend any time around him,

35
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,800
 you know he delights to lower himself

36
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,560
 so that way he might lift Christ on high.

37
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,160
 He is one of the most trusted voices I know.

38
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:48,840
 He is revered for the wisdom he offers in rooms.

39
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,500
 Oftentimes whenever he speaks,

40
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,360
 the conversation just kind of concludes

41
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,520
 because that was the right thing

42
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,480
 that we were all waiting to hear.

43
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,920
 And he faithfully serves as the executive director

44
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,400
 of discipleship here at Watermark Community Church.

45
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,160
 So porch, would you do a really good job

46
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,040
 in helping me welcome for the very first time

47
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,680
 Dave Bruscus to the stage.

48
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:12,020
 (congregation cheering)

49
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:15,280
 - Love you, man.

50
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,680
 Thank you, thank you, thank you.

51
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,100
 Hey friends, great to be with you tonight.

52
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,960
 Tonight has already been meaningful to me,

53
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,880
 just our time of worship together.

54
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,840
 Found myself tearing up being emotional.

55
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,720
 I don't know how I'm gonna get through tonight,

56
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,760
 but I am glad to be with you.

57
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,320
 I was on a road trip years ago with my dear friend, Randy.

58
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,520
 Randy brought his eight-year-old son with us, Truett.

59
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,880
 Truett was in the backseat.

60
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,080
 We had a dual cab pickup truck

61
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,600
 and Truett was obsessed with Pokemon.

62
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,080
 Anybody been there before?

63
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,480
 And Truett, some of you, it's okay to come clean tonight.

64
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,160
 Truett had a three-ring binder

65
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:58,880
 with plastic dividers of every Pokemon card he collected.

66
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:02,760
 And he began to run me through every character's strengths,

67
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,720
 weaknesses, uniqueness.

68
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,480
 So I learned all about Pikachu and I learned all about Psyduck

69
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,320
 and I learned all about Snorlax.

70
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,280
 How cool is it that you could change the world

71
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,440
 just by sleeping?

72
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,560
 That's my favorite, is Snorlax.

73
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,800
 So we went through the characters,

74
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,720
 but Truett's presentation began to lag a little bit.

75
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,680
 And we were now in 30 minutes of him talking nonstop.

76
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,480
 And finally, his dad looked back at him and said,

77
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,000
 "Hey, son, listen, I'm not so sure

78
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,680
 "that Pastor Dave is as interested in Pokemon as you are.

79
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,680
 "Why don't we wrap this thing up?"

80
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,120
 And Truett looked defeated, he looked angry,

81
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,160
 and he also looked determined.

82
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,380
 He said, "Dad, you give me 30 more minutes with Pastor Dave

83
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,920
 "and I promise you he will love Pokemon

84
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,320
 "every bit as much as I do."

85
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,120
 So here's the deal tonight.

86
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,320
 Kylan gave me free reign to talk about

87
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,040
 anything I wanted to talk about.

88
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,080
 So I have chosen my favorite passage in all of Scripture.

89
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,720
 And if you give me the next 30 minutes,

90
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,840
 I'm pretty confident that it will become

91
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,780
 your favorite passage of Scripture as well.

92
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:07,980
 If you have a Bible, turn with me to Colossians chapter one.

93
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:12,960
 We're gonna look at verses 15 through 21 tonight.

94
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,200
 And as we look at these verses,

95
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,260
 I think they're so critically important

96
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:19,280
 because they answer what I think

97
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,760
 is the most important question a Christian can answer,

98
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,640
 and that is, who is Jesus to us?

99
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,880
 So that's what I wanna talk about tonight

100
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,040
 as we look at this text.

101
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,160
 I want to answer the question through the lens

102
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,260
 of this passage of Scripture, who is Jesus to us?

103
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,800
 And after we come to that answer,

104
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,320
 I wanna give you one specific action item.

105
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,020
 So glad to be with you, let's pray together.

106
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,360
 Father, thank you for tonight.

107
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,240
 Thank you for everyone who's in the room here in Dallas.

108
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,440
 Thank you for all those who are joining us online.

109
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:50,900
 Father, we know that according to Jesus, there's no one,

110
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:53,460
 no one in this space that's here by accident tonight

111
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,380
 because Father, you are seeking worshipers

112
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,340
 who will worship you in spirit and truth.

113
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:01,500
 And tonight is not so much about us getting ourselves here,

114
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,560
 it's you bringing us here that we might experience

115
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,000
 the joy of your presence, of knowing you, of worshiping you.

116
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,740
 Father, I praise we open up the Bible tonight.

117
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:15,860
 Through your Holy Spirit, you would open up our eyes

118
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:18,940
 in a fresh way to who Jesus is,

119
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:21,300
 that we would see him clearly.

120
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,220
 Father, you know our tendency to downsize Jesus,

121
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:27,400
 to make him smaller so he fits into our lives,

122
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,100
 to make him in our own image.

123
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:33,460
 I pray you would break apart all the things

124
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,260
 that we've constructed that are false tonight.

125
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:39,540
 And I pray that we would see Jesus as he truly is.

126
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,700
 Holy Spirit, I pray if there's anyone in this room tonight,

127
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:45,420
 anyone joining us online who doesn't yet know Jesus,

128
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,820
 that you would arrange an introduction,

129
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,100
 that lives would forever be changed,

130
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,380
 that Jesus would be worshiped and glorified.

131
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:53,580
 In his good name we pray together, amen.

132
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:56,380
 Colossians 1, we're gonna jump right into verse 15.

133
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:01,340
 Simple question tonight, who is Jesus to us?

134
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,180
 Here we go.

135
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:05,580
 He is the image of the invisible God,

136
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:08,260
 the firstborn of all creation.

137
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,220
 Listen to this.

138
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:13,660
 For by him, all things were created in heaven and on earth,

139
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:16,980
 visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions

140
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:19,740
 or rulers or authorities.

141
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:23,780
 All things were created through him and for him.

142
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,540
 And he is before all things,

143
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:28,720
 and in him all things hold together.

144
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,700
 I wish we could take these first few verses

145
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,180
 and spend hours unpacking them

146
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,980
 'cause they're so rich with meaning.

147
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:37,560
 But I wanna highlight a couple things as we get started.

148
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,600
 First thing I want you to see as we speak of Jesus,

149
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,960
 he's the he we're referring to here,

150
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,660
 is he is the image of the invisible God.

151
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,220
 If we were to look at the original language

152
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:50,580
 of the New Testament, you would recognize this word

153
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:55,140
 because it is the word that we use for icon.

154
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:58,620
 Jesus is the icon of the invisible God.

155
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:01,280
 Now when we think of icon and think about this,

156
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,220
 think of the most iconic image you can come up with.

157
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,980
 An icon can do one of two things.

158
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:09,380
 An icon can be a representation of something

159
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:12,080
 or in the biblical sense,

160
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,080
 it can be a manifestation of something.

161
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,720
 Here's what scripture is telling us.

162
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,100
 When you and I look into the face of Jesus,

163
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:24,620
 we see far more than just a representation of God.

164
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:27,540
 We see the very face of God itself.

165
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:31,880
 I don't know if you did this during the pandemic.

166
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,420
 Some of you might not have been old enough back then too,

167
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:37,260
 but I binge watched, I'm so bored.

168
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,780
 I binge watched so much TV.

169
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:42,100
 Now, my wife, Kara loves musicals

170
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:46,180
 and because I love Kara, I have to love musicals as well.

171
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:49,020
 And I had wanted to take her to see "Hamilton" at Fair Park,

172
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:51,940
 but everything shut down in the pandemic.

173
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:54,300
 We had binge watched everything we could binge watch.

174
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,100
 And I thought, okay, I'm gonna splurge.

175
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,140
 I'm gonna break my budget.

176
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:00,180
 I'm gonna go ahead and buy the Disney Channel

177
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,060
 and we are going to watch the music "Hamilton."

178
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,360
 As I was, and it was a great musical.

179
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,820
 You should see it if you haven't seen it yet.

180
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,860
 As I was watching "Hamilton,"

181
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,900
 I would tell you I saw an icon,

182
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,140
 an image of Alexander Hamilton.

183
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:14,420
 Now, what I didn't see

184
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,880
 was a manifestation of Alexander Hamilton.

185
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,380
 What I saw was a representation.

186
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,560
 Lin-Manuel Miranda did a beautiful job

187
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,340
 of representing Alexander Hamilton,

188
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:26,860
 but I didn't see a manifestation of him.

189
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:29,820
 The only way I could have seen a manifestation

190
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:32,740
 of Alexander Hamilton is had his eternal spirit

191
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:36,420
 somehow been embodied in Lin-Manuel Miranda's body,

192
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:39,060
 then I would have said I could see Alexander Hamilton.

193
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:42,980
 God is a triune God.

194
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,820
 The God of the Bible is three persons, one God,

195
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,860
 co-eternal, co-worthy of worship,

196
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:51,100
 God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Spirit.

197
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,860
 God the Son took on human form.

198
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,500
 His name is Jesus.

199
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,060
 When you and I look into the face of Jesus,

200
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:01,300
 we see the very face of God.

201
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:04,380
 Not only is Jesus the image of the invisible God,

202
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,140
 I want you to see the next thing it says about him.

203
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:09,520
 He's the firstborn of all creation.

204
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:12,220
 Does that seem confusing to you?

205
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:15,540
 Do you think for a second, wait a minute, wait, wait, wait.

206
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,740
 Dave, if Jesus is eternally God,

207
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,860
 then how can he be firstborn?

208
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,300
 How can he be connected to creation in any way?

209
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,740
 Well, if you look at the context of this passage,

210
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:28,580
 you understand that Jesus is not a creature, he's creator.

211
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:32,020
 The text has already told us that everything that exists,

212
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:35,220
 visible, invisible, things in heaven, things on the earth,

213
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:38,100
 were created by Jesus, through Jesus,

214
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,460
 and ultimately are for Jesus.

215
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,060
 And when we use the term firstborn,

216
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:45,300
 what we mean is he's not just first in sequence,

217
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,340
 he's first in significance.

218
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:48,540
 We see this in the Bible, right?

219
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,820
 You read those Old Testament stories,

220
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,700
 and there's this weight of value

221
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,820
 that's placed on firstborn animals, firstborn children.

222
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,140
 Any firstborns in the room, raise your hand.

223
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,380
 All right, congratulations.

224
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:02,460
 According to the Bible, you're more significant

225
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:04,360
 than the siblings that came after you.

226
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,320
 Right, I love to bring this, I have one little brother.

227
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,040
 I love to bring this to him up all the time.

228
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,360
 Hey man, how are you doing?

229
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,760
 Just wanna remind you, I'm the firstborn,

230
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,120
 and if we really wanna be biblical,

231
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,700
 we should hope that mom and dad take the inheritance.

232
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,040
 They split it three ways, and I get two shares,

233
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,600
 and you get one, you know,

234
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,760
 because that's the way things should be

235
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,640
 if mom and dad are gonna follow Jesus through the Bible.

236
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,840
 And then when he gets angry, he's telling me,

237
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,160
 "Hey man, don't be a hater, I'm just the messenger.

238
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,440
 "I'm just telling you what the truth is."

239
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:38,400
 Jesus is more significant than the entirety of creation.

240
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:42,280
 He's the agent of creation because everything that exists,

241
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,600
 everything that we see and everything we don't see

242
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,920
 that we know exists in our world was created by Jesus,

243
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,040
 through Jesus, and ultimately exists for Jesus.

244
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,400
 But there's this last phrase I wanna get to

245
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,040
 that's so important here.

246
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,280
 Look at it with me again, verse 17.

247
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,000
 And he is before all things.

248
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,560
 Here we go, ready for this?

249
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,440
 And in him, all things.

250
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:09,960
 All things, not a few things, not most things,

251
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:13,040
 all things hold together in him.

252
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,520
 He holds all things together.

253
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,520
 What does that mean?

254
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:20,000
 It means Jesus is the fabric

255
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,680
 that gives meaning to everything that exists.

256
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:26,840
 Jesus gives meaning to everything.

257
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:30,980
 Everything has meaning in as much as it relates to Jesus.

258
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,960
 Jesus is the single thread of meaning

259
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,880
 for everything that exists visibly and invisibly.

260
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,760
 So if we go back to our question that we began with,

261
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,080
 and that is who is Jesus to us,

262
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,320
 first thing I want you to think about is this.

263
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,780
 Jesus is our meaning.

264
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:48,840
 Jesus is our meaning.

265
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:52,320
 You ever look around the world?

266
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,240
 You ever look around your neighborhood?

267
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,520
 You ever look around your workplace?

268
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,000
 You ever look around your classroom and you think,

269
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,600
 "I can't make sense of this."

270
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:04,260
 It's really hard to piece together significance

271
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:06,260
 and meaning based on what I see.

272
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,300
 Well, the reason for that is nothing makes sense

273
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,940
 apart from Jesus.

274
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,380
 If you're here tonight and you're not a Christian,

275
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,300
 you're saying, "I can't make sense

276
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,580
 "of what's going on around me."

277
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:15,060
 That makes sense according to the Bible

278
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,140
 because the only way the world makes sense

279
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:20,020
 and everything in it is in relationship to Jesus.

280
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,700
 Jesus holds all things together,

281
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,060
 meaning that Jesus gives meaning

282
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:27,200
 and significance to all things.

283
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,380
 I want you to understand this clearly about the Bible.

284
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:32,540
 The Bible isn't a collection of countless stories,

285
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:34,160
 it's one story.

286
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,340
 The Bible isn't 1,000 principles to live by,

287
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,940
 it's one person to live for.

288
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:41,140
 His name is Jesus.

289
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:46,060
 The Bible's a story in four acts featuring one character.

290
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,500
 It's as simple as that.

291
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,860
 The featured character of the Bible,

292
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,620
 it's not the story of you and me,

293
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,780
 it's the story of Jesus.

294
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,900
 But here's the four acts.

295
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,260
 The first act is creation.

296
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:59,060
 God created the world through Jesus.

297
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,860
 And when he had finished creation,

298
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,860
 he declared, "This is good."

299
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:05,940
 He made humankind to live in relationship with him,

300
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:08,180
 to worship him and enjoy him forever.

301
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,340
 And everything got off to a great start.

302
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:14,060
 But before we even get past the third chapter of Genesis,

303
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,260
 everything comes undone.

304
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:18,180
 Our common parents, Adam and Eve,

305
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,860
 they rebelled against God.

306
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:23,100
 They did the very thing God said they couldn't do

307
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:27,900
 and because of their sin, their treason, their rebellion,

308
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,220
 everything is corrupted.

309
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,580
 Everything is broken.

310
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:32,980
 That's chapter two of the Bible.

311
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:36,180
 First chapter is creation, second chapter is fall.

312
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:39,860
 Humankind and the world around us is fallen, it's broken.

313
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,980
 But here comes the third chapter.

314
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:45,180
 And this is when the story really starts to get good.

315
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:48,180
 God in his mercy, God in his patience,

316
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:52,100
 God in his kindness, God for the sake of his glory

317
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:55,180
 sends his son Jesus on a rescue mission.

318
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,820
 Jesus takes on human form.

319
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:02,580
 He lives the perfect life that no one else can live.

320
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:07,060
 He goes to the cross and there he dies a brutal, painful,

321
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:10,500
 God-forsaken death, the death that you and I deserve to die.

322
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,820
 He's put in the grave.

323
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,780
 But friends, here's the good news tonight.

324
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:15,500
 You're not gonna ever find the bones of Jesus.

325
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,580
 He is risen from the grave, physically, bodily.

326
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,540
 He's at the right hand of God the Father.

327
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:23,220
 One day he'll come and he'll rule and reign forever.

328
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,900
 And as we enter in this third chapter,

329
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,780
 the chapter that you and I find ourselves living in today,

330
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,900
 it's the chapter of redemption.

331
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,180
 You know what God is doing in the world?

332
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:36,460
 God is drawing together a people from himself,

333
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,580
 a people from every tongue, every tribe,

334
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,500
 redeeming a people for himself,

335
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,700
 promising to forgive them of their sin,

336
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:45,900
 free them from their sin, live life with them,

337
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,740
 and ultimately look forward to the fourth chapter,

338
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,580
 which is still in front of us.

339
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:51,500
 We're not there yet.

340
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,700
 It's the chapter of restoration or recreation.

341
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:57,540
 The day will come when God will restore all things.

342
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,820
 And you and I, as followers of Jesus,

343
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:00,780
 will be with him forever.

344
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:02,060
 There'll be no more sin.

345
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,340
 There'll be no more suffering.

346
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,740
 There'll be no more death.

347
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:09,420
 But friends, today we find ourselves in chapter three.

348
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:13,720
 And if you're here tonight, even as a follower of Jesus,

349
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,100
 perhaps especially as a follower of Jesus,

350
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,420
 and you're thinking life is hard, you're right.

351
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:22,140
 We haven't entered into chapter four yet.

352
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,340
 Jesus has forgiven us.

353
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:29,660
 Jesus has come to live in us through the Holy Spirit.

354
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:31,180
 And he is not only forgiving us

355
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,900
 from sin and rebellion and brokenness,

356
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,260
 he's freeing us from it.

357
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,720
 But we're not entirely there yet.

358
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,600
 We're gonna sit.

359
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,060
 We're gonna experience suffering.

360
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,620
 We're gonna live in a world that's broken,

361
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:45,740
 and yet God promises never to leave us or forsake us.

362
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,440
 He's gonna be with us.

363
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,700
 We will be his people and he will be our God.

364
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,140
 And together we'll walk towards the fourth chapter,

365
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:54,940
 anticipating with hope the day when Jesus returns

366
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:55,940
 and makes everything right.

367
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:58,820
 Until then, it's gonna be hard.

368
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:02,480
 Is your life hard tonight?

369
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,900
 Are you struggling tonight?

370
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:10,860
 Do you find yourself in a season perhaps of suffering?

371
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:13,500
 Perhaps a season of fighting sin

372
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,540
 and you just feel like you're not gaining any ground?

373
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:19,060
 I've got four daughters.

374
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:21,060
 My wife and I have been married 38 years

375
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,140
 come this December.

376
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:26,100
 Four daughters and four sons-in-law

377
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,180
 and now eight grandkids.

378
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:29,100
 I love them dearly.

379
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:32,140
 Our youngest daughter, who's here tonight,

380
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:35,500
 at 20 years old was diagnosed with stage four lymphoma.

381
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,780
 And it was devastating.

382
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:41,860
 The good news was from the doctors

383
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,860
 that this is a treatable form of cancer.

384
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:47,020
 The tough news was it's gonna be hard treatment

385
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,220
 to get better.

386
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:50,280
 And so she began chemotherapy.

387
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,340
 Perhaps some of you in the room

388
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:52,780
 have had a similar diagnosis.

389
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,700
 Maybe you've suffered through cancer.

390
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:58,820
 I'll never forget the first day we took Jillian

391
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:01,340
 to her chemotherapy appointment.

392
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:02,660
 And she went into this large room

393
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,700
 and she was the youngest person in the room.

394
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:07,740
 The room was filled with people that looked very sick.

395
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,500
 And everyone caught her eye

396
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,620
 because they thought to themselves,

397
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:12,940
 why is the person that young in this room?

398
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:15,340
 She got hooked up to her chemotherapy treatment

399
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:16,740
 and she sat there for a few hours.

400
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:19,620
 And as we left, she physically looked different

401
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:21,260
 than when she walked in the room.

402
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:25,060
 Skin tone had changed, her countenance had changed.

403
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:29,060
 And so we went home and I know my little girl well,

404
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:31,320
 when she's not feeling well, she's just gonna sleep it off.

405
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:34,460
 And I know even when she's depressed and sad,

406
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:36,540
 she's just gonna sleep out her feelings.

407
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:38,220
 And so she goes to her room,

408
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,620
 Karen and I are sitting there at the table

409
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:42,700
 and we're just overwhelmed by what she's experiencing.

410
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,820
 And I'm really thinking through,

411
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:48,020
 Lord, how do I make sense of this?

412
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,980
 Jesus, I know you love us, I know you're with us,

413
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,140
 I know we're in the third chapter,

414
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,620
 there's a fourth chapter to come.

415
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,300
 I know this is a time of redemption,

416
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,980
 the time of restoration isn't here yet,

417
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:59,060
 but would you please help my little girl?

418
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,780
 And then I begin to think back

419
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:04,340
 about all the times I failed as a dad.

420
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:07,660
 And I began to think why she's laying in bed,

421
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:12,460
 suffering from the effects of chemotherapy, fighting cancer.

422
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,020
 I began to think, I hope my voice

423
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,580
 isn't rattling around in her head saying,

424
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:19,220
 hey, suck it up, do more, try harder, tough it out,

425
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,620
 you can do this.

426
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,020
 So I remember just praying, Lord,

427
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:25,260
 I know in this chapter of the story of the Bible,

428
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,680
 you promise to be with your people,

429
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,060
 you promise to minister to people.

430
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:29,340
 I said, Father in heaven,

431
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:32,420
 would you please overcome my deficiencies

432
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,260
 and my failures of my little girl?

433
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,660
 And would you care for her in ways that I can't?

434
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:39,820
 A few hours later, she emerged from her room,

435
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:44,140
 we had a quiet dinner together, she wasn't feeling well,

436
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:47,900
 her appetite wasn't there, she kind of picked over her food,

437
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,780
 there wasn't much to say.

438
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,060
 And right before we finished the meal,

439
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:54,460
 she said, very casually, matter of factly,

440
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:56,020
 oh, God spoke to me.

441
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:57,820
 We're like, wait, what?

442
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,380
 Like that deserves a better introduction,

443
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:02,780
 but please tell us what it was he told you.

444
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:05,440
 And she said, I was right in that place

445
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,380
 when you wake up and you've been asleep for a while,

446
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,500
 and as soon as I woke up,

447
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,180
 I heard this voice that said, my daughter.

448
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:13,800
 And she said, Dad, I looked around the room

449
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,180
 thinking that that must be you

450
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:17,460
 because you're the one who calls me that,

451
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,900
 and I looked around the room and there was no one there,

452
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,780
 so I think the Father was just reminding me

453
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,860
 that I belong to him and he is with me

454
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,420
 in the midst of this suffering.

455
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:30,700
 Friends, that's the meaning that Jesus gives life.

456
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:33,260
 All of life, the good things, the bad things,

457
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:35,420
 the in-between things,

458
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,940
 the things that are visible and invisible,

459
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:39,820
 every experience you have, all of who you are,

460
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:43,180
 all your thoughts, all your feelings, all your words,

461
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:45,100
 all your actions, all your relationships

462
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,720
 have meaning in as much as they relate to Jesus.

463
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,260
 Jesus is our meaning,

464
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:53,500
 which raises the question for us tonight is,

465
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,660
 are we living meaningful lives?

466
00:19:56,660 --> 00:20:02,280
 Are we understanding and viewing the life

467
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,040
 that God has assigned us to live

468
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,860
 through the meaning that we have in Jesus?

469
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:08,000
 I want that for you tonight.

470
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,400
 I want that for us tonight.

471
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,440
 Let's go back to Colossians.

472
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,960
 Verse 18, "Who is Jesus to us?

473
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,400
 "And he is the head of the body, the church.

474
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,520
 "He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead,

475
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:27,520
 "that in everything he might be preeminent."

476
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,280
 I love that statement about Jesus.

477
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:33,760
 Jesus has done something that no one else has ever done

478
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,120
 in the history of the world.

479
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,120
 Jesus has risen from the dead.

480
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:42,360
 And because Jesus has risen from the dead,

481
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:46,640
 he has manifested and claimed his victory over death

482
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,560
 and sin and Satan.

483
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,600
 And by doing so, he is preeminent in all things.

484
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,440
 He's the head of the church.

485
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,440
 Every church in our city and in our state

486
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,640
 and in our country and around the world that loves Jesus,

487
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,220
 if they had an org chart,

488
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:02,280
 guess who would be at the top of that org chart?

489
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,400
 Jesus, why?

490
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,540
 Because it's his church.

491
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:08,320
 It's not yours, it's not mine, it's his.

492
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,480
 We are his people.

493
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,400
 He deserves the top space.

494
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,240
 He is preeminent in everything.

495
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:19,240
 He is first, he is foremost, he is supreme.

496
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,800
 That's who Jesus is.

497
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,520
 Second thing I want you to know about Jesus tonight is

498
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,600
 Jesus is our mission.

499
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,800
 Now let me explain that.

500
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,400
 'Cause I know some of you are gonna know the Bible

501
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,160
 well enough to say, "Wait, wait, wait a minute.

502
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,760
 "I got you on this one, Dave."

503
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:36,460
 No, no, our mission is to make disciples.

504
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,420
 You would be right.

505
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:41,120
 But I want you to understand what the end point

506
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,080
 or the destination are,

507
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,360
 what it means finally to make disciples.

508
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:49,040
 And I want us to look at Jesus's words themselves.

509
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,380
 Look with me, if you will, at Matthew 28.

510
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:55,560
 We're gonna pick up in verse 18, the words of Jesus.

511
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,600
 Jesus is about to ascend into heaven.

512
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,080
 It's some of his final words to his disciples

513
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,320
 as they remain on earth.

514
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,120
 Listen to what he says.

515
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:07,420
 Verse 18, Matthew 28, "And Jesus came and said to them,

516
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:10,120
 "all authority in heaven and on earth

517
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,000
 "has been given to me."

518
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,040
 What does that sound like to you?

519
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,640
 That's Colossians 1, isn't it?

520
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,080
 All, that word comes up again.

521
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:20,220
 "All authority in heaven and on earth, Jesus says is mine.

522
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,860
 "I am now in charge of all things

523
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:24,000
 "and will be forever in heaven and on earth."

524
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,880
 So he states his position first.

525
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,520
 Then he says this in verse 19.

526
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:31,540
 "Go therefore and make disciples of all nations,

527
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:34,600
 "baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son

528
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,560
 "and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe

529
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:40,480
 "all that I have commanded you."

530
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,600
 I love this tagline.

531
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:46,600
 "And behold, I am with you always to the end of the age."

532
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,080
 I want you to see what Jesus is saying here.

533
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,440
 He's giving his people marching orders.

534
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,120
 He's about to ascend into heaven.

535
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,540
 And he proclaims, it's like he has this sandwich.

536
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,640
 The two pieces of bread are,

537
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,360
 "Hey, all authority has been given to me."

538
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,520
 And the other piece of bread is,

539
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,480
 "And I'll be with you forever."

540
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,140
 But between that sandwich is the meat.

541
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,600
 I want you to make disciples.

542
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,520
 But I want you to see what it means to be a disciple.

543
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,240
 It means that we are baptized

544
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,000
 and that's the right of initiation

545
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,100
 into the family of Jesus.

546
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,700
 Let me say something real quick.

547
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:16,000
 I never cease to be surprised

548
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,240
 by how many professing Christians have not been baptized.

549
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,240
 I want to encourage you to not.

550
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,200
 If you've not been baptized, would you let somebody know?

551
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,760
 If you're a part of another local church,

552
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,200
 if you're a part of this church, Watermark,

553
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,040
 you're not a part of this church,

554
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,040
 would you let somebody know

555
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,400
 it's very important you be baptized?

556
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,400
 Not so that God will love you.

557
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:35,040
 He already has in Jesus, but it's an act of obedience.

558
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,960
 Baptism is the initiation point,

559
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,880
 but what does culmination of discipleship look like?

560
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:44,200
 Jesus says, "Teach them all things so that they may," what?

561
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,680
 "Know everything about me."

562
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:49,920
 No, he says, "So that they will obey me."

563
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,640
 So they observe all that I've commanded.

564
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,960
 In other words, the very essence of baptism

565
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,560
 is bringing as many people as we possibly can

566
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,880
 under the preeminence of Jesus.

567
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:03,840
 So that Jesus rules over every thought, every word,

568
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,200
 every feeling, every action,

569
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,120
 every relationship over everyone, everywhere.

570
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,480
 That's the mission.

571
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,840
 Jesus is our mission.

572
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,200
 I was a part of a church that was started

573
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,280
 near the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque,

574
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,120
 and it was a dynamic neighborhood.

575
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,440
 If you've ever been in a college setting

576
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,840
 and the neighborhoods around the college

577
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:25,240
 are usually pretty wild, right?

578
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:28,720
 People that live there tend to not like organized religion.

579
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,040
 They tend to be very progressive

580
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,960
 in their political persuasions.

581
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,320
 And this was that setting.

582
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,760
 And so as we started the church there,

583
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,000
 I just decided I'd spend some time

584
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,880
 walking up and down the street by where we met.

585
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:45,040
 We met in an old Route 66 movie theater.

586
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:45,960
 It's a really cool setting.

587
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,640
 And I was just gonna walk up and down the street,

588
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:51,000
 move in and out of stores and bars and restaurants.

589
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,200
 And I was gonna pastor people

590
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,400
 whether they wanted me to or not,

591
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,920
 like with a degree of respect.

592
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,000
 But hey, I just wanna care for you.

593
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:58,880
 I wanna tell you about Jesus.

594
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,720
 I was just gonna do that.

595
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:02,760
 I struck up a relationship with a young woman

596
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:07,760
 who had a store that exported rugs from Afghanistan.

597
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,640
 Really cool store.

598
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:13,140
 Also had some fine art from South Asia.

599
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:15,440
 I got to know her.

600
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,680
 Let's just say her name was Flo

601
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,320
 because that's what her name was.

602
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,800
 And so I got to know Flo

603
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,880
 and we began to have conversations about Jesus.

604
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:27,160
 And I was surprised at how open Flo was.

605
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,960
 And so I would go by once or twice a week

606
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,880
 and when customers weren't coming in

607
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,840
 and needing her attention,

608
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:35,320
 she was the sole storekeeper,

609
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,400
 we'd have conversations.

610
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,440
 And I began to realize like her heart

611
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:42,120
 is growing tender towards Jesus, right?

612
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:46,400
 She was moving towards Jesus in a significant way.

613
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:50,640
 And as we begin to have conversations about Jesus,

614
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,800
 she was growing closer and closer to knowing him.

615
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:58,880
 And as we, and I'll pick up the story in a minute

616
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,440
 'cause it fits later, so hold on with it, okay?

617
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,480
 I almost got ahead of myself.

618
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,500
 I'll tell you the end of that story in just a minute.

619
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,840
 But that's our mission, right?

620
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,680
 That's what we want.

621
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,560
 The mission isn't about Flo.

622
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,160
 The mission is ultimately about Jesus.

623
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:14,520
 It's about you and I knowing Jesus personally.

624
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:17,240
 It's about Jesus having rule and reign over our life

625
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,880
 in every capacity, over every relationship,

626
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:22,700
 over every work endeavor, over all that we are.

627
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,760
 We want Jesus to be preeminent.

628
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,440
 He is preeminent in the church.

629
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:29,320
 I want you to think about mission differently.

630
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,960
 Going back to this church that I was a part of

631
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,440
 in this neighborhood that was a little bit eclectic,

632
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,920
 is a little bit avant-garde.

633
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,480
 I used to park behind a car that had a bumper sticker.

634
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:40,240
 I love bumper stickers and really creative parts.

635
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,000
 It's like, you ever go look at bumper stickers in Austin?

636
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 They're just weird because Austin is weird,

637
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,180
 but they're really entertaining.

638
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,880
 Well, this is a place like that.

639
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,560
 And so I parked behind this car every day

640
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,720
 that had a bumper sticker that said, get this,

641
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,200
 I want you to think about this for a minute.

642
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:58,080
 What if, what if the UFO is the alien?

643
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,320
 That's a really interesting question, isn't it?

644
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,400
 Like, what if we shouldn't be looking for little green men

645
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,840
 to come out of a spaceship?

646
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:07,160
 What if the spaceship in and of itself is the alien?

647
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,320
 Like if it's a robotic AI thing?

648
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,220
 I don't know.

649
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:11,800
 I just found that fascinating.

650
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,200
 It made me think about UFOs differently.

651
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,840
 I want you to think about mission differently tonight.

652
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:21,280
 What if the ultimate point of mission is Jesus himself?

653
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:25,240
 What if mission ultimately culminates

654
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:29,240
 in people knowing and loving and trusting

655
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:32,280
 and obeying Jesus in all their lives?

656
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,520
 And mission took root all over the world

657
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:37,680
 so that in every tribe, every tongue,

658
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,760
 every place among every people,

659
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,520
 Jesus rightly held the preeminent place

660
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,860
 that he deserves to have.

661
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:45,120
 Wouldn't that be amazing?

662
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:49,040
 Here's what one theologian says about this idea

663
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,360
 of Jesus being preeminent.

664
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,760
 Theologian from the past century,

665
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:55,400
 a Dutch theologian named Abraham Kuyper, he said this,

666
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,680
 "There is not a square inch in the whole domain

667
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:01,920
 "of human existence over which Christ does not cry, 'Mine.'"

668
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:06,680
 Jesus is preeminent over everything.

669
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:10,680
 He's the head of the church in that he's preeminent.

670
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:14,780
 He's first, he's supreme, he's foremost over everything.

671
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:19,520
 Are we living on mission tonight?

672
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:23,160
 Mission begins with you.

673
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:26,080
 And it begins with you living

674
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,840
 with the preeminence of Jesus over every aspect

675
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,240
 and every dimension and every relationship

676
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,080
 in every facet of your life.

677
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:35,400
 And then it extends into the lives of others.

678
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,880
 Now, one last thing, and I'll pick up the story with flow.

679
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,800
 Look, if you will, with me back at Colossians 1.

680
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,200
 Jesus is our meaning, Jesus is our mission.

681
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,320
 One more thing I need you to know about Jesus.

682
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,880
 Verse 19, "For in him, all the fullness of God

683
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,900
 "was pleased to dwell and through him

684
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:55,720
 "to reconcile to himself all things,

685
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,920
 "whether on earth or in heaven,

686
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:02,080
 "making peace by the blood of his cross."

687
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,840
 Here's the third thing I want you to see about Jesus.

688
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,320
 Jesus is our message.

689
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,320
 Friends, that's the message of the Bible.

690
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:13,200
 That's the storyline, start to finish of the Bible.

691
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,880
 It is message about Jesus, it is a story of Jesus.

692
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,720
 Four acts that we already went over,

693
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,720
 but the central figure of the Bible isn't me, isn't you,

694
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,640
 it's the Lord Jesus Christ.

695
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:26,240
 And he is the message that we've been entrusted with

696
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,620
 to share to others.

697
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,760
 Specifically, I want you to see a couple things here.

698
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,520
 First of all, the fullness of God

699
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:36,680
 was pleased to dwell in Jesus, isn't that amazing?

700
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,920
 Jesus isn't some afterthought of God saying,

701
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:41,120
 "Oh no, this thing has gone terribly wrong.

702
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,480
 "How am I gonna pull this out of the ditch?

703
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,200
 "Oh, I know, Jesus."

704
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:48,960
 The fullness of God is pleased to dwell in Jesus.

705
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,840
 Jesus is fully God and he's fully human.

706
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:55,960
 And he was God's plan from the very beginning.

707
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,800
 Why?

708
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,240
 'Cause God has great purpose in Jesus.

709
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,960
 What is God's purpose in Jesus?

710
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,960
 To reconcile to himself, not some things,

711
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:09,000
 not a few things, not many things, but what?

712
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 All things.

713
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,160
 All things.

714
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:16,680
 All things will ultimately be reconciled to God

715
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,520
 through Jesus.

716
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:21,540
 In chapter two of the Bible, when humankind fell into sin,

717
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:24,880
 the whole world, visible and invisible, was corrupted.

718
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,520
 Everything was broken.

719
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:30,040
 Everything was antagonized in its relationship to God.

720
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,440
 You and I, here's the bad news tonight in the Bible,

721
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,240
 you and I, by being human beings,

722
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:38,040
 are born in an antagonistic, broken relationship with God.

723
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:42,040
 God considers our very first parent's sin, Adam and Eve,

724
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:42,880
 as our sin.

725
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,840
 We are born guilty.

726
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,120
 We are sinners by birth and you know what?

727
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,800
 As we grow older, we get really good at it.

728
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,760
 We begin to excel at living a life

729
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:53,160
 independent from God, apart from God,

730
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:56,000
 not honoring God for who he is,

731
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,720
 trying to mold God into our own image,

732
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:00,240
 to make our lives work, to try to use God

733
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,280
 to be some sort of delivery system

734
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,120
 so that we can have all that we want.

735
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:07,520
 The second part of bad news is,

736
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:10,580
 in this estranged relationship we have with God,

737
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:12,920
 there's absolutely nothing we can do to fix it.

738
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:17,720
 You can try as hard as you want, you can't do anything.

739
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:20,420
 It is broken beyond repair, but here's the good news.

740
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:23,760
 God became a man.

741
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:27,220
 His name is Jesus.

742
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:30,880
 He lived the only perfect life that's ever been lived.

743
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,260
 And then he went to the cross,

744
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:37,280
 our perfect, blameless substitute,

745
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:39,340
 and he died in our place.

746
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:42,220
 He died the death that you and I deserve to die.

747
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:43,380
 The grave can contain him.

748
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:45,980
 He's risen from the bed, bodily, physically,

749
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,340
 at the right hand of the Father,

750
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:51,940
 and God offers us, through Jesus, reconciliation.

751
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:54,740
 God takes this sentence that's been proclaimed over us,

752
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:56,940
 has condemned, and estranged, and said,

753
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,180
 "I reverse that now.

754
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:00,960
 "I am going to take your sin and put it on Jesus.

755
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,680
 "I'm gonna take the righteousness of Jesus

756
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,140
 "and give it to you as a free gift.

757
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:06,580
 "Will you receive it by faith?"

758
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:08,660
 And you and I, through the blood of Jesus,

759
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,780
 the Bible tells us, without the shedding of blood

760
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:12,340
 there is no forgiveness of sin.

761
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:14,440
 You and I, through the blood of Jesus,

762
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,500
 we can be made right with God.

763
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,900
 Isn't that amazing?

764
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,800
 We can be reconciled with God.

765
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,140
 That's the message of the Bible.

766
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,420
 That's the message of those of us in the room

767
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:25,500
 who follow Jesus.

768
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,220
 That's the message of the porch.

769
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:28,400
 That's what we just sang about.

770
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,380
 That's what I'm talking about.

771
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:30,780
 That's what we're gonna leave with.

772
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:33,940
 That's the good news we have for the broken world today.

773
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:36,200
 Be reconciled to God.

774
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,900
 It's possible.

775
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:40,260
 The worst thing that could ever happen to you has happened.

776
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:43,500
 You're unreconciled to God, but the good news is

777
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,740
 God offers you reconciliation through Jesus.

778
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:48,740
 Will you turn away from living a life independent of God

779
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:51,100
 and will you turn and run to Jesus and trust in him?

780
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:52,340
 Will you do that tonight?

781
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:55,900
 Maybe you're here tonight in this room.

782
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,520
 Maybe you're joining us online.

783
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:02,220
 And if you were really honest, you would say,

784
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:04,860
 "You know, Dave, I am not reconciled with God.

785
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:05,820
 "We're not okay.

786
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:08,580
 "I know we have a broken relationship.

787
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:10,400
 "It's estranged.

788
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,000
 "I now realize there's nothing I can do to fix it.

789
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,720
 "If you're in that place and I, oh, run to Jesus."

790
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,400
 He loves you.

791
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,680
 He's willing to receive you.

792
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:23,240
 He is willing to take your sin from you

793
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:26,200
 and in exchange give you his right

794
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,800
 standing before the Father forever.

795
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,800
 Would you take him up on that offer tonight?

796
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,960
 Would you trust in him?

797
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:35,700
 When we think about reconciliation,

798
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,400
 I want you to think through four levels.

799
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,080
 If you've never read a guy named John Perkins, you should.

800
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,560
 He has an amazing story.

801
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,160
 He speaks a lot about reconciliation.

802
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:47,280
 John Perkins was born in rural Mississippi in 1930.

803
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,240
 His parents died quickly after he was born.

804
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:52,440
 He was raised by his grandparents that were sharecroppers.

805
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,200
 And being a young black man in the South,

806
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,520
 his family said, "You've got to get out of here.

807
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,880
 "This isn't a safe place for you."

808
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,540
 So he ended up in California.

809
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:01,920
 He came to know Jesus and he has spent his entire life

810
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,840
 talking about reconciliation.

811
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,560
 He would say that through the cross of Jesus,

812
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,100
 there's four levels of reconciliation.

813
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,560
 The first is what we just talked about.

814
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,720
 Through Jesus and his blood,

815
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:13,040
 you and I can be reconciled to God.

816
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,040
 That relationship that's broken can be repaired forever.

817
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,760
 But that's not the only place reconciliation happens.

818
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,560
 Through the cross of Jesus,

819
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:23,160
 we can be reconciled to each other.

820
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:26,480
 I get to serve here on Monday nights, this very same space,

821
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,600
 and we get to see reconciliation happen all the time.

822
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:31,040
 And it's the craziest stories.

823
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,840
 People do horrible things to people.

824
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,640
 Have you realized that yet?

825
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,600
 Maybe sadly, you've been the recipient of that.

826
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,840
 Maybe you have been the perpetrator in that.

827
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:43,080
 There's not a week that goes by that we don't hear of

828
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:46,040
 unfaithful spouses being reconciled one to another.

829
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:50,240
 There's not a month that goes by that we don't get to see

830
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,360
 a child that was abused by a parent

831
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,480
 be reconciled to that parent.

832
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,600
 We get to see friends who betrayed each other

833
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:59,200
 and hurt one another come back together.

834
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,040
 We get to see the most amazing acts

835
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,560
 of forgiveness and reconciliation.

836
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,120
 How is that all possible?

837
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:06,040
 It's through the blood of Jesus.

838
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,080
 It's because God forgives us in Jesus

839
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:11,200
 and because his forgiveness is so thorough, so pervasive,

840
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,760
 you and I can extend that same forgiveness one to another.

841
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,720
 So four levels of reconciliation.

842
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,200
 The first is people to God, people to people.

843
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,320
 Then you see this other level of reconciliation,

844
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,360
 the Bible, I love this.

845
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,480
 It's people groups to people groups.

846
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,520
 Don't you love that?

847
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:29,520
 In the anthropology of the New Testament,

848
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,520
 there's only two kinds of people in the world.

849
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,280
 There are those that come from Jewish heritage

850
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,880
 and everybody else is considered a Gentile.

851
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,360
 And those two groups of people did not like each other

852
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,720
 in the ancient culture of the Bible.

853
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,600
 They were at odds.

854
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:44,800
 Yet when the church was formed, guess what happened?

855
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,720
 Jews were reconciled as a people group to Gentiles.

856
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,280
 How did that happen?

857
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,520
 Through Jesus.

858
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:55,880
 Think about what that could look like in our world today.

859
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,520
 Could you imagine a world where men

860
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,880
 are reconciled to women?

861
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:03,480
 How about white people being reconciled

862
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,160
 to non-white people?

863
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:09,840
 Let's take it even deeper.

864
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:15,200
 How about Democrats being reconciled to Republicans?

865
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,760
 You wanna blow your mind tonight?

866
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,600
 What if Aggies could be reconciled

867
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,560
 to Longhorns through Jesus Christ?

868
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,400
 Whoa!

869
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,200
 Some of you need to repent and believe.

870
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,000
 I hear that, isn't it?

871
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,760
 It's always the Aggies too, I'm sorry.

872
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,080
 But man, you talk about a people group far from God.

873
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:36,920
 (congregation laughing)

874
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:41,920
 It's all right, nobody's beyond his reach.

875
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,920
 Nobody's finding an Aggie and share the gospel tonight,

876
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:44,760
 would you?

877
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:53,520
 Jesus is our message.

878
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,840
 Let's go back to Flo.

879
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:58,880
 So I'm there in Flo's store.

880
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,320
 And I leave the day thinking like,

881
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,520
 "Oh, she's so close to coming to know Jesus.

882
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,080
 "Her heart is so tender."

883
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:10,680
 So I go home, sleep on it, wake up the next morning,

884
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,560
 and I just have this sense.

885
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,720
 I don't know if it's from the Holy Spirit

886
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,040
 or spiritual indigestion.

887
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,720
 Sometimes it's hard to discern, but I'm like,

888
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,800
 "Today's the day that Flo meets Jesus."

889
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,080
 So I walked up to her store.

890
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,760
 I waited for there to be an opening.

891
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,920
 I walked in.

892
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:27,360
 I said, "Flo, do you wanna trust Jesus today?"

893
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,720
 And she began to tear up.

894
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,640
 And I thought, "Okay, that's a good sign."

895
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:35,960
 She said, "Oh, I'm so close, but I don't know."

896
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:38,600
 I said, "Okay, let's talk about the gospel again."

897
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:41,280
 And we went over it, and she agreed with everything.

898
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,760
 God is a holy God, and I'm a sinner separated from him,

899
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,240
 and the only way I can know him

900
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,680
 and be forgiven is through Jesus.

901
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:51,480
 And I walked through all the presuppositions of the gospel.

902
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,800
 She said, "I believe, I believe, I believe."

903
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,760
 And I said, "Why not trust him today?"

904
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,040
 And she began to weep.

905
00:37:56,040 --> 00:38:00,360
 She said, "I just can't."

906
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:03,040
 And I said, "Flo, I don't understand.

907
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:06,760
 "You profess to believe all the tenets of the gospel.

908
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:09,540
 "Why not trust Jesus today?

909
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:11,120
 "Why not give your life to Jesus?"

910
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:14,400
 She looked at me through tears, and this is what she said.

911
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,060
 She said, "Dave, I am so ready to become a Christian.

912
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:21,460
 "I'm just not ready yet to be a Republican."

913
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:24,720
 (congregation laughing)

914
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:29,360
 Flo, Flo, like, "Where did you see that in the Bible?"

915
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,360
 (congregation laughing)

916
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,080
 Please tell me.

917
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,520
 Where did, you know, what,

918
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,760
 what intertestinal book does that come from?

919
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,240
 What is happening?

920
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,400
 And you know what she said?

921
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,320
 She said, "It's not in the Bible."

922
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:45,200
 But she said, "I've been watching Facebook posts."

923
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,480
 Back then it was Twitter.

924
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,400
 "Twitter posts, Instagram.

925
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,780
 "I've been watching the people that go to your church,

926
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:52,160
 "and my understanding from them is

927
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,820
 "you've got to be a Republican to be a Christian.

928
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:57,100
 "Listen to me, friends.

929
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:00,680
 "I want us to be politically active.

930
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:03,740
 "I think we have a responsibility to love and serve

931
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:05,420
 "people that are marginalized.

932
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:06,860
 "I think that's the calling of the gospel.

933
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:08,860
 "I think the gospel has application.

934
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:10,880
 "We're to care for the unborn.

935
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,980
 "We're to care for the vulnerable.

936
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:13,520
 "We're to care for the poor.

937
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,900
 "We're to care for the widow and the orphan.

938
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,140
 "We're to care for the sojourner.

939
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:17,280
 "We're absolutely to do all that,

940
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,180
 "and we need to speak into culture.

941
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:20,820
 "We need to speak into it.

942
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:25,440
 "But let's not hijack our main message.

943
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:29,120
 "The primary message that you and I should be majoring on

944
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:34,120
 "is be reconciled to God through Jesus."

945
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:40,460
 Friends, are we living on message tonight?

946
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:42,560
 Here's what I want you to see as we wrap up.

947
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,480
 Jesus is our meaning.

948
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:49,880
 Jesus is our mission, and Jesus is our message.

949
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,880
 That's who Jesus is to us.

950
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:54,840
 This is why this passage is my favorite passage

951
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,920
 in all of scripture.

952
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,640
 But if these things are true,

953
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:01,420
 and I firmly believe they are

954
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:03,220
 because they're right on the Bible,

955
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:10,300
 then I think it's worth building our lives

956
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:13,960
 around knowing Jesus Christ.

957
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,340
 What might that look like?

958
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:18,760
 There's a book that went around about 15 years ago.

959
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:22,380
 Every now and then a new book comes through the church

960
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:23,640
 that everybody says, "Hey, you gotta read this.

961
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:24,520
 "This is amazing.

962
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,680
 "This will change your life."

963
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:28,720
 And then it passes quickly,

964
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:29,720
 and this was one of those books.

965
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,240
 It was called "Blue Like Jazz."

966
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,160
 Maybe you're old and you read it.

967
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,160
 A guy named Donald Miller wrote it.

968
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,000
 It's not a bad book.

969
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,760
 It's just, it was a fad book.

970
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:39,240
 But in this book, he tells this story that I really love.

971
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,080
 Listen to it.

972
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:43,640
 He says, "A guy I knew named Alan went around the country

973
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:46,180
 "asking ministry leaders questions.

974
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:48,280
 "He went to successful churches

975
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,640
 "and asked the pastors what they were doing

976
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,100
 "and why what they were doing was working.

977
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:54,280
 "It sounded very boring."

978
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,120
 I agree.

979
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:58,200
 "For one visit, except for one visit he made

980
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,180
 "to a man named Bill Bright,

981
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:01,920
 "the president of a big ministry.

982
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,380
 "Alan said he was a big man full of life

983
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:08,160
 "who listened without shifting his eyes.

984
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,400
 "Alan asked a few questions.

985
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,240
 "I don't know what they were, but as a final question,

986
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:16,240
 "he asked Dr. Bright what Jesus meant to him.

987
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:20,740
 "Alan said Dr. Bright could not answer the question.

988
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:23,720
 "He said Dr. Bright just started to cry.

989
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:28,820
 "He sat there in his big chair behind his big desk

990
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:29,940
 "and wept.

991
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:32,420
 "When Alan told that story,

992
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:35,080
 "I wondered what it was like to love Jesus that way.

993
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:38,120
 "I knew that I would like to know Jesus like that

994
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,040
 "with my heart, not just my head.

995
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:43,340
 "I felt like that would be the key to something, friends.

996
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:46,320
 "That's the key to everything."

997
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:50,740
 As we close tonight,

998
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:55,140
 I wanna invite you to build your life

999
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:59,120
 entirely around knowing Jesus.

1000
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:02,380
 The simplest way to begin,

1001
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:04,020
 if you don't know where to start,

1002
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:06,460
 before you go to bed tonight,

1003
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:08,820
 as you wake up tomorrow,

1004
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:11,340
 open up your Bible,

1005
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:15,400
 pick a gospel, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John,

1006
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,700
 and just begin to read,

1007
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:21,660
 and just ask Jesus to make himself known to you.

1008
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:24,180
 A relationship with God is different

1009
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:25,400
 than a relationship with a person,

1010
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,580
 but there are some similarities.

1011
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:28,220
 And the way that we get to know Jesus

1012
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:29,540
 is through conversation.

1013
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:34,540
 Jesus speaks to us through his word and his spirit,

1014
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:36,980
 and you and I respond to him in prayer.

1015
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:42,260
 Will you build your life around knowing Jesus?

1016
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:43,100
 Let's pray.

1017
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:45,680
 (gentle music)

1018
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:54,060
 Lord Jesus, thank you that you give our lives meaning.

1019
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:55,580
 Thank you that you give our lives purpose,

1020
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:59,020
 and that you call us to a mission of making you known,

1021
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:02,060
 of knowing you, and making you known to the nations.

1022
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:05,140
 Thank you that you give us a message to lead with,

1023
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:08,260
 that people can be reconciled to God and each other

1024
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:10,700
 through who you are and what you've done.

1025
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:14,140
 Lord, I pray for my friends tonight.

1026
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:16,340
 I pray for those that are hurting and struggling,

1027
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:19,980
 that they would find comfort in you, Jesus.

1028
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:21,960
 I pray for those that are trying to make sense

1029
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:23,460
 of what's happening, that they would make sense

1030
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:25,420
 of all that they see in their lives

1031
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:27,340
 through the lens of you, Jesus.

1032
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:30,640
 I pray for those that are looking for direction

1033
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,660
 and guidance as to what to do next with their lives,

1034
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:35,360
 that they would find purpose in your mission.

1035
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:40,820
 Lord, I pray for those who've not yet believed

1036
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:43,980
 that tonight they would hear the clear message,

1037
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:46,220
 you can be reconciled to God through Jesus.

1038
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:47,060
 Will you believe?

1039
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:51,780
 Lord Jesus, you are the creator of all things.

1040
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:54,540
 All things were created by you, through you,

1041
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:56,060
 and ultimately for you.

1042
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:59,820
 We want to live our lives completely and entirely

1043
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:03,600
 for your glory, together in your good name we pray, amen.

1044
