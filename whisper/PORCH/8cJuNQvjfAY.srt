1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:27,240
 - Well, hi Porsche.

3
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,480
 My name is Harrison Ross

4
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,140
 and I'm excited to be back with you tonight.

5
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,520
 Thank you.

6
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,360
 Yeah.

7
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,200
 Yay for you.

8
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,000
 Why not?

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,320
 Hey, so we're in a series called Mood.

10
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,140
 You just saw that.

11
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,220
 And last week, Dave and Marvin kicked us off

12
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:47,540
 and he gave us this overview,

13
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:49,160
 kicking us into the series,

14
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,240
 talking about for the next few weeks,

15
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,760
 what does the Bible have to say about emotions?

16
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:55,600
 We all have them.

17
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,040
 It's a human experience.

18
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,760
 We all experience these emotions and these feelings.

19
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:01,680
 And so what do we do with it?

20
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,560
 And all of us experience different things.

21
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,440
 Some of us cross over and have similar emotions.

22
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,960
 Sometimes we experience similar things or different things

23
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,800
 and experience different emotions.

24
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,180
 Sometimes that's subjective,

25
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:16,580
 but there are a few things that are not subjective.

26
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:19,880
 When you are placed in that place or that experience,

27
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,440
 it evokes something in you, a feeling, an emotion.

28
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,400
 If you don't believe me,

29
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:29,720
 what happens when you see these images right here?

30
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,640
 Where are you?

31
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,520
 Yes, vacation.

32
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,920
 Everything away from what you hate right now.

33
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,520
 Your job, your life,

34
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,040
 you're sitting there with a Corona in hand

35
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,040
 or a virgin mocktail for those that are out there.

36
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,860
 And you're just living a dream.

37
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,200
 You're loving life.

38
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,120
 You're completely sunburned

39
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,160
 'cause you're convinced I can get away with it.

40
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,200
 I'm young.

41
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,600
 I don't have leathery skin.

42
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,040
 I'll be fine.

43
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,680
 Said everyone else.

44
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,840
 And you look like a lobster,

45
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,760
 but you're on the beach and life is good.

46
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,120
 It fills you with delight and joy.

47
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,460
 Maybe the beach isn't your scene.

48
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:12,060
 You're into mountains or maybe this is your scene.

49
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,440
 College football season.

50
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,480
 (audience cheering)

51
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,520
 Oh goodness.

52
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,560
 I knew that would happen.

53
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,240
 This is a terrible choice.

54
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,160
 But here you are.

55
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,100
 You're at the game.

56
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:21,940
 It's game day.

57
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:22,980
 You're excited.

58
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,600
 Maybe you're in the season

59
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,720
 and your team's winning.

60
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,640
 The Aggies aren't my team.

61
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,400
 And you know, that experience where you're there,

62
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,720
 you're there together and they throw that long pass

63
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,200
 and you're like biting your nails

64
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,040
 and your girlfriend's like, "Why are we here?"

65
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,000
 And you're just like, you're in that moment

66
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,880
 and they score.

67
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,280
 You know, Dale Beckham's, he reaches out

68
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,120
 and he's like, (imitates gun firing)

69
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,200
 and he breaks his collarbone.

70
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,800
 And you're like, "Yeah!"

71
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,160
 You're high-fiving.

72
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,860
 It fills you with joy.

73
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,400
 Or maybe more than sports,

74
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,720
 you just love to watch your team lose.

75
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,800
 I hate the Aggies.

76
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,520
 I find joy.

77
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,360
 It's fine.

78
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,440
 (audience cheering)

79
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,920
 I find joy when the Aggies lose

80
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,080
 and I go, "Yeah, you just got whooped!

81
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,040
 "Whoop that!"

82
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:08,960
 It's amazing.

83
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,480
 It fills me with joy.

84
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,600
 Maybe different feelings.

85
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,000
 But sports do that.

86
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,400
 Now maybe neither of those things are your thing.

87
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,400
 But universally, we all know

88
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,720
 that this fills us with joy.

89
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,720
 Puppies, oh I know.

90
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,880
 It's just like, oh my goodness!

91
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,920
 Ah!

92
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,680
 It just doesn't matter who you are.

93
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,360
 Now there's a reason we didn't put cats up there

94
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,780
 because cats are divisive.

95
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,580
 Cats are disgusting.

96
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:39,200
 If you're a cat person, I'm not saying you're disgusting.

97
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,560
 Hiss away, you're an Aggie, that's fine.

98
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:45,040
 But we love puppies!

99
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,740
 We love puppies!

100
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:48,440
 They're just cute and cuddly.

101
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,680
 The problem is they grow into dogs

102
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,080
 and then they eat everything.

103
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:57,440
 But we see these things and it gives us this feeling,

104
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:02,080
 this emotion that we all can relate to.

105
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,120
 It's joy.

106
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:11,120
 This feeling of joy.

107
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,400
 And we want it.

108
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,400
 And then we spend our life chasing it

109
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,840
 from experience to experience.

110
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:23,140
 And so tonight, we're gonna look at how can we have joy?

111
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,660
 Because here's the problem.

112
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:30,960
 Life's not just vacations and football games and puppies.

113
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,320
 Life's a beach.

114
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:39,000
 Maybe life's a beach when you're there

115
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,040
 one or two weeks of the year,

116
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,360
 but everything else, it's hard!

117
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,000
 It's difficult!

118
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,740
 It's sometimes boring!

119
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:49,820
 And your team loses!

120
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:52,140
 And it's not always elation and joy

121
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,100
 and you're allergic to puppies!

122
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,860
 It doesn't fill you with joy!

123
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:59,560
 And you get rejected.

124
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,240
 But the guy or the girl that you care most about,

125
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,940
 they don't want you.

126
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:07,660
 Or you don't get that job that you wanted.

127
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,580
 You get turned down for that job.

128
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,740
 Or you can't even get a job.

129
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,060
 Or you start looking through Instagram

130
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:20,620
 and your life looks nothing else like everyone else's life.

131
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,120
 Or maybe if you're honest,

132
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,660
 your life looks nothing like you thought it would

133
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,800
 when you got to this point in your life.

134
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:33,220
 You're not Drake, 25, sitting on 25 mil.

135
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,680
 That's not your life.

136
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:40,820
 But through all of this,

137
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,660
 maybe you're not one of those things.

138
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:46,220
 Maybe you've gotten everything you've ever wanted

139
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,580
 and still you don't have joy.

140
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,380
 Maybe you are like Jake.

141
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,660
 Maybe you've got millions, you've got success,

142
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:55,260
 you've got status, you've got that guy or girl,

143
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,580
 and it's leaving you empty.

144
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:02,020
 You know what the Bible says?

145
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,980
 The Bible says that regardless

146
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:06,020
 of where you are on that spectrum,

147
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:08,140
 regardless if you've had the best life

148
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,340
 and everybody wants it,

149
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,580
 or you've had the worst life

150
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,340
 and no one wants to be in your shoes,

151
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:16,140
 the Bible says you can have joy.

152
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:22,100
 And so tonight we're gonna look at how do we have joy.

153
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,020
 We're gonna look at what is joy,

154
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,180
 what keeps us from having joy,

155
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,920
 and then how can I have it?

156
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,620
 So first, what is joy?

157
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,860
 Joy in the dictionary is defined as this,

158
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:37,420
 a feeling of great pleasure and happiness.

159
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:40,740
 Yeah, describes what we feel when we see it.

160
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:45,540
 Oftentimes when the Bible speaks of that feeling

161
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:48,160
 or emotion or experience, it talks about delight.

162
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,420
 All throughout the scriptures, it speaks of delight,

163
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:54,020
 111 times throughout the Bible.

164
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,680
 And delight is synonymous.

165
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,700
 It's the same thing as joy, happiness,

166
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:05,140
 satisfaction, extreme pleasure, and fulfillment.

167
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,340
 Psalm 37, four, it says,

168
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,320
 "Delight yourself in the Lord,

169
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:16,720
 "and He will give you the desires of your heart."

170
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,760
 Happiness, joy, fulfillment, extreme pleasure,

171
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:25,280
 satisfaction, this feeling we all want.

172
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,220
 But I wanna shatter something for you.

173
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:32,280
 Joy isn't just something you wake up

174
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,800
 and you're like, "Oh, it's a great day, hurrah!"

175
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,280
 And then the music starts playing

176
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,080
 and you start high-fiving everybody.

177
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,280
 That's what we all want,

178
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,620
 is it just to kind of happen to us.

179
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:48,520
 But joy isn't a mood, it's a choice.

180
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:53,040
 Joy is not something that's just going to happen to you.

181
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,720
 Joy is something you choose to walk in.

182
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,680
 And I'm gonna explain that through the rest of this message.

183
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,400
 Joy is not a mood, it is a choice.

184
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,640
 What this scripture says, again,

185
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,640
 delight is a synonym with joy.

186
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,320
 It doesn't say, "Oh, you're gonna have joy,

187
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:12,280
 "you're gonna feel joy, you're gonna feel delight."

188
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:16,520
 It's not a noun, it's not something that we're pursuing,

189
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:21,120
 it's something that we pursue, to delight in,

190
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,880
 to find joy in, another synonym, to enjoy.

191
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:30,760
 It's not a mood, joy is not a mood, it's a choice.

192
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,000
 Because what you're looking for is happiness.

193
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,820
 Most of the time when we say,

194
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,360
 "Oh, I want joy and I wanna be joyful."

195
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,360
 What you mean is, "I wanna be happy.

196
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,840
 "I want what I want.

197
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:44,020
 "I want everything in my life to go really, really well

198
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,980
 "so that I can be awesome and beautiful

199
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,960
 "and everyone will love me."

200
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:51,660
 And we can giggle, but we all feel it.

201
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:55,320
 What you're looking for is not joy,

202
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,000
 the mood you want is happiness.

203
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,960
 That's not joy, joy is completely different.

204
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,960
 It's not happiness,

205
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:05,480
 because happiness is dependent on our circumstances.

206
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,700
 Happiness is dependent on everything going well,

207
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,500
 or me winning the lottery,

208
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:14,500
 or me blowing a red light and not getting in a wreck.

209
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:18,100
 I'm like, "Oh, yes, ha ha ha."

210
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,660
 It's dependent on my circumstance.

211
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:22,220
 Joy has nothing to do with my circumstance,

212
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,340
 it has everything to do with my Savior.

213
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:27,940
 It's not dependent on everything around me,

214
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:31,580
 I can have joy regardless of what's happening in my life.

215
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:35,400
 That's what the Scripture teaches all over the place,

216
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:39,340
 because joy isn't a mood, it's different.

217
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:43,260
 It's a choice, and if you don't believe me,

218
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,660
 people do this all the time.

219
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:50,300
 I mean, you can think of people whose life is in shambles,

220
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:53,540
 and they have a smile on their face,

221
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:55,180
 not because they're faking happiness,

222
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:57,920
 because they have something that maybe we don't have.

223
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:01,960
 Or they're going through a terrible situation,

224
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,500
 they're going through a terrible sickness in their family,

225
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:08,060
 and these people have something, it's hope.

226
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:11,260
 And in that, they can choose to have joy.

227
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:16,140
 When I was in, a few years ago,

228
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,740
 my wife, she has three siblings,

229
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:22,260
 and one of her brothers died in a motorcycle accident,

230
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:25,420
 out of nowhere, random, catastrophic.

231
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:31,420
 And in most families where a death occurs,

232
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,900
 not only is that hard to deal with,

233
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,520
 but it breaks the family apart.

234
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:38,140
 Many divorce, I mean, the divorce rates skyrockets,

235
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:40,380
 siblings start to just gripe with each other

236
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,980
 and hate each other.

237
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:45,600
 But I saw something different in my father-in-law.

238
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,660
 He stood strong, and he chose to have joy

239
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,500
 in the midst of a terrible circumstance.

240
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,600
 No one wakes up and goes, "I hope my son dies today,

241
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,240
 "because I'd love to have joy."

242
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:03,240
 But regardless of his circumstance, he chose joy.

243
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,920
 Not because everything was good,

244
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,760
 but because he chose the goodness of God

245
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,100
 in the midst of everything being terrible.

246
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,600
 If you look at the scriptures,

247
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:17,500
 and Paul is going all over the Grecian world,

248
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,240
 and he is getting just persecuted,

249
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,960
 and put in prison, and beaten, and he sings.

250
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,280
 That's crazy.

251
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:31,040
 He's sitting there, he and Silas are chained to a wall,

252
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,480
 not just like, "Man, this is a bummer again."

253
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:37,720
 They're probably elevated, hung by their arms and their legs

254
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:41,920
 hanging on a wall, probably thinking they're going to die,

255
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,760
 and they're worshiping God.

256
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,880
 Not 'cause they're like, "This is awesome, God,

257
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,600
 "we have a house, a roof over our head."

258
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,820
 It's terrible, but they chose joy,

259
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,920
 regardless of their circumstance.

260
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,840
 And there are scriptures, there are stories

261
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,680
 throughout the Bible that show the same thing.

262
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,760
 Because Paul had it figured out.

263
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:06,440
 Joy is not from his circumstance, it's from his contentment.

264
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,880
 That God is who he says he is,

265
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,240
 that he's gonna do what he says he's gonna do,

266
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,320
 even if it doesn't happen in this life.

267
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,180
 And in that, he can have joy.

268
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:18,860
 Philippians 4, 11 through 13.

269
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:21,800
 Hold on, before I read it.

270
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,040
 Some people know probably Philippians 4, 13.

271
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,120
 Uh, apparently I don't.

272
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,200
 (laughing)

273
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,360
 I could do all things through Christ who strengthens me.

274
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,060
 Yeah, you see the college football players

275
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,960
 put it on their eye black, or the high school players,

276
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,120
 they're like, "Yeah, I'm bad."

277
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,300
 And they just are like, "Man, we're gonna do it,

278
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:46,280
 "we're gonna win this season, 'cause we've got God, yes!"

279
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,440
 And we take it completely out of context,

280
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,920
 it's not what it means.

281
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,920
 This is the context, Philippians 4, verse 11.

282
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,320
 "Not that I'm speaking of being in need,

283
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,240
 "for I have learned in whatever situation

284
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,780
 "I am to be content.

285
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:01,240
 "I know how to be brought low, I know how to abound.

286
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,180
 "And in every circumstance, I have learned the secret

287
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:09,180
 "of facing plenty, and hunger, abundance, and in need.

288
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:14,460
 "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me."

289
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:20,620
 Joy is not a mood, it is a choice.

290
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,520
 But what keeps us from having joy?

291
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:28,400
 What keeps us from choosing that?

292
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:32,320
 I think the biggest thing is we choose the wrong things.

293
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:37,720
 We always have a choice, but choosing joy is not easy.

294
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,760
 Choosing joy is not often fun.

295
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,360
 Choosing joy isn't most of our first steps.

296
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,240
 We choose these other things, because like I read earlier

297
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:49,200
 in Psalm 37, four, it says that we can delight in him

298
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,840
 and he'll fulfill the desires of our heart,

299
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,740
 but I think we flip it around.

300
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:58,000
 Because too often we look for our desires

301
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 to bring us delight, but God has created us to delight

302
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,020
 in him and he will fulfill our desires.

303
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:08,840
 Too often we think, if I go chase what I want,

304
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,560
 I go chase what I think I need,

305
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,800
 I go chase what my heart is telling me and I'm feeling,

306
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,540
 I'll have joy.

307
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:18,640
 That's not what this verse says.

308
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,500
 That's not what the scriptures teach.

309
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:25,820
 That if I choose to enjoy him, I choose to have joy

310
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:30,260
 in Christ, I'll have everything I could ever ask,

311
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:34,780
 or think, or imagine, but we choose the wrong things.

312
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,960
 We're focused on the wrong things.

313
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,980
 We become focused on our feelings,

314
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:43,080
 what we think our heart wants, what our heart's telling us.

315
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:46,460
 Just, man, whatever your heart says, just go do that.

316
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,660
 I don't know, what's your heart telling you?

317
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,260
 I don't know, it tells me something different every hour

318
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,780
 and I can't tell if it's heartburn.

319
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,940
 But we get focused on our feelings

320
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:00,220
 and we chase these experiences.

321
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:02,620
 We chase these highs to give us something,

322
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,740
 thinking if I just chase my feeling,

323
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,460
 then I'll have what I want,

324
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:08,860
 and we chase the highs, the party life,

325
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:11,820
 the weekend warrior, the next promotion,

326
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:16,820
 the next relationship, and we just pursue our emotions,

327
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:20,000
 our emotional experiences, and that happens

328
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,720
 in the Christian life all the time,

329
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,820
 even in pursuing godly things.

330
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,680
 We want that great worship experience,

331
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,400
 we wanna feel close to God.

332
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,480
 I hear all the time, I just,

333
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,920
 I don't know that I feel God's there.

334
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,560
 It's 'cause you're focused on the wrong things.

335
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,880
 You're focused on what you feel.

336
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,720
 You're not focused on God.

337
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:44,680
 We're focused on the wrong things, our feelings,

338
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:49,680
 or our flesh, not just what we feel, but what we want,

339
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,900
 what we desire, the carnal nature within us.

340
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,740
 We just want what we want.

341
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,460
 You don't withhold anything.

342
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,500
 Anything that you want, you go after it.

343
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,980
 It's like a buffet.

344
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:02,600
 I love buffets.

345
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,640
 You're just like, give me a plate and give me another.

346
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,620
 Give me that tray so I can go four on there.

347
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:09,540
 You just take it 'cause you can and you want it.

348
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:12,900
 I lived my life that way for so long.

349
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,180
 I was addicted to pornography for 12 years,

350
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,880
 and part of that struggle is because

351
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,760
 I just chased what I wanted.

352
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:22,040
 I chased what I thought would give me pleasure,

353
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:25,740
 would give me life, would fill me with something,

354
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:28,220
 'cause I wasn't feeling joy.

355
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:36,480
 It's those impulse actions, those things we jump at

356
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,760
 because we just think we want it.

357
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:42,700
 We become focused on our feeling, on our flesh.

358
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:45,840
 And when we do that, when we chase our desires,

359
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,380
 that doesn't lead to delight.

360
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,700
 It doesn't lead to joy.

361
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,520
 It leads to despair.

362
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:53,820
 And then spiritually, it just leaves us jaded

363
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:58,660
 because many of us in this room, you go,

364
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:02,100
 well, hey, I love Jesus, but I don't feel joy.

365
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:06,700
 I wanna try to choose joy, but I don't feel that

366
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:12,300
 because we become focused on the wrong things

367
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:15,460
 instead of the pursuit of our God.

368
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:19,060
 The last one that we focus wrongly is in just fantasy.

369
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:23,820
 What I mean by fantasy is not just where our mind

370
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,900
 can go sexually, but just this world

371
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:28,120
 that really isn't reality.

372
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:30,500
 We just get distracted.

373
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,580
 We live in a world that's got more devices

374
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,260
 and more stuff that can take our attention

375
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:37,260
 and more pings and alerts and blah, bing, bing, bing.

376
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,140
 Like, I hate wearing an Apple Watch anymore

377
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:41,400
 'cause I'm just like, wow, do I have arthritis?

378
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,140
 I'm just buzzing all the time.

379
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:46,020
 And we just get distracted.

380
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:51,020
 The glow of our phone, the constant Instagram feed,

381
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:55,360
 Netflix, what everyone else has and we don't.

382
00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:00,140
 Then there are some of you in this room that you go,

383
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,860
 well, I've got joy.

384
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:02,980
 I don't need God.

385
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:07,260
 I feel joy all the time.

386
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,620
 I'm living with my boyfriend.

387
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,900
 Life is good.

388
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,900
 I got one red check, boy.

389
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,380
 I don't need anything else.

390
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:16,620
 I've got joy.

391
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:17,460
 I don't need God.

392
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,480
 Okay.

393
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:23,400
 Again, I'd say, I think you may have some happiness.

394
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:29,560
 And can you have happiness outside of godly things?

395
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,860
 Yeah, absolutely.

396
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,440
 But it's not gonna last.

397
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,860
 It's not joy.

398
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:37,580
 It's not a constant state of being,

399
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,060
 regardless of your circumstance.

400
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:41,140
 That's completely dependent on your circumstance.

401
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,340
 And some of you that are saying,

402
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,660
 hey, I've got joy and I don't need God.

403
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:47,540
 Friend of mine uses an illustration.

404
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,420
 It's like free falling.

405
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,840
 If we just took a video of someone just like,

406
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,860
 (yells)

407
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,620
 skydiving and no parachute, you'd be like,

408
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,600
 wow, they're living the dream.

409
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,900
 Until they hit the ground.

410
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:03,060
 Or they're jumping from building to building.

411
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,620
 When you're suspended in free fall

412
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,980
 and it seems like you've got no care in the world,

413
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,580
 that's great.

414
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,420
 But eventually, there's another side.

415
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:13,660
 What I'd tell you is if you're here

416
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:16,980
 and you think that you can have joy outside of Jesus,

417
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:20,020
 then you're missing out on what God's got for you.

418
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,660
 Eternity's coming.

419
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,200
 And it's not a scare tactic.

420
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,700
 Because that's there, Jesus pursues you and he loves you

421
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:32,600
 and he wants you to know him so you can have joy.

422
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:36,520
 But we get focused on the wrong thing.

423
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,020
 Second Corinthians 4:18.

424
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:40,700
 As we look not to the things that are seen

425
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,420
 but to the things that are unseen.

426
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,280
 For the things that are seen are transient

427
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,140
 but the things that are unseen are eternal.

428
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:50,640
 We get so focused on here, so focused on me,

429
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,120
 so focused on what I feel, on my flesh and what it wants

430
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,980
 and on this fantasy that we wanna create

431
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:59,360
 that we miss out on an eternal perspective.

432
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:04,800
 John Piper asks it this way.

433
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:09,800
 If you could have all the pleasures in this world or God,

434
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,220
 what would you choose?

435
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:16,480
 Like if you could have your dream job,

436
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,780
 you could have more money

437
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,960
 than you could ever imagine you could ever have.

438
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,960
 You could have the hottest wife or the hottest husband

439
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,240
 and however many kids you want

440
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,620
 or whatever lifestyle you want,

441
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:27,800
 if you could choose that right now,

442
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,200
 snap your fingers and have it.

443
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,220
 Or you could have God and have none of it ever again.

444
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:35,820
 What would you choose?

445
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:40,460
 I know what I should choose

446
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:43,380
 but I know what I wanna choose.

447
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:47,460
 I know where my feelings take me.

448
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:51,020
 I know where my circumstances make me wanna go find joy

449
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,780
 in everything around me.

450
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:55,560
 I know I can choose Jesus.

451
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:59,180
 I know I can choose God theologically, conceptually

452
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:01,060
 but really what I want?

453
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,100
 I want fame.

454
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,280
 I want security.

455
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:08,960
 I want those experiences of elation and excitement.

456
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,220
 I wanna feel God.

457
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,220
 I will do that at the expense

458
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:15,700
 of even deepening my relationship with Jesus

459
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:18,120
 because I want what I want.

460
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:23,080
 I know what I should choose

461
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,460
 but I know what I wanna choose.

462
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:25,300
 And you know what?

463
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,420
 I'm so glad Jesus didn't

464
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:30,720
 'cause he had the same choice I did.

465
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:34,320
 He's the same choice that we all did

466
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,760
 to choose this world or something far greater.

467
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,600
 And when he could choose to be the ruler

468
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,120
 of all that was here, he knew he already was

469
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:47,020
 and so he rejected that and he chose me and he chose you.

470
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:51,640
 What keeps us from having joy

471
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:54,640
 is we are consumed with everything else in our life

472
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,200
 instead of being consumed with the one thing

473
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,160
 that will give us life.

474
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,460
 Jesus.

475
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:05,500
 So how do you have joy?

476
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,460
 You choose Jesus.

477
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:11,920
 You're like, okay, thank you.

478
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,200
 Glad I showed up.

479
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,040
 What a Bible answer.

480
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:20,940
 And it may seem like it's not enough

481
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:24,440
 but that's what God gives us all throughout the scriptures.

482
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,200
 That's why Jesus came.

483
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,600
 That's why he came and dwelt among us.

484
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,040
 That's why he died.

485
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:34,840
 And honestly, as I'm preparing this message,

486
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:37,440
 I'm wrestling with, well, how can I have joy?

487
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,800
 How can I delight in the Lord?

488
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,320
 I don't really know.

489
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,000
 Sometimes it's this like ethereal idea

490
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,280
 but I'm called to do it and I can have it because of Jesus.

491
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,860
 Not in what I get from him,

492
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:53,600
 not in what I feel when I choose to follow him faithfully

493
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,720
 but because of him.

494
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,680
 I've been married to my wife for eight years.

495
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:04,000
 When I started dating her, well, before I started dating her

496
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,440
 I would see her in the halls.

497
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,760
 I'm like, man, that girl's cute.

498
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,580
 I'd see her more and more.

499
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:10,320
 I was like, man, that girl's got something going on.

500
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,840
 That girl is attractive.

501
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,160
 And so I asked her out.

502
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:18,600
 We went on a couple dates and I just had fun with her.

503
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,960
 I enjoyed her.

504
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,360
 She made me laugh.

505
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,800
 I enjoyed our conversation.

506
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,660
 I enjoyed being with her.

507
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:27,560
 And so I went and asked her dad, bought a ring,

508
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,840
 got down on one knee and I asked her to marry me.

509
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,840
 I didn't ask her to marry me so I could get a tax write-off.

510
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:35,120
 It's ridiculous.

511
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,760
 I didn't ask her to marry me so that I could come home

512
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,220
 and have dinner every night.

513
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:44,020
 I didn't ask her to marry me so that I could have babies.

514
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:50,000
 I didn't marry her because I have a California king bed

515
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,920
 that's way too big for one person.

516
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:56,640
 I didn't marry her because I love to spend twice as much

517
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,780
 on every meal when we go out to eat.

518
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:02,520
 I married her because I love her.

519
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:06,320
 I married her because I choose her, because I enjoy her.

520
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,760
 I delight in her.

521
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,760
 I didn't marry her for the things I can get from her.

522
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,680
 I married her for her.

523
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:19,320
 I married her because I enjoy her.

524
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:28,260
 So what is the experience of enjoying God like?

525
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:31,760
 What does it practically look like to have satisfaction

526
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,520
 and fulfillment in God?

527
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:38,880
 It's the joy of knowing the person of God

528
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,240
 through Jesus Christ.

529
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,040
 It's not in what God can give you.

530
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,960
 It's not in what he's gonna do for you.

531
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,680
 It's what he's already done for you.

532
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:49,760
 It's what Jesus has done on the cross.

533
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,280
 And it didn't stop there.

534
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,080
 He defeated sin and death.

535
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,440
 He is the only person that rose from the grave

536
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,440
 and never died again.

537
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:02,440
 And he did that so that you could have life in him

538
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:05,900
 by having a relationship with the living God.

539
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:09,240
 And in that is fullness of joy.

540
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:14,400
 Psalm 16, 11 says that very thing.

541
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,460
 You make known to me the path of life.

542
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:20,200
 In your presence, there is fullness of joy.

543
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:24,600
 At your right hand are pleasures forevermore.

544
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,880
 The enjoyment of God is the enjoyment

545
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:30,000
 of the person of Jesus.

546
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,600
 I already said it earlier,

547
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,040
 but our joy is not found in our circumstances.

548
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,440
 Our joy is dependent on our Savior.

549
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:44,000
 Our joy is the pursuit, not of our desires,

550
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,520
 but the pursuit of the God of the universe, Jesus Christ,

551
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:52,280
 who loves you, who gave himself for you.

552
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,580
 Because you wanna know something that's crazy?

553
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:57,240
 He finds joy in you.

554
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,680
 He delights in you.

555
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,800
 The reason you can have joy

556
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,920
 is because he's the one that's pursuing you.

557
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:11,020
 And when you choose Jesus, you have him.

558
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:14,720
 Jesus didn't just die so that I could go to heaven.

559
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,400
 Oh, I'm so thankful that I get to spend eternity with him.

560
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,600
 Jesus didn't just die so that I don't have to go to hell,

561
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,680
 although I'm glad I don't have to spend forever

562
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,480
 eternally separated from him.

563
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,000
 Jesus didn't just die so that I don't have to have sin

564
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,320
 rule my life anymore, although I'm so grateful.

565
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:35,160
 Jesus died to give me God,

566
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:38,560
 the greatest thing I could ever imagine.

567
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:42,640
 He died so that I could have God.

568
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:50,200
 The spirit of God, if I believe in him, dwells in me.

569
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:53,400
 His power is fully present in me.

570
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,880
 And for all who believe, that's crazy.

571
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:02,020
 And that is our source of joy.

572
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:05,520
 So how do you have joy?

573
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,460
 It's through relationship with Jesus.

574
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:10,400
 When I say choose Jesus, it's not just like,

575
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,400
 all right, Jesus, step in, buddy.

576
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,200
 Come on, let's take out dating.

577
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,520
 Jesus, you're in.

578
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:20,720
 I choose to walk in him.

579
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,600
 I choose to have relationship with him,

580
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,340
 to link my life to his life,

581
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:27,800
 to choose that he will be the source of my life,

582
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:31,920
 the source of my power, because I submit myself to him.

583
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:36,040
 John 15 says this.

584
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,160
 He says, "Abide in me, and I in you,

585
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,080
 "as the branch cannot bear fruit by itself

586
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,580
 "unless it abides in the vine,

587
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,300
 "neither can you unless you abide in me.

588
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,500
 "I am the vine, you are the branches.

589
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,700
 "Whoever abides in me and I in him,

590
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:52,020
 "he it is that bears much fruit,

591
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:55,860
 "for apart from me you can do nothing."

592
00:27:55,860 --> 00:28:00,520
 Jesus died so that we could be reconciled to God.

593
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:03,160
 We could be made in right relationship with him,

594
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:07,660
 to love him and be loved by him through relationship.

595
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,480
 And joy is a product of that relationship,

596
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,960
 not something we go searching for in our desires

597
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,040
 and our pleasures and whatever.

598
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:21,520
 It is a fruit of staying connected to Jesus.

599
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,600
 It is the produce.

600
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,720
 That's what fruit is in the grocery store,

601
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:28,640
 unless you all just like Walmart pickup and Amazon it,

602
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,760
 you've never been to a grocery store,

603
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,960
 but it is what comes from the vine.

604
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:38,680
 Joy is a product of a relationship with Jesus,

605
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,920
 and so how do we have that relationship?

606
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,600
 We spend time in his word.

607
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,160
 First, you gotta believe.

608
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,680
 You gotta believe that he's the savior of your life.

609
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,720
 You gotta believe that what he did on the cross

610
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:53,240
 is enough for you to satisfy your deepest needs,

611
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,020
 that you don't have to chase it in this world,

612
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,160
 but you can choose him.

613
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:01,520
 And then you can daily sit in scripture

614
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,280
 and be reminded of his promises.

615
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,480
 We just sang that song at the end,

616
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,200
 to rest in his promises.

617
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,920
 We don't read this because it's a playbook

618
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,480
 that's gonna make me a better person.

619
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,240
 That's not Christianity.

620
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,160
 That's not why we love Jesus.

621
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,400
 I read this so that I can be reminded

622
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,660
 of who God is and how he loves me.

623
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:23,780
 When I read this and I rest in his promises,

624
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:25,080
 I know that I'm loved,

625
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:28,160
 that I'm accepted,

626
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:31,960
 that I'm forgiven, I'm wanted,

627
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,880
 I'm a part of something, I matter to God.

628
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,680
 I'm a child of God.

629
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:41,720
 And in that, I find great joy,

630
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,080
 fullness of pleasure,

631
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:46,520
 pleasures forevermore.

632
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:49,720
 So we do that through his word, through his people,

633
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:52,540
 community that's all around us, his church,

634
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,500
 because we forget.

635
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,720
 We gotta remind each other, encourage each other.

636
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:58,560
 And then as I said earlier, his spirit is within you.

637
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:02,320
 And as we abide in him, as we remain in him

638
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:06,100
 and find joy in him, have relationship with him,

639
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:12,220
 then joy is the product.

640
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:14,820
 And so how do I delight in the Lord?

641
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:18,080
 Let me just simplify it way more.

642
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,760
 How do I delight in the Lord?

643
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,400
 Practically, how does that look?

644
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,480
 How do I live it out?

645
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,600
 What's my next step instead of this ideological thing?

646
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:30,880
 One of the ways is just do what makes you love God more.

647
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:35,360
 And again, that may sound crazy,

648
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,720
 but some of y'all are trying to find joy

649
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,040
 in a relationship with Jesus

650
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,320
 by doing things you don't really enjoy.

651
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:44,880
 We've kind of gone in these Christian circles of,

652
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,240
 okay, I've gotta have a two-hour quiet time.

653
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,960
 I'm really gonna be a religious person

654
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,640
 and I've gotta memorize all of these texts

655
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,120
 and I've gotta go through these things

656
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,920
 and I've gotta make sure I don't miss church on Sundays.

657
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:59,360
 And you're miserable

658
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,120
 'cause you don't enjoy it.

659
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,120
 Now, are those things bad?

660
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,200
 No, they're life-giving.

661
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,740
 We've gotta stay rooted in his word and connected to him.

662
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,700
 We need to fellowship with other believers

663
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,720
 and worship with them.

664
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,720
 But don't just do what everyone else is doing.

665
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,340
 Do what you love.

666
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:18,840
 One of the ways to do the things

667
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:21,340
 that make you love God more is do what you love.

668
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:25,220
 I'm not a guy that likes to just sit for four hours

669
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:26,920
 in scripture and read Leviticus.

670
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,140
 I'm like, oh.

671
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,920
 Whatever.

672
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:35,160
 I love to be behind a boat on a wakeboard.

673
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,520
 When I get up at a sunrise and I'm standing behind a boat,

674
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,880
 my legs are throbbing because I need to work out.

675
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:42,400
 And it is just a glassy lake.

676
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,980
 That's worship for me.

677
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:46,120
 I am connected to the Father.

678
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:50,140
 I am close to him and worshiping in his creation,

679
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:52,560
 in the mountains, in a starry sky.

680
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:55,320
 What is it that you love to do?

681
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,400
 Worship him in that.

682
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,680
 First Corinthians 10 says, "Whether you eat or drink,

683
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:02,000
 "whatever you do, do it for the glory of the Lord."

684
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,280
 Worship him.

685
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:08,080
 Joy in the Lord doesn't just come from godly things.

686
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:11,480
 Everything that brings us joy and delight and happiness

687
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,620
 is given by God.

688
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:15,920
 So enjoy him in the things that you enjoy.

689
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,960
 And then do what you're good at.

690
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:23,060
 Duh.

691
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:24,880
 He made you that way.

692
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,440
 And some of you, again, are you just trying

693
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,680
 to fit yourself in this box?

694
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,840
 You don't have to fit in a box.

695
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,740
 He made you uniquely.

696
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:33,600
 Maybe you love to do art.

697
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,320
 Maybe you love accounting.

698
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,040
 I don't know why.

699
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,680
 But God bless you, he's made you to love numbers.

700
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,680
 Then go do that.

701
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,320
 The other way that the scripture says this

702
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,760
 is to use your gifts.

703
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:48,080
 Maybe you love to encourage people or to serve people

704
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,680
 or to invite them into your home.

705
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:52,960
 Do those things for the glory of the Lord,

706
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,120
 to wrap it all up.

707
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,940
 Choose Jesus and choose joy.

708
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:00,300
 Joy isn't just this selfish pursuit

709
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:04,720
 that if I go and find what I want, then I'll have joy.

710
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,760
 It's in Jesus.

711
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:09,680
 The Clemson football coach,

712
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,300
 when they won the national championship last year,

713
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:13,660
 he said a quote.

714
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:15,260
 He said, "Well, I just try to have joy."

715
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,340
 Here's what joy is.

716
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:19,380
 Jesus first, others, and then you.

717
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:23,740
 He just says, "It, our source of joy,"

718
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:25,340
 that spells joy, by the way,

719
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:29,020
 "Our source of joy is Jesus.

720
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:31,060
 "And from our joy in Jesus,

721
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:33,940
 "it then leads us to serve and love others."

722
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:37,660
 Not just serve and love ourselves,

723
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:40,060
 but most of us flip it around and we have yaj.

724
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:43,940
 No one wants yaj.

725
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:46,540
 They want joy.

726
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:47,940
 It's not about you.

727
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,860
 And it's not about hanging with other people

728
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,220
 so that you feel better about you

729
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:53,220
 and then somewhere Jesus fits in.

730
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:54,300
 That's backwards.

731
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:57,660
 How do you have joy?

732
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:00,400
 Choose Jesus and live in relationship with him.

733
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:04,680
 And guys, there are some people in this room

734
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:07,380
 who are going through really hard circumstances.

735
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:11,180
 And as we addressed earlier, circumstances are real.

736
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:14,100
 And it isn't just this pithy thing to go,

737
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:15,740
 "Well, just get over it and choose joy."

738
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:16,900
 Those are really hard.

739
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:20,460
 And one of the ways that the Bible

740
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:25,420
 reminds God's people continually of who he is

741
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:29,120
 is when they gather together like this and they rejoice.

742
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:33,620
 They don't just stand there and just go, "My life sucks.

743
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:35,200
 "I hate it.

744
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,800
 "Yeah, you tell me how much your life's terrible."

745
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:41,100
 They gather together and they focus on God.

746
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:43,340
 And they rejoice in who he is

747
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:45,100
 and they rejoice in his promises.

748
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:48,460
 Rejoice, what that word means is to take great pleasure

749
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:52,500
 and joy and delight in and take action.

750
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,740
 It's to worship.

751
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:56,060
 It's to sing whenever you're chained on the wall

752
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:58,020
 or your life is in shambles.

753
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:00,460
 And if you're here and that is your circumstance,

754
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:03,220
 then listen to the people of God sing over you

755
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:05,940
 the truth of who God is and how he loves you.

756
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:08,060
 We're gonna sing Psalm 34.

757
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:11,740
 Taste and see that the Lord is good.

758
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:13,800
 Blessed is he who hides in him.

759
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:17,740
 It's not just this far off idea.

760
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:20,580
 It is something that if you choose it, you taste it,

761
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:22,820
 you will see the goodness of God

762
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:25,360
 lived out fully in your life.

763
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,820
 Let me pray and then we'll sing.

764
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:31,500
 Heavenly Father, thank you for Jesus.

765
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,100
 Thank you that we don't have to walk this earth

766
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:33,960
 trying to figure it out.

767
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,100
 We don't have to walk this earth

768
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:37,900
 trying to make ourselves better or more lovely

769
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,700
 or more good or gooder.

770
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:42,300
 We can trust you.

771
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,420
 We can choose you.

772
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:45,220
 We can choose life in you

773
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:48,060
 because when you were here, you said,

774
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:51,940
 "I have come that you may have life and life abundantly,

775
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:56,940
 "life to the full, life with fullness of joy."

776
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:59,260
 And Lord, we're easily distracted

777
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:03,100
 by all the things in our life where our feelings take us,

778
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:04,520
 where we wanna place our focus

779
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,460
 and what we wanna choose that isn't you.

780
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:08,000
 And so Lord, help us.

781
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:13,220
 Help us find eternal life in you.

782
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:17,020
 Help us choose to have life in you today and tomorrow

783
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:19,220
 regardless of what's going on around us.

784
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:21,880
 Thank you, Lord, that you chose us,

785
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:25,500
 not for what we've done or what we could do,

786
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:28,700
 but because you loved us, that we are your joy.

787
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:33,700
 And because you chose us, we can choose to find joy in you.

788
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:34,820
 Lord, we worship you.

789
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:38,820
 We sing that you are good and we love you.

790
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:40,520
 It's in Jesus' name we pray, amen.

791
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:50,520
