1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,240
 Good evening and welcome to the porch. I'm here to guide you on your journey

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:09,480
 through the complex world of relationships. Can we cue some music

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,680
 please? From our friendships to our romantic endeavors, we'll explore our

4
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:19,760
 family bonds, estranged relationships, work dynamics, and perhaps even the

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,840
 relationship with oneself. So how do we relate? To answer this, we'll look to

6
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,560
 scripture and find exactly what God has to say about our relationships. This is

7
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:37,160
 After All, the Relationship Series. Porch, how are we doing tonight? You doing okay?

8
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:41,920
 It's great to be with you. Thanks so much for making the time to join us here.

9
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,920
 Whether it's your first time or it's been a long time, we're always grateful

10
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,960
 you would make time to be here. Not just those of you that are here in the room,

11
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:53,360
 but also those of you that are tuning in live right now or they're gonna watch

12
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:58,640
 this later on. Thanks for just trusting us with your evening. Special shout out

13
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,240
 to our Porch Live locations. Yes, can we give a shout out to Porch Live? Yeah.

14
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:08,760
 Porch Live Des Moines, Boise, and Porch Live Indy. We're so grateful that

15
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,680
 you guys are on board with us this evening. Hey, we've been journeying

16
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:18,400
 through a series called the Relationship Series. Maybe you've heard of it, but we're

17
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:24,020
 now making our way into the third week. Last week we talked about dating and what

18
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:29,200
 you need to know about dating is that dating is not aimless. Dating is very

19
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:35,280
 intentional. Like it's not just a tendency to sail in circles and that

20
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,680
 great sea of romance that we all so badly want to be a part of. No, it's

21
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:47,320
 journeying to an eventual destination known as marriage. Known as marriage. And

22
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,720
 so that's what we're gonna talk about tonight. That's what I want to visit with

23
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,840
 you about. But in order to do it, I thought it would be helpful for me to

24
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,520
 get a little assistance. So Porch, for the very first time I'd like to introduce to

25
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:06,520
 you my wife, Brooke Perry. There she is, ladies and gentlemen. Now, hold on, hold

26
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:13,640
 on, hold on. This is very important. We have a very special announcement to make.

27
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:22,640
 The Porch family's growing because we're pregnant. Yeah, let's go. Oh my gosh.

28
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:28,320
 You can take a seat. Yes, okay, so you can you can celebrate with us. You can also

29
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:32,960
 pray alongside us because this whole parenting thing is something that we are

30
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:38,280
 anxiously, eagerly going to figure out because come November 12th we are

31
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:44,600
 welcoming a baby boy into the world. So stay tuned. It's gonna be awesome. But

32
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:48,240
 here, I'm really excited for tonight. I'm really glad that Brooke is here with me.

33
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:53,840
 She truly is my better half. Gentlemen, you need to find a better half because if

34
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,440
 you're the best side of your marriage then we are all in trouble. You know, you

35
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:00,320
 got to find somebody that's gonna help you out along the way. Brooke is that for

36
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,120
 me. So what I'll do is I'll just let you tell them a little bit about yourself. Is

37
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,520
 that okay? We'll start there and then you can tell them about us too. Okay, sounds

38
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:11,160
 good. Hey guys. Hey porch. Good to be here. Like I said, my name is Brooke. I think

39
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,480
 he said this from stage two. I'm from the Dallas area. You Dallasites in the room,

40
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:23,120
 I'm from Plano. So not actually Dallas. Okay, Plano. Love Plano. So grew up in

41
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,160
 Plano my whole life. So coming home, like here to Dallas has been just so fun. It's

42
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:32,400
 like family. We got aunts, uncles, grandparents, everybody here, cousins, and

43
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,160
 the whole DFW Metroplex. So we've loved coming home. Moved here obviously at the

44
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:41,680
 beginning of this year. Went to college at A&M. Get the poop out there. I have a

45
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,760
 couple Aggie things and then we'll move on. I'm just sorry ahead of time. I

46
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:49,000
 actually work at A&M still. So I work in like branding and marketing for the

47
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 Aggies. Last one then we can move on. So Kyla and I met at A&M.

48
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:03,120
 Aggie things are over. I'm sorry. So met at A&M, met my freshman year when he was a

49
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:12,240
 graduating senior and dated for that whole time. Okay, like we're gonna have to

50
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:16,680
 talk about that later. Clearly there's some judgment here. All right, I'm in a

51
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,560
 vulnerable spot. She's outing me in front of you all. You're gonna act like that?

52
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,600
 Okay, just hold on. I've got something for you. I like to say you saw what you

53
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:31,600
 wanted and you just kind of said I got it. I was patient and I was pure and full of great

54
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:39,400
 purpose. Okay, I'll redeem you. So we dated all through college. My college at

55
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,320
 least. He was graduated.

56
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:54,580
 Dated through college. He was working in the College Station area and went to

57
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:58,320
 more than 12 date parties as like a young professional in the area with me.

58
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,440
 To the point where whenever I was like a graduating senior in college he had

59
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,080
 like gray hair on the side of his head and was still coming to date parties with me.

60
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:12,080
 I like to think that was really sweet that you did that and like endured that.

61
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:17,760
 I was older than some of the bouncers at these things. They laughed at him when they saw his ID at the end there.

62
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:22,780
 Okay, so moving on. We got married in 2017, lived in College Station for a few

63
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:27,120
 years, moved to Houston at the beginning of 2021 with like Snowmageddon.

64
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,920
 If y'all remember that, that was our introduction into Houston. And then moved to Dallas at

65
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:35,840
 the beginning of this year, the promised land. The great part about being here,

66
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,520
 yes, is about the family that I have and you have actually in the Metroplex.

67
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,000
 But also about Watermark. Like I didn't grow up going to this church but this has

68
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,040
 felt so much like home. Like we love going to church on Sunday. We love going

69
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:51,580
 to the porch on Tuesday. We've loved getting to know you guys. These people

70
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:57,520
 have felt like family so much. So, lastly, a little bit about ourselves.

71
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,980
 So, personality-wise, socially, like if you talk to us in a conversation, we're very similar.

72
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:08,280
 Everything else about us is honestly the polar opposite. So, socially, we

73
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,560
 like to talk the same way. We're both like introverted extroverts but

74
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,840
 everything else is truly just the opposite. And I tell you that because we

75
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:19,480
 have just learned so much over three and a half years dating, almost seven years

76
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:24,560
 being married now. So, a decade of like doing life together. And I have just

77
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:31,080
 gone through hard stuff. Thank you for the clap over there. We've just gone through

78
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,320
 hard stuff together. Good experiences. We've learned a lot about what the

79
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:38,360
 Bible has to say about marriage. And so, my hope is that all that combined is just

80
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:42,360
 a really great service to you tonight. Okay, so let's just get into the weeds of

81
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:48,960
 this thing. Why would we teach marriage to a room predominantly composed of

82
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:54,520
 singles? Why do you even care about this thing? Like this feels like a really

83
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:58,960
 unstrategic move for us. Well, here's why. Because tonight is about so much more

84
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,880
 than how you're gonna relate to your spouse one day. Tonight is about how you

85
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:10,160
 relate to God right now. This talk is very specifically purposed for the

86
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,960
 single adults in the room. Because here's what's fascinating. If you survey the

87
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:19,360
 nation, single adulthood is a time of your life where it's a time of life

88
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,320
 where within our generation, we most look forward to it. Like it's a chance to

89
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:29,840
 focus on yourself and figure out what your priorities are and follow your heart

90
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,920
 and find your friends and forge your future. Like that's what your single

91
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:40,080
 adult years are typically and predominantly considered as useful for.

92
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:45,960
 It's also why the average age of first marriage has gotten older. And it's at a

93
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:51,120
 point today that's older than any other point in human history. It's the chapter

94
00:07:51,120 --> 00:08:01,240
 of life where the fruit of singleness is best found. But the rot of selfishness is

95
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:07,080
 most possible. Why is that? Because at this point in your life, in this chapter

96
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:12,440
 for you, you're expected to look out for you. Numero uno, baby. Like you're

97
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:20,000
 supposed to only pay attention to what works well for you, which is an idea that

98
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,560
 the Bible has with respect. Like it's an idea that the Bible has no acquaintance

99
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:29,400
 with whatsoever when it comes to the topic of love. 1 Corinthians 13 verses

100
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:34,800
 four through seven, it says, "Love is patient and kind. Love does not envy or

101
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,560
 boast. It is not arrogant or rude. It does not insist on its own way. It is not

102
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:43,280
 irritable or resentful. It does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with

103
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:48,400
 the truth. Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things,

104
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:54,400
 endures all things." In just four verses, Paul gives 11 different descriptors of

105
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:59,520
 what love actually is. And what you see is it's not self-seeking, it's very

106
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:04,960
 others-seeking. Like the love that Paul describes here, it's something we've

107
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:09,760
 talked about before. It's this idea of agape, which was really unique in the

108
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:14,800
 early church because it was essentially non-existent by that point in history.

109
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,560
 Because in ancient Greek culture, these ideas of selflessness and sacrifice and

110
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:23,360
 self-giving, they were disdained. They were considered weak qualities that one

111
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,640
 would not want to ascribe as true of them. And here's the thing, while we don't

112
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:34,000
 openly disdain selfless love, we do quietly dismiss it. Just think about it.

113
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,880
 Online dating is the pursuit of a romantic interest solely on the basis of

114
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:47,280
 my self-selection. Now, I'm not decrying online dating, but it does begin with a

115
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:53,040
 self-interest. Do you see it? I swipe right or I swipe left, depending upon how

116
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,040
 cute you are and how witty you are. Do you appeal to me? And then the other end

117
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:03,400
 of the spectrum is like ghosting. It's the idea that I'm going to terminate my

118
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:09,680
 romantic interest on the basis of my self-interest. I'm going to do what's

119
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,880
 best for me because hard conversations and awkward conversations, I don't really

120
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,160
 want to do anything with that. So I'm just going to fade into the dark. They'll

121
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:21,360
 never hear from me again. They will be quite all right. Which is why we have a

122
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,800
 poor understanding of selfless love. And to our first point, marriage is often so

123
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:31,760
 very messy. Marriage is messy. You see, selfless love is hard. It's

124
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:37,400
 inconvenient. It's even frustrating. But in the confines of marriage, selfless

125
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:43,520
 love helps this thing to be less messy. Like it allows you to move from a

126
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:49,120
 self-focused perspective to a spouse-focused perspective. And the reason

127
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,800
 this is relevant for all of us is because this kind of love, it's not just

128
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,760
 reserved for marriage. Like you don't just wait to practice it until the day

129
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:01,960
 you're there. You begin practicing it right here and now. Like you begin to

130
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:08,000
 engage with other people on the basis of a selfless love. So take 1 Corinthians

131
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,880
 13 verses 4 through 7. Stack yourself against that list. Love is patient. Love

132
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:19,800
 is kind. It does not envy. It does not boast. How well do you stack up against

133
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:25,440
 that list? I'm not a betting man, but none of us are passing that test with

134
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:31,840
 flying colors. Like no one is, except for one man whose name was Jesus. Jesus was

135
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:38,160
 perfect in love. And so as we walk with Christ, we are perfected in his love.

136
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:43,920
 So I just want to start out with my end goal here. Like hope for the night you

137
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,480
 leave is that you have a right understanding and anticipation of what

138
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,280
 marriage really is. Like what its true purpose is. And so I just want to ask the

139
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:57,160
 question, like what's the purpose? Why, why, why marriage? And I know there's like a

140
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:01,040
 Bible like cookie cutter answer here that you could throw at me if I called

141
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:06,280
 it on you and you raise your hand. Throw that out for me and just honestly think

142
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:10,440
 to yourself like, in the privacy of your seat in your heart, think about yourself

143
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,320
 getting married and like what does that mean to you? What does that represent to

144
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:20,600
 you? Is it this guaranteed companionship? Maybe like this freedom from loneliness?

145
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:25,200
 Maybe it's this culmination of your pursuit of happiness. That was me before

146
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,880
 I got married. Or maybe it's this like solution to your problems. Like this

147
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,480
 mentality of man if I just get married, my problems are gonna be solved. They're

148
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,640
 all gonna be fixed. Or I've just got somebody to help me solve my problems. I

149
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:41,360
 get married now I got somebody to help me figure out. That definitely did not happen.

150
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,200
 And I just want to speak to the single women in the room for a second. Men, don't

151
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,480
 tune me out because this might apply to you too. But we've been doing young adult

152
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:54,080
 ministry for about four years now and I've had so many conversations with you

153
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:58,320
 guys about the idea of marriage. That is usually the biggest topic that comes up

154
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:03,400
 and whether you admit it or not, I think a lot of us in this room want for that

155
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:07,320
 and that is a good thing. Like marriage was instituted by God. It's a good thing

156
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:13,280
 to want. But it's this struggle of just like the now and not yet. And a lot of

157
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:16,480
 you in this room might feel like man I've put myself in every good situation.

158
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,120
 I've got a job. I'm working hard. I go to church on Sunday. I'm at the porch on

159
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,160
 Tuesday. I'm in a community group. I'm trying to be nice to my family. I'm good

160
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,200
 with my friends. I'm asking the Lord like God would you give me this relationship?

161
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:33,640
 And the timing is just not working out. And I wish that I could look at you and

162
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:37,760
 just be honest with each one of you and have an individual conversation but for

163
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:42,120
 the sake of time we're just going to tell it to everybody. Deeper than this,

164
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:47,920
 deeper than just the desire to want marriage is a problem of contentment.

165
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,960
 And I wish that we could go to coffee, literally every single one of us, and I

166
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:54,480
 could sit across the table from you being the person that's on like the greener side

167
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:59,720
 who's gone married and look at you in the eye and raise my hand in honesty and just

168
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:04,480
 tell you that marriage is not going to solve your contentment problem. Like it's

169
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,360
 not going to solve your contentment problem. This might be the first season

170
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:12,080
 that you're in that is like that waiting period. Or maybe not. I don't know what

171
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:15,640
 your story is. But this might be the first time you've experienced that tension of

172
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:19,680
 just like trying to do all the right things and just feeling like timing is not

173
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:24,280
 lining up with God. But it will not be your last. Like welcome to the trial of

174
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:28,520
 faith. Welcome to life, this side of eternity. That is what it's like to war

175
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:32,960
 through and wrestle with trusting the Lord with your life and being in surrender

176
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:37,440
 to Him. And I can say in all honesty, I've struggled more with discontentment on this

177
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,400
 side of marriage than I ever did on the other.

178
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,360
 - I approve that message.

179
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,200
 - Not with him.

180
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,600
 - I approve that one. I knew that one was coming.

181
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:48,200
 - That was not a joke. Not with him, but in other things. Like the discontentment

182
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,920
 struggle, it continues on. If it's not marriage, it's going to be something else.

183
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:57,280
 Paul says in Philippians 4, 11 through 12, "Not that I am speaking of being in need,

184
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:02,080
 for I've learned in whatever situation I'm to be content. I know how to be brought low

185
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:06,640
 and I know how to abound. In any and every circumstance, I have learned the secret of

186
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:11,960
 facing plenty in hunger, abundance in need." And for all you Bible belters in the room,

187
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:16,920
 Philippians 4, 13 comes next, "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me."

188
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:20,520
 And obviously that verse, that's not talking about all things through Christ who

189
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:24,040
 strengthens me, the strength to just move mountains. No, it's talking about the

190
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:28,680
 strength for contentment. It's the secret of contentment. Paul says, "I've learned the

191
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:32,600
 secret of facing plenty in hunger, abundance in need." It's through Christ who

192
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,200
 gives him the strength to do that. And so I just want to encourage you today, if this

193
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,080
 is resonating with you at all, if you've talked to someone about this or if you've

194
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:44,720
 never even confessed that, just identify it as discontentment. Don't let this nagging

195
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,600
 itch just keep scratching at you and think that marriage is going to solve it.

196
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,840
 Like that's contentment and God wants you to live a way fuller life than anticipating

197
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:55,080
 marriage is going to solve that problem. And if that is you, like I would just

198
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:58,880
 encourage you, my anthem for going through times of discontentment has been

199
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,840
 Psalms 63, 3 through 8. So I'll read it to you now. I would encourage you to memorize

200
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:07,400
 this. "Because your steadfast love is better than life, better than anything

201
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:12,960
 else. My lips will praise you, so I will bless you as long as I live. In your name,

202
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:17,280
 I will lift up my hands." This is my favorite part. "My soul will be satisfied

203
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:21,200
 as with fat and rich food, and my mouth will praise you with joyful lips.

204
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:25,840
 When I remember you upon my bed and meditate on you in the watches of the night,

205
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:30,760
 for you have been my help. And in the shadow of your wings, I will sing for joy.

206
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:37,040
 My soul clings to you. Your right hand upholds me." So if marriage is not just a

207
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:41,600
 solution to your contentment problem, then what is it? What is it for?

208
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,120
 The last verse I'll leave you with tonight, for this section at least,

209
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:51,720
 1 Thessalonians 4, 3, "This is the will of God, your sanctification." So I just want

210
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:57,240
 you to think about the general accepted idea that everyone in this room is a sinner,

211
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:01,440
 that we are all depravity, that we all need Jesus to save us. If you disagree

212
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,040
 with that, come talk to somebody afterwards. But hopefully that's a commonly

213
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:09,320
 accepted term here. And then I want you to think about taking two sinners,

214
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:13,160
 putting them in a covenant together, and telling them 100% of the time you're

215
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:16,400
 supposed to put the other person's needs in front of your own.

216
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,040
 Do you think that solves more problems or creates more problems?

217
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:24,640
 Honestly, it solves more. I'm not going to lie to you. Marriage is messy.

218
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,120
 If you think that you're being sanctified as a single person, just wait until you get

219
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:33,160
 married. You will literally discover an entire new world of your sin that you did

220
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:37,080
 not know existed. Literally, there are like sinful habits that I did not know

221
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:40,680
 were there until Kylan helped me see them. Thank you.

222
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,520
 - My pleasure.

223
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:47,000
 - And I know that...and like sanctification, talking about it like this,

224
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,880
 might sound scary, but it's good. Like I just read 1 Thessalonians.

225
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:53,040
 That's the will of God that we're supposed to be holy. Like it is a really good thing

226
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:57,320
 when you have eternity in mind, that we are being sanctified by each other.

227
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:01,560
 So to illustrate this point that marriage is messy, I've rounded up Kylan and Brooke's

228
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:07,560
 top five most ridiculous fights. If you would like to know the topics of them,

229
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:11,520
 I've ordered them in order of least ridiculous to most. Here they are.

230
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:16,680
 Picture frame, laundry, GPS, golf, and a baked potato. We have literally laughed

231
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:21,760
 about a baked potato. And these aren't just like spiffs, tiffs, spiffs?

232
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,120
 - Tiffs.

233
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:26,440
 - Tiffs. These aren't like tiffs that we've had. Literally fights.

234
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,520
 Like we've had fights about these things, and like sun has gone up,

235
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,160
 us still angry.

236
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,600
 - Yeah, knocked down drag outs, man, over baked potatoes, you know?

237
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,280
 We're like, "We're lost. Like why did you tell me to go left in this..."

238
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,480
 It's in the past. Don't worry about it.

239
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:43,840
 The reality is, the reason why I tell you that is we are sinners just as much as

240
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:48,280
 everybody else in the room. And when you put two sinners together in a covenant,

241
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:53,440
 it is literally like the sanctification boot camp. God intends for you to take all

242
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,520
 your expectations and all your habits, and he intends to use your spouse to work out

243
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:02,200
 all the knots in your holiness. Marriage is literally just another tool,

244
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:08,160
 another mechanism that God uses to make you more holy. Gary Thomas, he wrote...

245
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:08,600
 What's the book?

246
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,080
 - Sacred Marriage.

247
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:12,160
 - Thank you. Sacred Marriage. He says it really well. He says,

248
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,800
 "Marriage is less about your happiness and more about your holiness."

249
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:20,040
 - And listen, marriage is less about your happiness and it's more about your

250
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:25,920
 holiness. Like we pray you would really know that. And I'm not saying that because

251
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:31,240
 I want your marriage to be miserable. I hope that the two of you make each other

252
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:36,600
 wildly happy, and yet what you need to know is that marriage is not going to be

253
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:40,600
 picture perfect. Like you're not going to find somebody that just completes you and

254
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:46,120
 makes you feel all the deep joys that you knew you would one day feel.

255
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:53,040
 Like that's not what it's meant for. It's meant to sanctify you.

256
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:59,120
 It's meant to make you more like Jesus. That's why for so many of you that are

257
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:04,480
 here tonight and you've just been waiting for the right person to come along and

258
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,960
 you're unwilling to make a commitment because you think someone better is going

259
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,200
 to show up, I'm not telling you to lower your standards. No, we talked about what

260
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,200
 your standards should be last week. You can go reference that if you haven't

261
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,720
 heard it yet. But assuming someone is meeting a standard of true godliness and

262
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:26,400
 there is vibrant chemistry and there's great commitment to Christ and a fidelity

263
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,760
 to faith, like as long as those things are there, listen, they're a sinner,

264
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:36,040
 you're a sinner, holiness is the aim. And because you are imperfect,

265
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:42,200
 you will aid each other in that pursuit. Like marriage is not about your

266
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:46,040
 self-advancement, what they can do for me, how happy they make me,

267
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:51,440
 all the love that boils up inside. That's not what it's about.

268
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,800
 It's about self-sacrifice. That's what marriage is all about.

269
00:20:55,800 --> 00:21:01,520
 It's the laying down of my life in the lifting up of another person's life,

270
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,640
 which is exactly what Christ Jesus has done for us.

271
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:08,120
 - That's right. And it's what Paul describes in his letter to Ephesians.

272
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:12,560
 I'll read. We'll contact him, Ephesians 5, 22 through 24.

273
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:18,200
 "Wives, submit to your own husbands as to the Lord. For the husband is head of the

274
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:22,920
 wife, even as Christ is head of the church, his body, and is himself its savior.

275
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:27,440
 Now, as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to husbands and

276
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,400
 everything to their husbands." Should submit and everything to their

277
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,880
 husbands. Sorry, guys.

278
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:35,600
 - Verse 25, "Husbands, love your wives as Christ loved the church and gave himself

279
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:40,040
 up for her, that he might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of

280
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:44,480
 water with the word, so that he might present the church to himself in splendor

281
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:50,760
 without spot or wrinkle or any such thing that she might be holy and without blemish.

282
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,720
 In the same way, husbands should love their wives as their own bodies.

283
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:58,720
 He who loves his wife loves himself, for no one has ever hated his own flesh but

284
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,480
 nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ does the church,

285
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,480
 because we are members of his body."

286
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:09,120
 - So what is Paul getting at in all of this? This is our second point.

287
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,840
 Marriage is a metaphor. And I just want to encourage you,

288
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:16,720
 as we just read this, my natural tendency when I read this for the first time is to

289
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,560
 look directly at my gender's instruction. So like, what does it say about wives,

290
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,600
 women, men, you might be doing the same thing. And I just want to challenge you

291
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,120
 to remove that lens for a second and to look at this passage again.

292
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:31,360
 Do you notice that in almost every verse that we just stumbled through a little bit,

293
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:36,960
 that we just read for you, that God talks about himself in every single one?

294
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,480
 More than like gender roles and identity, the point of this passage,

295
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,880
 what Paul is trying to say is that marriage is talking about God.

296
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:47,760
 It says some things about God. And we're talking about relationships

297
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,840
 in this series, all type of relationships here on earth,

298
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:53,560
 how we relate to each other, what the Bible has to say about them.

299
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:56,880
 And there is a relationship, there's a husband and wife relationship

300
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,040
 in marriage, but the first relationship that marriage is illustrating is actually

301
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:04,120
 a relationship between God and his church. Do you all get that?

302
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:08,320
 And how cool is it that Paul is talking about this, that God designed it that way,

303
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,680
 that he designed marriage to be this metaphor? And so let's talk about metaphors,

304
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:17,400
 for example. Obviously, I'll bring it back to like fifth-grade English here

305
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:22,280
 for a second. What's a metaphor? It's an object, activity, or idea that's used

306
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:27,000
 as a symbol for something else. So if I said, "Love is difficult,"

307
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:33,480
 versus, "Love is a battlefield." Or if I said, "Kylin makes me happy,"

308
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:40,080
 versus, "Kylin is the light of my life." It's just an illustration, babe.

309
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:47,360
 - Gosh. This is not just for stage appeal, man. Like, this is it at home.

310
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,720
 I just get ripped. God knew I would need a strong woman.

311
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:53,720
 - My point in those examples is the fact that these metaphors,

312
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:56,480
 which one hits home more for you? Like, which one really illustrates the point?

313
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,520
 It's the metaphors. And they bring these concepts to life. So, too,

314
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:04,720
 are our marriages. They're meant to add color and life and deeper meaning

315
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,680
 to illustrating God's love for his people. That's the whole point.

316
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:13,040
 Ephesians 5, where we just read, it's so much more than our individual roles

317
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:16,640
 as a man and a woman. It is first and foremost an illustration of God

318
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:21,400
 and his church. So, if you want a biblical marriage, it shouldn't look black and white

319
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:26,400
 to the outside world. It should colorfully display to a watching world that the love

320
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,800
 of God exists. Like, practically speaking here, like if non-believers interact

321
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:34,360
 with you and your husband and wife one day, they come over to your house,

322
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:38,000
 practically speaking, they should leave that interaction with you in your marriage

323
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,720
 and your home, touched and perplexed that the love of God exists.

324
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,800
 Like, that's what that looks like in real life. And this whole idea that marriage

325
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:50,520
 is a metaphor, it's not just a metaphor to the watching world externally.

326
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:55,120
 It's a metaphor internally, behind closed doors, when no one is watching.

327
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,640
 And I think this is the most convicting part for me, like in the privacy of our

328
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:03,520
 home, my conduct to myself and my husband should demonstrate the relationship

329
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,400
 between God and his people.

330
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,720
 - And it's not just that. Like, it's not just that this sort of submission,

331
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:13,600
 "A wife shows her husband," is consistent with the sort of submission that...

332
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:19,040
 Yeah, it's not just that the submission, "A wife shows her husband," dwells only

333
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:22,000
 and always within the realm of that relationship. Because if you look at what

334
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,400
 Paul says earlier in Ephesians chapter 5, we see that this sort of mutual submission

335
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:31,960
 is characteristic across relationships in God's family. So Ephesians 5,

336
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:37,720
 look at 1 and 2. It says, "Therefore, be imitators of God as beloved children

337
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:43,200
 and walk in love as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us."

338
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,360
 A fragrant offering and sacrifice to God. If you jump down to 21, it says,

339
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:49,520
 "Therefore, submitting to one another out of reverence for Christ."

340
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:54,880
 Our submission is a response to the fact that Christ has submitted himself

341
00:25:54,880 --> 00:26:00,360
 for our sake. Like, we do this because we want to imitate what God has done himself.

342
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:04,080
 That word "submit" in the Greek, it literally means to be under,

343
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:10,520
 in rank or regard. So before you consider any relationship in your life,

344
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:16,280
 that I'm a husband or I'm a wife or I'm a boss or a subordinate or,

345
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:20,240
 as Paul would put it, a master or a...whatever the role is that you would consider,

346
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:26,240
 before you look at the role, what you need to first realize is you're a servant.

347
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:32,800
 Like, that's it. That's ground zero for all of us. Submission is the standard

348
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,840
 in God's family.

349
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:39,320
 - That's right. So I want to unpack that last statement that we just read in 521.

350
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:43,640
 It says, "Out of reverence for Christ." So that statement right there introduces

351
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:47,080
 a theme for all the submission passages that follow in Ephesians.

352
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:50,760
 And I'll read some of them for you now. You've got 522, which we'll talk

353
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:56,480
 about wives, "Submit to your husbands as to the Lord." 6-1, jumping ahead,

354
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,320
 "Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right." 6-5,

355
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,440
 "Bond servants, obey your earthly masters with fear and trembling,

356
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:08,120
 with a sincere heart, as you would Christ." So if you notice all those, like,

357
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:11,680
 Christ-centered statements that are in each of those verses that I read,

358
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:16,560
 it makes it clear that our participation in His order of believers, in God's order,

359
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:20,840
 and how He's established authority on earth is completely about Him.

360
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:25,680
 First and foremost, it's not about respect for God's law or respect for those

361
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:28,600
 in authority, even though those things are well and good. The foundation

362
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:33,240
 of submission here is literally about God Himself. It's about part of a bigger

363
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:36,600
 picture of honoring His design. And so we read this not thinking

364
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:41,080
 about ourselves as individuals, but as part of a unit, like,

365
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:45,800
 falling into the order of God's design, of the way He's instituted authority

366
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:49,840
 in His design for humanity on earth. And when you have that perspective,

367
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,200
 when you're reading these verses with that perspective, you're not looking

368
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,960
 at yourself as an individual, but you're literally looking and aiming

369
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:59,840
 at God's ambition, God's design. It's kind of hard to be offended

370
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:04,680
 by His instruction. It's not about us. It's about Him. So with that foundation,

371
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:08,800
 that perspective in mind, we'll read Ephesians 5:22 again,

372
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:12,280
 and Kyla and I both are going to unpack this together. "Wives,

373
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:16,320
 submit to your husbands as to the Lord." So before we go any further,

374
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:20,280
 I just want to clarify who this isn't talking to. This is not, like,

375
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:25,400
 a blanket statement that all women should submit to all men.

376
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:29,120
 Girlfriends in the room, it's not for you either. You shouldn't be submitting

377
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:35,000
 to your boyfriends yet. This is for wives and husbands. And even though honoring

378
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:40,320
 your husband is really good, there's an even bigger reason why we do it.

379
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:44,920
 It is literally an act of surrender to the Lord. It's not about talents and abilities

380
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:48,520
 of husbands and husbands being stronger, women being weaker.

381
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,720
 It's not about those things. It is literally about trusting and honoring

382
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:57,520
 God's appointed order for His glory. It is also about honoring our husbands.

383
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:02,120
 So Proverbs 12, 4 says, "An excellent wife is the crown of her husband,

384
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:06,680
 but she who brings shame is like rottenness to his bones." Kyla and I have talked

385
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:10,040
 about this for a few years now, and I think there's this question in the hearts

386
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:15,240
 of most men. It's, "Do I have what it takes?" And women in the room,

387
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:20,360
 I'll just speak to you one more time. I didn't realize this, but your words have

388
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:26,240
 so much power. Not even in the confines of like a husband-wife relationship,

389
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,560
 but with guys, like your guy friends, brothers, whatever it looks like,

390
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:33,120
 your words carry a lot of weight. In the confines of marriage,

391
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:37,960
 like you have the power to put wind in his sails, and you have the power to make him

392
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:42,520
 feel like the smallest man in the room based off of how you use your tongue.

393
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:47,000
 And so by submitting to your husband, like doing that act in Word or Deed,

394
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,880
 you're telling him, "I believe in you. I see you. You are capable,

395
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,920
 and you have what it takes."

396
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:57,880
 - And I'll just interject as like a man in the room with respect to this idea that

397
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:02,440
 words carry great power, that submission can actually be wind

398
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:09,200
 into the sails for the masculine heart. This kind of submission makes a massive

399
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:17,560
 difference. And yet what you need to understand is what submission actually is

400
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:23,120
 not. Because if you look across our world in the name of submission,

401
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:28,120
 some pretty awful things have been perpetuated. I remember Ben Stewart,

402
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,840
 when he was talking about this, he taught on the subject,

403
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:34,360
 he said that submission is not subjugation. Submission is not subjugation.

404
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:39,720
 It's not the forceful act of dominance or imposing one person's will over another

405
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:43,680
 person. That's not what it is. And submission is not servitude,

406
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:48,840
 that I'm enslaved to someone more powerful than me, that I answer his every

407
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:52,240
 beck and call. That's not what submission is. And I would actually add to Ben's list,

408
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,000
 I would add a couple more things. I would say that submission is not

409
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:00,840
 suppression. Like as you submit to your husband, ladies, it should not lead to a

410
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:04,520
 diminished or diluted version of yourself in any way, shape, or form.

411
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:10,880
 No, you should be flourishing alongside him. You should be exploding with life.

412
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:15,000
 You should find that you're better with him than you are apart. And yet too often,

413
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:20,360
 we see that women will, they will suppress themselves out of submission

414
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:23,800
 to their husbands. And then lastly, submission is not supervision.

415
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:27,720
 He does not control you. Like you're not under his management.

416
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:32,200
 You're not under his surveillance. I know of couples in times past from doing

417
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:36,760
 the work of ministry where the man has access to their girlfriend's bank account

418
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:40,520
 and MyLife360 can track their location wherever they are and are a part of

419
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:46,200
 medical decisions. And he's not your supervisor. That's what Brooke's saying.

420
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:55,480
 Like you as a girlfriend in the room to a guy, you can exercise serving and loving

421
00:31:55,480 --> 00:32:00,760
 and selflessly giving for his sake, but you do not answer him as leader because

422
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:06,720
 he's not that yet. There are brothers and sisters. There are husbands and wives.

423
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:12,720
 If you're not yet married, you fall into the former. The wife does not have a

424
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:19,280
 diminished value. Hear me. She has a distinct voice. She has a distinct voice.

425
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:23,440
 Genesis 2, this beautiful picture of what it looks like for the woman to be made,

426
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:30,240
 it says that she's taken from the man's side, which suggests equality.

427
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:35,320
 And yet it says that she's opposite of him, which suggests complementarity.

428
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:39,320
 That as I look at Brooke, I think of the words of Justin Timberlake.

429
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:44,880
 ♪ It's like you're my mirror. My mirror's staring back at me. ♪

430
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:52,880
 ♪ Whoa. I couldn't get any bigger with anyone else beside of me. ♪

431
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:58,720
 Yeah, man. Give your boy a round of applause. You know, put myself out there.

432
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:04,160
 A man is only as strong as the woman staring back at him because any differences

433
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:08,320
 in your design, they actually make you better. They make you better.

434
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:12,440
 In her submission to her husband, it's merely an extension of her

435
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:17,360
 submission to the Lord. Back to you.

436
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:21,920
 - So, Kyla and I did personal and traditional vows at our wedding.

437
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,600
 And I want to read you just a portion of my personal vows because it has to do

438
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:29,720
 with this topic. I say, "I vow to trust God fully with my life and my future so

439
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:35,360
 that in turn, I might freely submit to you," Kyla, "as my husband and leader."

440
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:39,080
 That was part of my personal vows. And this was a really sobering moment for me

441
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:42,960
 as I'm like sitting at the altar, looking at Kyla, and TA's officiating us,

442
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,720
 so he's right here too. We're in front of our family and friends.

443
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:51,560
 Because this idea, what I just read to you about like submitting my life to God,

444
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:57,880
 my future, so that I might freely submit to Kyla, the idea of that at its core is a

445
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:02,440
 spiritual submission of surrendering my life at a deeper level to Christ than I

446
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:06,360
 had before. Like more so than before as a single person in marriage,

447
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:11,560
 I was now submitting to the Lord at a deeper level. I was looking at another

448
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:15,760
 broken person and submitting to him because I trusted my life and his to God.

449
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:19,200
 That's what I was saying to Kyla whenever I said that. And I got to put this into

450
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:25,720
 practice pretty quickly whenever we got married. So a little backstory on dating

451
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:30,040
 me and Kyla. So as you know, he's in ministry now. He wasn't always.

452
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,760
 So we met at A&M. We met in the business school. Kyla had like business

453
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:37,120
 aspirations before he came into ministry. He wanted to be an accountant before.

454
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:40,640
 - That didn't work out. We've talked about this before. It's just math and I,

455
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:41,480
 we don't mix.

456
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:45,880
 - So all through our dating life though, we talked about this idea of like him

457
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:48,640
 warring through this call to kind of go into ministry, feeling like God was

458
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:51,360
 calling him to teach and preach, but not knowing when that time to jump

459
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:54,320
 into ministry would come. So that was like a really sweet part of our dating

460
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:59,160
 experience. Fast forward into as we're getting married, around that same time,

461
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:03,040
 Kyla gets this offer for the jump into ministry, gets that opportunity.

462
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,640
 At the same time, I have this offer that I'm really excited about,

463
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:10,320
 kind of like my dream career direction in Dallas. And so obviously,

464
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,080
 I watched him war and pray through this through college. And then when this

465
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:18,040
 opportunity specifically came, I watched him just constantly seek the Lord on,

466
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:21,720
 "Is this the right time? Is this from the Spirit? Like, is this where we should

467
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:27,320
 lead our family?" And I can genuinely say that whenever he decided that like this

468
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:31,520
 was from the Spirit, this was the right call, this is what we should do,

469
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:35,400
 we should stay in College Station and pursue this job, that it was the easiest

470
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:40,040
 decision I've ever made to leave the opportunity in Dallas and like follow him

471
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:44,360
 and do this thing in College Station. And let me just be very passionately clear

472
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:47,680
 with you. There are two big reasons why this was not an easy decision.

473
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:52,640
 First, it was not easy because College Station is just this bustling city for

474
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:56,160
 young adults. That's where all the people go whenever you graduate.

475
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,720
 I think at the time when we lived there, it's gotten better now,

476
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:02,480
 there were probably like 10 other young adults in the city with us.

477
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:07,240
 It also wasn't easy even more passionately because I am this just sweet,

478
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:12,080
 shy, sensitive wife who has no dreams of her own and just isn't content to follow

479
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:15,600
 her husband wherever he may go. If you know me and you all don't,

480
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,840
 you're just going to have to like take my word for it.

481
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,120
 - Take my word for it, you know.

482
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:19,960
 - And Kylan's word.

483
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,080
 - She's strong, man.

484
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:27,040
 - That's just so far from me. Like I am not that personality type at all.

485
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:31,040
 I like to lead, I like to pursue a career, all of those things are true.

486
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:36,920
 It was easy because like I just read in my vows, as I had surrendered my life to God

487
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:40,760
 and trusted him fully with all of it, Kylan was doing the same.

488
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:44,880
 And in the God-appointed order of our marriage, the way God designed it,

489
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:50,920
 I was able to submit to his own spirit-led convictions because I had already

490
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:55,120
 surrendered my own life to God. And looking back, this was like seven years

491
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:58,040
 ago to date, around this month was when we were like deliberating this,

492
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:01,120
 seven years ago. Looking back, God just really provided.

493
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:04,640
 Like in that moment when I made that sacrifice to submit and really let him

494
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,080
 pursue this thing that he felt like God was calling him to do,

495
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:12,560
 which was breakaway at the time. So cool the way all of that was orchestrated.

496
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:16,320
 God honored like my ambitions too. Like just for the working women in the room,

497
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:20,200
 you can work and also live in God's design as a wife at the same time.

498
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:24,200
 I've pursued my career for seven years. I'm proud of where my career is now.

499
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:28,920
 God provided all these incredible opportunities as a result really in my

500
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:32,480
 mind of making this decision to just surrender that one thing to him.

501
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:37,120
 And it is so cool the way he blesses those acts of obedience and submission when

502
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:39,320
 they're rooted in this pursuit of wanting to honor the Lord.

503
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:42,520
 - I think you just said something that's really important and yet it's really easy

504
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:49,400
 for us to gloss over if we're not careful. Speaking still to the women in the room,

505
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:58,680
 if your man is self-led and not spirit-led, you do not follow him.

506
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:04,440
 If he's not following God, then you do not follow him because a lot of harm has been

507
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:10,000
 imposed on women in the name of this idea of submission.

508
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:16,080
 Like if your man uses this verse or his role as the biblical leader of your one

509
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:22,720
 day household to sexually exploit you or to diminish your voice or to control your

510
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:29,560
 life or to justify his laziness, you get away from him. You don't spend any hour

511
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:33,240
 of time with that guy. You drop him like he's hot. You leave him at the door.

512
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:38,400
 You move on with your life because he's not moving anywhere you want to go.

513
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,880
 You don't want some guy that's going to beat his chest and bark orders because God

514
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:47,200
 told him he could do so. That's not what Paul describes in Ephesians 5.

515
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:54,520
 I've already read it. We won't look at it again. Where Paul gives the women 52 words

516
00:38:54,520 --> 00:39:01,400
 of instruction on what it looks like to be a wife, he gives the men 104 words of

517
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:05,480
 instruction on what it means to be a husband. I'm not good at math,

518
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:11,400
 but 52 times 2 is 104. Literally, he uses double the words to help get it through

519
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:16,040
 our thick brain what it looks like to be a man. Ladies, you're going to have to tell

520
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:21,200
 us twice sometimes, okay? And the reason Paul doubles down on it is because this

521
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:28,160
 is not easy. Like the ladies, they think they got it hard because they got to put

522
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:34,040
 up with one of you jokers one day. But let me just be really fair.

523
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:39,440
 If you're a man in the room, the standard for you is to love your wife as Christ

524
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:46,520
 loved the church. And I would stand my ground and say that's far harder because

525
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:55,040
 that requires so much of us that is so very outside the norm in human experience.

526
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:58,440
 So let me just tell you what it looks like to lay down your life, men.

527
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:02,320
 Number one, husband sacrifice. That's what he says. He says,

528
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:07,720
 he gave himself up for her to make her fully alive. So what does that mean?

529
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:11,800
 That means you lay down your life even when she doesn't deserve it.

530
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:16,480
 That's what Christ did. Christ, he went to the cross for a people that were not

531
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:23,400
 worthy of it at all. Because love is sometimes a feeling, but it is always a

532
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:28,560
 choice to lay yourself down for the sake of the other person. The second thing that

533
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:32,440
 husbands have to know is that we're called to protect. That's what Paul means

534
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:35,920
 when he gets to 26. He says that he might sanctify her. The Greek there for

535
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:42,240
 sanctify means to make pure or to make holy. So you fight to protect your wife's

536
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:46,880
 holiness. You do everything in your power to protect it. So how do you do that?

537
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,840
 I'll give you a couple of examples. You pray for her. That's number one.

538
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:53,600
 You pray for her. Like you want to see the quality of a man's love for his wife,

539
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:58,280
 then you look to the quantity of prayers he prays for her. That's what you do.

540
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:01,240
 Like before you spring to your feet and you jump out to help,

541
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:05,680
 you better hit your knees. Brothers, you pray for your wife.

542
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:08,840
 You seek peace with her. Ephesians 4, 26, 27 says,

543
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:14,880
 do not let the sun go down on your anger and give no opportunity to the devil.

544
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:19,160
 So when you're fighting with each other, listen to me guys,

545
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:22,280
 when you're fighting with each other, because you inevitably will,

546
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:26,440
 the burden of responsibility falls upon you

547
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:32,760
 to get up off the couch, break the cold silence,

548
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:37,640
 lay down your defenses and seek peace.

549
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:41,240
 But it's not my fault. I didn't do anything. It's not your fault.

550
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:45,720
 It's your responsibility. That's what it is. And so you as a man, you,

551
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:49,880
 you seek peace. And then lastly, you fight sin for her.

552
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:54,280
 You fight sin for her. And I want y'all to hear me.

553
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:57,640
 If you don't deal with the seeds of your sin today,

554
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:03,240
 you will deal with the fruit of your sin tomorrow. And so will your family.

555
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:09,200
 Shame on the man who sends his wife to fight his sin battle.

556
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:15,480
 No, you, you raise yourself up.

557
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:18,440
 You strengthen your knees. You gird your loins.

558
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:22,640
 You get some guys around you and you make war on the very thing that's making

559
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:26,480
 war on you and on your family. You fight sin.

560
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:31,560
 And then the third thing that you do as you seek to sacrifice yourself,

561
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:35,600
 lay down your life for your wife as you provide for her. That's what he says.

562
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:38,040
 His husbands love their wives as their own bodies,

563
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:41,120
 nourishing it and cherishing it as Christ does the church.

564
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:45,600
 Like Jesus didn't just come to save us from sin. He came to save us into life.

565
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:49,600
 And so you nourish her and cherish her, nourish,

566
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:53,520
 you help her grow and then cherish.

567
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:56,800
 You value her deeply. First Thessalonians 2, 7 says,

568
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,680
 we were gentle among you like a nursing mother,

569
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:04,000
 taking care the same word as cherishing of her own children.

570
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,760
 Gentlemen, that's how you take care of your women.

571
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:13,120
 You be gentle and intentional.

572
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:15,880
 You make sure that you nourish her,

573
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:20,800
 that you lead her to a place where she is thriving in Christ,

574
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:25,920
 even if it comes at great cost to yourself. You see,

575
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,280
 the question at the heart of all women,

576
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:30,720
 because we've processed this is, am I valuable?

577
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:33,080
 Am I valuable?

578
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:38,640
 Godly husbands love their wives in such a way that it quiets that question from

579
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:43,240
 ever raising again. Does any of that sound easy?

580
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,000
 No,

581
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:50,880
 because it's not. And yet that's why we're talking to you about marriage tonight,

582
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:53,920
 because you don't wait until you get married to figure it out.

583
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:56,760
 Then you get started on it right now,

584
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:00,240
 here in your single years, you see,

585
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:04,000
 you learn a love like Christ that would cross any distance to care for his

586
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:04,840
 beloved.

587
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:10,200
 Ephesians 5 31 through 32 says, therefore a man shall leave his father and mother.

588
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,680
 It holds fast to his wife and the two shall become one flesh.

589
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:17,640
 This mystery is profound and I'm saying that it refers to Christ and the church.

590
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:18,360
 However,

591
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:23,120
 let each one of you love his wife as himself and let the wife see that she

592
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:24,320
 respects her husband.

593
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,800
 Just as a man shall leave his father and mother and be united to his wife.

594
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,120
 So too did Jesus.

595
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:33,440
 Jesus left his father to be united to his bride.

596
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:38,960
 He moved into earth from heaven above to reach you and I,

597
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:41,080
 when we were not worthy.

598
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:43,920
 He came with a missional mentality.

599
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:47,800
 I'll do anything to get them back because it brings us to our third point that

600
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:50,560
 marriage is a mission. Marriage is a mission.

601
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:54,840
 Like marriage is not just inwardly oriented where we gaze longingly into each

602
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:58,680
 other's eyes and we lose ourselves forever. No,

603
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:02,360
 it's outwardly oriented where we link arms together.

604
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:07,920
 We set our gaze to the horizon and we run towards the causes of

605
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:12,880
 Christ. Like God created marriage for two reasons for marital union.

606
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:16,040
 Yes, but also for marital mission.

607
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:20,000
 They're not just marriages are not just a metaphor for God's people.

608
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,240
 They're a mission to save God's world.

609
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:26,280
 So let's talk about the great commission for a brief second.

610
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:30,320
 The point of it, the heart of it is to go and make disciples.

611
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:32,960
 Our marriage should serve that same end.

612
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:36,800
 It should be a tool to accomplish the great con wow,

613
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:41,040
 the great commission commission commission. Thank you.

614
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:47,320
 In fact, our marriages, they should do even more for the great commission,

615
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:49,880
 like even more than you can do as an individual.

616
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:52,400
 Your marriage should serve even greater to that end,

617
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:55,400
 like building your home and growing that Pinterest board.

618
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:57,560
 I don't know if y'all do Pinterest boards anymore. I still do Pinterest.

619
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:01,960
 The picture perfect house, how you're going to dress your kids one day,

620
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:05,440
 all that stuff, or building this like private Oasis for your house.

621
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:09,280
 It's like just this private sanctuary sanctuary away from the world.

622
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:13,680
 That's all fun, but it's not the point. It's not the point of marriage.

623
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:18,120
 Literally our marriage is created to be on mission, Priscilla and Aquila.

624
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:19,440
 We're not going to read about them tonight,

625
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:23,760
 but they're in the Bible and they are a married couple that do this so well.

626
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,640
 They lead a house church in their home.

627
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:28,800
 They guide theological discussions with new believers.

628
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,320
 They move from city to city to grow the church.

629
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:35,200
 They help fund Paul's missionary journey. They are this example for us.

630
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:37,320
 For a marriage being on mission,

631
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:40,960
 I am able to better minister to women because of Kylan.

632
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:44,280
 We don't have a house here in Dallas yet. We're still working on that.

633
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:47,080
 Blood, sweat and tears are involved. But in Houston,

634
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:50,400
 we did have a home and I would have girls over for lunch, dinner, whatever.

635
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:54,280
 And we'd be talking about dating stuff that's going on in life,

636
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:55,080
 seasons that they're in.

637
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:59,560
 And Kylan would oftentimes be in those conversations too, offering his advice,

638
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:03,160
 offering input from like a man's perspective in a way that I can't.

639
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:07,680
 Kylan's also provided like physical protection in times, honestly,

640
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:11,520
 there's been girls that have needed security and protection.

641
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,840
 And Kylan is able to do that in a way that I just can't.

642
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:17,320
 Also Kylan is stronger than me.

643
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:21,080
 We've been able to move girls from like apartment to apartment.

644
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:22,880
 I can't move a couch, but Kylan can.

645
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:26,440
 He's able to minister in that way that I cannot. And then vice versa.

646
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:30,440
 All my gym bros are like, I just got justified. You know,

647
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:34,640
 the hard work, moving that iron day after day.

648
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:38,440
 If you're ministering, then yes. On the flip side,

649
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:42,440
 on the men's side. So like the guys that Kylan's ministering to,

650
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:45,480
 I mentioned earlier that women, your words are so powerful.

651
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:46,920
 Even in this instance,

652
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:50,840
 like I'm able to encourage guys and encourage them their identity or things

653
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:53,720
 that they're doing really well in a way that I just think carries more weight

654
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:56,280
 sometimes coming from a female's perspective.

655
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:58,960
 I'm able to give them a female's perspective on dating advice.

656
00:47:58,960 --> 00:47:59,960
 Whenever they're struggling,

657
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:02,320
 I'm able to create like a hospital,

658
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:04,760
 a hospitable place for them to come into our home.

659
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:07,920
 That's what girls are gifted at. A lot of us are. I'm able to cook.

660
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:10,320
 Kylan can't cook. That's something that only I can do.

661
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:14,480
 And that's the way that I'm able to help him minister to his guys.

662
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:18,800
 Your spouse should amplify your ministry and vice versa.

663
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:21,800
 God's plan for your marriage.

664
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:28,920
 It isn't just meant to be better between the two of you.

665
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:32,600
 The world is meant to be better because of the two of you.

666
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:38,400
 Like that's God's intent. Like when he created marriage in the garden,

667
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:41,640
 it wasn't just that one person was lonely. So he,

668
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:45,960
 he decided to craft up another one and throw them together that they might have

669
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:49,640
 love. Like, yes, like there is deep delight in relationship to each other,

670
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:52,720
 but there's also immense purpose. And he looked at me, he's like, Hey man,

671
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:55,520
 like I have a plan to save the world, a play to,

672
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,760
 to bring my kingdom to bear.

673
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,880
 And it's going to come through this thing called family.

674
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:05,040
 And yet here's what we know if you follow the story arc of the Bible

675
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:08,080
 is that first marriage,

676
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:11,680
 it utterly failed.

677
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:16,840
 And the reason for it is because they did not trust God's design.

678
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:20,960
 They trusted themselves and entrusting themselves,

679
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:24,360
 not seeking the welfare of each other and the glory of God,

680
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:28,760
 seeking their own, not exercising a Christ-like love,

681
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:32,160
 but a self seeking love. As they did so,

682
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:35,560
 what happened is they turned on God and they turned on each other.

683
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:39,760
 But what you know,

684
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:45,000
 as you follow through the story of scripture is that God never turned on

685
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:45,840
 them.

686
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:51,880
 That God embodying perfect marriage by

687
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:55,000
 sending a groom to seek out a bride for himself

688
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:00,040
 would ultimately take the mess that we had made

689
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:06,480
 and make it beautiful again for Christ stepped into our mess

690
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:12,200
 and he made us clean. He ordered our affairs.

691
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:17,200
 He brought us close by way of his life and his death and his resurrection.

692
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:20,040
 And that was Christ's game. He wasn't just a metaphor,

693
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:25,040
 but he was the literal manifestation of God's love of the kind of love we

694
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:28,080
 described that he would step in and he would lay down,

695
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:31,800
 not just some of himself, not just a lot of himself,

696
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:33,680
 but all of himself.

697
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:39,160
 He gave himself ultimately, utterly, finally,

698
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:41,880
 fully for the sake of the one he loved.

699
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:44,080
 He would do so to the point that said, man,

700
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:49,280
 I see you where you are and I will come running through the quarters of time.

701
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:54,280
 I will lay my life low that you might be exalted on high as I myself rise.

702
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:58,840
 You see, Jesus came on mission for us,

703
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:04,480
 like to pursue his beloved that as his beloved enjoys the depth of love that

704
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:07,360
 God himself gives,

705
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:12,640
 they might turn themselves in mission to the world and give that love to others

706
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:15,520
 also. Friends,

707
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:20,600
 a relationship like this that enters the fray doesn't run from it,

708
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:22,520
 that gives at all costs,

709
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:26,120
 doesn't reserve anything whatsoever and loves for all eternity,

710
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:29,160
 not just for the temporary moment.

711
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:34,320
 That's a love like Christ's and that's not a love that you have to wait until

712
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:36,720
 marriage to find.

713
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:43,440
 That's a love that you can have right now for it's available in Christ.

714
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:48,280
 Should you place your faith in him? Let me pray that you would.

715
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:50,920
 God's so thankful for tonight.

716
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:57,680
 Just grateful God that we have marriage as a picture of the kind of love you have

717
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:00,120
 for us,

718
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:06,720
 that Jesus for an unworthy people and undeserving people and unlovely people,

719
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:10,400
 you would chase us out to give us worth,

720
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:15,560
 to prove your choice and decision and ultimately God to love us with a love that

721
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:19,240
 we'd never known. God,

722
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:24,240
 it's so easy to get swept up in the sea of romance and relationships and love

723
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:30,520
 and miss the fact God that all of this is pointing to something so much greater

724
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:34,640
 that God,

725
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:39,720
 our desire for meaningful relationship to someone else is just an extra step

726
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:43,600
 is just an echo of our desire for meaningful relationship to you.

727
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:46,960
 God, I don't know where my friends are tonight.

728
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:50,920
 If they have that kind of relationship to you, but God,

729
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:53,240
 I pray before they consider any other relationship,

730
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:58,200
 they would consider that one a relationship with the God of the universe,

731
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:00,080
 to the person of Jesus Christ

732
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:06,160
 that would live perfectly when we could not,

733
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:10,480
 would die sufficiently where we deserve it,

734
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:13,840
 where we deserve the dire selves and would rise

735
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:19,440
 vindicating us of all our sin and proving the fact that God,

736
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:22,120
 your love is inconquerable.

737
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:26,240
 Help us caught to engage with you.

738
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:29,160
 The fount of all love before we seek it anywhere else.

739
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:33,960
 We love you and we sing to you now it's in Christ's name. Amen.

740
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:36,880
 Hey porch, let's stand together. If you would.

741
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,320
 I know that we've run a little bit long.

742
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:42,640
 Thanks for being patient and just hanging in there with us.

743
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:48,200
 We're going to respond with some worship and my hope would be that you wouldn't

744
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:49,240
 race out the door,

745
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:54,120
 but that you would lean into this moment and realize man,

746
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:56,400
 the love of God that we've been talking about tonight,

747
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,080
 that's available to you in relationship.

748
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:01,760
 It's available to you right now that you can have it here in this moment that

749
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:04,040
 God brought you into this space.

750
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:06,280
 Though you thought you were coming for whatever other reason,

751
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:11,280
 he brought you into this space so he could give that love to you now so you could

752
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:15,400
 receive it. You could see it and you could enjoy it.

753
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:18,720
 We've got a team that's going to be coming down to the front.

754
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:21,680
 They'll be on my right and my left. They would love to pray and process with you.

755
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:25,960
 Some of you, as I've spent time talking to young adults through my years,

756
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:27,880
 some of the greatest heartbreak,

757
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:33,520
 some of the deepest pain is in the realm of lost love and broken relationship.

758
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:36,480
 Maybe you just need to come and talk about that with someone.

759
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:39,480
 We would love to visit with you about it. Others of you,

760
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:42,440
 you're just processing some of the things we discussed tonight.

761
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:46,240
 You see misgivings in your life that you need help with. Others,

762
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:48,400
 maybe you have questions about the person of Jesus.

763
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:52,560
 Come talk with us as we sing to our one true love.

764
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:54,620
 you
