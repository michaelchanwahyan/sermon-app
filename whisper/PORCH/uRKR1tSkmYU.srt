1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:25,380
 - Well, here we go, the last week of Datable.

3
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,580
 We are doing it, here we go, Dallas.

4
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:31,800
 Welcome all of you that are online watching us live,

5
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,420
 all of our PortsLive locations,

6
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,540
 Northwest Arkansas, North Houston, Scottsdale,

7
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,700
 Indianapolis, the greater Lafayette of Indiana.

8
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,420
 We see you, welcome.

9
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:43,340
 We're glad that you're tuning in with us.

10
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,180
 And of course, I can't forget my friends

11
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,340
 right here in Dallas, Texas.

12
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:48,780
 Welcome, yeah.

13
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,260
 Got a great cheering section right here, I can't wait.

14
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,920
 It's gonna be a great night.

15
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,800
 Well, hey, before we get going,

16
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,100
 by the way, my name is Josiah.

17
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,040
 I have the privilege of serving on staff here at The Porch,

18
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,240
 but before we get going, I would love just to update you

19
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,800
 with another friend of ours on staff,

20
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,280
 and that is JD Rogers.

21
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,860
 Many of you know JD, yeah.

22
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:12,200
 Many of you know JD, he's our creative director

23
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:16,260
 here at The Porch, and he also teaches a lot here.

24
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:20,260
 And today, he underwent a kidney transplant surgery.

25
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:22,760
 I think we have a picture of him, it'll be up on the screen.

26
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:26,560
 This is JD, and JD gave his kidney away

27
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,020
 to a man that was in need of another friend of ours

28
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:32,400
 named Ryan, and so as far as we know,

29
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,480
 everything went well, no complications.

30
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:38,080
 JD and Ryan are recovering, amen.

31
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,240
 (audience cheering)

32
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,080
 Yeah.

33
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:45,000
 And so I just wanna stop, and I wanna pause,

34
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,480
 and I wanna pray for those two

35
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,400
 as they're recovering in the hospital this evening.

36
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:53,640
 Father God, thank you for JD and Ryan.

37
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,120
 Thank you, God, for the incredible news

38
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:00,280
 that we received as a team, and now here as a Porch family,

39
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:05,040
 that the kidney transplant went without any hiccups,

40
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,680
 without any complications, God,

41
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:10,960
 that you were right there in the midst of it all.

42
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:14,000
 Thank you for the incredible picture of the gospel

43
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,920
 that JD self-sacrificed one of his kidney,

44
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,360
 gave that away for the betterment of Ryan

45
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,280
 who needed it to live.

46
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,640
 That's a picture of Christ sacrificing his life

47
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,480
 for us on the cross.

48
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,120
 God, thank you for the incredible opportunity

49
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,560
 we have to gather in this space to lift up these two.

50
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,320
 I pray that you would heal 'em, in Jesus' name,

51
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,980
 God, that they would recover fully in the hospital,

52
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:45,140
 and their story would be told for years to come,

53
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,760
 and many would come to know you in a personal way,

54
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,740
 and you would receive much, much glory.

55
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,920
 It's in Christ's name we pray, amen.

56
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,800
 - Amen.

57
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,520
 - Well, let me start out by taking you back

58
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,840
 to our childhood, okay?

59
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,720
 Everyone loves to reminisce maybe of your childhood,

60
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,320
 maybe good memories or bad memories,

61
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,600
 but one of the memories for me specifically

62
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,400
 that I would do in my childhood was play musical chairs.

63
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,760
 Anyone, any musical chairs?

64
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,560
 Man, we got some musical chairs fans in the house.

65
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,000
 Yeah, so this idea of musical chairs

66
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,200
 is you have a circle of chairs, and the music's playing,

67
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,160
 and you have one less chair than the contestants playing

68
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:25,200
 in the actual game, and they're walking around the chairs,

69
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,740
 right, and the music's playing in the background,

70
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,580
 and then all of a sudden, the music stops,

71
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:32,120
 and they gotta find a seat as quick as possible.

72
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,580
 And so I thought, maybe we should just play

73
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,280
 musical chairs tonight, would that be fun?

74
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,120
 Yeah, so hey, I got a few contestants.

75
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,800
 Why don't y'all come on out here tonight?

76
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,820
 Come on out here, contestants.

77
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:45,600
 These are some of the contestants tonight.

78
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,800
 Y'all give it up for them.

79
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,440
 (audience cheering)

80
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,400
 Also known as our porch leaders

81
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,240
 in the porch black shirt that we know

82
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:01,400
 to be a leadership shirt, so we are thankful for y'all.

83
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,760
 Are y'all ready to play musical chairs, yeah?

84
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,600
 Y'all ready, okay.

85
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,640
 Y'all ready?

86
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,480
 (audience cheering)

87
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,920
 All right, let's have some fun.

88
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,760
 Hit the music.

89
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,160
 (upbeat music)

90
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,220
 Gotta keep walking.

91
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,960
 Maybe a little dancing.

92
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,540
 (upbeat music)

93
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:23,120
 Okay.

94
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,700
 (upbeat music)

95
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:31,160
 Whoa, whoa.

96
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:35,240
 (audience laughing)

97
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:39,800
 What, we like breaking ankle up here?

98
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,760
 Oh, come here, come here, come here, come here.

99
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,160
 - What happened there?

100
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,000
 - I think he was just trying to be respectful,

101
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,680
 wouldn't you say?

102
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,680
 Yeah, y'all give it up for my man.

103
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,520
 What's your name?

104
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,360
 - David.

105
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,320
 - David, y'all give it up for David right here.

106
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,720
 He's just trying to be respectful of the ladies.

107
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,200
 So what's going on, man?

108
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,400
 You're left here all alone without a chair.

109
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,840
 - I knew I didn't like musical chairs as a kid.

110
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,520
 - Yeah, obviously, obviously, right?

111
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,760
 How do you feel right now?

112
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,560
 - Kind of alone, you know.

113
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,680
 Some would say I'm single up here.

114
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,360
 - He says alone and single up here.

115
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,320
 All right, y'all give it up for the contestants

116
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,160
 that found the chair.

117
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,160
 Y'all can head off stage and take your chair back

118
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,800
 'cause you have a chair to take,

119
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,760
 but you on the other hand,

120
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,300
 you don't have a chair to take, bro.

121
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,260
 You're all alone.

122
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:28,160
 So here's the deal, David, David, David.

123
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,600
 Here's why I start there tonight.

124
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,960
 Because how you feel in this moment playing musical chairs

125
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:38,880
 is how I felt for 29 years of my life.

126
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:44,400
 That I feared, one of my greatest fears,

127
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,840
 that I was gonna be all alone, the music was gonna stop,

128
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,480
 and I was gonna be single without a chair,

129
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,200
 in this case, without a girlfriend, a boyfriend,

130
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,820
 or a future spouse to marry.

131
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,640
 All right, y'all give it up for my man, David.

132
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,800
 (audience applauding)

133
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,280
 How he felt in that moment,

134
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,680
 how he got left out,

135
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,680
 or he lovingly gave his chair to the woman, right?

136
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:21,640
 To the lady, is a picture in some way

137
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:25,920
 of my singleness for 29 years of my life.

138
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:29,640
 That I come into this place

139
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,240
 and I'm reminiscing about my childhood,

140
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,480
 and in those moments of your childhood,

141
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,720
 you're like, man, I'm all alone, I'm without a chair,

142
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,840
 and everyone's looking at me, and everyone's sitting,

143
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,600
 and everyone's comfortable,

144
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:47,720
 but then fast forward 20 years of my life,

145
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:51,460
 my greatest fear is that I would be without a seat

146
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:54,960
 in my late 20s, that I would be the token single person,

147
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,400
 that life would go on, and I'd miss my moment

148
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:02,400
 to find my chair, and I would be 45 and all alone

149
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:07,220
 with no one to date or marry,

150
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,900
 and the worst part about that is like,

151
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,060
 man, you get left out, right, and you're watching,

152
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:16,060
 everyone found their chair, and you're seeing them

153
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,580
 sit there, and they're having a good time,

154
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:22,940
 they're hanging out, and the music,

155
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:25,740
 we all know the music begins to play again,

156
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:30,300
 and I was thinking about myself at 29,

157
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:34,620
 watching the people around me go on dates

158
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,380
 and have fun and dancing to the music

159
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:39,380
 and about to get married,

160
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:44,700
 and it left me in a position where,

161
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:49,340
 did you miss out, God, like, did you forget about me?

162
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,620
 Did I miss out on my moment?

163
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:54,580
 See, that was my story,

164
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:57,700
 it might be some of your stories tonight.

165
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,260
 Everyone around me was getting married,

166
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:03,240
 except for me, every roommate I had ever had got married

167
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,180
 or was on the verge of getting married,

168
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:09,040
 they were engaged, except for me.

169
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:14,860
 I found myself at 29, almost 30 years old,

170
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,860
 laying in bed one night and just kind of doing

171
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:20,540
 that ugly cry, like, God, like, where would you,

172
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:23,020
 I'm so fed up with this singleness,

173
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:25,100
 I don't want anything to do with it anymore,

174
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,200
 God, would you just take it away?

175
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:33,060
 And this might be some of you tonight,

176
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:34,820
 this might be some of your story.

177
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,860
 Like, right now, your friends,

178
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:39,600
 maybe your roommates are dating

179
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:43,320
 and maybe they're engaged or maybe they're even married.

180
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:48,280
 And you're asking, God, what about me?

181
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:52,060
 Have I missed my moment?

182
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:58,200
 And you're starting to believe lies from the enemy,

183
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,580
 like, you're single because you're just not fit enough,

184
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,420
 you're too fat or you're too skinny,

185
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:09,420
 or you're single because you got them daddy wounds, right,

186
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,820
 and you can't trust anybody,

187
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,980
 or you're single because you're full of anxiety

188
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:18,580
 and you're the anxious person who has a hard time

189
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:20,940
 being around other people and people don't even

190
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,580
 really like being around you.

191
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:28,980
 You're single because you're not rich enough or cool enough,

192
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,240
 or maybe you're believing the lie of,

193
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,560
 man, I'm single because all the good guys

194
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,120
 and all the good girls, I mean, they're already taken.

195
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:44,600
 Whispers from the enemy, lies from the enemy.

196
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:51,240
 And tonight, my hope is that over the next few minutes

197
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,400
 that you would see three truths from God's word

198
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,940
 about our singleness, that I would want you to see

199
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:57,920
 that your singleness is a gift,

200
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:01,380
 that we're single for a reason,

201
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,180
 and many of you will be relieved to know

202
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,620
 that you'll only be single for a season.

203
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,740
 And my hope tonight is that you wouldn't believe

204
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,700
 that God is trying to hold out on you

205
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,420
 or God's trying to rip you off

206
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,900
 or God's trying to give you something that's second best,

207
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:17,680
 but that you would see that you are a gift to the kingdom

208
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,480
 and you are a gift to the church

209
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:23,700
 right where you are in your singleness.

210
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,300
 You're not any less than a person if you're single

211
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:28,940
 or dating or even married.

212
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:32,020
 We're gonna be in 1 Corinthians 7 tonight.

213
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:32,860
 If you have your Bibles,

214
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,920
 you can open it up to 1 Corinthians 7.

215
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,900
 If I could sum up this book in one statement,

216
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,020
 it'd be like the church gone wild.

217
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,860
 I mean, they're doing some crazy stuff, y'all.

218
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:44,360
 Y'all should read 1 Corinthians at some point.

219
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:48,720
 Like one dude is like sleeping with his mom.

220
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,320
 Like, I mean it, like it's crazy.

221
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,700
 Like they're full of prostitution, sex,

222
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,300
 drunkenness, idols, division.

223
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:59,540
 Like men are going out with prostitutes.

224
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,460
 Like people are going to the church

225
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,060
 and getting drunk at communion.

226
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:06,180
 Like they're even trying to find the party in the church.

227
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,940
 Like it's some crazy stuff going on there.

228
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:12,820
 And Paul, this guy who's been radically changed by God

229
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,420
 who used to persecute Christians,

230
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:17,460
 this guy named Paul has a heavy task

231
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:22,740
 that God has given him in writing to this church in Corinth,

232
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:26,060
 the believers in Corinth, pertaining to these issues,

233
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,420
 not only to the church in Corinth,

234
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,780
 but 2,000 years later, right here at the porch,

235
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,860
 Dallas and all across the nation.

236
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:35,620
 So tonight we're gonna address the question.

237
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:38,180
 It's the question that Paul addressed back then

238
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:41,060
 in 1 Corinthians 7, why are you single?

239
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:43,320
 Why are you single?

240
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:47,980
 Starting in verse six, this is what Paul says.

241
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:52,140
 He says, I say this as a concession, not as a command.

242
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:55,100
 So this isn't like a command from God,

243
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,820
 but this is just like something that maybe you would yield

244
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:00,460
 to because it's good wisdom, okay?

245
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:02,660
 What is he about to say that it's not a command,

246
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,460
 but it's maybe just good advice.

247
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,300
 He says in verse seven,

248
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,340
 but I wish everyone were single just as I am.

249
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:12,140
 Paul, that's not what I wanted to hear, okay?

250
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:14,640
 Like that's the last thing I wanted to hear, bro.

251
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:18,960
 He goes on and says, and yet each person

252
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:22,380
 has a special gift from God of one kind or another.

253
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:25,940
 In other words, you're single, that's a gift.

254
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,620
 You're married, that's a gift.

255
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:31,720
 So I say to those who aren't married and to widows,

256
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,460
 it is better to stay unmarried just as I am.

257
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:37,740
 So again, whether you're married or you're single,

258
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,540
 God's got a gift.

259
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,020
 He sees this as a gift.

260
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:44,140
 First point, if you're taking notes tonight,

261
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:46,200
 is singleness is a gift.

262
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,940
 Singleness is a gift.

263
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,660
 And you're probably like rolling your eyes right now

264
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,240
 and saying like, I don't wanna hear

265
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,200
 that singleness is a gift, Josiah.

266
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,980
 But here, if I'm gonna accurately teach the text,

267
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,860
 I got to share this, okay?

268
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,180
 So stay with me.

269
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,500
 Those of you that are rolling

270
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,740
 and don't wanna hear anymore,

271
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,340
 right out of the gate, Paul hits us with this simple,

272
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:06,940
 but profound truth that he has a gift

273
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,100
 and that gift is singleness.

274
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:13,060
 Now the word in Greek for gift is charisma.

275
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,980
 It's where we get the English word charity.

276
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:19,060
 It literally is translated grace from God.

277
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:23,300
 And so he's like, man, Josiah, have you not heard?

278
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,020
 Like, I don't want you to talk to me

279
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:27,960
 about my singleness being grace from God.

280
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,600
 It feels nothing like grace.

281
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,560
 It feels like a curse, bro.

282
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,100
 Like, come on.

283
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:38,100
 But as Paul continues, he's trying to point out

284
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:42,320
 that there's a gift here.

285
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,380
 And he's gonna elaborate on it in the rest of the verses

286
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:47,020
 why he would say that this is a gift.

287
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:49,720
 But before we get there, I know this is hard.

288
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,560
 Like, let me just empathize with you for a second.

289
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,920
 I know this is hard for you to hear

290
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,200
 because many of us, if statistics are right,

291
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,200
 Barna would say, Barna Research Group would say

292
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:01,060
 96% of singles long to be married at some point.

293
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:04,620
 So there's only about 4% that just say,

294
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,980
 hey, I don't want a significant other.

295
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:10,780
 Let me ask you, have you ever received a gift

296
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:11,840
 that you didn't want?

297
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:16,040
 In just a few short weeks, I couldn't believe it.

298
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,200
 Like, I think it's like, I mean, Christmas

299
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,040
 is right around the corner.

300
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,720
 I mean, I know I don't wanna skip Thanksgiving, right?

301
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,160
 But Christmas is right around the corner

302
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,160
 in just a few short weeks.

303
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,000
 We're gonna be celebrating Christmas.

304
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,240
 Last week, our porch staff, last week, last year,

305
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,600
 our porch staff got together and we had a party

306
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,480
 with some of our team leads that serve here at the porch.

307
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,140
 And we had a white elephant gift exchange.

308
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,860
 Ever done one of those, yeah?

309
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:42,600
 So we go around and we draw numbers

310
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,960
 and I kinda had the tail end.

311
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,160
 I was like nine or 10.

312
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,680
 And man, my time finally came where I was gonna

313
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,920
 find my gift and I was gonna unpack it

314
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,200
 and lo and behold, I grabbed my gift and I unpack it.

315
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,400
 And it's a mouse, y'all.

316
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,920
 Like, it's a mouse.

317
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:06,520
 Like, I don't do rodents, much less a mouse, a pet mouse.

318
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,400
 And I'm looking at the person that gave it.

319
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,240
 I'm like, you gave this?

320
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,280
 Like, I'm starting to question your integrity.

321
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:15,360
 I'm starting to question your, you know,

322
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,000
 I'm starting to question whether I can trust you

323
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,640
 and you're a leader at the porch.

324
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:24,040
 And the whole time, I was just like,

325
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,000
 man, this is gross, y'all, man, this is,

326
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,160
 I'm not taking this home, man.

327
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,720
 Like, I will pay you to take it back.

328
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,760
 Like, I will give you money.

329
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,000
 Like, I'm bargaining, I'm like,

330
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,840
 hey, this is a pet mouse, kinda cool.

331
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,440
 I mean, there's something I think you could do with it.

332
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,560
 Maybe you can feed it to your pet snake, right?

333
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,460
 'Cause that's about all it's good for.

334
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:42,340
 Right, amen?

335
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,160
 Yeah, I don't know any people that like pet mouse.

336
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,400
 Like, I can't even say it.

337
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,780
 It's like, get that out of my language.

338
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:54,840
 But the reason why I share that with you

339
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,720
 is because that's a picture of some of you

340
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,120
 in what you do with your singleness.

341
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,460
 You're like, man, it's gross.

342
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,360
 Like, I don't wanna talk about it.

343
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,780
 That's like the dirty word in the church

344
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:05,960
 that we talk about sometimes when there's dating series.

345
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,640
 Like, I don't want nothing to do with that.

346
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,080
 Like, I'm trying to give it away.

347
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:13,340
 Like, I'm trying to lose it, not use it.

348
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:16,960
 Like, I will pay some people to take my singleness.

349
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,480
 Some of you conniving right now.

350
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,320
 It's like, what can I do?

351
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,720
 Like, get rid of my singleness, right?

352
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:26,320
 And I think this is just a picture

353
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,320
 of sometimes what we do with our singleness.

354
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:32,280
 And the entire time, God is saying,

355
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,680
 hey, singleness is a gift,

356
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,520
 and you're called the steward to get this gift.

357
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,320
 But now there's another group of people

358
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,920
 that came into the room tonight.

359
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,180
 Let me talk to this group for a second.

360
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:46,260
 There's people, mainly men,

361
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:49,260
 that came into this group, this room tonight.

362
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:52,180
 And you're like, man, I don't know what you're talking about.

363
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:53,860
 I just said I love my singleness.

364
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,420
 Like, it's awesome.

365
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:58,620
 And you don't love it because you can serve God more.

366
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:01,820
 You don't love it so that you can, you know,

367
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:02,940
 make much of his name.

368
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,780
 You love it because you can make, you know,

369
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:06,580
 much of your name.

370
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:11,140
 And you're abusing your singleness at the expense of women.

371
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:12,900
 - Say that.

372
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,400
 - Amen.

373
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,720
 (congregation laughing)

374
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,440
 Like, you're dragging their hearts through the mud.

375
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,360
 You're going from one woman to the next,

376
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:27,740
 and you're preying on the women that come here to the porch.

377
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:35,760
 Like, you know some Bible verses,

378
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,280
 but you use those Bible verses to manipulate women

379
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:41,100
 to get what you want, you know what I'm saying?

380
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,160
 Oh, now I'm meddling.

381
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:47,380
 Or you got a Bible, you even got a Bible,

382
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,840
 and you carry that Bible with you.

383
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,740
 You got that cross necklace that you wear around your neck.

384
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:56,440
 And you know what the Bible would say about you

385
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,540
 is that you're a wolf in sheep's clothing.

386
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:04,660
 I'm not done.

387
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:07,120
 I'm not done.

388
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,220
 And let me tell you something.

389
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:14,760
 We see you, and we train up our leaders to see you,

390
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,000
 and we will find you, and we will expose you.

391
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,240
 And let me tell you something, ladies.

392
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,260
 Let me hit you for a second.

393
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:21,820
 Let me hit you for a second.

394
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,360
 Listen, ladies, ladies, ladies.

395
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,940
 Just because he calls himself a Christian

396
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:31,080
 doesn't mean he's a Christian.

397
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:34,000
 Just because he knows a few verses or carries a Bible

398
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 or got a cross tattoo of John 3:16 even,

399
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:42,500
 (congregation laughing)

400
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,900
 I'm just trying to keep it real.

401
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:44,940
 Is that okay tonight?

402
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:49,140
 Doesn't mean that he's authentic, man.

403
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:52,500
 He's a wolf.

404
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,700
 And so what do you do?

405
00:18:55,700 --> 00:19:00,700
 You observe him over a period of time,

406
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,380
 because here's what I know.

407
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,600
 The greatest test is time,

408
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,980
 that you would observe someone.

409
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,900
 You would watch them in circles of friends or people,

410
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,620
 and you would see what they do, because, hey, listen,

411
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,140
 they might be able to front you for a season,

412
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:18,900
 but they can't front forever.

413
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:22,380
 And you ask, you check the resources,

414
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:27,380
 you check the people around, and you ask about the person.

415
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:31,740
 The greatest test is time.

416
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:36,080
 Sorry, I digressed.

417
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,200
 (laughing)

418
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,320
 Some of you are asking, "Josiah,

419
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,000
 "how do I know if I have the gift of singleness?"

420
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,520
 This is how you know if you have the gift of singleness.

421
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,920
 Did you walk in here single?

422
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,440
 You got the gift of singleness.

423
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,420
 Congratulations.

424
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:51,440
 (congregation laughing)

425
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,280
 And-- - I love it!

426
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,600
 - And I-- (laughing)

427
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,760
 I can always count on this guy every week

428
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:01,120
 to just keep it light and keep it fun.

429
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,400
 But here's the deal.

430
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,340
 Listen, listen.

431
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:10,260
 I know that sounds harsh, but what do we do with any gift?

432
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:13,360
 You have athleticism, you have good looks,

433
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,660
 you have success in corporate.

434
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:20,340
 You steward that gift for the glory of God.

435
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:25,220
 You take that gift and you tell that gift the passion.

436
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:28,580
 The passion is that you are created in the image of God

437
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:31,580
 to bear his image, that you would make much of his name,

438
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:35,300
 and anything you do or anything he's entrusted you with,

439
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,100
 and you're like, "Man, I don't wanna be entrusted

440
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:37,940
 "with singleness."

441
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,900
 Do you think I wanna be entrusted with singleness

442
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:40,900
 at 29 years old?

443
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:41,780
 No, I didn't.

444
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:45,500
 But I couldn't shake this passage.

445
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,180
 I couldn't shake 1 Corinthians 7

446
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:52,180
 when Paul is sitting here trying the best he can

447
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:57,600
 through the spirit of God and saying,

448
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,660
 "Hey, your singleness is a gift."

449
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,060
 Now, that's from God.

450
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,740
 The whole, "Hey, I wish you were single,"

451
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:03,980
 is not, that's not a command.

452
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,820
 That's just Paul just saying,

453
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,940
 "Hey, I think it'd be good for you to be single,"

454
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:09,740
 and he's about to tell us why.

455
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,700
 But what do you do when you've been given a gift?

456
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:16,700
 You steward it for the glory of God, for the good of others,

457
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:20,540
 and when you do that, you will find much, much joy.

458
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,100
 I hope you'll see that tonight.

459
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:27,500
 Just this past week, I was talking to some new friends

460
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:32,500
 on staff that we just hired, Becca and Alexia.

461
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:37,860
 And yeah, they're awesome, awesome women of God.

462
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:40,480
 But what's so cool, I was getting to know their story,

463
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,060
 and they went on to say Becca was from Florida,

464
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:46,620
 and she had family, and she had friends there,

465
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:50,940
 and she was about to take a job in corporate,

466
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:54,260
 making six figures, and she came here

467
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,440
 to be a content coordinator, a content person

468
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,820
 that really knows how to organize what you see

469
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,880
 on social media, and plan things,

470
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,220
 and just, she's got incredible gifts,

471
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,760
 but she was gonna make six figures

472
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,800
 doing something along those lines.

473
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,320
 And God arrested her heart and said,

474
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:18,740
 "Hey, I think I'm calling you to pick up your comfort

475
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:22,460
 "and your convenience, and what you would have in Florida,

476
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:24,840
 "and I'm calling you to leave all of that,

477
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,640
 "to come to Dallas, a place," she said,

478
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,580
 she's never, I'm like, "Bro, you ain't been to Dallas before?

479
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,040
 "We gotta get you out, right?"

480
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,160
 But no, she's like, "Florida's the best."

481
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,520
 Cool, I trust that.

482
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:39,200
 But she left, and I was thinking to myself,

483
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,080
 is she any less complete?

484
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,520
 She happened to be single, too.

485
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:50,240
 Alexia, she came from Seattle, Washington.

486
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,120
 I looked it up, 30 plus hours, over 2,000 miles.

487
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,440
 To come on staff and be a graphic designer,

488
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,840
 a videographer, content creator,

489
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:05,820
 what you see, you're gonna be seeing some incredible work

490
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:08,560
 on social media for the glory of God.

491
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,280
 And I'm like, man, I look at these women,

492
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,480
 I'm like, goodness gracious,

493
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,980
 are they any less complete because they're single?

494
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:20,280
 No, if anything, they might even be more complete.

495
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:24,180
 They're doing things like maybe I could never have done

496
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:28,540
 as now a married man, and just pick up and leave.

497
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,300
 They're not distracted by a husband

498
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,740
 or in desperate need of one.

499
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,740
 If the Lord entrusts them with, this is what they say,

500
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:35,060
 if the Lord entrusts them with one,

501
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:37,620
 then they would steward that gift.

502
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:40,500
 But I was just so impressed, like, listening to their story

503
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:43,380
 and watching how they were hearing from God

504
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:46,180
 and pursuing Him, and they made the decision

505
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:50,940
 to come on staff and to leverage their gifts

506
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:51,980
 for the glory of God.

507
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:54,980
 What are they doing, man?

508
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:59,980
 They're choosing to use their singleness as a gift,

509
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:06,740
 not trying to lose it, but to use it.

510
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:11,100
 Tonight, let me ask you something.

511
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:14,220
 Do you see your singleness as a gift to use

512
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,380
 or a gift to lose?

513
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:21,360
 Do you see that God, in all of His sovereignty,

514
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:26,700
 has put you in Dallas, Texas, that the job you have

515
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,820
 and the apartment complex you live in,

516
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:31,180
 the neighborhood that you're in,

517
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:34,540
 the cubicle that you office at,

518
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:39,380
 so that you would make much of Him in these years

519
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:44,140
 that you might never get back, called your singleness.

520
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,560
 Singleness is a gift.

521
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,780
 Point number two, if you're taking notes,

522
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,060
 singleness for a reason.

523
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,660
 Singleness for a reason.

524
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,140
 He says this, Paul says,

525
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:57,780
 "I want you to be free from anxieties.

526
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:00,740
 "The unmarried man is anxious about the things of the Lord,

527
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:02,220
 "how to please the Lord.

528
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:06,900
 "But the married man is anxious about worldly things,

529
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:10,500
 "how to please his wife, and his interests are divided.

530
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:13,620
 "An unmarried man or betrothed woman is anxious

531
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,780
 "about the things of the Lord, how to be holy

532
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,860
 "in body and spirit, but the married woman

533
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,900
 "is anxious about worldly things,

534
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,300
 "how to please her husband."

535
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:24,760
 Verse 35, "I say this for your own benefit,

536
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,020
 "not to put restraint on you."

537
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:28,380
 I'm not trying to restrict you from getting married,

538
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:31,180
 but I'm just trying to let you know ahead of time,

539
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:33,620
 I'm trying to give you a greater vision of your singleness,

540
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:36,580
 a greater vision of a future

541
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:38,260
 that would affect your present reality.

542
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:40,100
 Like many of you, did you hear me?

543
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,740
 You're gonna probably get married,

544
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,320
 we're gonna get there here in a second,

545
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:46,380
 but you have this moment in your life,

546
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:50,460
 you have this period of time that you can use

547
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:53,180
 where you're gonna be less distracted.

548
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:59,300
 And so, he goes on and says, "I say this for your benefit,

549
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:01,020
 "not to put restrictions on you,

550
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:03,540
 "but to promote what is appropriate,"

551
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,540
 and I love this last part,

552
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:08,320
 "and to secure undistracted devotion to the Lord.

553
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,760
 "I want you to do whatever will help you

554
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,100
 "serve the Lord the best

555
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:14,740
 "with as few distractions as possible."

556
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:19,060
 See, God is purposeful, and all that he does,

557
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:21,580
 don't miss this, you're single for a reason.

558
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,620
 You know what that reason is?

559
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:25,980
 So you can focus on Jesus

560
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:31,020
 with minimal distractions as possible.

561
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:34,140
 Like, here's where this old,

562
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:36,540
 this married thing comes into play.

563
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:39,700
 You're like, "Oh, here's a married guy."

564
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:42,520
 Let me just tell you about his last 24 hours.

565
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,280
 Speaking of myself, okay.

566
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:47,320
 Yesterday I woke up, yesterday morning I woke up,

567
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:50,120
 and it was my wife's birthday, her name's Kathy.

568
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:54,280
 And we just had an incredible morning,

569
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,900
 woke up early 'cause I went off to write this message,

570
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:57,980
 but here we are on the 'Gram,

571
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:02,980
 celebrating 37 years of life, right?

572
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:07,280
 And this is my family, Camille, the oldest,

573
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:12,280
 and then Isabella, she's three, Camille's four,

574
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:15,600
 and I have little Caleb right there, seven months,

575
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,960
 and then our babysitter, she came by to give a coffee,

576
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:20,160
 so I was like, "Jump into the picture, let's go."

577
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:24,160
 But, you know, that was probably

578
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:29,160
 the one shining spot light of the whole day.

579
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,020
 I went off to write my message,

580
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:34,440
 and shortly into my message I get a text

581
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:37,320
 from my sister saying, "Hey, Mom's gotten in a car accident

582
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,360
 "on Highway 30, she got rear-ended,

583
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,480
 "and the guy doesn't have insurance."

584
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,120
 So I'm like, "All right, here we go.

585
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,560
 "What do we do for you, let me help Mom out."

586
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,640
 My mom's single, parents divorced when I was young,

587
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,860
 so it makes things complicated.

588
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:50,620
 Go back to writing, make sure Mom is okay,

589
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:51,680
 go back to writing.

590
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,140
 Then I get a text from my wife, she's like,

591
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:55,480
 "Oh, Josiah, I don't know what to do.

592
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,600
 "Kids are acting crazy, they're hitting each other,

593
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,920
 "they're screaming, you know, one of 'em scratched,

594
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,600
 "we got blood pouring out."

595
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,440
 I mean, just like, "What's going on?

596
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,600
 "You're gonna have to give spankings when they come home."

597
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,360
 I'm like, "All right, go back to writing."

598
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,960
 Wrap up the writing.

599
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:15,240
 No joke, y'all, I walk into my house.

600
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:19,160
 My little girl, three years old,

601
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:22,040
 is literally crying all over the floor,

602
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:25,800
 flailing her arms, can't stop.

603
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,320
 My wife's got the seven-month-old Caleb,

604
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,800
 and she's like, "Hey, just to remind you,

605
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,100
 "we're leading a Bible study tonight for newly-marrieds.

606
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:35,400
 "Who plans a Bible study for newly-marrieds

607
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,560
 "on their wife's birthday?"

608
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:39,080
 Now I feel like I'm the best husband in the world.

609
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,480
 Right now I'm being, I mean, like,

610
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,400
 I didn't even see that coming,

611
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,880
 and she's like, "Why would you do that?"

612
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,020
 I'm like, "I don't know, I should've said something,

613
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:48,160
 "I should've raised my hand."

614
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,720
 And then she's like, "Hey, we don't even have dinner made,

615
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,480
 "so I'm gonna go get dinner, I'm gonna get takeout."

616
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,320
 I'm like, "All right, go."

617
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,640
 She gives me my seven-month-old Caleb.

618
00:28:55,640 --> 00:29:00,360
 At that time, he projectile vomits all over the floor.

619
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,560
 And I'm just like, "Man, I can't even be mad,

620
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:05,680
 "that's impressive, I didn't know that much bodily fluid."

621
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:08,120
 Bodily fluid could come out of a seven-month-old.

622
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:14,160
 About that time, I get a call from one of our porch leaders,

623
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,460
 and I'm like, "I'm just gonna FaceTime this

624
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:16,760
 "so he can just see all the chaos,"

625
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,600
 you know what I'm saying?

626
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:21,120
 Like, I gotta give spankings, I gotta clean up vomit,

627
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,100
 I got scratches, I gotta break up fights,

628
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:26,620
 so we FaceTime, I'm like, "Hey, what's up, Kyle?

629
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:27,920
 "This is what's going on, bro."

630
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,320
 I'm like, "Hey, man, what are you doing?"

631
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,720
 He's like, "Oh, bro, man, I'm hanging out with my roommate,

632
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,560
 "we're getting some food,

633
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,720
 "we're about to watch the Cowboys game."

634
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,240
 I said, "Great, man, have a nice night,

635
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,800
 "enjoy your singleness."

636
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:39,280
 (audience laughs)

637
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,460
 Hung up the phone.

638
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:43,440
 You kidding me, bro?

639
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:49,440
 Listen, man, I don't...

640
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,480
 I'm done.

641
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:58,920
 But listen, I don't say that for sympathy, I really don't.

642
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:01,440
 I say that because of what the Texas,

643
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,520
 what Paul is trying to communicate

644
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,840
 through the Spirit of God in this text.

645
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,600
 I share this because what Paul is saying is true.

646
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,040
 Like, you don't have less problems in marriage,

647
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,660
 you have more problems, more stressors, more anxieties,

648
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:15,000
 more things to worry about.

649
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,360
 And I think what he's trying to communicate

650
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:21,500
 is when you get married, you just double your problems.

651
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:24,280
 Like, there's single problems,

652
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,120
 and I don't wanna minimize,

653
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,760
 that's what's hard in this room.

654
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,280
 I know there's hard things that y'all are going through.

655
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,800
 I'm not trying to minimize your problems.

656
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:35,360
 You have incredibly difficult stressors

657
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:39,160
 in your life right now, and we wanna minister to those.

658
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,060
 But what I wanna communicate

659
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:44,400
 in the most loving, careful way possible

660
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,360
 is notice how I didn't post any of those stressors

661
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,440
 on my 'gram.

662
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:52,360
 Oh, here's throw up.

663
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:55,000
 (audience laughs)

664
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 Here's blood.

665
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,320
 I'm trying to communicate in the same way that Paul is,

666
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,520
 that Paul is saying, "Hey, marriage doesn't fix your problems

667
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,680
 "it only adds to your problems."

668
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,280
 God is trying to convince you of something

669
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,680
 that I know is really hard to believe

670
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,680
 because it was for me when I heard this.

671
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:15,860
 My mid-20s, nearing the end of my 20s.

672
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,200
 There are problems in singleness

673
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,880
 and there's problems in marriage.

674
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,640
 It's a good thing, but you're choosing to double them.

675
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:24,960
 I'm not trying to talk you out of marriage,

676
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,440
 but I am trying to exposit the text.

677
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,840
 I'm trying to be faithful to what God's word has to say

678
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,220
 in 1 Corinthians 7.

679
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:36,320
 And he's saying, "Hey, you have a season of life

680
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,480
 "that I'm placing you in

681
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,260
 "where you're gonna have minimal distractions,

682
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,800
 "or you're gonna have less distractions,

683
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,260
 "you're gonna have less problems,

684
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:45,960
 "you're gonna have less stressors

685
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:51,440
 "than you'll ever have before in your life."

686
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,840
 And hearing all of this, some of you are like,

687
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,780
 "Man, I get that you have more problems,

688
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,960
 "but I'd rather trade my problems for your problems,

689
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,720
 "Jessi, at least you got a companion and all.

690
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,560
 "At least you get to have sex, you know what I'm saying?

691
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,940
 "Look at them kids."

692
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:08,360
 (congregation laughing)

693
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:13,180
 But here's the reality, we just got real.

694
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:16,280
 And they're all under five.

695
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,520
 Yeah.

696
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:24,680
 But here's the reality.

697
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:28,080
 You might say, "Hey, I'd rather have your problems,

698
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:32,340
 "I'd rather trade your problems for my problems."

699
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:34,040
 But here's the reality, you can't.

700
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:38,860
 So why wouldn't you use this season of singleness

701
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:40,180
 that God's got you in

702
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:45,060
 for an incredible

703
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:51,100
 way of saying, "God, I wanna make much of you,

704
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:52,700
 "I wanna use the extra time,

705
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,200
 "I wanna use the extra income,

706
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:58,040
 "I wanna use the gifts that you've given me,

707
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,060
 "and I wanna leverage those for your glory."

708
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:01,840
 Why would you not try to do that

709
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,700
 during this time of singleness?

710
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,180
 Like you see, before Christ,

711
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:07,900
 I wasted so many years of my singleness.

712
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:12,360
 Like I wish I could stand up here and authentically say,

713
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,820
 "Man, I leveraged it all, man, I went all in."

714
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:18,740
 But the truth is, I wasted all of my college years,

715
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:19,580
 pretty much,

716
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:25,320
 chasing the party, chasing one relationship after another.

717
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:29,020
 I was the man praying on women.

718
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:30,100
 I was that guy.

719
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:33,000
 I was the porn addict.

720
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:38,120
 I was thinking I was gonna find fulfillment and rest

721
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,900
 in my sport that I played,

722
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:44,760
 in the fame that I got, in the affirmation that I received.

723
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:52,460
 And it came to a screeching halt one night.

724
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:54,180
 My sin was ruling my life.

725
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:56,440
 It finally caught up with me.

726
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:59,680
 I chased all these things, even pornography,

727
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:03,000
 for a decade of my life for a cheap thrill and a fill

728
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,480
 that only led to greater levels of anxiety and depression.

729
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:10,760
 Alcohol was my escape,

730
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:13,880
 and I began to become so unsatisfied

731
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,320
 and unfulfilled with those things.

732
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,320
 And I always tell people,

733
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,800
 "Hey, you won't really see your need for Christ

734
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,480
 "until you see how wicked your sin is

735
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,720
 "in light of a holy God, a perfect God."

736
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:27,120
 Like, some of you come into this place

737
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,680
 and you just justify your sin,

738
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,280
 and you're like, "Oh, I'm good, man.

739
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,440
 "Like, I got God here on Tuesdays,

740
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,160
 "but then every other day, man,

741
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:36,240
 "I'm just doing what I wanna do.

742
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,880
 "But I'll give 'em a little bit on Tuesday night."

743
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:43,000
 And you're miserable, man.

744
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,640
 Deep down inside, you're miserable,

745
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:50,640
 because you can't have the world and Christ at the same time.

746
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:56,200
 They're two competing.

747
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,360
 They're oppositions.

748
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:02,040
 You can have Jesus or the world, but you can't have both.

749
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:05,640
 And I realized for the first time,

750
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:06,880
 my eyes were opened to the fact

751
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,200
 that Jesus got what I deserved on the cross,

752
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,920
 and I got what he deserved, death.

753
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,840
 (silence)

754
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:20,920
 Thankfully, the Lord captured my heart at the end of college

755
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:25,920
 and I began to give my life away,

756
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,120
 and that's really when I began to find life.

757
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:32,960
 I almost left the game that I loved

758
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,400
 for so many years, baseball,

759
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,720
 and God said, "No, no, no, you take that game

760
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,000
 "and you tell that game your passion.

761
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,280
 "Your passion is me."

762
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,440
 (silence)

763
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,960
 See, God loves passions.

764
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,440
 He's not against your passions.

765
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,600
 He's not against your desires,

766
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:53,480
 but you need to start telling your passions its purpose.

767
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:57,000
 Your purpose is Christ.

768
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
 Your purpose is to make him known

769
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,960
 in any and everything you do.

770
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:06,400
 So, can I charge you for a second?

771
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,680
 Like, in this season,

772
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,960
 that God's got you, like you're single for a reason,

773
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,920
 because he says, "Hey, you can go.

774
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,600
 "You can move halfway across the country

775
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,120
 "if God's calling you to take a job.

776
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,440
 "You can go on a mission trip

777
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,840
 "and go share the gospel with people

778
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,560
 "that have never heard the name of Jesus.

779
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:28,200
 "Like, tomorrow morning, when you get into that office,

780
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,000
 "like, you should try to lose your job

781
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,240
 "for sharing the gospel of Jesus Christ

782
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,360
 "with people that don't know him.

783
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,360
 "Like, you should get plugged in.

784
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,240
 "I mean, plugged into the local church.

785
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,600
 "Like, you should submit yourself

786
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,000
 "under the authority of the elders

787
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,480
 "and say, 'Hey, I'm going all in.

788
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,440
 "'I'm changing my playground and my playmates.

789
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,440
 "'Enough of this.

790
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,200
 "'I'm tired of going and hanging out

791
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,360
 "'on the same playgrounds.

792
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:50,200
 "'Like, I am going to find men that love Jesus.

793
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,280
 "'I'm gonna go find women.

794
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,840
 "'Like, I'm telling you, these women,

795
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:53,840
 "'I'm gonna find them,

796
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,460
 "'and they're gonna be women that go all in,

797
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:57,600
 "'and they're not just gonna have one foot in the world

798
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,280
 "'and one foot in the church.'"

799
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:06,120
 God's got that for you tonight, you know that?

800
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:10,840
 God's speaking to you tonight and he's saying,

801
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:15,000
 "Hey, don't waste these years that I'm gonna give you.

802
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:22,440
 "That you would bring glory to my kingdom,

803
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,040
 "that you would live for another kingdom,

804
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,800
 "that you wouldn't treat God as something

805
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,120
 "that you just add onto your life,

806
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:30,520
 "but you would treat him as the biggest thing in your life."

807
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:33,880
 Man, could I tell you about

808
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:39,400
 a guy named Kyle, I'm close to him.

809
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,720
 He serves here at the porch.

810
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,280
 He went to SMU, played football,

811
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,120
 chasing everything underneath the sun.

812
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,640
 God radically changed his heart.

813
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,520
 God flipped it upside down.

814
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,600
 He was chasing corporate, wanted to be a millionaire.

815
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,460
 By the time he was 30, and God just said,

816
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:53,640
 "Hey, no, no, you're gonna,

817
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,240
 "I know that's a passion of yours.

818
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,560
 "Nothing wrong with that in and of itself,

819
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,520
 "but hey, you can't even be a Christian right now

820
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:01,080
 "because you're allowing that to consume you."

821
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,800
 And he began to change Kyle's heart.

822
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,720
 And now he's leading a team here at the porch

823
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:08,640
 every single week, right down here.

824
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,720
 It's called the Sidewalk Team.

825
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,880
 They share the gospel with people.

826
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,280
 They pray with people right after service.

827
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,140
 Can I tell you about a woman named Melissa

828
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:16,340
 who had an abortion?

829
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:17,720
 That's part of her story.

830
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:20,480
 And she's leading a team out in the town center,

831
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:23,420
 the lobby, every week here at the porch.

832
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:25,800
 Like, your past doesn't have to define you

833
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:29,320
 because Jesus says, "Hey, I can define you now."

834
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,580
 Melissa is an incredible example of a girl

835
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:35,460
 that went all in with everything underneath the sun

836
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:39,640
 only to find greater levels of anxiety and depression.

837
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:45,020
 And listen, it's like some of you tonight,

838
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:46,560
 like, you're gonna get creative.

839
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,980
 Like, you're gonna go out of here

840
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:49,660
 and you're gonna be like, "Yeah, man, I'm gonna go all in.

841
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:52,820
 "Like, I'm gonna sign up for a community group.

842
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:54,020
 "I'm gonna be a member of a church.

843
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:55,460
 "I'm gonna go equip disciple.

844
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:56,700
 "I'm gonna leverage these years.

845
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:57,700
 "I'm going all in.

846
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,980
 "I'm gonna figure out how to share the message of Christ

847
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:01,760
 "in the most tactful way possible,

848
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,100
 "and I am going in, all in."

849
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:09,400
 And you're gonna get creative

850
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:13,320
 in how you can bring God's name to your office.

851
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:19,200
 Others of you, man, you're gonna leave this room tonight.

852
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,000
 Tomorrow's gonna come, and you're gonna waste

853
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,740
 your singleness by focusing all the attention on you.

854
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:25,220
 You're gonna impulse buy clothes

855
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:27,440
 or another trinket that you really can't afford.

856
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,400
 You're gonna go out and binge eat

857
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,700
 because you feel like your life is out of control

858
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,040
 and that's the only thing that you can control.

859
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,400
 You're gonna binge watch Netflix,

860
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:38,060
 or you're gonna binge watch Bravo and Real Housewives,

861
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:40,280
 nothing against that, right, but it's consuming you

862
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,060
 and you're living in some fantasy world.

863
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:44,400
 You're gonna do these things

864
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:49,520
 thinking that they're gonna give you life,

865
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,780
 and they're just leading to emptiness.

866
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:52,980
 Like, you, man, you're gonna pull up

867
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:56,800
 a two-dimensional image tonight on your phone.

868
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,860
 Because it's your only escape, you think.

869
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:03,040
 I thought that, that was a lie I believed.

870
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:07,200
 It's your only escape of leaving the pain of loneliness.

871
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,940
 And it might feel good in the moment,

872
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:13,940
 but you're not, it's not doing anything for you.

873
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:20,320
 It's leading to emptiness, and you know it.

874
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,660
 You lay in bed at night saying,

875
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:25,000
 "Is this all that there is, is this it?"

876
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:29,360
 And God's trying to give you a perspective tonight.

877
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,700
 Unless you see a different perspective,

878
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:34,160
 unless you see that, hey, there's more to this life

879
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,000
 than what you're doing now.

880
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,920
 Listen, you are going to die a miserable person.

881
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,660
 Why do you think LA, Hollywood,

882
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:46,280
 is the most miserable place on the Earth?

883
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,520
 Come on, you know that.

884
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,780
 It's fake, bro.

885
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:51,800
 See your singleness as a gift.

886
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,020
 See your singleness for a reason.

887
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:55,320
 And third and final point tonight is this.

888
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:58,600
 See your singleness for a season.

889
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,680
 Like if you didn't know, most of you will be relieved

890
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,960
 to know that your singleness has an expiration date,

891
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,800
 so you can exhale now.

892
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:10,340
 Demographers, is that how you say that, demographer, yeah,

893
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:14,100
 project that 80% of Americans will be married

894
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:15,480
 at some point in their lives.

895
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,400
 And I know what you're thinking, I'm going to be the 20%.

896
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:20,160
 Get that negative feedback out of here, right?

897
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,160
 Just get it out of here.

898
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:26,160
 Brides.com said according to the 2018 statistic,

899
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:30,320
 the average age at which women get married is almost 28.

900
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:34,200
 There's hope.

901
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,720
 For some, the average age is 29.

902
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,560
 In my case, it was 31.

903
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:44,240
 If most of us see singleness for a season,

904
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:51,040
 which I hope you do, hope that gives hope,

905
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:54,280
 then what should you do in this season?

906
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:57,600
 Can I challenge you with two things and then we'll close?

907
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,080
 The same thing that I was challenged with

908
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:02,500
 is that you would see this season

909
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:05,340
 where you would choose two things,

910
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:08,380
 and there's a lot of other things you can choose,

911
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:10,420
 but you would choose contentment

912
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:11,620
 and you would choose purity.

913
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:12,460
 Here's why I say that.

914
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:13,560
 Let me talk about contentment first.

915
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:16,800
 Philippians 4, 11 through 13, same guy, Paul, says this,

916
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,840
 and he says, "I've found the secret to contentment."

917
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:19,680
 Look what he says.

918
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:22,760
 "I've learned how to be content with whatever I have.

919
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:26,160
 "Whether I know how to live on almost nothing

920
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,920
 "or with everything, I've learned the secret

921
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,600
 "of living in every situation,

922
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,480
 "whether it's on a full stomach or empty,

923
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:32,960
 "with plenty or little."

924
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,200
 Listen, I know this is a coffee cup verse,

925
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,080
 it's a tattoo verse, but here, don't miss it.

926
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:39,880
 "For I can do everything through Christ

927
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:40,880
 "who gives me strength."

928
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:43,720
 You can replace that word strength with satisfaction.

929
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:46,880
 "I can do everything through Christ who satisfies me,

930
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,120
 "who gives me contentment."

931
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:50,520
 Paul's saying, "Hey, I've learned the secret to contentment

932
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:55,520
 "and it's by me learning how to build

933
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:58,560
 "contentment in Christ."

934
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,800
 And some of us, man, we take this verse

935
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,840
 and we tack it on to selfish gain.

936
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:06,480
 And in the context of this passage,

937
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,520
 he's talking about contentment.

938
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,600
 He's not talking about your bench press.

939
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:12,960
 He's not talking about you making a million dollars

940
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:13,800
 by the time you're 30.

941
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,320
 He's not talking about you getting a spouse

942
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:17,340
 or getting a girlfriend or going on a date

943
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:19,400
 or not being single the next Valentine's Day

944
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,240
 that comes along.

945
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,840
 He's talking about, he's like,

946
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:25,720
 "I've learned the secret of facing little

947
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:28,520
 "or abounding and having everything."

948
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:30,360
 You know what the secret is?

949
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:33,800
 Putting my faith in Jesus.

950
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:36,960
 Putting my trust in Him.

951
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:39,280
 Why is being content so important in your singleness?

952
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,680
 Because here's what I know.

953
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:42,160
 Where there's a lack of contentment,

954
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:43,440
 there's a lack of conviction.

955
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:44,940
 And where there's a lack of conviction,

956
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:46,480
 there's always a willingness to settle

957
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:47,540
 for less than God's best.

958
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:49,260
 Some of you tonight, listen,

959
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:50,100
 some of you tonight,

960
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:51,500
 you're settling for less than God's best.

961
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:53,740
 You're dating that person that you know you shouldn't date.

962
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:55,800
 You're going on these dates with guys

963
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,740
 that man, their profiles are saying that they're Christian,

964
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:00,140
 but you know they're far from it.

965
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:02,140
 Like you're settling.

966
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:04,540
 The conviction is a belief.

967
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:07,020
 When there's a lack of contentment in our life,

968
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:08,420
 there's a lack of belief.

969
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:10,740
 There's a lack of trust in God.

970
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:12,300
 And where there's a lack of trust in God,

971
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:14,340
 you're always gonna be willing to settle

972
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:16,480
 for less than his best.

973
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,880
 And I don't want that for you, Porch.

974
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,840
 I don't want that for you tonight.

975
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:23,820
 I want you to experience all that God would have for you.

976
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:26,560
 The lie is Jesus isn't enough,

977
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,280
 and that's such a lie.

978
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:30,640
 So the question I, it begs tonight,

979
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,800
 is how do we build contentment?

980
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,560
 Listen, we build contentment

981
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,720
 by actually living out our faith.

982
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:40,080
 Like I just implored you in the last truth,

983
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:42,180
 like some of us, man, we're not living out our faith.

984
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:44,440
 You wake up and you don't spend time with God.

985
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:45,400
 You don't talk to God.

986
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:47,000
 You don't get in his word.

987
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,500
 You don't allow this to wash over.

988
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:50,160
 You don't allow this to renew your mind.

989
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,860
 How do you expect to build contentment in your life

990
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:54,080
 when this isn't true?

991
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:58,840
 How do you build contentment?

992
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:02,440
 You read, man, you study the Bible.

993
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:05,160
 You get with men and women that love Jesus.

994
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:07,400
 You follow someone who's following Christ.

995
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:10,480
 Find the most godliest man or godliest woman

996
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,120
 and say, hey, will you mentor me?

997
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:13,140
 Will you disciple me?

998
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:14,460
 Can I learn from you?

999
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:17,880
 That's what I did when I was 20,

1000
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:21,160
 two years old after I came to know Jesus.

1001
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:24,560
 You confess sin.

1002
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,320
 You pursue healing from addiction.

1003
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:29,200
 Some of us tonight, man, we have to go to Regen.

1004
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,760
 Like it's a recovery ministry.

1005
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:33,120
 I'm thinking about going through it next year

1006
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:34,520
 when I can free up some time.

1007
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:35,920
 When I'm not a man of divided heart,

1008
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,720
 I wish I could do it now.

1009
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:40,240
 Monday nights, every Monday night,

1010
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,880
 there's about 1,000 people that show up here

1011
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,020
 and we all got issues.

1012
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:44,900
 We all got baggage.

1013
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:47,120
 We all got things that we need to work through.

1014
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:51,080
 And the healthiest thing that you could do right now

1015
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:53,480
 in your singleness is to get healthy,

1016
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:57,480
 is to learn what it looks like to confess sin,

1017
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:01,960
 to pursue Christ, to flee sexual immorality,

1018
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:04,400
 drunkenness, drugs, anything that would take your eyes

1019
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:05,240
 off of Jesus.

1020
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:06,200
 Philip Zimbardo, I love this,

1021
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:08,680
 chair of the Western Psychological Foundation.

1022
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:10,560
 He wrote a book called "The Demise of Guys."

1023
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:11,880
 So you listen up, man.

1024
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:15,140
 We reported that the average guy, by the time they're 21,

1025
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:19,440
 has spent 10,000 hours playing video games.

1026
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,360
 10,000 hours.

1027
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:24,400
 It takes half that time to earn a bachelor's degree.

1028
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:25,960
 Listen, it's not about video games.

1029
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:27,400
 I don't care if you don't play video,

1030
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:28,520
 go play video games.

1031
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:30,080
 But if it's consuming your life,

1032
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:33,720
 then I wonder if you're missing a bigger purpose.

1033
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:36,480
 The world is on fire, man.

1034
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,400
 You understand?

1035
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:41,280
 Like it's burning all around us.

1036
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,800
 Crippling levels of poverty.

1037
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:47,200
 Injustice is taking place.

1038
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:51,920
 Addiction all over this country.

1039
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:56,480
 And you're sitting behind a screen,

1040
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,680
 twiddling your thumbs,

1041
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:02,040
 thinking that you're gonna find purpose and satisfaction

1042
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:05,540
 in beating some silly game.

1043
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:07,540
 Sex slavery.

1044
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:13,540
 God is looking for men to step up

1045
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:16,660
 and to run to the fire and say, "I got hope.

1046
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:19,220
 "His name is Jesus.

1047
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:21,300
 "Where are the men?

1048
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:25,160
 "Stand up.

1049
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:26,440
 "Let's go.

1050
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:28,980
 "The time is now.

1051
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:32,700
 "Right now in our singleness."

1052
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:34,180
 Could it be that we're discontent

1053
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:36,620
 because the things of Christ are not really

1054
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:37,900
 true in your life?

1055
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:41,420
 Could it be that the reason why you go to bed,

1056
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:46,180
 you're miserable because you're the weakened warrior,

1057
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:47,620
 the porn, you're the Tinder hookups,

1058
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:49,740
 you're the workaholic, you're uncommitted relationship,

1059
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:51,260
 you're playing house with your girlfriend,

1060
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:53,300
 you're half-heartedly doing this church thing,

1061
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:55,060
 could it be that you're not,

1062
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:57,360
 it's because you're not all in?

1063
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:58,420
 Tonight's the night.

1064
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:04,020
 Jesus wants to build contentment

1065
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:06,460
 because he knows if you don't ever learn

1066
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:07,660
 to be content in him,

1067
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:10,700
 then if you were to get married,

1068
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:14,300
 your spouse is gonna let you down, man.

1069
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:18,460
 Spouses make miserable saviors.

1070
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:21,220
 Like I wish I could say I meet

1071
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:22,620
 every one of my wife's expectations.

1072
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:23,660
 I wish she could say that, right?

1073
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:25,420
 But it's not true, man.

1074
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:27,720
 And so what do you do?

1075
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:29,540
 What do others do when spouses

1076
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:31,260
 don't meet their expectations?

1077
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:32,740
 They run to some drug.

1078
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:35,780
 They run to some strip club.

1079
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:39,040
 They run to some illegitimate relationship.

1080
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:41,260
 Why do you think the divorce rate is on all-time high?

1081
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:42,740
 Because men and women haven't learned

1082
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:44,340
 to be content in their creator.

1083
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:46,880
 Amen?

1084
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:50,000
 Lastly, choose purity.

1085
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,200
 Why pursue purity?

1086
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,780
 Why pursue purity?

1087
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:56,260
 Because here's why I say this,

1088
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:57,740
 you have a sexual desire now,

1089
00:48:57,740 --> 00:48:59,060
 you know that the Lord doesn't want you

1090
00:48:59,060 --> 00:49:01,460
 to express it right now in a way

1091
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:06,260
 that would go against a committed relationship.

1092
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:07,840
 Where he says, hey, don't go outside

1093
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:09,940
 of a committed relationship with your spouse.

1094
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:11,780
 And so you have this desire,

1095
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:13,140
 and you're basically saying,

1096
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:14,700
 hey, I don't care what God says,

1097
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:16,020
 so that when I have this desire,

1098
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:19,980
 I'm gonna act on this sexual desire at will.

1099
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:21,500
 Let me tell you something.

1100
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,180
 You're gonna have sexual desires

1101
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:25,020
 for other men and women after you get married.

1102
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:27,140
 I wish I could say that wasn't true,

1103
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:28,780
 but on this side of marriage,

1104
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:29,940
 it's true.

1105
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:32,500
 And so what is God trying to do?

1106
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:34,580
 He wants you to pursue purity now,

1107
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:37,240
 so that you can have patience and self-control later

1108
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:39,300
 in your marriage, so that when you do have

1109
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:42,060
 a sexual desire for someone else who's not your wife,

1110
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:43,980
 that you have, what have you done?

1111
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:47,020
 You've built patience and self-control,

1112
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:49,840
 so that you can say no to those desires

1113
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:52,180
 after you get married, and so that you can be

1114
00:49:52,180 --> 00:49:55,600
 a one-woman man and a one-man woman.

1115
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:58,060
 Amen?

1116
00:49:58,060 --> 00:50:01,060
 And so God is not trying to rip you off.

1117
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:03,320
 He's not trying to hold out on you.

1118
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:07,300
 Pursue purity, because it's worth it.

1119
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:08,540
 He's trying to give you,

1120
00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:12,540
 he wants to give you more trust in your relationship.

1121
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:15,060
 So many relationships, so many people I meet with,

1122
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:16,320
 they don't have trust.

1123
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:20,060
 They gotta track their spouse.

1124
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:22,420
 They don't even let their spouse hang out with the boys,

1125
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:24,720
 or the girls don't even, can't even go out with the girls,

1126
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:26,820
 because they're thinking, what are you doing?

1127
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:29,800
 Because they're not giving them any reason to believe

1128
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:31,340
 that anything's different.

1129
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:36,860
 God is a God of purpose.

1130
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:39,840
 He loves you, he's created you.

1131
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:45,940
 I'm so thankful for my season of singleness,

1132
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:48,020
 and the contentment and the purity that God grew,

1133
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:50,180
 and I can stand up here tonight saying that,

1134
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:51,980
 man, I've been faithful to my wife in the midst

1135
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:54,500
 of temptation, in the midst of not being content

1136
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:57,940
 in seasons of our marriage, because God did something

1137
00:50:57,940 --> 00:50:59,380
 in that season of singleness.

1138
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:03,100
 Tonight is the night where you begin to build that, right?

1139
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:07,620
 Guys, I know, like I told you earlier, man,

1140
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:11,100
 it was a long season of singleness for me.

1141
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:13,620
 And I did things that, man, I wasn't proud of.

1142
00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:15,540
 My life wasn't content in Jesus alone,

1143
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:16,920
 and I didn't pursue purity.

1144
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:18,640
 I did the things that I felt were right,

1145
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:20,540
 like porn filled my lonely nights,

1146
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:22,980
 sexual relationships after one another,

1147
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:26,580
 left me empty, like partying, I mean, all those things,

1148
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:29,860
 right, and I kept saying to myself, who would want this?

1149
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:34,020
 Who would want this person full of baggage?

1150
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:37,100
 Who would want me full of sin and self?

1151
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:41,020
 And that's when the gospel came alive in my life,

1152
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:44,260
 and I began to realize that Jesus wants this.

1153
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:45,300
 Jesus wants me.

1154
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:46,940
 That's the whole purpose of the gospel,

1155
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:50,900
 that he became sin, he who knew no sin became sin,

1156
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:53,260
 so that we might become the righteousness of Christ,

1157
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:55,940
 so that we might be granted forgiveness

1158
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:57,340
 and be in a right standing with him

1159
00:51:57,340 --> 00:51:59,060
 because of what he's done for us on the cross.

1160
00:51:59,060 --> 00:52:01,900
 He wants you, so if you're thinking that tonight,

1161
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:02,820
 if you're like, who would want this,

1162
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:04,940
 who would want this baggage?

1163
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:06,460
 There's hope.

1164
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:09,180
 The good news of Jesus Christ,

1165
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:14,180
 God sent Jesus to do the impossible.

1166
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:18,140
 It's the greatest love story that has ever been written.

1167
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:21,280
 That he died on a criminal's cross for you and me,

1168
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:23,680
 that we wouldn't be punished for our sins,

1169
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:27,300
 but that Jesus would be punished in our place.

1170
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:34,960
 In closing, I celebrated my first Valentine's Day

1171
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:42,040
 with my wife, Kathy, back in 2013.

1172
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:44,060
 She lived in Addison.

1173
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:45,060
 We actually came to the porch.

1174
00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:48,820
 We actually sat right back there behind the sound booth.

1175
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:50,960
 Holler at my section back there.

1176
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:56,540
 I had this creative idea,

1177
00:52:56,540 --> 00:53:00,340
 this idea that was romantic,

1178
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:02,200
 but had a spiritual twist to it.

1179
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:05,220
 We were doing the long distance thing.

1180
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:06,700
 I live two hours away.

1181
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:08,780
 I'm like, hey, whatever for you, baby.

1182
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:09,720
 I'm all in.

1183
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:12,760
 She was like, let's just celebrate

1184
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:13,820
 Valentine's Day on the weekend.

1185
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:14,740
 I'm like, no, no.

1186
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:18,180
 I'm not doing that.

1187
00:53:18,180 --> 00:53:20,620
 I've fallen for that trick before.

1188
00:53:20,620 --> 00:53:29,260
 I showed up at her apartment in Addison with one rose.

1189
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:30,700
 I had it behind my back.

1190
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:31,820
 She opened the door.

1191
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:34,980
 I said, here, baby.

1192
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:36,580
 Kathy, I'm giving you this rose

1193
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:38,740
 'cause that's what they do on The Bachelor.

1194
00:53:38,740 --> 00:53:40,460
 [audience laughs]

1195
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:41,380
 I didn't say that.

1196
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:44,740
 I said, I'm giving you this rose, baby,

1197
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:45,700
 not because I'm cheap,

1198
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:47,600
 because you're worth a dozen roses.

1199
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:52,080
 But I'm giving you this rose as a symbol

1200
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:53,980
 that every time you look at this rose,

1201
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:59,480
 that God is calling you and I to be the one

1202
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:02,840
 before we ever know if we're the one for each other.

1203
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:05,520
 I want you to have this rose,

1204
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:08,000
 and I want you to look at it every day.

1205
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:12,840
 Because the most tragic thing that we could do

1206
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:16,320
 as we continue to pursue each other in this relationship

1207
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:19,040
 is we get consumed with marriage,

1208
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:20,800
 or we get consumed with engagement,

1209
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,300
 or we get consumed with these things

1210
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:24,800
 that really don't matter at the end of the day,

1211
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:27,840
 apart from becoming the one.

1212
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:29,840
 I mean, they do, but if you're not becoming the one,

1213
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:31,160
 it doesn't really matter.

1214
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:35,460
 And what I mean by becoming the one is becoming God's man.

1215
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:36,720
 The things that we talked about tonight,

1216
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:38,000
 becoming God's woman.

1217
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:43,760
 I've tried the other way, babe.

1218
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:46,020
 I don't wanna go back.

1219
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:48,120
 I don't wanna fall into sexual immorality.

1220
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:51,760
 I don't wanna do the things that the world does.

1221
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:53,800
 It's a trap, man.

1222
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:56,520
 It always overpromises, but it underdelivers.

1223
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:58,800
 So I'm giving you this one rose

1224
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:01,600
 as a symbol of every time you look at this,

1225
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:04,360
 I want you to remember that God is calling us

1226
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:09,360
 to be fixated on becoming the one that he wants us to be,

1227
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:12,320
 to become his man, to become his woman.

1228
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:15,120
 Because here's what I know.

1229
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:19,480
 If we take our crosshairs off of becoming the one,

1230
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:20,660
 then nothing else matters.

1231
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:23,160
 Marriage doesn't matter, engagement doesn't matter,

1232
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:24,680
 having kids doesn't matter,

1233
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:27,080
 living life together doesn't matter.

1234
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:27,940
 And here's what I know.

1235
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:29,560
 If we don't get married,

1236
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:31,440
 then we leave each other better than when we found

1237
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:34,360
 each other, which, wow, that'd be a crazy phenomenon

1238
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:36,240
 if we actually dated that way, right?

1239
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:39,440
 But that's how God's men date.

1240
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:40,840
 That's how God's women date.

1241
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:44,880
 And we're gonna know quickly,

1242
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:47,600
 if we focus on becoming the one,

1243
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:49,480
 if we're called to get married or not,

1244
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:51,760
 or we're gonna know quickly because the spirit of God

1245
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:53,520
 is gonna tell us that, hey, this isn't right,

1246
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:54,520
 we need to break up.

1247
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:59,240
 And so tonight, could I charge you with the same?

1248
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:04,640
 Man, we've elevated marriage sometimes so much

1249
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:07,560
 in the church that it's made you singles feel

1250
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:10,800
 like outcasted, like you don't matter.

1251
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,060
 That's not the end goal.

1252
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:16,320
 The end goal is to love the Lord your God

1253
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:18,820
 with all your heart, all your mind, all your soul.

1254
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:22,000
 The end goal is to seek first the kingdom of God

1255
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,240
 and His righteousness, and He says,

1256
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:24,440
 these things will be given to you.

1257
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:27,440
 Now, I'm not promising you, He's not promising you a spouse,

1258
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:31,880
 but He is promising you a life of fulfillment,

1259
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:35,000
 a life of purpose, a life of satisfaction,

1260
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,160
 a life of contentment.

1261
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:41,480
 And so I share that story with you tonight, not to brag,

1262
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:45,060
 not to say, look at me, 'cause God knows

1263
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:48,060
 I've gotten it wrong before, but I share that story

1264
00:56:48,060 --> 00:56:50,120
 with you because it's a redemption story.

1265
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:54,600
 And that same redemption is offered to you.

1266
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:59,260
 I share that story because the most tragic thing

1267
00:56:59,260 --> 00:57:01,860
 that you could do tonight is walk out of these doors

1268
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:04,920
 and focus on the wrong thing.

1269
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:10,060
 But I promise you that if you focus on becoming the one,

1270
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:15,840
 that if you understand that God is calling you

1271
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:20,360
 to be the one, if you focus on being God's man,

1272
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:25,080
 that you'll never be mad.

1273
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:27,860
 You'll never be mad at God, you'll never be dissatisfied.

1274
00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:29,520
 Sure, there might be some lonely moments,

1275
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:31,000
 but God is gonna be there for you.

1276
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,480
 You'll never be alone.

1277
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:35,000
 He says He'll never leave you nor forsake you.

1278
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:39,180
 It's the highest call that you could ever have.

1279
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:47,480
 And tonight I'm asking for you to take that call

1280
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:49,760
 and make it real to your life.

1281
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:51,080
 The way you do this in singleness

1282
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:53,360
 is to see your singleness as a gift.

1283
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:55,320
 Understand the reason why you're single,

1284
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:57,200
 and for most of us in the room tonight,

1285
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:01,520
 see your singleness as just for a season.

1286
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:04,240
 Let me pray that you would.

1287
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:10,120
 God in heaven, you gotta do the work that I can't do.

1288
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:20,300
 Lord, this work that I can't do is change hearts.

1289
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:24,040
 Every time I go at this, every time I get up here

1290
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:28,320
 and speak or charge a group of people,

1291
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:32,240
 there's something,

1292
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:40,640
 there's something that supernaturally has to happen

1293
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:44,280
 for you to change lives.

1294
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:49,320
 And so I'm begging you by the Spirit of God

1295
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:54,320
 to supernaturally give my friends a vision

1296
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:58,580
 of a preferred future that affects

1297
00:58:58,580 --> 00:59:00,960
 their present reality tonight,

1298
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:04,680
 that when they stand up and they worship,

1299
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:08,880
 that something changes, something shifts in their heart,

1300
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:14,080
 and God, you would be made much of in their singleness,

1301
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:16,120
 that you would get much glory,

1302
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:19,080
 whether they're single for the rest of their life

1303
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:20,880
 or they're single only for a season,

1304
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:23,920
 that God, you would allow my friends

1305
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:28,260
 to experience an unbelievable purpose

1306
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:32,780
 and vision for their life that would trump anything else

1307
00:59:32,780 --> 00:59:35,580
 that this world could offer for your glory in Christ's name.

1308
00:59:35,580 --> 00:59:36,420
 Amen.
