 [MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,160
 Well, how we doing, Dallas?

00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,480
 [CHEERING]

4
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,640
 Welcome to the porch.

5
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,720
 Hey, if you're joining us for the very first time, welcome.

6
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,960
 We know that you could be in a lot of different places

7
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,360
 right here in Dallas.

8
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,200
 And you're right here at the porch.

9
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,600
 If you're joining us online, our Porch Live locations,

10
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,320
 y'all give it up after I say it.

11
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:52,560
 The Porch Live, Tulsa, Midland, Fort Worth, Scottsdale, Arizona,

12
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:56,200
 Boise, and a host of others, welcome them with us.

13
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,040
 [CHEERING]

14
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,640
 Yeah.

15
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,120
 We're so glad that you're with us tonight.

16
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:05,080
 Hey, we've been in a series titled Essential.

17
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:09,320
 And it's this idea that we're studying these one thing

18
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,480
 statements in scripture.

19
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:14,520
 It's the one thing that gives everything else in our life

20
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,800
 perspective and clarity.

21
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,960
 And there's five of them.

22
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,960
 There's five different one thing statements in the scripture.

23
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,200
 And tonight, we're going to be diving into Philippians

24
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,640
 chapter 3 to unpack another one thing statement.

25
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,520
 So if you have your Bibles, you can open them

26
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,040
 to Philippians chapter 3.

27
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,640
 Before we get going, I was just thinking the other day,

28
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,520
 I had a thought.

29
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:45,160
 In America, we love to document our successes, don't we?

30
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:51,600
 Like trophies and trophy cases and social media even.

31
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,880
 Like we love to document where we've been, what we've done.

32
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:00,760
 And it just kind of plays out in a way where, ma'am,

33
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,120
 you're hanging out with your boys, your girls.

34
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,720
 And for me, I know when I hang out

35
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,520
 with some of my best friends, we talk about the good old days.

36
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,800
 And the good old days consist of our accomplishments

37
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,520
 and our achievements.

38
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:16,520
 I remember walking down the hallways of my high school

39
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,160
 right there in Fort Worth, Texas.

40
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,560
 North Crowley High, anybody?

41
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,080
 North Crowley?

42
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,720
 Nope, no North Crowley High?

43
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,000
 Oh, we got some North Crowley.

44
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,800
 OK, let's go.

45
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,880
 And I remember looking at the trophy cases

46
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:31,120
 and reminiscing on the past.

47
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,120
 And it brought me to a point in my journey

48
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,080
 where I was thinking about everything

49
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,760
 that I had done over the last few years of my life.

50
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,480
 Y'all remember this?

51
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,880
 These patches, right?

52
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,520
 The letter jacket, I said it earlier.

53
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,840
 Yeah, y'all, you're like, yeah, yeah, the letter jacket.

54
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,120
 They look more like rugs.

55
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,160
 I don't know why, but they just do.

56
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,720
 But they document your successes,

57
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,880
 all state, all district, right?

58
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,640
 Or if you're like me, you didn't have any patches.

59
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,880
 So I had to find a young adult that had some patches,

60
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,760
 and this brother's just balled out.

61
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:13,960
 I mean, all state, everything.

62
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,200
 And there's different flavors of this, right?

63
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,320
 It might not be a letter jacket for you,

64
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:23,600
 but it might be your resume or your LinkedIn profile

65
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,880
 and everything, all of our accomplishments,

66
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,120
 where we've been, what we've done, our GPA,

67
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:32,000
 our education is all on one sheet or one profile.

68
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,920
 Why?

69
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,720
 Because we love to document it.

70
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:40,000
 Maybe for you, it's that big game hunting.

71
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 You're like, yeah, yeah.

72
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,080
 He said, yeah.

73
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,800
 You're like, that's my buck.

74
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,360
 Yeah, I put them on the wall.

75
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,680
 It's my trophy.

76
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,440
 I killed that with my 270, my rifle.

77
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,960
 And you just kind of document it.

78
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,280
 Or there's different flavors of this,

79
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,800
 like in Dallas and other cities.

80
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,240
 And that flavor is us.

81
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,480
 Like we're the trophy.

82
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,800
 You know, we're at the gym when you're like, look at me.

83
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,760
 You know, you're flexing in the mirror.

84
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,360
 Or you know that the summer's coming,

85
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,240
 and you're going to be going out to the lake.

86
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,200
 You're going to go to that pool,

87
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,120
 and you're going to find that party cove,

88
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,720
 and you're going to take those pictures

89
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,880
 over 4th of July on the boat.

90
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,120
 Are you wakeboarding?

91
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,440
 Or are you showing off your body

92
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,200
 that was meant for your significant other,

93
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,400
 your wife or your husband?

94
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,760
 Ouch.

95
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,680
 That's all too real, right?

96
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,000
 You're like, wait, hey, get off.

97
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,560
 No, no, you ain't going there now, bro.

98
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,600
 Don't we do that though?

99
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,200
 Come on.

100
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,960
 I see y'all on the 'gram.

101
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,320
 But isn't that what we do?

102
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:53,320
 We document our successes, our achievements.

103
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:58,040
 And it gets really weird when that desire to be seen

104
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,320
 in our accomplishments overlaps in our faith,

105
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,320
 and maybe even in the church.

106
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,200
 I told you I didn't grow up in the church.

107
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:08,760
 But when I was young, I went to church for a couple years.

108
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:13,760
 And I remember doing this thing called Bible quizzers.

109
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,440
 You're like, man, when did you do that?

110
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,440
 Back in 1994, that's what it says.

111
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,760
 I mean, the trophy is so old, it's like yellow now, right?

112
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:23,600
 It's just, and I got a trophy for this.

113
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,280
 Like I got a trophy for knowing answers to the Bible.

114
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,840
 Like that's just kind of weird, man.

115
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,600
 That's just a visual award for memorizing scripture

116
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,320
 and being religious.

117
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,480
 That's crazy.

118
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:42,080
 Why do I start there tonight?

119
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:48,120
 I start tonight because we live in a culture of performance.

120
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,800
 Like it's hardwired in us.

121
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,320
 And Paul, the writer of Philippians

122
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,560
 is going to warn us against this.

123
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,720
 When you bring performance into the gospel,

124
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,680
 here's what it says.

125
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,880
 It says, Jesus Christ, you're not enough.

126
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,800
 It's not just what you've done for me, Christ.

127
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,900
 It's what I do.

128
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,480
 See, the gospel says, let me explain.

129
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,160
 The gospel says Christ performed for us,

130
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,400
 but dying on the cross three days later,

131
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,560
 raising again to defeat sin and death.

132
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,960
 And that alone is enough to forgive you and I of our sin

133
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,460
 and to be made right with him.

134
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:28,440
 But when we add some type of performance to the gospel,

135
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,760
 it says that Christ isn't enough.

136
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,280
 Question.

137
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,800
 Let me further explain it this way.

138
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:40,400
 If you die tonight and you stand before Jesus,

139
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,360
 and he says, why should I let you into heaven?

140
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,320
 What are you going to say?

141
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,840
 Like, this is in the quietness of your own heart.

142
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,320
 Don't blurt it back up here.

143
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,880
 Like, what are you going to say in that moment?

144
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,320
 Like it's you and Jesus, you stand before him.

145
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:58,080
 And he says, why should I let you in to heaven?

146
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,640
 Like, what's going to be your response?

147
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:06,020
 And if it's anything other than the life, the death,

148
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,420
 the burial and the resurrection of Jesus Christ,

149
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,400
 then you're wrong.

150
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:15,600
 If it's no, no, no God, it's because I'm a good person.

151
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,800
 I tried to obey you really, really well.

152
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,080
 I tried to do some good things, some charitable things.

153
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:29,520
 But God, I tried really hard.

154
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,360
 And you pull out your resume of performance.

155
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,000
 Here on earth, you got it wrong.

156
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,040
 Why?

157
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:39,720
 Because that makes it about you and not Christ.

158
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,480
 That makes it about me and not Christ.

159
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,560
 If I pull up my resume of performance

160
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,520
 and all the things that I think are good

161
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,880
 in the eyes of a holy, perfect God.

162
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:55,560
 In that moment, that hypothetical moment,

163
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,760
 you put all your stock in your resume.

164
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,240
 And you're like, God, I went to Africa every year

165
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,080
 to help kids that didn't have clean water,

166
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,160
 get clean water so their lives could be saved.

167
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:11,920
 Or God, I became a CEO of a fortune 500 company.

168
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,840
 Or God, I've memorized some scripture,

169
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,360
 all these different things that you're gonna pull out

170
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,440
 as your resume that points to you, not him.

171
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,280
 You tracking?

172
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,560
 This is where Paul is going tonight

173
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,700
 in Philippians chapter three.

174
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:34,240
 The gospel says only what Christ has done.

175
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,480
 Tonight we'll be in Philippians three.

176
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,200
 And here we find a guy named Paul

177
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:44,200
 who used to point to his spiritual resume.

178
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:51,080
 Watch this, Philippians three, verse three.

179
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,440
 Paul says this, "I put no confidence in my flesh,

180
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,360
 though I myself have reason for confidence in the flesh.

181
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,160
 Also, if anyone else thinks he has reason

182
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,360
 for confidence in the flesh, I have more."

183
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,200
 Sounds really prideful, Paul.

184
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,960
 But then he lists his resume.

185
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,620
 Watch.

186
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:13,280
 "Circumcised on the eighth day of the people of Israel,

187
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:16,520
 of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews,

188
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,560
 as to the law of Pharisee, as to zeal,

189
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,280
 a persecutor of the church,

190
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,240
 as to righteousness under the law, blameless."

191
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,720
 He's just, hey, he's letting them know, man, I did it.

192
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,160
 I've arrived.

193
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,240
 You're like, what does that even mean?

194
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,640
 Let me tell you what it means.

195
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,880
 Let me put it in modern day language for you.

196
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,800
 He says, "You want to talk about family?

197
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,720
 I was born to the noble parents.

198
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,640
 They got connections everywhere.

199
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:47,700
 You want to talk about education, Texas, Baylor, A&M?"

200
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,880
 I knew it.

201
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,760
 That's why I paused.

202
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:56,120
 He says, "No, Ivy League with honors.

203
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,120
 You want to talk about power?

204
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,160
 I have authority over my enemies.

205
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,720
 I can persecute them.

206
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,920
 You want to talk about religion?

207
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,320
 I've never missed a day of church,

208
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,460
 and I grew up in a Christian church.

209
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:12,520
 Listen, I've memorized more Bible than you have forgotten.

210
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,720
 You want to talk about respect?

211
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,320
 Older guys call me for advice.

212
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:19,280
 You want to talk about spirituality, stuff, status?

213
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,720
 I win, Paul says.

214
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:27,200
 Question, what are you putting your confidence in?

215
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,760
 That you never miss a Tuesday night at the porch?

216
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,240
 That you got into some Bible study,

217
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,240
 and now you know some verses?

218
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,600
 That you serve weekly in the church?

219
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,000
 Or maybe it's not so spiritual for you.

220
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,960
 Maybe you do some charity work every single weekend

221
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:49,080
 to help noble causes.

222
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:55,380
 Or maybe it's your job, your six to seven figure income,

223
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,280
 your car, the guy or girl you're dating,

224
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,320
 the promotion, your body, your good looks,

225
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,440
 your gifts and your skills.

226
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,080
 Then what Paul's going to do,

227
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,040
 he's going to flip the whole thing on its head.

228
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,840
 And he's going to say, hey,

229
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,520
 this is where I thought my worth was.

230
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:16,400
 This is where I thought my confidence lied in,

231
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,080
 in my spiritual resume, accomplishment and stuff.

232
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,440
 But now I know.

233
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:27,000
 Verse seven, but whatever gain I had, says Paul,

234
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,320
 I counted it as loss for the sake of Christ.

235
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,480
 Indeed, I counted everything as loss

236
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,480
 because of the surpassing worth

237
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,320
 of knowing Christ Jesus, my Lord.

238
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,640
 For his sake, I have suffered the loss of all things

239
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,400
 and count them as rubbish

240
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,340
 in order that I may gain Christ and be found in him.

241
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:46,640
 Not having a righteousness of my own

242
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,400
 that comes from the law,

243
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,320
 but that which comes through faith in Christ.

244
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:56,200
 The righteousness from God that depends on faith.

245
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,280
 See, he's reiterating what we just talked about.

246
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,520
 That when you stand before God,

247
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,800
 that when I stand before God,

248
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,240
 we're not going to be able to pull out our list of things

249
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,140
 that we've done.

250
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:09,360
 The law that we've come up in our own mind,

251
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,100
 that if I do this or do that, then I'm good.

252
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,080
 We're not gonna be able to pull that out.

253
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:17,200
 He says, no, it's not a righteousness of my own

254
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,400
 that comes by obeying a bunch of rules.

255
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:23,480
 It comes through faith in Christ and what he's done.

256
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:27,160
 (congregation laughing)

257
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,840
 The Greek word here for rubbish is scrupola,

258
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:34,800
 which literally means garbage or dung.

259
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,320
 All the stuff Paul gained in his life is garbage

260
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,400
 compared to what?

261
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,360
 Knowing Christ.

262
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,680
 Like see, the best of our best.

263
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:50,680
 Without Jesus, it looks like a pile of garbage in our life.

264
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,360
 But we fail to believe that, don't we?

265
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,980
 I fail to believe that.

266
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,600
 The guy standing on stage at times

267
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,320
 wants to go back to my resume,

268
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,820
 wants to go back to the list,

269
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:05,440
 wants to go back to what I do instead of what he's done.

270
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,760
 So Paul's saying, if you're gonna pursue righteousness,

271
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,040
 pursue Jesus.

272
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:16,640
 Don't let looking good on the outside be your goal

273
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,960
 or just being better for the sake of being better.

274
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,760
 He says, no, if you're going to pursue

275
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:26,240
 being the man or woman that God's called you to be,

276
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,460
 you got to do that by pursuing Christ.

277
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:36,340
 Question, what kind of desperation for God

278
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,040
 did you come into this place with?

279
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:41,800
 I know you've had a long day.

280
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,640
 Some of you worked 12, 13 hours.

281
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:48,060
 You fought traffic, you haven't eaten, but you're here.

282
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:53,740
 I just wonder, like what kind of desperation

283
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,620
 did we come into this place with

284
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:59,140
 when it comes to our yearning for God?

285
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:01,140
 Like see, ever since I came to Christ

286
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:04,180
 back in college, my junior year,

287
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:06,160
 I've always resonated with men and women

288
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,820
 that have a deep yearning for God.

289
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:14,300
 They desire to be drawn by a passionate pleading

290
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,140
 for more of God.

291
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:18,220
 Like when I read Psalm 63, one, David says it like this.

292
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:20,540
 Oh God, you are my God.

293
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:23,600
 Earnestly, I seek you, my soul thirst for you.

294
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,060
 My flesh faints for you as in a dry and weary land

295
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,760
 where there is no water.

296
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:32,580
 This is not David saying, I just want to be a better guy.

297
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,380
 This is David saying, I'm yearning for my depths

298
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:37,820
 with an active soul desperation.

299
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,460
 David's crying out to God, God, I got to have you.

300
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:44,660
 I wonder if there's any people tonight.

301
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,440
 That want to seek God like that.

302
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:53,460
 He continues in verse two, he just says,

303
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:56,860
 so I have looked upon your sanctuary,

304
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:59,460
 beholding your power and glory

305
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:02,860
 because your steadfast love is better than life itself.

306
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,260
 My lips will praise you, so I'll bless you

307
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:07,080
 as long as I live.

308
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,100
 In your name, I will lift up my hands.

309
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:13,900
 My soul will be satisfied as with fat and rich food

310
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:17,220
 and my mouth will praise you with joyful lips.

311
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,500
 For David, God isn't some distant father

312
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,540
 or just some intellectual ascent.

313
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,780
 He's near.

314
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:29,320
 He's a father that wants to dwell with his children.

315
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:34,140
 He continues on in verse six and he just says,

316
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:38,740
 when I remember you upon my bed and meditate on you

317
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:42,500
 in the watches of the night, for you have been my help.

318
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,980
 And in the shadow of your wings, I will sing for joy.

319
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:48,020
 My soul clings to you, your right hand upholds me.

320
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:50,500
 I resonate so much with King David

321
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,020
 because when you read the Psalms,

322
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:56,160
 he kind of vacillates between God, you're awesome,

323
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,860
 you're amazing, I just want more of you.

324
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:00,660
 And then all of a sudden he's like, God, where are you?

325
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,180
 Like, I feel far from you.

326
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:08,780
 God, I feel like you've abandoned me, that you've left me.

327
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:14,440
 I was 30 years old and still single.

328
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:19,960
 I remember reading this passage of scripture.

329
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,480
 I mean, just the part where it says,

330
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,160
 I'm in my bed and I meditate on you

331
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,720
 and I'm watching for you in the night

332
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,960
 and I'm crying out to you.

333
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,040
 And I just remember saying, God, have you forgotten me?

334
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:30,880
 Have you abandoned me?

335
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:35,220
 Have you not seen me?

336
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:42,680
 And in that moment, God was like, no, I'm right here

337
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,560
 where I've always been.

338
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,820
 I haven't abandoned you.

339
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:50,760
 Josiah, the goal is me.

340
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,880
 The end goal is me.

341
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,920
 And I hear your heart, Josiah.

342
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,560
 I know you want to be married and you want to have a family,

343
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,660
 but are you satisfied with me and me alone?

344
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:05,800
 Because if you don't get there, Josiah,

345
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,200
 then you're going to find out

346
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:12,400
 that spouses make miserable saviors.

347
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:19,340
 What is God doing in your yearning?

348
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:23,780
 What does God want to do in your yearning?

349
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:27,500
 What does God want to do in you thinking

350
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,520
 that God is some distant God that doesn't care for you

351
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,500
 or doesn't see you?

352
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,640
 He's after your heart.

353
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:37,860
 And if he would give you the thing you want,

354
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:42,860
 it might cause you not to yearn and seek and pursue him

355
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:46,720
 the same way you would if you didn't get what you want.

356
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:57,360
 David and other biblical figures who wrote

357
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,540
 and spoke this way were not just pursuing experiences,

358
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:03,500
 they were pursuing God.

359
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,020
 This is why David writes in Psalm 42,

360
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:08,980
 "As a deer pants for flowing streams,

361
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:11,940
 so pants my soul for you, O God,

362
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,700
 my soul thirst for God, for the living God."

363
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,240
 And so what we'd like to do with this verse

364
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,940
 is we like to cheese this verse up.

365
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,820
 We like to put it on a coffee mug or a t-shirt

366
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,380
 where there's an actual deer on it,

367
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:26,060
 and we put that verse under the deer.

368
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,380
 And this is crazy.

369
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,220
 Why?

370
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:30,460
 Because David right here is in pain.

371
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:33,060
 He's crying out and he's saying, "Why can't I get there?

372
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:34,820
 Why can't I get more of you?

373
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:38,480
 Why do you not feel near to me, God?"

374
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,800
 And so what do we do in those moments?

375
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:48,240
 We lean in all the more.

376
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,420
 And we say, "God, I'm not getting up from this place

377
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:55,520
 until I connect with you,

378
00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:01,740
 until I begin to see you clearly from your word

379
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:06,700
 where I begin to see you for who you really are

380
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:09,340
 in the midst of my circumstances, in the midst of my pain.

381
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:13,300
 I want to know you in a deep, intimate way."

382
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:18,420
 You stay in it, even if that comes with tears,

383
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:21,580
 even if it comes with sadness.

384
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:23,380
 As I laid in bed that night,

385
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:27,580
 thinking that maybe I would never get married.

386
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:31,340
 And God said, "Well, am I enough?

387
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:32,740
 Will I still be enough?"

388
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:37,300
 And I had to wrestle that down.

389
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:43,620
 And I came to a place where, "God, you're enough."

390
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:46,980
 And he met me in that pain.

391
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:52,860
 Maybe for some of you right now,

392
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:55,980
 you're sitting there saying, "Well, what does that look like?

393
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:58,620
 It just looks like you crying out to God

394
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:00,180
 and say, 'God, I need you.

395
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:03,460
 I know I can't self-manufacture this on my own.

396
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:08,460
 I need your spirit to meet me in my distress.'"

397
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,500
 Paul goes on to say in verse eight,

398
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,820
 "Indeed, I count everything as loss

399
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:15,860
 because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus,

400
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,900
 my Lord, for his sake, I have suffered the loss

401
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,940
 of all things and count them as rubbish

402
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:23,740
 in order that I may gain Christ."

403
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:26,380
 Maybe for some of you, you're sitting there saying,

404
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:31,380
 "In 2024, I wanna have this desire that Paul has.

405
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:34,620
 I wanna have this mindset that everything else is lost

406
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,100
 compared to the infinite value

407
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:39,580
 of knowing Christ Jesus, my Lord, like the way he does."

408
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:42,380
 You wanna know how you get there?

409
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:45,100
 You believe what Paul believed,

410
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:48,980
 that nothing else in his life mattered

411
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:53,900
 except for knowing him.

412
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:57,820
 Like Jesus was ultimate.

413
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,020
 He knew with all of his heart

414
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:01,180
 that Jesus was the best thing for him.

415
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:03,700
 He knew that Jesus was the best thing for his finances.

416
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,620
 It was the best thing for his relationship.

417
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:07,500
 It was the best thing for his dating.

418
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,360
 It was the best thing for everything

419
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,680
 that he could possibly do, his job,

420
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,540
 everything that he spent his time,

421
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:17,220
 treasure, talent on, Jesus was better.

422
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,920
 This is how you get there.

423
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,820
 He counted everything as lost

424
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:29,360
 compared to the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus.

425
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:39,700
 Like you, you don't wear this anymore.

426
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,060
 Well, maybe some of you do.

427
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:45,120
 Let's talk about that after service if you do.

428
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:49,940
 But this is a picture of some of our lives

429
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:54,300
 where everything about us

430
00:21:54,300 --> 00:22:01,540
 is spelling out where we've been, what we've done.

431
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:07,620
 And Paul simply just says, "I count this as rubbish,

432
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:09,460
 trash for the sake of Christ."

433
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:11,700
 You're like, "Well, man, why do you still have this trophy?

434
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,420
 I don't know why I still have the trophy."

435
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:14,260
 But you know what?

436
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:16,300
 I'm glad I have it because it was an illustration

437
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,580
 that says even my spiritual resume,

438
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:22,140
 even everything I've done for Christ is trash

439
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:25,700
 for the sake of Christ, right?

440
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,880
 I mean, isn't that where we're trying to get to?

441
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,300
 This is what Paul is pleading with us tonight

442
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,660
 that whatever you think you do for Christ,

443
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:33,980
 I don't know what it is for you.

444
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:36,460
 Maybe it's your car, right?

445
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:39,160
 You're like, "Bro, you can have my car, it's a hoopty."

446
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:44,180
 Not for some of you, I've been out in that parking lot.

447
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:50,380
 And Paul says, "Even my car is trash for the sake of Christ."

448
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:57,700
 Money, we're chasing this, especially in Dallas,

449
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:00,980
 the performance track, the hamster wheel of,

450
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:04,380
 "Man, if I do this, I'll get that raise, I'll go there."

451
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:08,580
 And God is saying through Paul that even money

452
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:13,300
 can't buy the satisfaction and the contentment

453
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,020
 that Christ can give you.

454
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,660
 It's rubbish.

455
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:19,180
 It's trash.

456
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:25,300
 Your resume that you fit on one page, maybe two,

457
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:30,780
 is trash for the sake of knowing Christ.

458
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:36,080
 For some of us, it's our looks, it's external beauty.

459
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,180
 Ladies, I mean, I'm not trying to pick on you.

460
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:41,620
 This is just from one of our staff team,

461
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:44,460
 her makeup bag, right?

462
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,860
 But it's the same way for you men.

463
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:50,260
 Like you don't have this, but you got your thing.

464
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:54,460
 I've been in some of the bathrooms of young adult men,

465
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:55,460
 and I'm like, "Dang, I didn't even know

466
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:57,100
 they had products like that."

467
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:00,940
 And whatever you're doing to all this stuff,

468
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:03,620
 and I'm not saying, you know what?

469
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:05,660
 I'm not saying it's wrong in and of itself,

470
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:08,580
 but some of us allow it to distract us so much.

471
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,420
 And Paul says, "No, no, no, no, no, no.

472
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:14,620
 It's garbage compared to the infinite value

473
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,740
 of knowing Christ Jesus, our Lord."

474
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:21,740
 Your job, even your job,

475
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:25,740
 whatever you're putting your stock in,

476
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:28,380
 that corner office, that promotion,

477
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:33,380
 it's garbage for the sake of knowing Christ Jesus, our Lord.

478
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:37,180
 Some of you are like, "But my education, man,

479
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:39,060
 I went to A&M."

480
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,740
 (congregation laughing)

481
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:43,180
 And I'm like, "Did you not just hear Paul?

482
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:45,820
 He said, 'I did Ivy with honors.'

483
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:48,780
 Good for your A&M.

484
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:50,460
 It's garbage."

485
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,420
 See, it doesn't even fit.

486
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:53,260
 It's garbage.

487
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:56,900
 I'll make it fit.

488
00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:00,580
 (congregation laughing)

489
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:04,620
 Some of you, your phone, your social media.

490
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:06,900
 Oops, someone needed to say ouch instead of amen.

491
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:09,500
 (congregation laughing)

492
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:12,860
 Your phone, your social media, it's garbage.

493
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:19,320
 And even my family.

494
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:24,260
 I know it, but this is what God is trying

495
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:27,860
 to get every single one of you as a single two,

496
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:31,580
 that you would love Him and your love for Him

497
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:34,140
 in comparison to your love for your family

498
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:36,660
 would pale in comparison.

499
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:39,500
 It would almost look like hatred, Jesus says.

500
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:48,860
 Marriage, family is garbage

501
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:53,340
 compared to the surpassing worth

502
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:54,700
 of knowing Christ Jesus, our Lord.

503
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:55,600
 And some of you right now, you're like,

504
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,740
 "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, bro.

505
00:25:56,740 --> 00:26:00,220
 That's an intense exercise you just did.

506
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:03,140
 I don't feel like all those things are bad in and of themself."

507
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:04,140
 They're not.

508
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:07,740
 But He's better.

509
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:10,940
 That's the purpose.

510
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,140
 He's better.

511
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:14,060
 (congregation applauding)

512
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:16,700
 And you might ask,

513
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:19,640
 "Can these things not help me love Jesus more?"

514
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,200
 Yes, they can.

515
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,020
 My wife helps me love Jesus more.

516
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:25,300
 My kids help me love Jesus more.

517
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,100
 But here's the deal.

518
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:31,740
 Many times, those things become a distraction

519
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,500
 from the main thing,

520
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,420
 from you and I's relationship with Christ.

521
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:39,460
 This is where Paul is going into this text.

522
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:45,620
 He's just pulling the band-aid off tonight.

523
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:47,940
 And he's asking you and I to do an inventory.

524
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,360
 C.S. Lewis said it like this,

525
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,760
 "Our desire for pleasure is not too great.

526
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,840
 Our desire for pleasure is too small."

527
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,140
 Here's what he's saying.

528
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:58,540
 He's saying we pursue pleasure in the moment,

529
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:00,500
 but we hold out.

530
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:03,260
 We hold out for,

531
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,820
 we don't hold out for ultimate pleasure.

532
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:07,000
 We just like, whatever the fleeting pleasures of the day,

533
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,100
 we just give our minds attention and our hearts affection to.

534
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:14,840
 Man, I've done this.

535
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,980
 You've done this.

536
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:18,900
 So let's just run through some of them.

537
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,820
 I really, really wanna be married,

538
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:22,160
 but I want sex right now.

539
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:25,900
 I really, really wanna be married.

540
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:26,980
 I wanna find the one,

541
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,700
 but I wanna look at this naked girl,

542
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,100
 this two-dimensional image.

543
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:33,460
 On my phone before I go to bed.

544
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:35,780
 Hey, I really, really wanna get married,

545
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:38,240
 but I want his attention more.

546
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,380
 When you know he's no good for you.

547
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:45,940
 I want God, I want a relationship with him.

548
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,020
 And one day I'll pursue that

549
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:48,880
 because I know I need that before I die.

550
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,540
 But right now I just wanna do me.

551
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:54,420
 It feels good what I'm doing.

552
00:27:54,420 --> 00:28:00,060
 And we pursue fleeting pleasures.

553
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,140
 One more.

554
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:04,620
 I wanna really serve God in my singleness,

555
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:05,940
 but my job has become an idol.

556
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:08,260
 I'm working 60 to 70 hours a week,

557
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:11,300
 but that paycheck that drops into my bank account

558
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,580
 is really nice.

559
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:18,820
 And we pursue fleeting pleasures.

560
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:22,340
 We sell out for fleeting pleasures.

561
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:26,420
 So the question that begs us tonight is this.

562
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:29,360
 Why is Christ not your greatest desire?

563
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,080
 Why don't we pursue him like a first love?

564
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,680
 Everything else is garbage compared to that pursuit.

565
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:40,760
 Several years ago, I met my wife, Kathy,

566
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,680
 and we started dating and she was living in Dallas

567
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:45,960
 and I was living like four hours away round trip.

568
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,240
 Like it was a hike to get to Dallas.

569
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,560
 And we came to this thing on Tuesday nights

570
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,480
 called the porch.

571
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,540
 And we used to sit right back there behind the sound booth,

572
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:57,840
 right there in the middle.

573
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:04,080
 And I just remember saying,

574
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,840
 man, that's a lot of hours of drive time.

575
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,120
 Four hours going to the porch

576
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,400
 and then we go on a date right after.

577
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:16,680
 And I wouldn't leave Dallas to like 1030, 11 o'clock.

578
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:19,960
 And I wouldn't get back home till after midnight, 1 a.m.

579
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,440
 And I have to get up at 5 a.m.

580
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,500
 Why did I do that?

581
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,340
 Why?

582
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:27,000
 Because my love for Kathy wasn't just an emotion,

583
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,120
 it was devotion.

584
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,920
 And this is what Paul is getting at,

585
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:34,920
 that our love for him pales in comparison to other things.

586
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,600
 And some of us, we say we love God,

587
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,920
 but it's no more than emotion that just kind of flees

588
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,400
 and it's fleeting and it comes and goes.

589
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:45,680
 And it's not this devotion that you do anything

590
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:49,800
 and everything to put him as the priority of your life.

591
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:56,760
 Paul goes in in verse 12 and he says this,

592
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,400
 "Not that I've already attained this

593
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:02,780
 "or I'm already perfect, but I press on to make it my own

594
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:05,840
 "because Christ Jesus has made me his own."

595
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,440
 Paul presses on, this present tense,

596
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:12,560
 because Christ has made him his own past tense.

597
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:16,440
 Paul's obedience to press on is directly correlated

598
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:20,600
 to God's ownership of him, of the gospel,

599
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:23,400
 of God saying, "No, no, no, you're mine, Paul.

600
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:26,460
 "I've given up my life through my son,

601
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:28,760
 "my one and only son who hung on that tree

602
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:32,120
 "so that I could make you my very own."

603
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:35,160
 And so Paul's obedience to press on

604
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:39,800
 is correlated to the gospel of Jesus Christ.

605
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,760
 The gospel says this, that God loves you

606
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:46,400
 and there's nothing else that you can do to earn that love.

607
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,920
 There's no amount of resume building

608
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:52,800
 that he came on a rescue mission over 2,000 years ago,

609
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,640
 Christ who left the comforts of heaven

610
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,080
 for a cross here on earth to pay for the sins of humanity.

611
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:04,380
 And you and I, we're bankrupt without Christ.

612
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:08,880
 There's no one that will cross over from death to life

613
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:13,120
 apart from putting their faith and trust in Christ.

614
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,600
 And anyone who repents of their sin

615
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,360
 and believes in what Christ has done for them

616
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,200
 will be made right with him.

617
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,700
 And Jesus says, "You're mine."

618
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:26,380
 I liken it to my little girls.

619
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:29,420
 I have two little girls, Camille and Isabella,

620
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,580
 and I love them so much.

621
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:35,780
 And anytime I can share what true love really is, I try.

622
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:39,100
 And so I was tucking them into bed last night

623
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:42,260
 and I just said, "Hey girls, I love you,"

624
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:44,860
 to which they always say, "I love you too, Daddy."

625
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:46,900
 And it's the cutest thing ever.

626
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:49,200
 And I just, it dawned on me.

627
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,560
 I was like, man, I wonder if they know why I love them.

628
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:55,220
 Like there's just a question that came up in my mind.

629
00:31:55,220 --> 00:32:00,220
 And I just said, "Man, I'm just gonna ask them.

630
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:02,500
 "Hey girls, do you know why Daddy loves you?"

631
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:05,460
 To which they said, "Because we obey you."

632
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:07,260
 And I said, "Oh."

633
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:12,500
 And then you take us to tongue in cheek ice cream.

634
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,240
 That's really what Camille said.

635
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,820
 And I said, "Not quite."

636
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:21,960
 And I leaned over and I put their face in my hand

637
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,980
 and they're looking up at me and they're smiling.

638
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:27,600
 And those eyes that pierce my heart every time I look at 'em.

639
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,860
 And I said, "Daddy loves you.

640
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:33,520
 "Daddy loves you because you're mine."

641
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:38,520
 Like God has given you to me, to steward, to help raise,

642
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:43,720
 but he's given you to Daddy and Mommy to love

643
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:46,980
 and to care for, not because of what you do for us,

644
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:49,480
 but because of just you're mine.

645
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:54,340
 And I share that story with you because isn't it nice

646
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:56,860
 when someone's love for you is not contingent

647
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:58,040
 upon what you do?

648
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:02,140
 So it is with the love of God.

649
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:05,660
 It's not contingent upon you.

650
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:11,500
 If you could get to heaven based on your resume

651
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:14,060
 of good works, what was the point of Jesus

652
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:15,020
 down on the cross?

653
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:19,260
 He says, "You're mine."

654
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:23,100
 For everyone who puts their faith and trust in him.

655
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:28,940
 It's also helpful here that Paul says,

656
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:31,260
 "Not that I've already obtained this."

657
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:33,060
 It's comforting for us to hear this, right?

658
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:34,700
 Not that I'm already perfect.

659
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,580
 He's acknowledging that he still struggles

660
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:38,340
 and needs to grow.

661
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:41,680
 I love the honesty, the authenticity in Paul.

662
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,580
 And he said, "You must continue to follow Jesus."

663
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:46,580
 So he says, "Press on."

664
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:48,660
 Think about this in relation to your own sin,

665
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:51,180
 your own struggles, whatever that is, right?

666
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,020
 Kylan said last week,

667
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:54,500
 if we just put all of our struggles back here on the screen,

668
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,500
 like it would make us blush.

669
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,940
 Like we would just walk out and get out of here.

670
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:03,940
 But think about this in the context of whatever sin

671
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:05,840
 that you're struggling with today.

672
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:10,660
 And here, Paul's saying that there's a right way

673
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:12,060
 to struggle and a wrong way to struggle.

674
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:14,180
 The wrong way to struggle is to describe it like this.

675
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:15,060
 Let me control it.

676
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:16,300
 Let me manage my sin.

677
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:18,780
 Let me kind of do my own thing over here

678
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:20,260
 and act like it doesn't exist.

679
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:24,620
 And the right way to struggle is to press into Jesus.

680
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:29,260
 You know, my story of coming to Christ

681
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:34,220
 is one of real struggle.

682
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:37,100
 Like I had some things happen in my family growing up

683
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:40,340
 that produced a lot of heartache in my life.

684
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:42,020
 My parents divorced at a young age.

685
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:45,980
 And I just remember that, you know, that growing up,

686
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:47,860
 that environment that I was part of,

687
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:49,180
 it produced two things in me.

688
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:51,140
 It was kind of some generational sin.

689
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:54,100
 There was two things that I really struggled with.

690
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:56,740
 One was anger, was my temper.

691
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:58,460
 And the other one was lust

692
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:03,420
 that turned into a porn addiction for a decade of my life.

693
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:07,660
 And I remember when the light bulb turned on,

694
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:09,560
 when the veil was removed from my eyes,

695
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,680
 and I was playing college baseball at the time,

696
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,060
 and thinking that I had everything,

697
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:15,460
 the world at its fingertips.

698
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:17,980
 And I remember God revealing to me my sin

699
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:19,420
 in light of who He is.

700
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:21,820
 And I cried out to God and just said, "God, I need you.

701
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:25,580
 I can't go out, I can't go along anymore without you."

702
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:27,700
 I remember repenting of my sin

703
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,580
 and trusting in what Christ had done.

704
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:31,700
 And then I remember just thinking,

705
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:34,500
 "Well, surely like my temper is gonna go away

706
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,860
 and my lust is gonna go away.

707
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:37,340
 I'm not gonna struggle anymore."

708
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:39,020
 But that's not what happened.

709
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:41,960
 There were still struggles

710
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:46,620
 that I had to work out in my faith.

711
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:49,360
 And this is what Paul is saying,

712
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:53,180
 the way we struggle well, the way we keep going,

713
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:57,300
 the way we press on is what he says in 2 Corinthians 3.18,

714
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:00,580
 that it is by beholding, it's by seeing Jesus,

715
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:04,340
 that we are transformed from one degree of glory to another

716
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:05,920
 into the image of Christ,

717
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:09,620
 that you and I would grow in our character in Christ,

718
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:11,100
 that we would look and say,

719
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:15,060
 "Hey, what in my life is inconsistent with Christ's character?"

720
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:18,900
 And we would begin to repent of that.

721
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:21,860
 And we begin to see Jesus more in light of our sin

722
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:24,220
 and understand His grace even more.

723
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:26,260
 It wouldn't cause us to run from Him.

724
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:27,780
 It would cause us to lean into Him

725
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:31,340
 because you can't out-sin the grace of God.

726
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:34,980
 And if you've truly experienced His grace,

727
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:37,500
 then it causes you to lean in all the more.

728
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,820
 How do we beat sin?

729
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:44,300
 We beat sin by pressing into Jesus,

730
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:46,540
 knowing Him, chasing Him, and He knows our struggles.

731
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:50,540
 Like, it'd be crazy for us to try to hide that.

732
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:54,060
 I always say that the power of sin is in secrecy.

733
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:58,420
 And like Colin said last week,

734
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:00,980
 the freest people in the room

735
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:02,940
 are those who no longer have to hide.

736
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:07,620
 And we just come to Christ with everything that we are

737
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:10,320
 and all of our hangups and all of our sin.

738
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,980
 And we just say, "Here it is, God.

739
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:16,200
 "Take it, go to work."

740
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,000
 And we get honest with ourself.

741
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,740
 This is what Paul is saying.

742
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:23,560
 Paul's reminded of the tainted past

743
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:26,120
 filled with his own horrific sin.

744
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:29,200
 Like he used to persecute and kill Christians,

745
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:33,700
 but he knew the grace of God in his darkest hour of life.

746
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:36,520
 And so this is why he says in verse 13, he says,

747
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:40,300
 "Brothers, I do not consider that I've made it my own."

748
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,760
 I haven't arrived.

749
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,040
 I always say on this side of eternity,

750
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,100
 Christians never arrive.

751
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,780
 We keep pressing in.

752
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:48,480
 We keep knowing more and more about God.

753
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:52,160
 But one thing I do, forgetting what lies behind me

754
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,100
 and straining forward to what lies ahead,

755
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:56,060
 I press onto the goal for the prize

756
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:59,780
 of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.

757
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:01,520
 So what do we do?

758
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,140
 You see that phrase, one thing.

759
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:07,340
 What is this one thing that Paul is telling us to do?

760
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:08,180
 Don't miss it.

761
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:09,820
 He's saying, "Press on toward the prize."

762
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:10,660
 What is the prize?

763
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:11,860
 It's Christ Jesus.

764
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:13,020
 How do we do this?

765
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:16,340
 We forget what lies behind and we press on.

766
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:19,300
 We strive to what's ahead.

767
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,340
 Those are the two things.

768
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,580
 So number one, forget what lies behind.

769
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:27,260
 Paul's not saying that we forget totally what's behind us.

770
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:28,100
 Like that's crazy.

771
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,260
 I mean, all throughout the scripture, God says,

772
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:33,340
 "No, I want you to remember what I've done in your life.

773
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:36,620
 "I want you to remember the goodness and the power

774
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:38,900
 "and the things that I've helped you overcome."

775
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:41,100
 All of us come into this room with something hard.

776
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:42,100
 Throughout the Christian life,

777
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,460
 we've experienced various wins.

778
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:46,900
 But Paul is saying, "Be careful

779
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:49,460
 "that you don't feast on old manna."

780
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:52,820
 Like God wants to give you new manna today.

781
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:54,820
 That's for today, new grace today.

782
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:56,560
 That's for the struggles today.

783
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:01,540
 1 Corinthians 10, 12, Paul says, he actually warns us.

784
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:05,100
 He says, "Therefore, if anyone who thinks that he stands,

785
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:07,360
 "therefore let anyone who thinks he stands

786
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,780
 "take heed unless he falls.

787
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:13,820
 "Be careful not to put too much confidence in your flesh

788
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:17,260
 "because those of us that have too much confidence

789
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:19,540
 "in our flesh will surely fall."

790
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:22,660
 But that we would be dependent on God.

791
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:25,140
 Don't live off the victories of yesterday.

792
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:31,060
 Yesterday's grace is inadequate for today's struggle,

793
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:31,920
 Paul is saying.

794
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:35,220
 Today comes with a grace of his own.

795
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:39,900
 His mercies are new, come on, every morning.

796
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:44,900
 This is what it looks like to press on,

797
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:48,340
 to pursue Christ.

798
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:50,860
 Second, forget past sins.

799
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:52,900
 Don't let them define you.

800
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:56,480
 And the other thing Paul says is not to be defined by shame.

801
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:00,180
 I mean, I just remember when I first came to Christ,

802
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:03,220
 I was like, how do I not define myself by shame?

803
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:06,020
 And someone looked at me and said,

804
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:09,220
 "Well, if God doesn't condemn you,

805
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:10,940
 "if God doesn't shame you,

806
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:14,180
 "if that was put on the cross when he died,

807
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:15,860
 "why would you put that on you?"

808
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:21,580
 And so God is just reminding us in this moment

809
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:23,940
 that therefore there is no condemnation

810
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:25,700
 for those that are in Christ Jesus.

811
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:30,820
 And so some of us, we've had things done to us,

812
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:32,860
 or we've done things that we can't even mention

813
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:34,620
 or talk about.

814
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:36,140
 And in the last several years of ministry,

815
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:40,340
 I've seen people heal from the prison of their secrets.

816
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:43,220
 And God is in the business of restoring and making new.

817
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:46,420
 And Paul is saying, forget what's behind us,

818
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:48,580
 but not this idea of forgetting

819
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:53,300
 in a way that you just suppress it and you don't address it.

820
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:56,760
 No, no, Paul is saying, hey, don't let this own you.

821
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:00,260
 But he doesn't say don't own up to it,

822
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:02,380
 but he is saying, don't let it own you.

823
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:06,620
 So when you confess it, receive the grace.

824
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:08,620
 Whatever your sin is, receive the grace

825
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:10,940
 so that you can take that same grace

826
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:13,840
 and give it away and forgive others.

827
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,680
 Why?

828
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:17,340
 Because forgiven people always forgive people.

829
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:25,300
 We also see that God's grace for our sin

830
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:30,300
 can actually be rooted in this incredible fact

831
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:34,820
 that you and I, when we see God's grace,

832
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:39,820
 we now can boast about our weaknesses.

833
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:43,260
 Paul says it like this in 2 Corinthians 12, nine,

834
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:46,260
 that, hey, I can boast about my weaknesses

835
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:47,740
 because when I'm weak, he's strong.

836
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:49,620
 He also says in 2 Corinthians 11, 30,

837
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:52,480
 if I must boast, I will boast about the things

838
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,680
 that show my weakness.

839
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:54,520
 Why?

840
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:59,920
 So that the power of Christ can rest upon you.

841
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:04,640
 If you always come into this place with a resume,

842
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:07,680
 like I'm good, I got this, I don't need anybody,

843
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:12,680
 everything's good, you never experience his power

844
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:18,020
 because his power is given to the people

845
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:20,880
 who have a humble and contrite heart.

846
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,600
 Do you have that tonight?

847
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,400
 Is your heart humble and contrite?

848
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:32,040
 Number two, strive forward to what lies ahead.

849
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:34,160
 I'm straining forward and I'm pressing onward

850
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:37,320
 and I'm pressing on like he's the only prize there is.

851
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:40,520
 Paul uses this language all the time.

852
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:41,720
 And I love this language.

853
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:44,480
 He says in 1 Corinthians 9, 23 through 27,

854
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,760
 I do it all for the sake of the gospel

855
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:48,840
 that I may share in its blessings.

856
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:51,520
 Do you not know that in a race, all runners run,

857
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,560
 but only one receives the prize?

858
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:55,720
 So run that you may obtain it.

859
00:42:55,720 --> 00:43:00,440
 Every athlete exercises self-control in the things they do.

860
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:03,000
 And they do it to receive a perishable wreath,

861
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,680
 but we an imperishable.

862
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,440
 So do not run aimlessly.

863
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,760
 I do not box as one beating the air,

864
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:13,360
 but I discipline my body and keep it under control

865
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:15,320
 lest after preaching to others,

866
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:17,520
 I myself should be disqualified.

867
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,960
 Paul's saying that nobody runs a race to lose it.

868
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:22,200
 He says, no, we run to win.

869
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:23,160
 How do we do this?

870
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:25,200
 We have to train.

871
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,520
 We have to strive.

872
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:29,560
 We have to discipline ourself

873
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:33,680
 if we're gonna win against sin

874
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:38,680
 and the things that are coming after us every single day.

875
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:41,640
 Isn't this contrary to your side to grace?

876
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:44,320
 Talking about all this striving and toiling and training

877
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,200
 and discipline ourselves.

878
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:49,280
 No, Dallas Willard says it like this.

879
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:52,920
 Grace is not opposed to effort, but to earning.

880
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:56,480
 One of the best ways for us to get grace wrong

881
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:00,440
 is to believe it means we don't have to work

882
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:02,320
 in the Christian life.

883
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:05,200
 See, nobody just stumbles into godliness.

884
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:10,200
 Nobody just shows up a powerful person of God

885
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:14,880
 because they didn't discipline themselves.

886
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:17,640
 They didn't train themselves in God's word

887
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:19,240
 and to memorize scripture.

888
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:25,440
 See, if we truly believe that we're saved from our work,

889
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:31,600
 then we would work harder purely out of gratitude.

890
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:33,560
 If we really believe that there's nothing we can do

891
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:35,520
 to get to God and he's done everything,

892
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:39,760
 and we don't work for our salvation,

893
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,080
 then you and I would work from our salvation

894
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:44,240
 out of gratitude and worship

895
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,800
 because of what Christ has done for us.

896
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,800
 Is that true in your life?

897
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:55,360
 John Calvin said it like this.

898
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:57,600
 We are saved through faith alone,

899
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:00,240
 but not by faith that is alone.

900
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:03,680
 Every time you see faith in someone's life,

901
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:06,960
 it's always accompanied by works.

902
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:10,160
 James says it like this.

903
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:12,320
 Faith without works is dead.

904
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,000
 Wherever there is faith in Christ,

905
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,560
 good works will surely follow.

906
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:21,040
 So what are those good works?

907
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:25,840
 There's a change that happens in a person's heart.

908
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:29,440
 It happened to me my junior year of college

909
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:34,080
 where I never desired to get in God's word and read it,

910
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:39,240
 but then I couldn't stop putting it down.

911
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:45,280
 I had no desire to fight against pornography,

912
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:48,720
 but I couldn't stop putting up guardrails

913
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:52,640
 to not give myself access to look at it

914
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:55,840
 because I knew that when temptation

915
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:58,560
 and opportunity intersect, I was surely to fall

916
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,720
 and I was not gonna put any confidence in my flesh.

917
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,040
 So I said, no more.

918
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:05,320
 Where there's an opportunity, I'm cutting it off.

919
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:06,620
 I didn't have that desire.

920
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:09,240
 Memorizing scripture,

921
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:13,480
 connecting with other believers in community,

922
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:15,120
 guys that didn't look like me,

923
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:20,240
 dress like me, have the same hobbies that I had,

924
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:22,760
 like the same music I listened to,

925
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:24,560
 but you know what they had?

926
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:27,940
 The commonality of Christ and I needed them.

927
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:30,760
 And they held me accountable

928
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:32,920
 and they asked me the hard questions.

929
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:35,000
 I didn't have any desire for this

930
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,560
 apart from the spirit of God

931
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:43,440
 that sealed me at the moment of my salvation

932
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:47,040
 and began to change my desires and renew my mind.

933
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:51,380
 And we do these things, why?

934
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:54,500
 So we passionately pursue Christ.

935
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:58,120
 The prize is Christ.

936
00:46:58,120 --> 00:47:00,160
 The prize we strive for is Jesus.

937
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:03,000
 And so the one thing I want you and I to do

938
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,160
 when we walk out of those doors,

939
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,120
 we get in our car and we go home tonight.

940
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:07,240
 This is the one thing.

941
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:08,280
 You ready for this?

942
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:13,060
 Press on toward the prize, which is Christ Jesus.

943
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:14,680
 How do we do this?

944
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:16,420
 Forget what lies behind.

945
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:19,480
 Address your stuff.

946
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:20,960
 It's not what I'm saying, right?

947
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:23,380
 Address it, go to counseling, get community,

948
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:25,600
 whatever you gotta do, but don't live in it.

949
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:26,760
 Don't dwell in it.

950
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:27,600
 Forget about it.

951
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,260
 Let God heal you.

952
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:30,900
 And this is what we do.

953
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:33,480
 We strive forward to what lies ahead.

954
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:35,200
 He's not done with you.

955
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,560
 Do you know that?

956
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:42,520
 He's gonna use your mess and make it a message.

957
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:45,900
 And that message is gonna go out to the whole world

958
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:46,740
 if you let him.

959
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:53,080
 And this is what he does.

960
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:56,020
 He takes the prisons that you used to sit in

961
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:58,460
 and he gives you a key called the gospel

962
00:47:58,460 --> 00:47:59,700
 and your testimony.

963
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:01,680
 And you begin to share that with other people

964
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:03,900
 who are sitting in the same prisons that you used to sit in.

965
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:06,660
 And when you share it, it unlocks the prisons

966
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:09,220
 that people are sitting in, in your office places,

967
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:12,640
 in your neighborhoods, in your apartment complexes,

968
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:15,640
 at restaurants, and God begins to use you

969
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:17,960
 in a way that you've never been used before.

970
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:21,320
 What else do you wanna give your life to?

971
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:26,920
 Let me pray that you would tonight.

972
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:38,440
 God in heaven, would you help us see

973
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:40,700
 the overwhelming truth of the gospel tonight?

974
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:45,760
 Would we see that compared to the infinitely perfect

975
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:50,080
 holiness of God, our righteousness is absolutely garbage.

976
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:54,300
 Would we see that Jesus laid aside anything

977
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:58,280
 that he could have hung his hat on because he loved us?

978
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:03,460
 Would we believe that Philippians 2, 7 and 8

979
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:05,160
 says that Jesus emptied himself,

980
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:06,860
 taking the very form of a servant

981
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:09,040
 and he humbled himself by becoming obedient

982
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:11,440
 to the point of death, even death on the cross.

983
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:17,660
 And Christ has counted all as loss

984
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:19,240
 to make us right with him.

985
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:21,820
 Would we believe that God,

986
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:24,300
 not just intellectually, but from the heart?

987
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:28,440
 Would we believe that Jesus isn't asking us

988
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:30,720
 to do something that he hasn't done himself?

989
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,060
 He's emptied himself.

990
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:34,280
 He gave up his entire life

991
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:37,480
 so that we may become one with him.

992
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:40,960
 So would we count everything as loss

993
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:43,780
 compared to the infinite value of knowing Christ Jesus,

994
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:48,000
 our Lord, and would you help the porch

995
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:53,360
 and all the other locations that are meeting right now

996
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:55,940
 along the nation, around the nation, I should say,

997
00:49:55,940 --> 00:50:02,120
 to keep pressing on, to pursue the prize, which is Christ,

998
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:04,640
 forgetting what lies behind

999
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:07,720
 and striving toward to what lies ahead.

1000
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:10,000
 For your glory, our joy, and the world's good.

1001
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,800
 It's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
