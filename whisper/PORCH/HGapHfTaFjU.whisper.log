[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:25.440]   - Alright, welcome friends in the room,
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.040]   friends of Fort Worth, Houston.
[00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.180]   Get excited.
[00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.580]   Paso Phoenix, Nashville,
[00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.240]   Menhill, North Carolina,
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.480]   Southampton, Philadelphia,
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.760]   wherever you are joining us from,
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.260]   Fayetteville, and friends here tonight.
[00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.680]   Who's familiar with the term love language?
[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.400]   Okay, alright.
[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.320]   By show of hands, who in this room would say
[00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.320]   they are an acts of service love language person?
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.640]   Okay, a few.
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.040]   What about quality time?
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.760]   There you go.
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.520]   Touch?
[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.480]   (audience cheering)
[00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.760]   What about all my gifts, people?
[00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:03.980]   Words of affirmation?
[00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.420]   Okay.
[00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.600]   If you're not familiar with any of those,
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.280]   basically some guy came out with a book,
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.000]   made a killing convincing the world
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.680]   that everyone has one of these five love languages.
[00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:15.600]   I don't know if that's biblical,
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.840]   but it's somewhat helpful.
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.080]   And let me tell you about my love language.
[00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.420]   So me and my wife have different love languages.
[00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.720]   The theory of the book is everyone has
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:23.680]   at least one love language.
[00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.060]   Sometimes you have a couple of them,
[00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.320]   but typically people have a predominant one,
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.120]   maybe two predominant ones.
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.660]   My love languages would be acts of service
[00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:33.960]   and physical touch.
[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.640]   Acts of service, physical touch.
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.280]   Serve me, touch me.
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.120]   Serve me again.
[00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.520]   That's all I want, man.
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.660]   My wife's love language would be quality time
[00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.360]   and words of affirmation.
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.040]   So quality time, she doesn't care
[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.280]   if I'm out mowing the lawn.
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.960]   She doesn't care if I clean up the house,
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.320]   do any service.
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.600]   She's great to sit and filth just you and I,
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:57.640]   just sitting together.
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.480]   This is great.
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.320]   Not quantity time, quality time, the two of us.
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.960]   Or cards, notes, words of affirmation.
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.880]   This is the stuff that makes you feel loved.
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.280]   And I tell all that because there was a time not recently,
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.480]   or that was recent, where it was Mother's Day
[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.500]   this past year.
[00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.320]   I had a plan, got some gifts together,
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.280]   decided that I was gonna get my wife this necklace
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.120]   with our kids' names on it.
[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.680]   And then I got her a massage.
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:22.960]   I know, husband of the year.
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.480]   I had gotten her this card,
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.160]   and I just had the day planned out.
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.680]   We were gonna go to this brunch and breakfast,
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.160]   and we woke up that morning,
[00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.420]   and I gave her the kind of gifts that I had given.
[00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.060]   The card, I had had my son, who's three and a half,
[00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.000]   write and fill out.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.400]   It was kind of like, oh, this will be sweet,
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.520]   and I'll have him write the card.
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.680]   He can't write words, so he just writes with a crown,
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.000]   like some colors inside of there.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.520]   And I thought that was brilliant and genius,
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.280]   and husband of the year, no big deal.
[00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.720]   And I give her the whole gift package, give it to her,
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.320]   and she's like, this is great.
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.800]   And the breakfast kind of goes on,
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.640]   and we're at breakfast having brunch,
[00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.240]   and then we get home from that breakfast,
[00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.600]   and we're getting ready to put kids down for naps.
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.820]   And I look at her, and she's over by the kitchen sink,
[00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.920]   and she's emotional.
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.080]   I can tell that she's like, oh, man,
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.800]   she's upset about something right now.
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.360]   And I don't know if it's like, oh, man,
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.480]   look, I've just touched you so deeply
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.720]   with my thoughtfulness.
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.240]   And she's like, she says,
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.440]   "I feel like you don't know me at all.
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.760]   "You didn't write me a card?"
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.480]   And I'm like, and this moment I go,
[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:30.880]   well, I had him write in the card.
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.200]   That was the sweetest thing ever.
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.400]   And she was like, I know, but that's great,
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.000]   but you didn't get a card from you to me?
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.180]   And it was a realization that my attempted expressing love
[00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.400]   was now received in the way
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.160]   that I thought it was going to be received.
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.520]   Because our definitions of love and love languages
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.160]   and what love looks like are different.
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.000]   I've learned from that.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.820]   And now every single time, no matter what,
[00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.440]   if it's a Wednesday, here's a card
[00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.480]   that I've written for you.
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.800]   And it's not entirely true.
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:03.960]   It's not at all true, actually,
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:04.800]   so don't give me credit for that.
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.940]   But point being, I will not make that mistake again.
[00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.480]   And I start there because in our marriage,
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.400]   we have different definitions of what love looks like,
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.920]   what love is.
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.400]   Like I said, for me, it's acts of service
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.280]   and physical touch.
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.160]   For her, it's gonna be quality time
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:25.040]   or hearing things written out and words described to her.
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.200]   And our definitions are different.
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.040]   What does that have to do
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.520]   with what we're talking about tonight?
[00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.160]   Well, we're continuing the series, Instagram theology.
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.100]   What's Instagram theology?
[00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.940]   We are looking at some of the more popular
[00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.080]   cultural mantras that people throw out there
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.080]   and people say on Instagram or just kind of in life
[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.520]   that there's a lot of culture behind it,
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.200]   but they're half truths at best.
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.920]   And tonight, just like my wife and I
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.300]   had different definitions of what love looks like
[00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.960]   and what love is, there's an Instagram mantra
[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.520]   called love is love.
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:56.800]   Whereas culture, we basically say like,
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.720]   hey, look, we may agree to disagree
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.400]   and have different definitions of what love looks like,
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.480]   of what love is, of when love is appropriate,
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.680]   but let's just agree, like love is a great thing,
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.240]   and so let's kind of keep it at that.
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.240]   Like our culture has embraced
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.700]   that there are different definitions of love,
[00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:17.520]   but as long as it's love, that is what matters most.
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.180]   People will use the phrase love is love,
[00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:20.080]   which is what we're gonna talk about
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.260]   for the next 30 minutes or so,
[00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.420]   to encourage different relationships
[00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:25.540]   that you may have heard of.
[00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:27.200]   People will, underneath the banner of love,
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.360]   it basically, if you haven't heard that term,
[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.160]   it basically is kind of like, you know, love is blind,
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.000]   it knows no religion, it knows no sex or gender.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.360]   It is what most important is that there is love there.
[00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.920]   Don't be confined by anything else.
[00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.240]   It's the most powerful force in the universe.
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.160]   And so we may disagree on what love is supposed to look like,
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.240]   but as long as love is there, that is a beautiful thing.
[00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.140]   And there's something true about that,
[00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:53.720]   but there's also something really wrong about that.
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.520]   And as we've said throughout this series,
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.040]   any time that, you know, culture begins to step
[00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.440]   in the direction of things that God said,
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.700]   this is something you don't define, I define,
[00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:04.660]   it comes with tremendous consequences
[00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:08.120]   when we abandon God's definitions.
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.680]   In other words, when you begin to talk about, like,
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.680]   different definitions of this is what love looks like,
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:15.260]   or this is love, the Bible says that God, who is love,
[00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:18.480]   defines it, and he gives a definition
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:19.720]   of what love is to look like.
[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.400]   So we're gonna look for the next handful of minutes
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.000]   of what is wrong with some of the more popular ideas
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.080]   as it relates to love is love.
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.120]   People will marry someone of a different faith
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:33.480]   underneath the idea, or in the name of, hey, love is love.
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:37.600]   People will push for marrying someone of the same sex
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.040]   underneath the idea that, you know, love is love,
[00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.640]   and, you know, love, how could love ever be a bad thing?
[00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:46.080]   So we're gonna talk about how could love be a destructive
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.400]   and bad thing.
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:48.780]   The truth about love is love,
[00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:50.100]   or one of the things that's true,
[00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:52.540]   is love is incredibly powerful.
[00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:58.140]   Love is incredibly powerful, and you can fall in love
[00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:02.020]   with someone that God would say is not who he calls you
[00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:03.180]   to marry.
[00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:05.020]   You can fall in love with someone regardless of their age,
[00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:07.620]   regardless of their gender, regardless of their religion,
[00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:09.260]   that love is an incredibly powerful thing.
[00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.920]   I went to a John Mayer concert last week.
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:15.860]   John Mayer would not be selling out American Airlines Center
[00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:18.120]   if love did not exist, or particularly if women
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:21.520]   did not exist, because I'm sitting there literally
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:22.900]   in the room, and I know I'm gonna get pushback
[00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:25.540]   from the guys who are like, I love John.
[00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:28.240]   If women didn't exist, John would not be selling out
[00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:29.080]   American Airlines Center.
[00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:31.480]   He would be working at Guitar Center.
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:33.700]   He's clearly a very talented guy, but there's not guys
[00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:35.480]   who are like, yeah, I'm gonna pay $200 to sit there
[00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:37.920]   and play Gravity, please, I love that one.
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:39.360]   And love is a powerful thing.
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:40.840]   It leads people to make decisions, spend money,
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:42.800]   spend their time, their attention, their focus.
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.320]   I mean, it moves us.
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:47.560]   Love is incredibly powerful, but love in a direction
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:51.480]   that God says is not the direction of what love truly
[00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:54.960]   is supposed to look like can be an incredibly powerful thing
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:57.020]   that is also incredibly dangerous.
[00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:59.220]   So we're gonna look for the next handful of minutes
[00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:00.060]   at three ideas.
[00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:01.560]   What is wrong with love is love?
[00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:03.720]   And I'm gonna answer that.
[00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:06.120]   Why God, who's there, would have anything to say,
[00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:11.120]   or may not always be crazy about all forms of, quote, love,
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:13.400]   and then what does it look like to have love in your life
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:15.680]   that looks like the love of God or God's love?
[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:16.520]   What does that look like?
[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:19.440]   So the first one, what could possibly be wrong
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:20.280]   with love is love?
[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:21.440]   Here's the first idea.
[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:25.620]   When love is love, love becomes a God.
[00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:27.440]   Like when love is love, and using that phrase,
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.260]   whenever it's like, hey, you know what, love is love,
[00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.480]   as a justification that, hey, you can't really explain it,
[00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:32.760]   and you know I was caught up in the moment,
[00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:34.760]   and it's a sweeping force, and you can't control
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:37.320]   who you're in love with, and we just fell into love together
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:40.640]   and it's used for a Christian, and I'm talking
[00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:43.520]   just to Christians primarily in this message.
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:45.440]   When it becomes something that a Christian uses
[00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:48.880]   to justify living or relationships
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:52.840]   that contradict God's word, you are no longer underneath
[00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:56.840]   the control of the Holy Spirit, control of yourself.
[00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:58.600]   You're basically saying like, hey, I couldn't help it.
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:01.720]   I was swept up in love, and love is no longer some,
[00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:03.100]   you know, thing that is just a part
[00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:04.320]   of a romantic relationship.
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:05.720]   Love becomes your God.
[00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:07.480]   Love becomes the thing that controls you.
[00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:09.920]   You're helpless, you're at its will, you're at its mercy.
[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:13.040]   And anytime that a Christian justifies relationships
[00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:16.480]   that contradict God's word, whether it would be
[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:18.760]   with someone of an opposite faith,
[00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:21.260]   or someone, not an opposite faith, of a different faith,
[00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.860]   or someone of the same sex, it communicates that,
[00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:26.140]   hey, love is God.
[00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:28.680]   At the end of the day, I'm not responsible
[00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:32.220]   for who I fall in love with, and love would lead me
[00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:35.040]   to do this, and that, the tragic thing,
[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:38.320]   is that it begins to make love become God.
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:40.160]   What do I mean?
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.360]   Because God is love, and we'll talk about that in a second,
[00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:44.720]   but I mean, by love becoming your God,
[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:48.860]   it's like, it presents the idea as though,
[00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:50.520]   man, I had to, or I have to,
[00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:53.120]   because the heart wants what it wants.
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:58.100]   And I was moved by the love God, if you will.
[00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:00.320]   And when that happens, it can be
[00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.580]   an incredibly dangerous thing.
[00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:03.040]   It's happening all over our culture right now,
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:05.240]   where people under the banner of love is love
[00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:08.680]   are buying that lie, and it's making love a God.
[00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:10.280]   What do I mean?
[00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:11.560]   I don't know if you guys remember Woody Allen.
[00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:14.880]   Woody Allen is a very famous movie director.
[00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:17.400]   Woody Allen had, you know, Midnight in Paris
[00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:19.880]   has been tons of films, very successful movie director.
[00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:23.640]   He married someone named Mia Farrow back in the 1980s,
[00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:26.040]   and Mia was just another kind of celebrity person
[00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:27.560]   on the scene, and they had a family together.
[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:29.200]   Here's the family of them together.
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:31.280]   If you know Woody Allen, that's Mia in the middle.
[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:32.120]   Here's some of their kids.
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:33.840]   I think this is like their second or third marriage,
[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:36.400]   but that baby boy is actually the two of them.
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:37.800]   And this is her adopted daughter,
[00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:40.440]   and her kids over here, and they married.
[00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:42.800]   Five years after they had their little baby boy,
[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:47.960]   he began a relationship, Woody Allen,
[00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:50.600]   with the girl that's on the right there.
[00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:51.880]   And he began to have a sexual relationship,
[00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:54.760]   and today he's married to the woman
[00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:56.460]   who was formerly his stepdaughter.
[00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:59.600]   And you know what he said whenever he was interviewed,
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:00.840]   'cause people, as you would imagine,
[00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:04.640]   like, "Oh, awkward, that's a little creepy."
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:05.880]   He did an interview with Time Magazine,
[00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:07.340]   and at the end of the interview, he basically was like,
[00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:08.560]   "Look, it's not that big of a deal."
[00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:10.580]   And here was the famous line, you probably heard it,
[00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:13.440]   'cause it's been picked up by others.
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:15.940]   "The heart wants what it wants.
[00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:17.460]   "There's no logic to those things.
[00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:21.760]   "You meet someone, and you fall in love, and that's that."
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:23.140]   He's basically saying, "Hey, love is love,
[00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:26.100]   "and in his scenario, love is his God.
[00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:29.080]   "I can't be responsible for who I fall in love with."
[00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:30.820]   Other scenarios that are even more extreme,
[00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:33.360]   because that one, there may be some part of you
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:35.700]   that's like, "Oh, you know, it wasn't his biological,
[00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:36.880]   "is that that big of a deal?"
[00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:38.980]   But we would all have a line where we would say,
[00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:41.820]   "Hey, love is love, it's not okay
[00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:44.840]   "if love leads you to do this."
[00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:47.160]   Underneath that definition, I think most of us
[00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:48.360]   would have some line where we draw,
[00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:50.080]   where we're like, "No, love is not love there,
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:52.360]   "that's creepy," or illegal.
[00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:55.620]   An example that I mean by that is,
[00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:57.800]   you guys heard of NAMBLA?
[00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:59.020]   There's an association called NAMBLA,
[00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:03.180]   which stands for National Association of Man-Boy Love.
[00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:06.240]   It's a group that basically says they were born
[00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:08.580]   with urges to love children,
[00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:12.580]   and they push for and try to legislate
[00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:16.500]   to get Congress to remove the requirements,
[00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:18.680]   you have to be of a certain age in order to have love.
[00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:20.460]   In other words, if it's consensual with a young child,
[00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:22.720]   if there's boys out there that want to engage in that,
[00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:23.900]   then we should be able to do that.
[00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:25.840]   And my point in bringing that up
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:28.040]   is not because I think that's a tremendously common thing
[00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:30.900]   in the room, but it's at least a point where we'd all go,
[00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:33.200]   "Hey, love is love in that scenario is not okay.
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:34.640]   "I don't care who's consenting,
[00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:36.240]   "that's over the line, that's not okay.
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:37.160]   "If you make love your God
[00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:40.720]   "and that's where your God leaves, not okay."
[00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:43.300]   But as a society, this increasingly
[00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:46.780]   is something that we see, and it's become almost comical.
[00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:48.520]   I don't know if you saw this dude in Argentina
[00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:50.760]   who recently decided he was gonna marry a tree
[00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:53.000]   underneath the banner of love is love.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.160]   That happened.
[00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:58.700]   I'm not even sure what to even address at that point.
[00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:00.600]   A woman recently, I think it was a couple weeks ago,
[00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:04.300]   who decided in the UK to marry her dog
[00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:06.600]   after four broken engagements.
[00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:10.680]   This is her, they actually went through with it.
[00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:11.940]   And all of those, I mean, they're just like,
[00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:13.640]   "Dude, that's nuts, that's so extreme.
[00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:17.800]   "The line is so far out there, but this is a result."
[00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:20.600]   Or is a line of thinking that is consistent
[00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:22.100]   with the idea that, "Man, hey, love is love.
[00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:24.540]   "I'm not responsible, and love's gonna lead me where it may."
[00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:26.240]   And it reflects the idea that love is God.
[00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:27.900]   Now, here's where it becomes relevant to the room.
[00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:30.100]   All of us do this at some level,
[00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:31.560]   or many of us still do this.
[00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:35.060]   Like, you don't put the line at dog or at tree
[00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:37.220]   as being kind of the line that, you know,
[00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:39.300]   you can't go farther than that.
[00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:41.520]   But any time that we put the line where God doesn't put it,
[00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:44.220]   we're putting it, and we're saying, "Man, love is love,
[00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:47.340]   "and because we love each other, it's okay."
[00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:51.240]   If you're dating someone who's not a believer in Jesus,
[00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:53.100]   they're of a different faith,
[00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:55.460]   you are moving the line just like somebody saying,
[00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:57.280]   "You know what, it's okay as long as I move the line
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:02.020]   "over to a dog," because it doesn't align with God's word.
[00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:03.020]   If you're doing it and you're like,
[00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:04.420]   "Man, he just calls himself a Christian,"
[00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:06.280]   and you're dating someone, and under the name
[00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:07.780]   of love is love, and we love each other,
[00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:09.260]   and I'm working with him, and maybe he's gonna
[00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.060]   get it together, you're doing the same thing.
[00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:12.700]   You're moving the line where God doesn't say
[00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:13.660]   you should move it.
[00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:17.240]   If you're dating someone and you're introducing sex
[00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:19.900]   into the relationship, or you're living together,
[00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:21.660]   and you're like, "It's okay, we're married in God's eyes.
[00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:23.500]   "You know, love is love," you're doing the same thing
[00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:26.900]   where you're taking your filter and using love
[00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:31.240]   and blaming on love the actions that you have.
[00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:33.140]   You're basically going, "Love is my God.
[00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:36.060]   "I have to do this," even if God says not to.
[00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:39.580]   Jesus said the line is not where you put it,
[00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:41.900]   where they put it, but he clearly articulates
[00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:46.180]   here's the type of love that God loves to see
[00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:49.420]   and the context for human love to take place
[00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:50.340]   in a romantic way.
[00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:51.700]   He says this in Matthew chapter 19.
[00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:53.780]   When God was on the planet, he stood up
[00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:54.980]   and he was asked about marriage,
[00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:56.540]   and here's what he said marriage is.
[00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:59.040]   Matthew 19, verse five and six.
[00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:03.460]   For this reason, a man will leave his father and his mother
[00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:07.900]   and be united to his wife, and the two
[00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:10.180]   will become one flesh.
[00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:12.780]   So they are no longer two, but one.
[00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:16.620]   Therefore, what God has joined together,
[00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:18.620]   let no one separate.
[00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:21.520]   Jesus' definition of the context for which love
[00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:24.340]   should take place, the type of love that God loves,
[00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:26.380]   is between one man and one woman
[00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:30.100]   in the context of marriage for life.
[00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:32.160]   The apostle Paul would go on to add
[00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:33.780]   that it would be one man, one woman
[00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:36.760]   who are both believers following Jesus.
[00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:40.760]   The direction of their life is following Jesus.
[00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:43.120]   One man, one woman for life.
[00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:44.820]   That's really what God says is to be the love
[00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:45.920]   that marks his people.
[00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:51.540]   Why would God not love all forms of love?
[00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:54.460]   Like what's the big deal to have love
[00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:59.180]   outside of a relationship between one man
[00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:00.580]   and one woman in marriage for life?
[00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:01.440]   Like what is the big deal?
[00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:04.340]   How could anyone be opposed to like these beautiful
[00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:06.220]   same-sex couples who are together,
[00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:08.020]   or couples even if they're of different faiths,
[00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:09.160]   they've learned to work it out
[00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:10.980]   and it's kind of a beautiful thing together.
[00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:13.980]   How could God be opposed to that?
[00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:14.980]   It's so beautiful.
[00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:20.020]   The reason is is because God loves you
[00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:21.320]   more than he loves love.
[00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:26.100]   The reason is that God loves you more than he loves
[00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:28.760]   any earthly definition of love.
[00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:32.180]   And he loves you so much that anything
[00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:34.200]   that's gonna hurt you, or anything that's gonna hurt me,
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:36.100]   or anything that hurts people,
[00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:38.100]   by definition he cannot love.
[00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:42.060]   And so as it relates to relationships
[00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:44.060]   that contradict God's design
[00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:48.740]   and how he created marriage and love to take place,
[00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:49.980]   of course he's not going to.
[00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:52.240]   Because he knows that hey, if you reject God's design,
[00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:54.740]   it comes with consequences inside of your life.
[00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:56.140]   The two most common ways,
[00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:58.780]   or two most common types really of love
[00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:01.100]   that are relevant and applicable to this room,
[00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:05.380]   that God doesn't love because he loves you,
[00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:10.020]   is relationships, dating relationships,
[00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:13.500]   and married relationships between a believing Christian
[00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:15.180]   and a non-believer.
[00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:17.980]   A believing Christian and someone who's Hindu,
[00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:19.780]   a believing Christian and someone who's Muslim,
[00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:22.820]   a believing Christian and someone who's Jewish,
[00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:25.020]   or not, or atheist.
[00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:27.540]   Between a believing Christian and someone who is not
[00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:32.100]   is a relationship that the Bible teaches
[00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:34.340]   you are to get out now if you're in.
[00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:36.060]   In 2 Corinthians chapter six, verse 14,
[00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:38.180]   the apostle Paul writes exactly about this.
[00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:40.500]   And speaking to marriage here,
[00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:44.860]   do not be yoked together, which is an agricultural term
[00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:46.760]   for basically oxen would be yoked together,
[00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:49.620]   they'd put two by one another and they'd throw a yoke on,
[00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:51.820]   and you are unequally yoked if the oxen moved
[00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:53.860]   in different directions or not in the same direction.
[00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:55.340]   And Paul says hey, just like that,
[00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:56.500]   when it comes to your life,
[00:17:56.500 --> 00:18:00.100]   you should be connected and partnered in marriage
[00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:01.880]   with people who are moving in the same direction.
[00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:03.380]   With unbelievers, don't do it.
[00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:06.340]   For what does righteousness and wickedness have in common?
[00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:08.740]   Or what fellowship can light have with darkness?
[00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:12.120]   The Bible teaches that you are to be in relationship,
[00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:13.500]   not with someone who claims to be a Christian
[00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:16.600]   or even uses that title, but someone who's following Jesus.
[00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:18.980]   Why would it be a bad idea?
[00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:20.220]   Like why is God not cool with that?
[00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:23.140]   Like maybe you as their friend or you're dating them,
[00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:24.700]   you could be a part of bringing them to God,
[00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:27.460]   why would he not be on board with that?
[00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:28.380]   A couple reasons.
[00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:31.700]   Because it hurts you.
[00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:33.100]   It hurts your faith.
[00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:34.700]   If you marry someone who's not of your same
[00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:38.380]   religious background or doesn't have your faith in Christ,
[00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:39.700]   here's what you're guaranteeing yourself.
[00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:40.980]   One of two options.
[00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:43.720]   You will either cap your relationship with Christ
[00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:45.820]   or cap your relationship with that person.
[00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:47.800]   You're either gonna cap your relationship,
[00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:49.080]   but in other words, like if you marry someone
[00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:49.960]   and they're not a Christian,
[00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:50.800]   you're either gonna be like,
[00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:52.360]   hey, you know, we don't have to go to church.
[00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:53.520]   It's not that big of a deal to me.
[00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:54.800]   It's not really that important.
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:56.960]   I care about you and so let's do whatever you wanna do.
[00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:58.800]   And you're gonna cap your relationship with Jesus,
[00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:01.320]   the person you say is most important in my life,
[00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:03.520]   which is what a follower of Christ does.
[00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:05.760]   Or you're gonna cap your relationship with that person
[00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:06.600]   'cause you're gonna go all in
[00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:08.000]   and you're still trying to follow Jesus
[00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:12.140]   and they won't necessarily always be on board with that.
[00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:13.380]   And so you're spending your time different,
[00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:14.460]   your values are different.
[00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:15.860]   You're either gonna cap your intimacy
[00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:17.780]   with your spouse or with Jesus,
[00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:20.500]   which inevitably is gonna hurt you
[00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:23.340]   and hurt your faith and your marriage.
[00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:25.700]   Second ways that it hurts you
[00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:28.180]   is marrying someone who is of a different faith.
[00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:30.580]   And if you're not here, all of us may have siblings
[00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:32.740]   or friends and people in our lives
[00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:35.060]   that are entering into relationships
[00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:37.100]   with someone who's not a follower of Christ.
[00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:39.740]   45% of marriages in the last 10 years
[00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:42.160]   were between people of two faiths in America,
[00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:45.480]   two different faiths, 45%, almost one and two.
[00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:51.840]   In doing so, studies show you triple your
[00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:55.380]   chances of getting a divorce.
[00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:57.520]   In other words, whatever it is right now,
[00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:58.920]   and it's already pretty high,
[00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:00.680]   you are tripling the likelihood
[00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:02.280]   that you're gonna get a divorce.
[00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:08.300]   Upwards of 75% of non-same faith relationships,
[00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:10.020]   marriages, end in divorce.
[00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:13.500]   You're almost guaranteeing that the children
[00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:15.540]   that you raise are gonna walk away from the church.
[00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:16.980]   When there's one believing spouse
[00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:18.780]   or one practicing faithful person,
[00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:22.420]   studies have shown that there is a 2% chance,
[00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:25.340]   a 2% chance that your children are gonna walk up
[00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:29.780]   and be practicing believers in that faith of the mother
[00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:31.460]   if she's a practicing believer and the father's not.
[00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:33.520]   2% chance, you are statistically guaranteeing
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:35.360]   98% chance your children will not,
[00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:37.960]   if they grow up in that home, have a faith in Jesus.
[00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:41.920]   And finally, you're hurting the person you're dating.
[00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:44.620]   You're showing them a weakened expression of Christianity,
[00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:45.540]   like hey, it's important,
[00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:47.640]   but it's not as important with you as you.
[00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:51.360]   And you're showing them some weakened version
[00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:52.800]   that's like yeah, I mean, it's not that big of a deal.
[00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:54.940]   I can kind of live however I want,
[00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:56.760]   and you should try it out sometime.
[00:20:56.760 --> 00:21:01.280]   Let me be emphatically clear.
[00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:04.320]   If you are dating someone who is not a Christian,
[00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:06.420]   and if you date a non-believer,
[00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:09.260]   you are in direct rebellion to God.
[00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:13.540]   And if you say, but I love him, clearly,
[00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:15.700]   and you love him more than you love God,
[00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:19.460]   because God's word has made it clear.
[00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:21.340]   I don't care how you met, how much chemistry you have,
[00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:23.060]   how much electricity, when you touch each other,
[00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:24.400]   and you like all the same jokes,
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:25.340]   and we love watching movies.
[00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:27.580]   If they don't share your faith,
[00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:29.860]   you need to hit the ejection button now.
[00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:32.960]   And the God who's there is not angry,
[00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:35.480]   and he's not trying to just move you
[00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:37.400]   out of having relationships.
[00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:40.140]   He's trying to move you away from the direction
[00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:44.840]   of pain and hurt and a future that's in store.
[00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:51.200]   The second type of relationship that I think
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:54.920]   often we wonder, like how could God be against that,
[00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:59.020]   is the same-sex relationships.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.040]   I mean, when we go in life, and we bump into friends,
[00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:04.600]   and all of us have friends, and we know people
[00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:08.520]   who are siblings or family members or roommates,
[00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:12.240]   and we come to church on Tuesday, and they're like,
[00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:14.620]   hey, God is not for same-sex relationships,
[00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:15.880]   it's only heterosexual, and then you go,
[00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:17.200]   and you're around these people, and they're like,
[00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:19.280]   man, I just, from as long as I can remember,
[00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:21.580]   I've only been attracted to women, and I'm a woman,
[00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:23.600]   or I've only been attracted to men, and I'm a man.
[00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:28.480]   How could God want something different for them?
[00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:30.880]   Why would God want something different for them?
[00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:35.440]   And what I'm about to share, I wanna share just
[00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:38.160]   to paint a little bit of a picture to align why
[00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:41.160]   the heart of God, which is always for people
[00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:44.880]   and always loves people, why would he not love a love?
[00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:49.200]   And the answer would be because it is hurtful
[00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:54.200]   to that person, and ultimately unloving in the long term,
[00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:56.960]   and I know it doesn't always feel that way.
[00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:58.520]   And so what do I mean by that?
[00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:04.400]   The Bible says in 1 Corinthians 6, 1 Timothy 1,
[00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:07.640]   Romans chapter one, and in other places,
[00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:11.860]   that same-sex relationships are not God's design,
[00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:14.480]   and the reason he's not for them is because it is
[00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:16.480]   a rejection of God's design.
[00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:20.400]   He designed one man, one woman, to come together
[00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:23.160]   in a specific way, and in the context of marriage.
[00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:28.900]   And any time that you and I reject the creator's design,
[00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:31.240]   there's consequences that follow.
[00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:32.740]   Anytime that I don't follow the instructions
[00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:36.480]   of the creator, there's a great chance the consequences
[00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:38.660]   are gonna come as a byproduct of that.
[00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:40.320]   I mean, we see this in life all the time.
[00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:43.180]   I mean, I, because I'm an acts of service person,
[00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:45.540]   will do the laundry in our house, I'll go up to my closet,
[00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:49.340]   share with my wife, get the dirty clothes all together,
[00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:50.860]   the clothes that are on the floor, stuff 'em
[00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:54.060]   in the laundry hamper, bring 'em downstairs,
[00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:56.420]   throw 'em in the washing machine, husband of the year again,
[00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:57.420]   doing all the laundry.
[00:23:57.420 --> 00:24:00.020]   The number of times this next thing has happened
[00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:02.020]   is astounding to me.
[00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:03.380]   We need to get this fixed.
[00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:04.700]   My wife will go into the laundry room,
[00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:06.040]   she'll begin to pull some of the clothes out
[00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:08.140]   that I've washed, and she'll go,
[00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:10.460]   "Did you wash this dress?
[00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:15.980]   "It's cashmere, are you serious?"
[00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:20.200]   And I'm like, "Why was it on the floor then, lady?
[00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:21.860]   "Give me a break."
[00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:25.220]   Hopefully I don't say that, but point being,
[00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:28.600]   I failed, she's like, "Didn't you read the instructions?
[00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:32.420]   "Whoever reads the instructions on clothes?"
[00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:33.380]   I'm not going to like read each one,
[00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:35.180]   okay, this one's good, okay, this one's good.
[00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:37.000]   Oh, put this one over here, okay.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.540]   Who reads the instructions?
[00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:43.200]   I don't, wise people, she said.
[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:44.620]   (laughing)
[00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:46.500]   People who would save so much money
[00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:48.700]   on ruining their wife's dresses,
[00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:51.060]   and it's like, we're just going to have to put this
[00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:53.380]   on a doll or something, 'cause it doesn't fit.
[00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:56.360]   But in failing to read the instructions,
[00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:58.780]   or to follow the instructions of the designer,
[00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:02.480]   it creates consequences.
[00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:04.360]   And in the same way, that's really the picture
[00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:06.040]   the Bible paints, is really, God created the world,
[00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:08.800]   he created you, he created life to be found in a certain way
[00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:11.200]   and when we reject the creator's design,
[00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:13.160]   there's consequences that come with it.
[00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:16.080]   And if the Bible is true, and if God is who he says he is,
[00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:19.280]   and if he created a design as it relates to sexuality
[00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:21.380]   and relationships in a specific way,
[00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:23.140]   anytime we reject his design there,
[00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:24.420]   it comes with consequences.
[00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:26.020]   What do I mean by consequences?
[00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:30.900]   Living in a same-sex relationship and lifestyle
[00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:33.920]   has impacts mental health-wise,
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:37.240]   in terms of life expectancy, and in terms of disease.
[00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:38.820]   The homosexual lifestyle has been associated
[00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:40.780]   with a 50% more likelihood of suffering
[00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:43.360]   from depression and substance abuse.
[00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:47.580]   200% more likely to commit suicide,
[00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:50.060]   according to a medical journal of BMC Psychiatry,
[00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:51.980]   the first was from a recent study in the UK
[00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:53.320]   from health24.com.
[00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:56.860]   A lot of people say 200% more times to commit suicide,
[00:25:56.860 --> 00:26:00.100]   that's just 'cause society is not accepting and is too mean.
[00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:02.220]   That would make sense,
[00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:05.660]   except for in the most tolerant,
[00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:08.180]   embracing societies and countries,
[00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:10.660]   the statistic is even higher.
[00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:14.540]   In European nations, where countries
[00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:17.920]   have hardly any religious practice present,
[00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:20.580]   and homosexual marriage is both encouraged and celebrated,
[00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:23.740]   there is a significant increase in suicide.
[00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:26.860]   Sweden, for one example,
[00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:31.440]   Sweden legalized same-sex relationships in 1944.
[00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:34.780]   The United States did in 2015.
[00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:40.700]   They made speaking against sexual orientation
[00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:43.220]   a crime as hate speech in 2003.
[00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:47.560]   It was recognized by the International Lesbian Gay Association
[00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:52.300]   to be the most gay-friendly country in Europe or the world.
[00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:55.820]   There, it's not a 200% increase in risk of suicide,
[00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:59.040]   it is a 300% increased risk of suicide.
[00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:01.460]   The decrease in life expectancy,
[00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:03.820]   the Eastern Psychological Association found
[00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:06.040]   that on average, regardless of the country,
[00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:10.800]   or regardless of the European and Western countries,
[00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:13.560]   the decrease in life expectancy is 20 plus years,
[00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:17.420]   both in gay relationships and lesbian relationships.
[00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:20.560]   The increased likelihood of disease,
[00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:25.440]   the United States Center for Disease Control in 2013
[00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:29.720]   found that while only 3% of the population
[00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:32.320]   identifies as homosexual,
[00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:35.440]   it's responsible for 50% of the cases of syphilis,
[00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:38.960]   60% of gonorrhea, 75% of all HIV cases
[00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:42.260]   in the past five years in America.
[00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:45.380]   Why is disease so rampant?
[00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:49.720]   Monogamy is an extreme minority.
[00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:52.960]   Studies have shown, and there was a study done
[00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:54.400]   in the Journal of Sex Research
[00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:57.800]   by a gay male couple, David and Andrew Madison,
[00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:00.800]   they did a study with 2,500 couples,
[00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:03.720]   and they studied for years these relationships.
[00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:05.840]   They found that not a single one of them in their study
[00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:09.220]   was able to maintain a monogamous relationship.
[00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:12.360]   On the average number of partners,
[00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:13.880]   they found the modal range for partners
[00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:16.860]   throughout their lifetime was between 100 and 500.
[00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:20.080]   And those relationships, it was not,
[00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:23.120]   in other words, 100 to 500 people they were sleeping with.
[00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:25.420]   That is not about love, that is about sex.
[00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:28.920]   And the God who's there,
[00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:30.640]   and I know a lot of these things,
[00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:33.160]   again, it's deeply personal, like we know people.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:35.960]   And when you stand back and you go,
[00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:37.880]   like, look, hey, love is love, and who am I to say,
[00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:39.960]   and it's not really my place, and do whatever you want.
[00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:42.360]   And in fact, you need to embrace how I live
[00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:44.640]   and encourage it and celebrate it and champion it
[00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:46.800]   and be like, oh, I'm all on board about it.
[00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:50.040]   And as Christians, as we're gonna get to in a second,
[00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:53.200]   our first priority is not someone's sexuality, it's Jesus.
[00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:57.100]   But at the same time, we can't encourage and applaud
[00:28:57.100 --> 00:28:59.980]   something that contradicts God's word
[00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:04.280]   and leads to tremendous consequences in this life.
[00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:05.120]   I mean, think about it this way.
[00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:06.880]   If I told you, or if a friend came to you and said,
[00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:10.200]   hey, I'm gonna move to a city, and in that city,
[00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:12.840]   I'm making this decision, I'm gonna move here.
[00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:14.440]   And you knew that if they moved to that city,
[00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:17.320]   they had a higher likelihood of being depressed,
[00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:19.400]   significantly more likely to have suicidal,
[00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:24.200]   or be suicidal, more likely to have anxiety, to use drugs,
[00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:27.920]   a higher likelihood to end up with disease,
[00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:29.840]   and virtually, statistically guarantee
[00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:32.040]   you're gonna take 20 years off of your life.
[00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:37.400]   Would it be loving to sit there and go,
[00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:40.080]   man, who am I to say, you should go do that?
[00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:40.920]   That's awesome.
[00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:44.920]   And this is where it's hard sometimes being a Christian,
[00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:47.880]   'cause you're like, man, I wanna make sure you know Jesus.
[00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:51.960]   That's what Jesus wants, first and foremost.
[00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:53.600]   But I can't.
[00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:55.680]   If you're asking me to just sit back and celebrate it,
[00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:57.640]   that puts me in a really hard spot.
[00:29:57.640 --> 00:30:00.000]   That puts me being a friend, knowing that you're gonna move
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.120]   into a lifestyle that has significant consequences.
[00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:07.540]   Rejects God's word, takes 20 years off of your life,
[00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:09.540]   and I'm supposed to sit there because I feel bad
[00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:11.900]   telling you that's not great, and be like,
[00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:14.660]   yeah, man, love is love, this is awesome, love that.
[00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:18.340]   And it's tragic.
[00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:24.340]   God's not angry, he loves people,
[00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:26.700]   regardless of orientation.
[00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:29.000]   The Bible doesn't even talk about orientation.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:32.180]   Let me articulate this, too.
[00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:36.040]   There's a sharp difference between homosexual attraction
[00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:38.480]   and homosexual action.
[00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:43.120]   Homosexual attraction is, some studies say one in five,
[00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:44.760]   it's all over the room.
[00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:46.680]   But there's a difference, the Bible says,
[00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:49.360]   between being tempted towards thoughts of the same sex
[00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:51.440]   and engaging in homosexual behavior,
[00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:55.360]   and further, engaging in that behavior and say,
[00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:57.400]   everyone better support me doing this,
[00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:58.880]   and if not, they're a bigot.
[00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:04.180]   As a Christian, you go, man, I love people,
[00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:05.620]   and I don't wanna see them make decisions
[00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:07.220]   that are gonna hurt them.
[00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:10.780]   And so if I have to just speak truth,
[00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:12.140]   and when I can, I wanna do it humbly,
[00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:15.260]   and just say, I don't know that this,
[00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:16.660]   if you're claiming to be a Christian,
[00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:18.820]   I do know this is not what God has for you.
[00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:25.140]   But God loves people, and so anything that hurts people
[00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:28.180]   is a love that he doesn't love.
[00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:36.180]   Finally, how do we as the church love like God loves?
[00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:38.560]   And I'm gonna land here.
[00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:42.940]   If love is love, it's wrong, because it makes like,
[00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:45.680]   whatever I feel I have to do, love is your God.
[00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:48.920]   Why would God not love every type of love?
[00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:52.060]   Because any love that hurts people, God can't love.
[00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:53.620]   'Cause the Bible says in 1 John chapter four,
[00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:55.220]   that by nature, he is love.
[00:31:55.220 --> 00:32:00.760]   And so how, I've written in four Cs,
[00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:05.300]   how do we as Christians love like God loves?
[00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:06.380]   How do we love like God loves?
[00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:10.540]   First, is that when it comes to society, humanity,
[00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:13.400]   we communicate Christ first.
[00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:17.780]   The biggest list on God's agenda for everyone out there,
[00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:19.700]   whether they're messed up heterosexually,
[00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:22.500]   homosexually, polysexually,
[00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:24.780]   whatever their brokenness sexually is,
[00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:26.380]   and we all are broken sexually,
[00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:28.260]   the biggest agenda for every person on the planet,
[00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:30.020]   regardless of what they look like, where they live,
[00:32:30.020 --> 00:32:34.020]   how oriented they are sexually, is them knowing Jesus.
[00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:35.940]   And as a church, we do not focus on behavior,
[00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:37.100]   and you should stop this right here,
[00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:39.020]   and let me just tell you, you need to quit that right now,
[00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:39.980]   to non-Christians.
[00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:42.180]   We have no business telling non-Christians
[00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:43.380]   to change their behavior.
[00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:45.020]   It gives them the impression that God,
[00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:45.900]   if he's gonna accept them,
[00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:47.340]   they have to change how they behave.
[00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:49.000]   We point them to Jesus.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.220]   Christians who point to culture
[00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:53.220]   and people who are not believers in Christ
[00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:54.860]   and say, "Stop acting that way."
[00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:57.420]   It's like, dude, stay in your lane, bro.
[00:32:57.420 --> 00:32:58.780]   Stay in your lane.
[00:32:58.780 --> 00:33:00.680]   We talk to Christians.
[00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:03.100]   We share the gospel with non-believers.
[00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:05.180]   We share God's word with believers.
[00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:08.340]   We call one another to living by God's word.
[00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:09.540]   But when it comes to what we share,
[00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:11.340]   we don't focus on behavior with society.
[00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:12.420]   It's confusing.
[00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:17.940]   And it's not what the Bible says we are to focus on.
[00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:19.840]   We share the message of Christ.
[00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:23.300]   And then the Holy Spirit brings behavioral change.
[00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:26.560]   But you didn't change before you became a Christian.
[00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:28.020]   You believe.
[00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:30.900]   And we focus on people believing or trusting in Jesus,
[00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:31.900]   not behaving.
[00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:33.660]   It's like this.
[00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:35.040]   In my house, we have rules.
[00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:35.880]   I have a three-year-old son.
[00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:36.720]   I think we have a picture of him.
[00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:37.780]   This is Kru.
[00:33:37.780 --> 00:33:40.780]   And my son is, there he is.
[00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:41.900]   He's three and a half.
[00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:44.300]   He would make sure, like, I'm not three, three and a half.
[00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:46.620]   And we have different rules.
[00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:47.980]   What are some of the rules in the house?
[00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:49.220]   If you're gonna live here, son,
[00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:50.180]   you gotta follow these rules.
[00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:51.100]   Here's some of the rules.
[00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:52.720]   When someone gives you something, you say thank you.
[00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:54.740]   When you ask for something, you say please.
[00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:55.580]   You are courteous.
[00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:56.660]   You don't hit your sister.
[00:33:56.660 --> 00:33:57.580]   That's a big one.
[00:33:57.580 --> 00:33:59.740]   You make sure that you don't spit out your food.
[00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:00.580]   You listen.
[00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:01.420]   You don't yell.
[00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:02.660]   You're kind to people.
[00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:04.060]   These are some of the rules in our house.
[00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:06.640]   Some behaviors that as a part of this family,
[00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:08.320]   you are to have.
[00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:10.380]   A couple weeks ago, or I guess 10 days ago,
[00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:11.220]   we went to Atlanta.
[00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:12.560]   We were at a family deal in Atlanta,
[00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:14.180]   and we went to the aquarium in Atlanta.
[00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:16.260]   I don't know if you've been to the aquarium in Atlanta.
[00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:17.620]   It's a big deal, apparently.
[00:34:17.620 --> 00:34:20.180]   Number one aquarium in America, in case you're interested.
[00:34:20.180 --> 00:34:21.180]   Anyways, we're in town.
[00:34:21.180 --> 00:34:22.480]   You do what you do in Atlanta.
[00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:23.580]   You go to the aquarium.
[00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:24.420]   Go to the aquarium.
[00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:27.380]   We get there, got our kids there, my wife, two kids.
[00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:28.900]   And it is like a nut house.
[00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:30.220]   It was the most packed environment
[00:34:30.220 --> 00:34:32.160]   we'd ever been in with children to date.
[00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:34.540]   I mean, it was just like shoulder to shoulder.
[00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:36.220]   People love these fish in Atlanta.
[00:34:36.220 --> 00:34:37.060]   And so we're going in,
[00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:38.740]   we're seeing all the different things.
[00:34:38.740 --> 00:34:42.660]   And at one point, there's people everywhere.
[00:34:42.660 --> 00:34:44.220]   My son darts off.
[00:34:44.220 --> 00:34:47.140]   And we lost him.
[00:34:47.140 --> 00:34:49.180]   It's not funny.
[00:34:49.180 --> 00:34:50.020]   I don't know why I'm laughing.
[00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:50.860]   (audience laughing)
[00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:54.020]   It was like, honestly, it was panic mode.
[00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:55.940]   And it's like, oh my gosh, where did he go?
[00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:56.780]   I can't see him.
[00:34:56.780 --> 00:34:58.020]   I'm like, he's three years old.
[00:34:58.020 --> 00:34:58.980]   He can't move that fast.
[00:34:58.980 --> 00:35:00.060]   Where could he possibly be gone?
[00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:00.900]   Where'd you see him go?
[00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:02.340]   What kind of mother are you?
[00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:03.300]   Are you serious?
[00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:04.140]   Where did he go?
[00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:05.100]   And we're looking everywhere and I can't find him.
[00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:06.460]   I'm retracing steps and I'm going back
[00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:07.500]   to like where he could have been.
[00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:09.260]   And I look over and I'm just like panicked.
[00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:10.100]   It felt like an hour.
[00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:12.900]   It was probably like 25 seconds, but it felt like forever.
[00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:14.780]   And we're looking everywhere for our son.
[00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:17.060]   And then I look over in the distance
[00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:20.540]   and he's holding the hand of an aquarium worker
[00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:23.740]   who's bent over and he's just like bawling his eyes out
[00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:25.340]   'cause he's like, he can't find his parents
[00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:26.760]   and she's trying to help him find his parents.
[00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:28.480]   And I go over and I grab him.
[00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:32.220]   You know what didn't go through my head
[00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:34.500]   while we were separated from him?
[00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:36.740]   While I was like, man, this person that I love,
[00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:37.700]   I can't find him.
[00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:40.380]   I didn't begin to go, you know what, wherever he is,
[00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:41.980]   I just hope that he's behaving himself.
[00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:43.980]   I hope that he's saying please and thank you.
[00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:45.500]   Better not be hitting anybody.
[00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:48.740]   Better be very thankful when people give stuff.
[00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:52.020]   He better keep things in line and represent the family.
[00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:54.620]   No, I thought, where's my son?
[00:35:54.620 --> 00:35:55.880]   I care about my son.
[00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:57.300]   I'm separated from someone I love.
[00:35:57.300 --> 00:35:58.900]   I'm not going through like, oh, these behavioral things
[00:35:58.900 --> 00:35:59.740]   he better be doing.
[00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:01.100]   I'm going through, man, there's someone that I love
[00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:02.260]   that I'm disconnected with,
[00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:04.060]   that I wanna be restored back to.
[00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:05.420]   I can't find him.
[00:36:05.420 --> 00:36:06.860]   I'm separated from him.
[00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:09.260]   That's what the Bible says.
[00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:10.820]   God is a heavenly father.
[00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:12.540]   And when his children are separated from him,
[00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:14.360]   the concern of your heavenly father,
[00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:16.980]   as crazy as it would be for me as a dad to be like,
[00:36:16.980 --> 00:36:19.380]   yeah, this is great, but son, I wanna hear exactly
[00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:21.260]   what you were doing while you were separated
[00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:23.100]   and how you were behaving.
[00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:24.140]   That's nuts.
[00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:26.900]   But that's what so many people,
[00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:29.620]   because the church has not stayed in its lane,
[00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:32.020]   think about when they think about God.
[00:36:32.020 --> 00:36:33.740]   They're separated from the heavenly father.
[00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:35.500]   And they think the heavenly father who's there is like,
[00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:36.460]   you know what?
[00:36:36.460 --> 00:36:38.260]   I don't know where they are, but I'm separated.
[00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:40.020]   They better stop doing that and stop doing that
[00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:41.340]   and stop doing that.
[00:36:41.340 --> 00:36:42.380]   It's nuts.
[00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:45.540]   And the God in Luke chapter 15 that is there
[00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:47.000]   is presented as a father.
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:50.340]   That when his children or when people
[00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:51.660]   who are running from him,
[00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:55.380]   when they look in his direction,
[00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:57.940]   you know what it says?
[00:36:57.940 --> 00:37:02.540]   He's filled with compassion towards them
[00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:05.620]   and a heart that when they move towards God,
[00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:07.260]   God runs after them.
[00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:10.540]   Every person, regardless of their sexual orientation
[00:37:10.540 --> 00:37:12.080]   and the life that they're living,
[00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:14.580]   God's greatest concern is being restored back
[00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:16.860]   to their father, not them behaving
[00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:18.540]   while they're separated from him.
[00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:20.780]   So the first thing is we call people Christ.
[00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:22.700]   The second C is we're committed to loving people,
[00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:23.740]   not changing people.
[00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:25.700]   Loving people, not changing people.
[00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:27.580]   People are not projects to complete.
[00:37:27.580 --> 00:37:29.860]   They are people to love.
[00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:33.440]   The church does not offer conversion therapy.
[00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:38.440]   The spirit of God is firmly responsible for change.
[00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:39.820]   In other words, it's not my job,
[00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:42.060]   it's not your job to try to change anybody.
[00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:45.060]   Our job is to love people, to present the gospel to people
[00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:47.260]   and to trust the spirit of God to bring about change
[00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:48.780]   in people's life.
[00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:51.620]   It is firmly the spirit of God that restores
[00:37:51.620 --> 00:37:53.220]   and works through people's sexuality,
[00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:55.820]   but it is not projects or it's not my job anymore
[00:37:55.820 --> 00:37:59.340]   that it is your job to work through and to bring change.
[00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:01.460]   Only the spirit of God can do that.
[00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:05.900]   It would be a disservice if I said,
[00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:07.820]   man, if somebody comes to Jesus,
[00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:10.380]   the spirit of God will always change
[00:38:10.380 --> 00:38:14.480]   their sexual orientation because sometimes he doesn't.
[00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:20.180]   And he allows people to showcase,
[00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:24.600]   you know what, I trusted in Jesus.
[00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:27.120]   It's been years.
[00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:30.540]   And I thought he would change some of my desires
[00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:34.260]   for the same sex, but he hasn't, but he's enough.
[00:38:34.260 --> 00:38:38.540]   And if nobody goes with me, I'm gonna follow him.
[00:38:38.540 --> 00:38:40.740]   And even my sexuality, I'll surrender to him.
[00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:44.580]   And as much as it would be a disservice for me
[00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:45.700]   to promise that he would change,
[00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:48.320]   it would also be a disservice for me to say
[00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:52.480]   that he never does because 1 Corinthians 6 says,
[00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:57.660]   such were some of you who practiced
[00:38:57.660 --> 00:38:59.680]   and lived homosexual lifestyles,
[00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:03.360]   but you were cleansed, you were washed, you were made new.
[00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:05.920]   And sometimes God does come in.
[00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:08.340]   The story's all over here where God
[00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:10.260]   and the spirit of God brings change in people's life,
[00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:12.100]   but the role of the church is to love people.
[00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:15.460]   We should be better lovers of the LGBTQ community
[00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:16.540]   than any other group.
[00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:21.760]   The acceptance, love, affirmation, all of those things,
[00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:28.280]   we have access to the source of them, which is God.
[00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:31.860]   And any community that loves better,
[00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:33.880]   shame on us as a church.
[00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:35.880]   And so loving people and caring about them
[00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:39.280]   and their story, where they're at.
[00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:44.920]   Finally, celebrating faithfulness to God's way.
[00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:47.300]   Or one more, celebrating faithfulness to God's way.
[00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:48.860]   What does it look like to have God-like love?
[00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:51.700]   God is a God who we're told, when people are faithful
[00:39:51.700 --> 00:39:52.980]   and they follow him and they go all in
[00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:55.980]   and they surrender their life and they're walking with him,
[00:39:55.980 --> 00:39:58.140]   there's gonna come a day where he goes,
[00:39:58.140 --> 00:40:00.900]   man, well done, good and faithful servant.
[00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:03.340]   Matthew chapter 25, verse 23 says,
[00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:04.900]   so to those of you in the room
[00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:10.220]   who are handling your singleness God's way,
[00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:12.900]   in other words, you're deciding that,
[00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:14.540]   hey, you know, I could go get married tomorrow.
[00:40:14.540 --> 00:40:16.000]   I could get on 17 dating apps.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:17.720]   I could lower the bar right down here
[00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:19.600]   and I could get married and I could do it.
[00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:21.360]   And I could cross boundaries sexually
[00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:23.160]   'cause that's what most guys out there
[00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:25.440]   and most girls out there are gonna be willing to do
[00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:26.400]   and I could do all of that.
[00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:28.240]   But I'm choosing to say, Jesus, you're enough.
[00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:30.760]   And if I'm single forever, you're enough.
[00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:31.900]   And I really hope that's not the case,
[00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:33.540]   but I believe you're enough.
[00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:36.080]   And so help me to trust and help me to know
[00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:38.320]   and help me to walk in that.
[00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:42.120]   I am so, so, so proud of you.
[00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:43.880]   You inspire me, you strengthen my faith.
[00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:46.140]   You're the people in the room who have same sex attraction
[00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:47.140]   and you find yourself going,
[00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:48.820]   is God ever gonna allow me to have someone
[00:40:48.820 --> 00:40:51.380]   in the type of relationship that I hear other people having,
[00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:52.660]   that other people wanna look forward to
[00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:54.140]   or even can look forward to.
[00:40:54.140 --> 00:40:56.320]   And when I think about it, I'm filled with despair
[00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:59.780]   and honestly, grief that I may never have that in this life.
[00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:01.200]   But Jesus, you're enough.
[00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:03.100]   Though none go with me, I'm gonna follow you
[00:41:03.100 --> 00:41:05.580]   and I'm walking after and I'm not gonna listen to the lies
[00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:07.060]   of the community around me that told me,
[00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:08.220]   man, you were born this way.
[00:41:08.220 --> 00:41:09.180]   God doesn't care.
[00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:10.380]   God, you have saved me.
[00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:12.500]   You're good, you're for me, and I believe you.
[00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:13.460]   You are enough.
[00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:15.300]   Help me to believe that you are enough.
[00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:18.260]   You inspire me, you strengthen my faith.
[00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:20.400]   You make me wanna follow Jesus more.
[00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:22.460]   I'm so, so proud of you.
[00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:25.220]   I couldn't say that enough.
[00:41:25.220 --> 00:41:27.100]   And you can golf clap or not, I don't care,
[00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:28.740]   but I need you to hear me.
[00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:30.620]   I'm so proud of you.
[00:41:30.620 --> 00:41:31.900]   You've strengthened this church.
[00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:33.980]   You've strengthened the church of God.
[00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:36.140]   May God multiply your kind.
[00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:37.780]   'Cause you live in a world that tells you the lie
[00:41:37.780 --> 00:41:39.220]   every single day.
[00:41:39.220 --> 00:41:40.500]   You should do whatever you want
[00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:44.980]   who cares if some book of the Bible says you shouldn't.
[00:41:44.980 --> 00:41:46.420]   And you look those people in the face
[00:41:46.420 --> 00:41:47.940]   and you say, Jesus is enough.
[00:41:47.940 --> 00:41:50.020]   He's my King, I will follow him.
[00:41:50.020 --> 00:41:51.660]   I'm not gonna follow the ways of this world.
[00:41:51.660 --> 00:41:52.860]   And I'm so proud of you.
[00:41:52.860 --> 00:41:56.340]   And you make me wanna follow Christ.
[00:41:56.340 --> 00:41:58.220]   'Cause here's the honest thing.
[00:41:58.220 --> 00:41:59.620]   You can't coast.
[00:41:59.620 --> 00:42:03.020]   There's a lot of people in the room.
[00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:05.740]   You're not engaged in homosexual sin,
[00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:07.180]   but you're looking at pornography every day
[00:42:07.180 --> 00:42:09.140]   and it's just as offensive to God.
[00:42:09.340 --> 00:42:10.740]   It's just as offensive.
[00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:13.940]   Candidly, the most prevalent sin here
[00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:16.300]   is not homosexual sin, it's heterosexual sin.
[00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:19.060]   And it is just as offensive to God.
[00:42:19.060 --> 00:42:20.940]   You're crossing boundaries physically
[00:42:20.940 --> 00:42:24.140]   and it is just as offensive to God.
[00:42:24.140 --> 00:42:27.820]   And if you do it under the name of love is love
[00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:29.620]   or just 'cause you are in love,
[00:42:29.620 --> 00:42:33.660]   it is an offense to God who loves you,
[00:42:33.660 --> 00:42:35.300]   who doesn't want you to feel the shame and guilt
[00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:37.420]   that you feel right now even as a man.
[00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:39.260]   He doesn't want you to feel the shame and guilt
[00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:41.460]   that you feel right now even as I'm talking.
[00:42:41.460 --> 00:42:44.500]   He wants you to have just relationships
[00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:46.740]   that flourish in line with his will
[00:42:46.740 --> 00:42:48.020]   and in line with his way.
[00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:53.340]   But to those of you who are walking faithfully, well done,
[00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:54.580]   I'm so encouraged.
[00:42:54.580 --> 00:42:57.260]   You humble and convict and strengthen me
[00:42:57.260 --> 00:42:59.860]   and make me wanna go all in more with God.
[00:42:59.860 --> 00:43:04.620]   Finally, the final C is to confess sin.
[00:43:06.420 --> 00:43:09.260]   To love people if you are not healing
[00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:11.940]   and healing from the own sexual sin
[00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:14.600]   or your own sexual sin inside of your past.
[00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:16.940]   That you would be in relationships with other people
[00:43:16.940 --> 00:43:18.860]   where you can confess current struggles.
[00:43:18.860 --> 00:43:19.700]   'Cause let's be honest, dude,
[00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:21.700]   there's not a guy in this room where for the most of us,
[00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:23.100]   like people being shocked about,
[00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:24.340]   "I can't believe you looked at pornography."
[00:43:24.340 --> 00:43:25.860]   Are you kidding me?
[00:43:25.860 --> 00:43:27.200]   In a second, you're gonna have access
[00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:29.060]   to naked women everywhere?
[00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:31.380]   It's never surprising to me.
[00:43:31.380 --> 00:43:33.820]   It's like that old, what was the commercial
[00:43:33.820 --> 00:43:36.660]   where it's like, "That was easy, that was easy."
[00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:39.860]   Staples, that's how sexual sin is.
[00:43:39.860 --> 00:43:41.300]   It's like, "Oh man, yeah, you know,
[00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:43.900]   "she's my girlfriend and she wants, you know,
[00:43:43.900 --> 00:43:45.240]   "to take her clothes off of me.
[00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:47.700]   "That was easy, okay."
[00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:49.580]   It's not surprising when sin happens.
[00:43:49.580 --> 00:43:52.900]   And if you don't have people in your life
[00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:53.740]   that you can confess like,
[00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:56.940]   "Hey, I'm being tempted to look at pornography right now.
[00:43:56.940 --> 00:44:00.080]   "I pulled up pictures on Instagram
[00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:00.980]   "and honestly, I was just looking
[00:44:00.980 --> 00:44:03.220]   "for a girl in a bikini pic."
[00:44:03.220 --> 00:44:05.900]   Or, "Hey, me and my boyfriend, we're crossing boundaries
[00:44:05.900 --> 00:44:07.420]   "and I haven't told anybody."
[00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:11.480]   Your faith, there's a roaring lion
[00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:14.780]   who looks to kill and destroy, named Satan.
[00:44:14.780 --> 00:44:16.460]   He wants to kill your relationship.
[00:44:16.460 --> 00:44:18.340]   He wants to kill your relationship with Christ.
[00:44:18.340 --> 00:44:20.780]   He wants you to stay alone and in shame.
[00:44:20.780 --> 00:44:24.460]   Faith lives in the light and it dies in the dark.
[00:44:24.460 --> 00:44:28.740]   Sin lives in the dark and it dies in the light.
[00:44:28.740 --> 00:44:29.940]   And if you don't have people,
[00:44:29.940 --> 00:44:30.900]   that's why we harp on community.
[00:44:30.900 --> 00:44:32.620]   You've gotta have people you can confess,
[00:44:32.620 --> 00:44:35.100]   past sexual sin, sexual relationships,
[00:44:35.100 --> 00:44:38.500]   current sexual sin of any form,
[00:44:38.500 --> 00:44:40.540]   heterosexual, homosexual, whatever it is.
[00:44:40.540 --> 00:44:45.820]   Some of you, you need to get rid of your smartphone tonight.
[00:44:45.820 --> 00:44:49.780]   You need to add Covenant Eyes to your computer,
[00:44:49.780 --> 00:44:51.500]   to your iPad, to your phone, whatever it is.
[00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:53.940]   I couldn't encourage, if pornography's a part of your story
[00:44:53.940 --> 00:44:56.740]   like mine, adding the software of Covenant Eyes
[00:44:56.740 --> 00:44:59.540]   or something called XXX Church, which is another software.
[00:44:59.540 --> 00:45:01.100]   I know a lot of you are like, "What are you talking about?"
[00:45:01.100 --> 00:45:02.700]   That is in your story right now.
[00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:04.700]   Covenant Eyes.
[00:45:04.700 --> 00:45:07.300]   It's a software to add on there
[00:45:07.300 --> 00:45:08.900]   that allows for accountability,
[00:45:08.900 --> 00:45:12.700]   for you to not make decisions that pull your faith
[00:45:12.700 --> 00:45:14.300]   in a direction you don't want it to go to.
[00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:17.140]   We all get thirsty, but it is not okay when I'm thirsty
[00:45:17.140 --> 00:45:18.580]   to go drink from the toilet.
[00:45:18.580 --> 00:45:20.220]   But I gotta be honest.
[00:45:20.220 --> 00:45:22.980]   I wanna go drink from the toilet a lot.
[00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:24.020]   And I need people that I could say,
[00:45:24.020 --> 00:45:29.020]   "Man, I am having thoughts about a past sexual relationship
[00:45:29.180 --> 00:45:32.260]   "or about someone that I saw at work
[00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:36.020]   "or about somebody who posted something on Instagram."
[00:45:36.020 --> 00:45:38.500]   And I need you guys to pray for me, to know,
[00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:39.460]   and to follow up and ask me,
[00:45:39.460 --> 00:45:41.060]   do you have those types of relationships?
[00:45:41.060 --> 00:45:42.740]   And I don't know what it is, and I know this may even have
[00:45:42.740 --> 00:45:43.700]   like a guy bent to it.
[00:45:43.700 --> 00:45:45.140]   I know there's a lot of girls
[00:45:45.140 --> 00:45:47.820]   that struggle with the same thing.
[00:45:47.820 --> 00:45:51.500]   Whatever your struggle is, do you have people in your life
[00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:52.700]   that you can be open and honest with?
[00:45:52.700 --> 00:45:54.380]   Maybe tonight the best thing you could do
[00:45:54.380 --> 00:45:57.540]   is to just open up with someone in your community group
[00:45:57.540 --> 00:46:00.220]   to share, to share that thing you thought
[00:46:00.220 --> 00:46:01.380]   you were gonna take to the grave
[00:46:01.380 --> 00:46:02.820]   that you've never told anyone.
[00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:06.460]   And you'll release its power because sin
[00:46:06.460 --> 00:46:08.540]   and the power of it dies in the light,
[00:46:08.540 --> 00:46:09.780]   but it lives in the dark.
[00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:16.220]   Finally, what does the love of God or God love look like?
[00:46:16.220 --> 00:46:18.740]   And I'll close here.
[00:46:18.740 --> 00:46:25.860]   I know that as common as sin of sexual path,
[00:46:26.860 --> 00:46:30.260]   sexual past, or sexual present is,
[00:46:30.260 --> 00:46:34.260]   and living in a way that God says in his word
[00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:38.980]   is not how he wants for you, what he wants for you,
[00:46:38.980 --> 00:46:41.940]   equally as common is the lie that man,
[00:46:41.940 --> 00:46:45.340]   because of my past, I'm damaged goods.
[00:46:45.340 --> 00:46:46.380]   Because of the things that I've done,
[00:46:46.380 --> 00:46:47.940]   because of the relationships that I've been a part of,
[00:46:47.940 --> 00:46:49.420]   because of all the decisions that I've made,
[00:46:49.420 --> 00:46:51.420]   like I'm damaged goods, and if there's a godly guy
[00:46:51.420 --> 00:46:52.460]   or a godly girl out there,
[00:46:52.460 --> 00:46:53.900]   like everything you're talking about, preacher,
[00:46:53.900 --> 00:46:56.060]   that's all cool, but that's not gonna work out here
[00:46:56.060 --> 00:46:56.900]   in the real world.
[00:46:56.900 --> 00:46:58.260]   Like we live in planet Earth,
[00:46:58.260 --> 00:47:00.020]   and so it's really cool when we're in here in church
[00:47:00.020 --> 00:47:01.780]   and you kind of talk about stuff and I'm encouraged,
[00:47:01.780 --> 00:47:03.180]   but when I go back to my normal life,
[00:47:03.180 --> 00:47:05.220]   there's just not godly guys out there,
[00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:07.180]   there's not godly girls out there,
[00:47:07.180 --> 00:47:08.940]   and there's not people that are gonna be interested
[00:47:08.940 --> 00:47:10.820]   in someone with my past, with my struggles,
[00:47:10.820 --> 00:47:11.900]   with my problems.
[00:47:11.900 --> 00:47:18.100]   And to you, I wanna say, how will a godly guy look at you?
[00:47:18.100 --> 00:47:19.580]   That's part of your story?
[00:47:19.580 --> 00:47:20.620]   That's a part of where you are right now?
[00:47:20.620 --> 00:47:23.220]   How is a godly guy gonna look at you?
[00:47:23.220 --> 00:47:24.500]   Like Jesus did.
[00:47:24.500 --> 00:47:27.580]   Which brings the question,
[00:47:27.580 --> 00:47:30.380]   how did Jesus look at people
[00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:32.860]   in the midst of their sexual brokenness?
[00:47:32.860 --> 00:47:34.300]   In the midst of just having a sexual past,
[00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:36.700]   in the midst of making decisions
[00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:39.620]   that were not God's will as it relates sexually?
[00:47:39.620 --> 00:47:43.340]   We're actually told a story of his interaction with a woman
[00:47:43.340 --> 00:47:45.020]   who was caught flat out in the midst
[00:47:45.020 --> 00:47:46.740]   of her sexual brokenness.
[00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:50.780]   And a godly guy will not look at you
[00:47:52.740 --> 00:47:56.100]   like anything other than how Jesus looks at you.
[00:47:56.100 --> 00:47:58.660]   A godly guy will look at you like Jesus looked.
[00:47:58.660 --> 00:48:00.180]   And we're told that Jesus has this woman
[00:48:00.180 --> 00:48:01.860]   thrown in front of him who's caught in adultery,
[00:48:01.860 --> 00:48:03.780]   in sexual sin, she's thrown out
[00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:05.460]   while Jesus is out teaching the crowds,
[00:48:05.460 --> 00:48:08.020]   and this group of religious leaders brings this woman in,
[00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:09.820]   it's in John chapter eight,
[00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:10.660]   and they bring this woman
[00:48:10.660 --> 00:48:12.140]   and they throw him down in front of him,
[00:48:12.140 --> 00:48:13.820]   and they begin to form a circle around him,
[00:48:13.820 --> 00:48:15.340]   and they say, "Jesus, this woman was caught
[00:48:15.340 --> 00:48:17.380]   "having sex with another man's wife,
[00:48:17.380 --> 00:48:19.180]   "or another man's husband."
[00:48:19.180 --> 00:48:22.500]   And the law says that anyone who commits adultery like this
[00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:25.860]   is deserving of the death penalty, to be stoned.
[00:48:25.860 --> 00:48:28.820]   What do you say?
[00:48:28.820 --> 00:48:32.140]   I mean, this woman is guilty by all accounts.
[00:48:32.140 --> 00:48:34.420]   This woman does not deserve for the son of God
[00:48:34.420 --> 00:48:35.660]   to do anything other than say,
[00:48:35.660 --> 00:48:38.460]   "Man, that's what the law cries for."
[00:48:38.460 --> 00:48:42.740]   What does God,
[00:48:42.740 --> 00:48:50.700]   God, creator of the heavens, moons, stars,
[00:48:51.220 --> 00:48:54.000]   all that is, every cell in your body,
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:57.540]   every person who's ever lived,
[00:48:57.540 --> 00:48:59.500]   formed you in your mother's womb,
[00:48:59.500 --> 00:49:00.940]   holds everything together.
[00:49:00.940 --> 00:49:04.300]   He walked on the planet for 33 years,
[00:49:04.300 --> 00:49:06.660]   and we're told there's a moment,
[00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:09.740]   he's standing before a woman who's committed adultery.
[00:49:09.740 --> 00:49:12.380]   She just got through sleeping with somebody
[00:49:12.380 --> 00:49:13.260]   who is not her husband.
[00:49:13.260 --> 00:49:15.500]   She's married, and this dude wasn't her husband.
[00:49:15.500 --> 00:49:17.780]   She's dragged in front of him,
[00:49:17.780 --> 00:49:21.060]   and Jesus, he looks at the woman,
[00:49:21.060 --> 00:49:24.420]   looks at the crowd that just said,
[00:49:24.420 --> 00:49:25.820]   "She deserves to die, Jesus.
[00:49:25.820 --> 00:49:26.980]   "What are you gonna do?"
[00:49:26.980 --> 00:49:30.340]   And we're told he bends down on the ground,
[00:49:30.340 --> 00:49:32.040]   he begins writing with his finger.
[00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:37.380]   And we're told, we're not told what he writes,
[00:49:37.380 --> 00:49:38.460]   and he just sits there for a second,
[00:49:38.460 --> 00:49:40.180]   and then he stands up and he says,
[00:49:40.180 --> 00:49:45.580]   "Let the person who is without sin cast the first stone."
[00:49:46.860 --> 00:49:48.140]   And then he sits back down,
[00:49:48.140 --> 00:49:50.220]   and he just writes on the ground again with his finger.
[00:49:50.220 --> 00:49:51.180]   And we're told that the crowd,
[00:49:51.180 --> 00:49:53.660]   from the oldest to the youngest, just walked away.
[00:49:53.660 --> 00:50:01.340]   And then it's just the Son of God and the adulteress.
[00:50:01.340 --> 00:50:06.300]   And he's bent over, and he looks at her,
[00:50:06.300 --> 00:50:07.500]   and he looks in the eye.
[00:50:07.500 --> 00:50:12.760]   Says, "Where is everyone who accused you?"
[00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:14.760]   "They've all left."
[00:50:14.760 --> 00:50:18.280]   She said, "They've all left."
[00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:23.540]   And then he says, "Neither do I condemn you.
[00:50:23.540 --> 00:50:27.480]   "Go and sin no more."
[00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:30.400]   John chapter eight, verse 11.
[00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:34.700]   "Go now and leave your life of sin."
[00:50:34.700 --> 00:50:38.680]   Jesus says, "I don't condone."
[00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:39.500]   That's what he's saying.
[00:50:39.500 --> 00:50:41.000]   Hey, I don't condone what you were just doing.
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:42.280]   Let's just be abundantly clear.
[00:50:42.280 --> 00:50:43.760]   I don't condemn you.
[00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:45.880]   And I'm inviting you and calling you to a life
[00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:47.500]   that is so much better and so much greater
[00:50:47.500 --> 00:50:48.340]   than what you are.
[00:50:48.340 --> 00:50:50.280]   Your sexual sin right now doesn't define you.
[00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:52.400]   It doesn't make me not want to have a relationship with you.
[00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:54.360]   And it doesn't disqualify you from being someone
[00:50:54.360 --> 00:50:56.520]   that God wants to use every part of your story,
[00:50:56.520 --> 00:50:59.140]   every part of your past, every part of your present,
[00:50:59.140 --> 00:51:01.480]   to be someone that God writes an amazing story,
[00:51:01.480 --> 00:51:05.040]   either of redemption, an amazing story of protection,
[00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:07.200]   an amazing story of you showcasing to the world,
[00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:10.200]   Jesus is enough, no matter what my love life looks like.
[00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:15.600]   And no sexual sin and no sexual past keeps the son of God
[00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:17.920]   from this woman or keeps him from you,
[00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:20.320]   or keeps him from sexually broken people like me.
[00:51:20.320 --> 00:51:25.480]   But he doesn't condone and say, "Carry on."
[00:51:25.480 --> 00:51:28.180]   But neither does he condemn.
[00:51:28.180 --> 00:51:34.320]   You need to know a godly man, a godly woman,
[00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:35.800]   will see you like Jesus sees you.
[00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:37.000]   You are not damaged goods.
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:38.400]   He is not done with you yet.
[00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:41.740]   (congregation laughing)
[00:51:41.740 --> 00:51:44.080]   But the choice is yours.
[00:51:44.080 --> 00:51:47.980]   So now embrace love is love with the God who is love,
[00:51:47.980 --> 00:51:51.280]   and embrace his love for you.
[00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:52.320]   Let me pray.
[00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:54.220]   Father, I pray for anyone in this room
[00:51:54.220 --> 00:51:58.000]   who's believing the lie.
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:05.360]   Their sexuality is fixed and firm and must be obeyed.
[00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:09.780]   And they must follow wherever love leads.
[00:52:09.780 --> 00:52:12.740]   They would follow the God who is love,
[00:52:12.740 --> 00:52:17.240]   who calls them to life,
[00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:22.960]   who loved them so much that he gave his life for them.
[00:52:22.960 --> 00:52:26.860]   You would dispense the lies.
[00:52:26.860 --> 00:52:28.520]   All of us are tempted to believe.
[00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:31.920]   You would dispense the lies about our sexual past,
[00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:33.880]   and you would be bigger and greater
[00:52:33.880 --> 00:52:35.680]   and have victory over those things
[00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:37.340]   in our hearts and in our minds.
[00:52:37.340 --> 00:52:40.320]   Would we love you more,
[00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:41.680]   and would the relationships that we have
[00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:45.080]   as it relates to love be filled and defined
[00:52:45.080 --> 00:52:46.060]   by the love of God?
[00:52:46.060 --> 00:52:47.440]   Would we pursue purity?
[00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:48.600]   Would we find healing?
[00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:55.760]   And would we look more like our savior, Jesus?
[00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:56.600]   Amen.
