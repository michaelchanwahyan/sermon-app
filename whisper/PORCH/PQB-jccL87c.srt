2
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,960
 All right, all right.

3
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,400
 It's good to be with you guys.

4
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,720
 Nothing like starting a little series with some Beyonce.

5
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:38,600
 This is Cupid.

6
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,220
 And the reason we're calling it Cupid,

7
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:42,400
 because we're covering dating myths.

8
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,080
 And so Cupid is a Roman mythology.

9
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,560
 You know, Cupid was Venus' son.

10
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,520
 And anyone he would shoot with magical arrows

11
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,840
 would fall in love with the first person they see.

12
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,720
 So as I thought about kind of where we're going to go tonight,

13
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,200
 this weekend I renewed my CHL.

14
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,080
 If you don't know what that means, it's--

15
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,920
 [CHEERING]

16
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,280
 Wow.

17
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,360
 OK, man.

18
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,680
 Laura, make note, CHL illustrations.

19
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,400
 More of those.

20
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,520
 OK.

21
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,640
 I'm scared all of a sudden.

22
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,560
 So that stands for-- so those in the dark.

23
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,080
 Concealed handgun license.

24
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,240
 Hopefully that's what you guys were cheering about,

25
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,760
 not some other CHL.

26
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,320
 So I went and renewed--

27
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,960
 that's something my community group did about a year ago.

28
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,240
 Or I guess it was more than a year ago.

29
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,520
 Anyways, it just expired.

30
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,100
 And so we had to go back and renew it.

31
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,000
 And so we met up.

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,360
 And I was reminded of this story.

33
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,920
 We were kind of talking back the first time that we did it.

34
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,600
 And so if you don't know, we're shooting at a target.

35
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,800
 The target looks like this.

36
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,720
 You have to go and do a field trial.

37
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,320
 And so this was mine.

38
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,400
 And so kind of that's not impressive.

39
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,800
 Everybody's looked like that.

40
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,360
 And you're not shooting that far off.

41
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,880
 You're kind of this close.

42
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,560
 And they're like, OK, fire five rounds.

43
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,800
 Like boom, boom, boom, boom.

44
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,560
 One, two, three.

45
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,060
 Yeah.

46
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:57,120
 Anyways, and then fire two more.

47
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:57,620
 Boom.

48
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,720
 And then you go and load it up again

49
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,000
 and then fire some more rounds.

50
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,280
 And kind of at the end, you fired 50 rounds.

51
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,320
 And you get graded.

52
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,480
 They have to pass.

53
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,600
 And everybody's kind of target looked like this.

54
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,400
 But there was this girl there that

55
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:14,720
 was helping the coach, the teacher of the class,

56
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,800
 the instructor.

57
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,880
 And she was a professional shooter.

58
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,960
 And they had told us that.

59
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,720
 And we had kind of heard about her all day long.

60
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,920
 People were telling stories about how great she was.

61
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,700
 And so kind of towards the end of that time, I was like, man,

62
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:30,340
 all of us were like, hey, we want to see her go.

63
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,420
 Can she go?

64
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,780
 And the guy, the instructor, was like, yeah, sure.

65
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:34,700
 Hey, you up for it?

66
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:35,680
 And she's like, yeah.

67
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,600
 And so they put the target-- they're

68
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,740
 on these electronic things.

69
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,140
 And they put the target way back.

70
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:45,700
 And so she's like this way, like this far, even farther back

71
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,620
 than this from the target.

72
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,220
 And so she kind of takes aim.

73
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,340
 And they're like, you ready?

74
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,420
 And she's like, yeah.

75
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,620
 And she starts shooting at it.

76
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:53,200
 Boom, boom.

77
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,340
 And while she's shooting, she's walking like this.

78
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,220
 Boom, boom.

79
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,460
 And they kind of sidestep and boom, boom, boom.

80
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,340
 And just rapid firing these rounds

81
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,660
 and walking towards the target.

82
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:02,940
 And I'm watching.

83
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,180
 And I'm looking at the target.

84
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:06,300
 And I'm thinking, oh, no.

85
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,780
 She's missing every time.

86
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,060
 And so I'm in my mind.

87
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:10,820
 I'm thinking what I'm going to say.

88
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,140
 I'm like, well, hey, that's really hard.

89
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:12,860
 You were moving.

90
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:13,360
 You know?

91
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,980
 And it's harder than it looks, isn't it, sweetie?

92
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,500
 You know, you're thinking kind of these things.

93
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,340
 And I'm like, what am I going to say?

94
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,760
 Like, we're all sitting there like, this is embarrassing.

95
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,840
 And so they kind of--

96
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,460
 you could see the target plain as day.

97
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,040
 There's no holes in it, right?

98
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,380
 And we're like, oh, no.

99
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,640
 And so they bring the target.

100
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,680
 She's like, OK, bring the target back.

101
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,840
 I'm like, you don't have to do that.

102
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,840
 I can see there's no holes in it, you know?

103
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,800
 And they bring it back.

104
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,720
 And I don't know if you can see from where you're at,

105
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,000
 but there's a little target up here.

106
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,960
 You know?

107
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,680
 There's a little one up here.

108
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,320
 I didn't know.

109
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,360
 That's just how they score it.

110
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:53,260
 And evidently, evidently, she was shooting at that one.

111
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:58,500
 Yeah, I had no idea.

112
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,100
 We're like, whoa.

113
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:00,580
 Wow.

114
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,860
 So they brought it up there.

115
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:05,060
 Ellie, you're good.

116
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:05,580
 Look at you.

117
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,140
 You've done that before, huh, sweetie?

118
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:08,900
 I'm just teasing.

119
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,500
 I'm just kidding.

120
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,980
 Yeah, and so here was the problem.

121
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,260
 What was the problem, right?

122
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,100
 We were watching this.

123
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,880
 We were looking at the wrong target.

124
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,720
 We were looking at the wrong target.

125
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:26,920
 And as I thought about you guys, you're considering someone--

126
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,760
 you're in this season of life where

127
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,760
 you're starting to think about someone you might

128
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,720
 spend the rest of your life with.

129
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,640
 And you guys know my heart's burning for you.

130
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,760
 I love young adults.

131
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,840
 I trusted Christ as a young adult.

132
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,880
 Man, I just made so many mistakes in my life,

133
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:45,860
 bad decisions, not mistakes, but bad decisions.

134
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:49,220
 And the cry of my heart, I think,

135
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,020
 is to spare you as much as I can.

136
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,540
 And I think all the time, I'm like,

137
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,420
 what would I have listened to?

138
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,660
 What would I have listened to?

139
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,300
 Like, what would have got my attention?

140
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,940
 Because I think as you guys are looking for someone

141
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:02,100
 or considering someone that you might spend the rest

142
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,180
 of your life with, I think so many of us

143
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,820
 are looking at the wrong target.

144
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:11,460
 We got the wrong target in mind.

145
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:14,000
 And the reason that's so important

146
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,760
 is because this is something that

147
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:23,700
 is going to affect the destiny, the destination,

148
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:26,360
 of the rest of your life.

149
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,000
 And you know, everyone here knows,

150
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,440
 people who've done it well and people who haven't done it

151
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,000
 so well.

152
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,520
 And I just think, I think, if we can just reset,

153
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,440
 if I can get you to believe me, not so much me,

154
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,800
 but the wisest man ever lived, not so much the wisest man ever

155
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,260
 lived, but the one who created all things,

156
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:46,360
 if I can get you to trust it, I think

157
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,760
 that we can redirect our sights to the right target.

158
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,840
 And everyone can leave here tonight

159
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:57,280
 with just a little bit better of a trajectory

160
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,960
 as we consider what might be next.

161
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,320
 And so we're covering myths every week.

162
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,320
 And I think this first myth is just

163
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,480
 the idea of love at first sight, the dating

164
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,720
 myth of love at first sight.

165
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,960
 And you're like, oh, no, you haven't

166
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,840
 heard my parents' story, or my cousin's story,

167
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,040
 or my Uncle Bob's story.

168
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,280
 Just hear me out.

169
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,520
 But I want to show you tonight just this idea of what happens.

170
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,280
 Because love at first sight, what is that?

171
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,840
 It's trusting in a moment our feelings

172
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,640
 and following our hormones instead of logic.

173
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,720
 And moreover, logic, actually God's word,

174
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,400
 what God says, the one who created all things, who's

175
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,240
 crazy about you, who wants what's best for you,

176
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,800
 what he says about this.

177
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,800
 And so tonight, my hope is I'm going

178
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,920
 to take a real logical approach at this.

179
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,280
 If you're here and you're married, I'm stoked you're here.

180
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,120
 I need your help.

181
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,620
 Because you're going to be the one with the perspective that

182
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:49,720
 can say, hey, he's right.

183
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,760
 No, trust me.

184
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,320
 We just know there's some things.

185
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,880
 Like I remember there's just some things I would not

186
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,280
 listen to as a single person.

187
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,480
 I'm like, yeah, that's cute.

188
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,520
 Yeah, but you're married.

189
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,280
 You don't get it.

190
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,600
 And so I need your help.

191
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,040
 If you're here and you're thinking, hey, you know what?

192
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,820
 I might be called to a life of singleness.

193
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:09,220
 If that's you, great, I'm glad you're here.

194
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,220
 Listen and learn from the scriptures

195
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,860
 so that you can minister to those around you.

196
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:17,660
 But if you're here and you're single,

197
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,220
 over the next four weeks, we're going

198
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:22,780
 to open the word of the creator of the heavens and the earth.

199
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:25,580
 And we're going to read about what some really wise people

200
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,540
 have written.

201
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:29,960
 And all I'm going to ask of you is that you would trust it.

202
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:33,740
 And if you will, it will help you the remainder of your days.

203
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:36,780
 And not only that, but I think you'll love God more.

204
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:39,060
 And have a greater understanding of how God loves you.

205
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,980
 So right now, so here's the problem as I see it.

206
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:44,940
 The way that this deal, dating, originally started--

207
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:48,180
 so a guy would pursue a woman for a reason.

208
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,980
 So I want to show you how we got so far off.

209
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:52,620
 Because right now, we are so far off.

210
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:55,220
 And you see the lens of dating through the world

211
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:57,380
 that you were born in, which is very different today

212
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,580
 than it was even a century ago.

213
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:02,700
 Very, very different, even two decades ago.

214
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,180
 And so this is how we got here.

215
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:07,900
 Originally, a man would pursue a woman for one reason.

216
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,780
 Do you know what that reason was?

217
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,540
 Not love, but a family.

218
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:17,220
 He would pursue a woman so that it was a means to a family,

219
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,180
 to pursue a relationship with her.

220
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:21,620
 They would get married, and they would have a family.

221
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,340
 This is God's first commandment of man.

222
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:26,220
 It's Genesis 1, "Be fruitful and multiply.

223
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,180
 Fill the earth."

224
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,860
 This is the first thing God asked man to do.

225
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:33,180
 And so man would pursue a woman for the sake of a family.

226
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:36,900
 And so in 1896, the word dating is introduced.

227
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,700
 And dating is actually, in 1896,

228
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:43,220
 introduced as a euphemism for prostitution.

229
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:47,780
 Okay, it literally means exchanging things

230
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,180
 or money for sex.

231
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:51,460
 And so if you went on a date with a girl,

232
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:55,200
 that meant that you sought out a prostitute.

233
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,620
 That's where the word comes from.

234
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,220
 In the first century, I'm sorry,

235
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,800
 in the turn of the 20th century,

236
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,660
 so in the beginning of the 1900s,

237
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:06,180
 if a girl was caught alone with a guy,

238
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:09,380
 through that event, she would earn a reputation.

239
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,700
 Okay, people would think that she was either loose

240
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,020
 or working.

241
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:13,840
 True story.

242
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,660
 Okay, so then we go into the 1900s,

243
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:19,920
 and now you have the introduction of media,

244
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,140
 which is a major influence now.

245
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,300
 And so over one million ladies

246
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:27,500
 subscribe to Ladies Home Journal.

247
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,860
 And that begins to influence the way women dress,

248
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:33,300
 the way they saw themselves, and the definition of beauty.

249
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:37,580
 And then in the 1930s, the date outside the home was born

250
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,660
 with the invention of the automobile.

251
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,480
 Here's what this means.

252
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,660
 Prior to the 1930s, a man, if you wanted to pursue a woman,

253
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,780
 you would start with her father,

254
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:50,740
 and you would ask if you could come into the home,

255
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:53,300
 and then you would date her in the living room.

256
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,980
 That's where the dates happened, prior to the 1930s.

257
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:58,380
 Now, with the invention of the automobile,

258
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,980
 this idea of this euphemism of prostitution,

259
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:03,220
 it really takes off, because what happens

260
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,740
 is wealthy guys have cars,

261
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,300
 and so wealthy guys can go on dates.

262
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,500
 And so there's this understanding,

263
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,500
 the more money you make, the nicer you dress,

264
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,220
 and the nicer car that you have,

265
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,500
 the more beautiful girl that you can get,

266
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,980
 okay, an idea that has been magnified today.

267
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:20,040
 And there was an understanding that the greater the date,

268
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,340
 you could expect some sexual favor in return.

269
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:23,900
 True story.

270
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,400
 This is the history of dating.

271
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:32,060
 And then in the 1940s, this was like full blown out.

272
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:34,860
 There was just an understanding of an exchange,

273
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:37,540
 if you went on a date, basically what I just said.

274
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:40,540
 In the 1960s, the dating lifestyle of society

275
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:43,900
 led way, the greatest social decay of morality

276
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,120
 in the history of singleness in the Western world.

277
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,220
 Anybody know what it was?

278
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,460
 The sexual revolution.

279
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:53,940
 You and I still stand under the consequences

280
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,900
 of the sexual revolution.

281
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:59,640
 This radically altered the sexual landscape of our nation.

282
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,180
 And now sex is seen as an experience.

283
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:04,760
 And so what happened now is people began

284
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,940
 to date for an experience.

285
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:09,260
 This should sound really familiar to you.

286
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:11,820
 'Cause people don't date for a family anymore,

287
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,500
 they date for an experience.

288
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,720
 Manic highs, manic lows, an adrenaline rush,

289
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,880
 or some sexual pleasure.

290
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,620
 In the 1970s, Playboy is placed out in plain sight,

291
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:25,020
 in convenience stores, abortion is legalized,

292
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,940
 and now this is allowing for reproduction

293
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,080
 to be removed entirely from sex.

294
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,820
 We talked about seeking pleasure

295
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,460
 without the consequences in a message,

296
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,760
 the problem of pleasure.

297
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,460
 That's what's going on now in the 1970s.

298
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:39,620
 In the 1980s, the internet is introduced,

299
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:42,820
 and pornography is made available to everyone.

300
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,640
 And again, sex begins to change,

301
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,720
 which in turn begins to change dating.

302
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,660
 And now in the 2000s, everyone has a mobile device,

303
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,160
 a smartphone in their pocket.

304
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,260
 Pornography is no longer two-dimensional images,

305
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,340
 it's videos.

306
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,580
 Of the act.

307
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,980
 And this perversion is magnified.

308
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:01,100
 And beauty is changed.

309
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,380
 What is beautiful is now different.

310
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:04,820
 It has evolved.

311
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:08,780
 With the turn of every decade, beauty has changed.

312
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,420
 Do you understand what I'm saying?

313
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,020
 Like this is the simple truth I'm hitting you with,

314
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,380
 a very logical truth.

315
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,180
 You've been told what is beautiful.

316
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:18,060
 You didn't decide on your own.

317
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,420
 You don't know what is beautiful.

318
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:22,100
 You've been told what is beautiful.

319
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,500
 Do you get that?

320
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:27,580
 And so now the reason that we date is for an experience.

321
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,500
 Girls often date for emotional acceptance,

322
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,540
 to feel that someone wants them.

323
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:36,300
 Guys often date so that they can feel that adrenaline rush,

324
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,860
 even if there's no sex or any kind of physical thing

325
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:42,140
 involved, just feel that adrenaline rush around a girl.

326
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:45,780
 And so we date, not for a family, but for an experience.

327
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:48,700
 And so I'm just telling you this tonight,

328
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,580
 if we could change this target,

329
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,820
 what we put our sights on, we'd be better off.

330
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:56,420
 And so the way that we combat myths is with wisdom.

331
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:59,100
 The way that you combat lies is with truth.

332
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,500
 And so we're going to turn to the book of wisdom.

333
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:05,380
 This is the book written by the wisest man

334
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:07,380
 who ever lived, the wisest man in the history of the world.

335
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,340
 And so these were Proverbs that he wrote down,

336
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,020
 but also Proverbs that other people wrote,

337
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:13,340
 other kings wrote, that he kept for himself.

338
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:15,940
 This particular Proverb was written by King Lemuel.

339
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:18,380
 And specifically, King Lemuel is reflecting on wisdom

340
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,860
 that he learned from his mother.

341
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,500
 So this is wisdom from a woman.

342
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,220
 We're gonna be in Proverbs 31.

343
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,500
 Ladies, I know that many of you have a love-hate

344
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,820
 relationship with Proverbs 31, okay?

345
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:28,660
 I get it.

346
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:32,260
 Some of you are like, if a pastor ever recites Proverbs 31

347
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:33,980
 to me ever again, I'm gonna throw up.

348
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,420
 And others of you are like, oh, look,

349
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:37,140
 it tells me exactly, this is great.

350
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:39,240
 And so I know there's all kinds of mixed emotions,

351
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,260
 but I'm just telling you, it's God's word.

352
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:42,680
 And so we're gonna look at one verse,

353
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,900
 we're gonna camp on one verse tonight.

354
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:48,120
 It's this, Proverbs 1:30, 31-30.

355
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:48,960
 Ready?

356
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:53,780
 All you gotta do tonight is believe this verse.

357
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:54,700
 That's it.

358
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,300
 Believe it's true.

359
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:59,540
 Charm is deceptive, beauty is fleeting,

360
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:03,300
 but a woman who fears the Lord is to be praised.

361
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:07,260
 If everybody in here believed this verse,

362
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:14,780
 if every, you'd save yourself a lot of time and heartache,

363
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:17,380
 frankly, you'd save me a lot of time and heartache,

364
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:19,500
 if everyone in here just believed this verse.

365
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,420
 And so let's start, my first point is charm is inaccurate.

366
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:25,060
 I say inaccurate because we're aiming for the right target.

367
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:27,540
 Charm is going to take you off target.

368
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:28,940
 Charm is inaccurate.

369
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:31,620
 And so if something is inaccurate, you can't trust it.

370
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,780
 The scripture says charm is deceitful.

371
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:34,600
 What does that mean?

372
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,100
 Deceitful means to be misled by false appearance, okay?

373
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:42,580
 So it looks good, it looks appealing, but it's deceitful.

374
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:45,460
 It intentionally deceives, okay?

375
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:47,460
 I can remember, I was brand new married,

376
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,940
 that was my first year of marriage.

377
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:49,980
 Green is all get out.

378
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:50,980
 I was a Christian.

379
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:53,020
 I did believe that Christ died for my sins

380
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,340
 and God raised him from the dead,

381
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:56,100
 but I was a brand new baby Christian

382
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,540
 and I still had a lot of old habits on me, okay?

383
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:02,700
 My wife goes out of town and I go to dinner with a friend.

384
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,220
 And so he and I are sitting there at dinner

385
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,140
 and these two girls approach us,

386
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,660
 two very, very beautiful girls,

387
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,820
 something that I was not accustomed to,

388
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,080
 beautiful girls approaching me.

389
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,940
 There I am and they say, "Hey,"

390
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:17,180
 and I talked to one and she says, "Can I buy you a drink?"

391
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:19,980
 To which, and so I'm like, "Wow, aggressive, okay."

392
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:20,820
 "Can you buy me?"

393
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,860
 And so to which I say, "I'm married."

394
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:25,580
 To which she says, "I don't care."

395
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:29,620
 And I'd love to tell you right now what I did

396
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:32,400
 is I like jumped up from the table and ran to my car

397
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,380
 and burned out of the parking lot.

398
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:37,340
 (congregation laughing)

399
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,180
 But I didn't.

400
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,300
 I didn't.

401
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:43,100
 My heart was flattered.

402
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:46,240
 I was like, "Huh."

403
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,900
 Still very green, still very immature.

404
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:50,780
 I was like, "Huh, you don't care."

405
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,140
 Still got some old habits.

406
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:55,140
 And I believe as I reflected in that moment,

407
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,500
 one thing saved me.

408
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:01,780
 And it was something that somebody had told me.

409
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:05,020
 And they said, "Hey, that woman,

410
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:07,560
 "she wants to destroy you.

411
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:11,220
 "She doesn't care about you, man.

412
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,920
 "She's just looking to feel loved.

413
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,280
 "She needs someone to help her feel loved.

414
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:20,220
 "And so she wants your wife to hate you,

415
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:23,900
 "your parents to hate you, your friends to hate you,

416
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,740
 "your wife's parents to hate you,

417
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:28,420
 "your brother-in-law, also your best friend to hate you

418
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:31,860
 "because you would have one moment of fleeting pleasure.

419
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:35,180
 "Do not be deceived by her charm."

420
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:37,700
 And that message rang true in my head.

421
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,380
 And I thought for a moment, I thought,

422
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:43,460
 "Oh, you just need to feel wanted."

423
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:49,080
 And I remember, "Oh, you want to destroy me."

424
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:53,640
 And that memory, I believe, saved me from that moment.

425
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,560
 Proverbs 6 says it like this, verse 21.

426
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,360
 For these commands are a lamp, this teaching is a light,

427
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,840
 and the corrections of discipline are the way of life,

428
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,920
 keeping you from the immoral woman,

429
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,120
 from the smooth tongue of the wayward wife.

430
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,840
 Do not trust in your heart after her beauty, I'm sorry,

431
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,160
 do not lust in your heart after her beauty

432
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,080
 or let her captivate you with her eyes.

433
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,300
 And so I'm telling you, ladies,

434
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,460
 the charming guy can't be trusted either.

435
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:19,260
 You do not trust charm, right?

436
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,780
 They want to destroy your marriage

437
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,640
 before your marriage ever happens.

438
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,880
 So I don't care if he's calling you

439
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,180
 and leaving voice to men on your voicemail

440
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:31,420
 and singing "Usher" to you and reciting "Romeo and Juliet"

441
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,580
 and he wrote a poem to you, okay?

442
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:36,500
 You don't trust charm, right?

443
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,220
 You don't trust charm.

444
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,900
 That's not what you trust.

445
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,100
 You don't trust your feelings,

446
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:44,880
 your emotions, or your hormones, okay?

447
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,920
 Charm is deceptive, it is fleeting,

448
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,960
 and it is the selfish pursuit of an experience.

449
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,460
 So when someone comes up to you,

450
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:57,040
 and remember, it's no longer about the family,

451
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,280
 so when they come up to you and they're charming,

452
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,860
 just say, respond with this thing.

453
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:01,800
 Let me ask you a question, how many kids you want to have?

454
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,400
 That will usually solve the problem right there, okay?

455
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,520
 (congregation laughing)

456
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,180
 That's free, man, that's free.

457
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:10,480
 Let's talk about dating websites for a minute, okay?

458
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,200
 I won't be here long, but evidently it's a hot topic.

459
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,560
 A lot of people say, hey, will you talk about this?

460
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,840
 So let's talk about it for a minute.

461
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,760
 Matt, I don't know.

462
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:21,960
 I mean, there's not, there's not a thou shalt not

463
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,080
 e-harmony, you know, in the scripture, all right?

464
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,560
 So what do I do?

465
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,960
 Here's what I would tell you.

466
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,920
 Be wise, make sure your community is aware,

467
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,640
 those around you are aware, and here's what I would tell you.

468
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:37,760
 This is a game where you want to remove the disadvantages.

469
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,280
 Okay, as quickly as you can, any kind of disadvantages

470
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,320
 between you and where you're going,

471
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,640
 you want to remove those disadvantages.

472
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,400
 And I'll just tell you that everyone is cooler

473
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,440
 on the internet, right?

474
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,920
 And so everyone is cooler in their profile

475
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,080
 than they are in real life,

476
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,040
 and technology puts advantages between you.

477
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,420
 And so let me say this to you guys.

478
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:57,720
 Stop asking girls out by text, amen?

479
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,840
 (congregation cheering)

480
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,680
 Yeah, I got that, I got that article sent to me

481
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,500
 like 16 times this week, so I read the article.

482
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,320
 We're good, and guys, we're good.

483
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,240
 Like, just don't do that anymore, okay?

484
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,120
 'Cause that's lame, we're good.

485
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:10,960
 We're gonna move past it.

486
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,240
 That has nothing to do with my talk, that's free too.

487
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,880
 (congregation laughing)

488
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,000
 Okay, my second point tonight,

489
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,800
 love at first sight is a miss.

490
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,840
 Remember, we're talking about this target,

491
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:24,320
 and so love at first sight, like I saw her and I loved her,

492
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,840
 I saw him and I loved him, he had this six pack

493
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,040
 that's not gonna be there very long.

494
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,680
 (congregation laughing)

495
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,840
 Okay, love at first sight is a miss.

496
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,920
 The scripture says beauty is fleeting.

497
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,260
 That's all it is, listen, all you gotta do is trust that.

498
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,160
 Beauty is fleeting.

499
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,280
 By the way, that's true.

500
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,060
 Historically, biologically, scientifically,

501
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,960
 beauty is fleeting.

502
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,400
 You tracking with me?

503
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,980
 What am I saying?

504
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,280
 We're all getting uglier.

505
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,200
 (congregation laughing)

506
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,240
 No, no, no, see, I just get paid to speak truth.

507
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,400
 Like, it's just true, guys.

508
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,480
 Everybody thinks they're here,

509
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,080
 no, I'm gonna be the hot 50-year-old.

510
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,600
 No, you're not, not one of you.

511
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,800
 (congregation laughing)

512
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,680
 Statistically, not, no, you don't understand,

513
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,520
 I'm gonna work out.

514
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,220
 No, you're not, you're not gonna work out,

515
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,120
 you're gonna hurt your joints in the gym

516
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,240
 and you're not gonna be able to work out anymore.

517
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,360
 That's what's gonna happen.

518
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,320
 It happens over and over.

519
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,960
 No, no, no, I'm gonna get plastic surgery.

520
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,960
 Okay, listen, that worked out maybe for a little,

521
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,240
 yeah, about 10 years on that, okay?

522
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,040
 It's fleeting.

523
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:29,040
 It's going away, it's diminishing, okay?

524
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,800
 And so what if you, who are you?

525
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,240
 What does this say about the guy who walks through the porch

526
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,820
 who sees the girl, goes up to her,

527
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,160
 the hot girl, right, goes up to her

528
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,120
 and asks her for her number.

529
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,560
 What does that say about you?

530
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:42,400
 It says you're a sixth grader.

531
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,040
 (congregation laughing)

532
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,440
 Okay, you're a sixth grader.

533
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:51,080
 It says that I know that what you have is vanishing.

534
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,840
 I'm not looking for a long time,

535
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,480
 I'm looking for a good time.

536
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,360
 That's what it says about you.

537
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,600
 I'm not looking for a long,

538
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,200
 I don't know anything about your character,

539
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,600
 I don't know if you love Jesus,

540
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,620
 I don't know who you are or where you come from,

541
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:05,600
 but I know you look good

542
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,880
 and so I was wondering if I could have your number.

543
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,200
 Okay, I used to do that in the sixth grade,

544
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,400
 walking through the mall.

545
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,240
 (congregation laughing)

546
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,880
 Just being authentic here.

547
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:22,080
 So if you invest, if you invest in fleeting things,

548
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,440
 like anybody, some of you are in the financial world,

549
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,720
 if you invest in things that are fleeting,

550
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,800
 it's diminishing returns.

551
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,700
 Like you're losing money from day one.

552
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:33,440
 But if you invest in godly character,

553
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,200
 it pays dividends the rest of your life.

554
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,640
 The rest of your life.

555
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,080
 It's just good investment.

556
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,800
 That's just good investing, okay?

557
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,800
 And so ladies, this is what I would tell you,

558
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,560
 you want looks that last.

559
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,620
 And what I mean, I'm not talking about Botox

560
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,360
 or facelifts or boob jobs,

561
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,880
 I'm talking about looks that last,

562
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,540
 looks from him that last.

563
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:56,560
 A guy who looks at your character,

564
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,540
 he's going to look at you like you're beautiful

565
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:00,720
 the rest of your life.

566
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,600
 When your beauty fades, and it will fade,

567
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,260
 he's still gonna look at you like you're beautiful.

568
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:09,120
 You want looks that last.

569
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,420
 So don't attract him with Botox and a boob job

570
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:15,440
 and a facelift and a butt that looks good in those jeans,

571
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,760
 okay, because those things are gonna go away,

572
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,940
 and when they do, he's gonna go away.

573
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:23,200
 And you don't have to trust me.

574
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,600
 See, there's like a part of me going into the night

575
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,640
 that I'm just like, man, they're just not gonna believe me.

576
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,120
 And I actually prayed through that,

577
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,200
 and I was like, God, they're not gonna believe me.

578
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,360
 He said, oh, they're gonna believe you.

579
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,520
 Maybe just not tonight.

580
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,200
 So that's the piece I have in this message.

581
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:41,840
 Every single one of you are gonna know it's true one day.

582
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,440
 Every one of you are gonna know it's true.

583
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:52,900
 And so ladies, you get a guy with your good looks,

584
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:56,120
 you're gonna lose him when those looks fade,

585
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,480
 and the problem with that is,

586
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,480
 is I think a lot of you ladies,

587
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,840
 when you hear me say that, you think,

588
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,360
 you don't think, oh yeah, he's right.

589
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,520
 You think, no, I'll just stay looking good.

590
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,600
 Good luck with that.

591
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:12,120
 First Peter 3:3 says,

592
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:16,240
 your beauty should not come from outward adornment, period.

593
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,440
 You tracking with me?

594
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,280
 See, your beauty should not come from outward adornment.

595
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,120
 It's just in the scripture.

596
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:22,940
 It's black and white.

597
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:23,780
 It's not even complicated.

598
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:25,400
 Like, I don't need to exegete the Greek on that.

599
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,960
 Your beauty should not come from outward adornment.

600
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:28,800
 You're gonna leave here and like,

601
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,080
 does my butt look good in these jeans?

602
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,800
 No, it shouldn't come from outward adornment,

603
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:36,120
 but from something inside, and I know,

604
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,320
 you're tired of waiting on those guys

605
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,360
 and you see the girls getting ahead.

606
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,200
 I get it.

607
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,840
 You're tired of always being the bridesmaid,

608
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:41,680
 never the bride.

609
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,240
 I get it.

610
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,560
 I don't really get it, but.

611
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:47,900
 (congregation laughing)

612
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:55,640
 See, like I said earlier,

613
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,080
 you've been told what is beautiful,

614
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:00,040
 and it's just true because like in researching this message,

615
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:00,880
 like it's evolved.

616
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,160
 Like there was a day, you know,

617
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,420
 even when Song of Solomon was written,

618
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:07,360
 when like super fair skinned,

619
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,800
 what was most attractive,

620
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,760
 like the fairer your skin,

621
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,940
 no matter what your ethnicity was,

622
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,920
 the fairer your skin, the more attractive,

623
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,200
 and slightly plump, and I don't know how else to say that,

624
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,800
 but that's what was attractive, okay?

625
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,800
 And so like in that day, in Solomon's day,

626
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,580
 if you'd have told him there's gonna be a Palm Beach tan

627
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:25,320
 on the corner, they'd have been like, what?

628
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,160
 That's crazy.

629
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,720
 They'd pay you to get uglier, you know?

630
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:31,320
 'Cause that was just the day, right?

631
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,320
 It's evolved.

632
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,560
 You've been told.

633
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,440
 You've been duped.

634
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,480
 Media has told you what is beautiful,

635
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,760
 and so it's evolving.

636
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,600
 Do you remember the anorexic look of the '80s

637
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,720
 and the early '90s?

638
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,000
 And now where it's headed, and I want you to hear why.

639
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,860
 Where it's headed, I think the more of what is going to be

640
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:49,560
 the epitome of beauty is now kind of the porn star, okay?

641
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:53,040
 The huge kind of unnatural curves, if you will,

642
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:53,960
 if you're tracking with me there.

643
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,720
 That's what's gonna be the epitome of beauty.

644
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,560
 Why?

645
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,800
 Because men are telling you what's beautiful.

646
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,640
 Why?

647
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,940
 Because you're letting them.

648
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:05,440
 Okay?

649
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,400
 Because as they say, hey, this is what we like,

650
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,440
 you say, okay, this is what we'll give you.

651
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,440
 And you say, but JP, that's 'cause I'm tired of waiting,

652
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,000
 and they're winning.

653
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:13,900
 You can trust God.

654
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:18,320
 Okay, if I didn't know anything else about God,

655
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,260
 I know one thing.

656
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:21,680
 I know that we can trust him.

657
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:25,360
 You can be with him a lot longer than you're here.

658
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,000
 And you can pursue him and love him

659
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,680
 and find satisfaction in him,

660
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:34,240
 which I know can be difficult in seasons.

661
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,160
 But I'm just telling you, he's just telling you,

662
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,920
 a relationship built on beauty won't last.

663
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,840
 How do I know this?

664
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,240
 We can pursue this with logic, like God said it,

665
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,060
 but I can answer, I can respond with logic.

666
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:45,960
 Because who are the most beautiful, sexiest,

667
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,240
 wealthiest people alive?

668
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,360
 Where can we look for that?

669
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,200
 Hollywood.

670
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,720
 Who also has the highest divorce rate?

671
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,640
 Let me just read a few.

672
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:54,040
 Ryan Filippi, Reese Witherspoon, Brad Pitt,

673
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,960
 Jennifer Aniston, Tom Cruise, Katie Holmes,

674
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,200
 Chris Robinson, Kate Hudson, Seal, and Heidi Klum,

675
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,520
 Usher and Tamika Foster, Chris Humphries and Kim Kardashian,

676
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,560
 Charlie Sheen, Denise Richards, Guy Ritchie and Madonna,

677
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,920
 Mark Anthony and Jennifer Lopez.

678
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,840
 It's a really long list.

679
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:11,000
 Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore, Katie Perry,

680
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,280
 Russell Brandt, Peter Wentz, Ashley Simpson,

681
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,300
 Jessica Simpson, David Arquette, Courtney Cox,

682
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,560
 Tony Parker, Eva Longoria.

683
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,480
 I can go on and on.

684
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,320
 It's a really long list.

685
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,200
 I'll stop right there.

686
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,960
 You track with me?

687
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:22,800
 How does that work?

688
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,360
 Who are the sexiest, wealthiest,

689
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,080
 most beautiful people on the planet?

690
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,580
 How's it working out for them?

691
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:33,440
 Like if it was about that,

692
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,280
 we would turn to them and say,

693
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,300
 look how great their marriages are.

694
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:39,040
 Like that's what I want, right?

695
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:43,220
 See, sometimes people are beautiful

696
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:46,240
 because they're at the center of their world.

697
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,240
 Like sometimes he's got everything kind of stacked up right

698
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,480
 'cause he's worked really hard for that.

699
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,840
 The reason he's worked really hard for that

700
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,240
 is 'cause he likes the way it looks in the mirror.

701
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,040
 He's at the center.

702
00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:00,840
 Sometimes she has everything stacked up just right, right?

703
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,000
 'Cause she's at the center of her world.

704
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,320
 I'd be really cautious about that, okay?

705
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:10,240
 And then sometimes,

706
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:17,400
 sometimes we pursue that

707
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:21,180
 because we want the experience.

708
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:23,420
 Let me ask you a question.

709
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:24,920
 Just gonna throw it out there.

710
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:28,180
 Is sex better with a beautiful person?

711
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:33,820
 Don't shout out your answer.

712
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:36,820
 Okay, my guess is the room would be divided.

713
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:38,740
 You can just think on it.

714
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:41,280
 I'll tell you, here's what I tell you.

715
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,700
 This is the truth I lean on.

716
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,860
 Marriage is better with a faithful person.

717
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:48,460
 Marriage is better with a committed person,

718
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:51,340
 with a person of character all day long.

719
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:59,300
 Some of you are so addicted to the experience

720
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:02,060
 that you've got some really bad habits.

721
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:07,060
 And so you watch the soap opera and you say, I want that.

722
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,540
 I like the drama.

723
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:12,660
 It's really crazy, but I met with enough of you to know this.

724
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:15,500
 Your life, in a way that some kind of subconscious

725
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:18,420
 or a way you can't help, you are addicted to drama.

726
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:20,580
 So you have what's called a savior complex

727
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:23,060
 and you see him and you know that he gets in fights

728
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,820
 and he's no good, but some reason,

729
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:27,460
 you wish your heart wasn't, you're attracted to that.

730
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:29,880
 And in some people, maybe he even gets in fights with you.

731
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,580
 Maybe he gets physical with you and you're attracted to that.

732
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,260
 And I'm just saying, hey, something's broken,

733
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:36,380
 something's off, and I'm not calling you out.

734
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:38,100
 I'm saying, hey, we're here to help you.

735
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:41,100
 All I need you to do is get the courage and say,

736
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,300
 yeah, man, something's a little off in me, man.

737
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,100
 I'm attracted to these guys, no good for me.

738
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,380
 Will you help me?

739
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:46,200
 And we will.

740
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,160
 And guys, like you go after the drama queens.

741
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:52,200
 Okay, most of you know, you run from the drama queens,

742
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,160
 but some of you, you're like, I like that.

743
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,240
 She's crazy, that's what I like.

744
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,580
 (congregation laughing)

745
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:02,640
 Eminem says it like this.

746
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,720
 One of my favorite theologians.

747
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,960
 (congregation laughing)

748
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:10,200
 I can't tell you what it is.

749
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,560
 I can only tell you what it feels like.

750
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:15,720
 And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe.

751
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:19,160
 I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight.

752
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:22,640
 As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight.

753
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,600
 High off of love, drunk off of my hate.

754
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,760
 It's like I'm huffing paint, and I love it

755
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,360
 the more I suffer.

756
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,160
 I suffocate, and right before I'm about to drown,

757
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:36,360
 she resuscitates me, she really hates me, and I love it.

758
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:40,480
 Some of you, you heard that song, you're like, yeah.

759
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,600
 (congregation laughing)

760
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,440
 That's true.

761
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:48,200
 But this is, this is what the scripture says.

762
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,840
 This is what the wisest man ever lived.

763
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:50,680
 This is what he wrote.

764
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,240
 It's gonna be, I'm gonna go in order, okay?

765
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,960
 Starting with Proverbs 19, verse 13.

766
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,600
 A quarrelsome wife is like a constant dripping.

767
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,120
 Proverbs 21, verse nine.

768
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,800
 Better to live on the corner of a roof

769
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,720
 than share a house with a quarrelsome wife.

770
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,240
 Proverbs 21, 19.

771
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,360
 Better to live in a desert, this is straight from the word,

772
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,280
 okay, better to live in a desert

773
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,600
 than with a quarrelsome wife and an ill-tempered wife.

774
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,360
 Proverbs 25, verse 24.

775
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,100
 Better to live on the corner of the roof

776
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,680
 than share a house with a quarrelsome wife.

777
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,600
 It's in there twice.

778
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,560
 Proverbs 27, 15.

779
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,600
 A quarrelsome wife is like a constant dripping

780
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,760
 on a rainy day.

781
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,040
 And then we get to this proverb, where we're at today.

782
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:26,400
 It's Proverbs 31, it's called a wife of noble character,

783
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,220
 and it says this.

784
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:30,040
 A wife of noble character, who can find?

785
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,840
 She is worth far more than rubies.

786
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,880
 And so when I'm calling you to,

787
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,080
 what God's word is calling you to,

788
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:39,400
 what someone who loves you very much is calling you to,

789
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:43,120
 men, women, aim at godly character.

790
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,060
 Aim at godly character.

791
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:48,220
 Put your crosshairs, put your sights on godly character.

792
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:49,540
 And so what does noble mean?

793
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:50,620
 It's not a word we use a lot.

794
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:52,340
 It means having or showing qualities

795
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:54,260
 of high moral character, such as courage,

796
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:55,860
 generosity, or honor.

797
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:59,860
 Okay, these are what you look for.

798
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,900
 Last Thursday, I picked my little girl up from school,

799
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:04,460
 Presley, she's in kindergarten, she's five.

800
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:06,140
 And she's telling me about her friend Avery,

801
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:07,740
 and she's like, "Daddy, Avery taught me this,

802
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,100
 "and Avery taught me that,

803
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,020
 "and do you know what infinity means, Daddy?

804
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:12,780
 "Avery told me what infinity means,

805
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:14,020
 "and this and that."

806
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:15,820
 And I was like, "Well, cool.

807
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:17,740
 "How long have you been friends with her?"

808
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,440
 And she goes, "No, Avery's a boy."

809
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,860
 (congregation laughing)

810
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:25,180
 Oh man.

811
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:28,740
 Okay, it sounded like y'all talked a lot.

812
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:32,940
 Is Avery your boyfriend?

813
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:33,780
 No.

814
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:36,800
 Presley, do you have a boyfriend?

815
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,800
 Yes.

816
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,220
 I can't breathe.

817
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:43,220
 (congregation laughing)

818
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:44,220
 What's his name?

819
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:48,900
 I don't know his name.

820
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:51,660
 It's funny when you're five,

821
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:55,900
 you don't know that names are important in relationships.

822
00:31:55,900 --> 00:32:00,220
 But what I'm saying tonight is I think when we're 25,

823
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:03,060
 we still don't know what's important in relationships.

824
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,320
 When we're 35, we still don't know

825
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,820
 what's important in relationships.

826
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:07,780
 Like God's word just says, black and white,

827
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:09,740
 it's just like it's plain as day, right?

828
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:13,140
 Charm is deceitful, beauty is fleeting,

829
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:16,540
 but a woman who fears the Lord, that's what you want.

830
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:18,900
 Find you a woman who fears the Lord.

831
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:19,780
 What does it mean to fear the Lord?

832
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:21,980
 It means to obey his command.

833
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:24,700
 That's what it means, to obey his command.

834
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:25,860
 It means to follow his command.

835
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,060
 Let me tell you like this.

836
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:29,380
 Ladies, a guy, the reason that he'll put his hand

837
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:31,820
 up your shirt or down your pants, it's for one reason.

838
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:33,340
 He's not scared of God.

839
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:36,320
 That's it, it's the only reason.

840
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:38,620
 You tracking with me?

841
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:42,660
 The reason he's saying, hey, can I come in?

842
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:44,300
 And you're saying, no, he's like, come on, what's the--

843
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:46,980
 It's because he doesn't fear God.

844
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:50,380
 Okay?

845
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:53,180
 And ladies, that's back on you too.

846
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:55,580
 If you're saying, if you're inviting that in,

847
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:56,780
 like it's only one reason.

848
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:59,180
 It's like, God, I'm not scared of you.

849
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,860
 I don't need to obey your word.

850
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:02,260
 You don't know what's best for me.

851
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:04,980
 All it means to fear God is to trust

852
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:06,680
 that he knows what's best for you.

853
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,680
 That he sets you here and he's giving you rules

854
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,120
 that leads to life.

855
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:20,080
 And so, but a woman who fears the Lord is to be praised.

856
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,480
 Guys don't believe this.

857
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:26,760
 One of the reasons that guys don't believe this, ladies,

858
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,920
 okay, I don't mean to come on hard at the ladies.

859
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,400
 I mean, guys, I could yell at you all night,

860
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:37,120
 but ladies, one of the reasons that guys don't believe this

861
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,720
 is 'cause you don't believe this.

862
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,720
 Like you can nod right now.

863
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,480
 You can be like, oh yeah, fears the Lord, yeah.

864
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,480
 And then you're like, man, I wish I had her body.

865
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,360
 So you don't believe it.

866
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,320
 Man, I wish I looked like her.

867
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,520
 Comparison, the thief of all joy.

868
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:54,360
 Let me say it again, comparison is the thief of all joy.

869
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,920
 You look at her, man, I wish I had her hair.

870
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,080
 I wish I had her eyes.

871
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:01,120
 I wish I had her chest.

872
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,400
 Wish I had those legs.

873
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:05,520
 You don't believe it.

874
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:09,040
 You ever, man, I wish I feared God like she does, you know?

875
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:12,880
 I wish I knew the word like she,

876
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,840
 I wish I was committed like she is.

877
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:22,920
 So let me just clarify some things and we'll wrap up.

878
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:27,760
 History doesn't disqualify you, okay?

879
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,560
 So I don't care if you've had 127 sexual partners,

880
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:34,960
 had abortions, that doesn't disqualify you.

881
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,520
 Christ makes you know, we know that.

882
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,200
 And so history doesn't disqualify you,

883
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,520
 but your reputation does, okay?

884
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,800
 And reputation's not today, right?

885
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,160
 Reputation's a season.

886
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:47,500
 And so you wanna walk faithfully for a season.

887
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:50,080
 Okay, I'm talking to you guys too.

888
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:50,920
 Like I don't give you, man,

889
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:53,200
 maybe you've been a player, a cheat.

890
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,640
 You're not disqualified,

891
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,920
 but it's time to surrender everything,

892
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,480
 to set the crosshairs on Jesus.

893
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,240
 Say, Jesus, I wanna follow you.

894
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,760
 I believe you died for my sins.

895
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,280
 I believe you covered them, they're behind me.

896
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,880
 That's not who I am anymore.

897
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,600
 My identity's now in you and I'm gonna walk

898
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,960
 as a new creation, Paul writes.

899
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,240
 I'm gonna walk in a new life.

900
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,840
 I'm your son, I'm your daughter.

901
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:17,060
 And so some of you, you hear this and you wanna date,

902
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:17,900
 but you don't need to date.

903
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,920
 You need to take a season and you need to pursue Jesus.

904
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,200
 And as I say that, your heart might be saying to you,

905
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,760
 I hope he's not talking about me, and I know he is.

906
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,360
 So let me just say this again.

907
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,840
 Some of you, you don't need to date right now.

908
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,800
 You need to go out and kind of mark

909
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,680
 in your Microsoft Outlook calendar,

910
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,640
 like six months or a year, and say,

911
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,840
 hey, I'm gonna take this time

912
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,340
 and I'm just gonna pursue you.

913
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:42,040
 And I trust in your timing.

914
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:46,720
 You know, that you'll ignite that in me

915
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,060
 or allow me to do that again through the context

916
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:51,060
 of community and the wisdom from others.

917
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:54,720
 Okay, but some of you, if you are ready,

918
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,720
 this is what I want you to do.

919
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,000
 It's a real simple application.

920
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:57,880
 It's a fun application.

921
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,440
 I think you're gonna like it, okay?

922
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,460
 It's this simple, guys.

923
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:02,040
 If you're here and you're like, man, I love Jesus,

924
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,400
 I'm ready to date, this is what I want you to do, okay?

925
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,300
 This simple.

926
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:07,980
 I want you to think of the most godly woman you know.

927
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:08,960
 This simple, think of her.

928
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:09,800
 Who is she?

929
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,620
 The most godly woman you know.

930
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:12,320
 Now, this is assuming you're not in a relationship.

931
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,280
 I know some of you are.

932
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,600
 And so if you're in a relationship,

933
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,960
 you can kind of audit your relationship

934
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,040
 based on these values.

935
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,120
 And so if you're here and you're not in a relationship,

936
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:22,220
 you think of the most godly person you know, okay?

937
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:23,060
 The most godly person you know.

938
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:25,780
 Guys, I'm talking to you, and I want you to ask her out.

939
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:28,020
 That's it.

940
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,300
 I'm not asking her to marry you.

941
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:31,460
 Just ask her to coffee.

942
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:33,540
 And you can ask her for this purpose.

943
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:34,780
 I mean, I wanna know kind of what,

944
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:36,180
 you know, how did you get godly?

945
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:37,280
 Like, what makes you godly?

946
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,520
 And how do you trust God?

947
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,780
 And just get to know her.

948
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:44,020
 And ladies, this is for you now.

949
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:46,160
 If you're here and you're not in a relationship,

950
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:49,460
 if a godly guy asks you out, okay?

951
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:51,980
 If a godly guy asks you out, and you know he's godly,

952
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:53,740
 I want you to say, okay, yeah,

953
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:55,460
 we can go and coffee one time.

954
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:59,820
 We can do that, I will get to know you better, right?

955
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:01,020
 And so what I'm saying, like guys are like,

956
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:03,140
 well, I want a tall girl, a short girl,

957
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:04,940
 blonde girl, brunette girl, blue eyes, right?

958
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:07,580
 I want you to throw that out the window for a minute

959
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:08,980
 and set it on godliness.

960
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:12,760
 Okay, godly character.

961
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,540
 If a godly guy asks you out, I just want you to give him

962
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:17,260
 a shot, it's one date, okay?

963
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:20,800
 Now, if he's not godly, okay?

964
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,780
 Let me say this first.

965
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:23,780
 If you don't know if he's godly, like you say,

966
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:25,540
 well, how do I know, he's at the porch,

967
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:27,620
 that does not mean he's godly, okay?

968
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,820
 And so if you don't know, you say this,

969
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:31,460
 you say, you know what?

970
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:33,520
 This tall, goofy guy told me that if you're godly,

971
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,360
 that I'm supposed to say yes.

972
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,780
 And so I don't know if you're godly,

973
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:38,200
 so I just need some time to kind of figure that out.

974
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,780
 That's it, it's that simple.

975
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:42,160
 You look him in the eyes, you say, hey, you know what?

976
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,940
 I don't know you well enough to agree to that.

977
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:46,740
 And so I just need some time to kind of

978
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:48,820
 check your references, if you will.

979
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:49,860
 He'll love that, okay?

980
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:51,940
 (congregation laughing)

981
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:54,620
 All right, now, if he's not godly, what do you do then?

982
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:57,380
 You make up an excuse, you say, well, I can't

983
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:58,780
 because I gotta go change my sock drawer.

984
00:37:58,780 --> 00:37:59,940
 No, you don't, okay?

985
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:00,860
 You don't do that.

986
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:02,660
 Now, listen, this is important, ladies,

987
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:04,620
 'cause a lot of you have missed this.

988
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:07,100
 So I'm gonna give you some good, sound wisdom here.

989
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:11,220
 If you don't think he's godly, you tell him that.

990
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:14,940
 Whoa, what a, no, you want me to be truthful?

991
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:18,820
 You look him in the eyes, and you say no,

992
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:20,100
 and you say, here's why.

993
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:23,020
 I've seen some things in your character

994
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:25,340
 inconsistent with that of Jesus,

995
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:27,320
 and so I'm not interested.

996
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:30,020
 I can't say that, you couldn't be honest?

997
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:32,180
 That's what you're saying, I can't be honest.

998
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:33,580
 That's crazy.

999
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:35,780
 Ladies, you can be honest.

1000
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:38,180
 I think we've taken this word submissive

1001
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:41,020
 to mean, like, I can't be truthful.

1002
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:43,700
 I wanna empower you to be truthful, okay?

1003
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:44,900
 You can be truthful.

1004
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:47,960
 That's it, that's the application tonight.

1005
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,400
 I'm serious, this week, every guy here.

1006
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,080
 Like, next week, y'all should be on a date.

1007
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:56,080
 Everyone here should be on a date at the porch.

1008
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,600
 (congregation laughing)

1009
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,640
 Okay, if you're here, you're ready to date,

1010
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,480
 you ask, you think of the godliest girl you know,

1011
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,320
 and you ask her out.

1012
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,840
 And you say, JP, I want both.

1013
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:07,280
 I want beautiful and godly.

1014
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,920
 You say, like, maybe it looks like this.

1015
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:12,360
 You're like, well, I mean, I need to be attracted to her

1016
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,960
 to spend some time with her.

1017
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,280
 No, you don't, you need to spend some time with her

1018
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,160
 to find out if you're attracted to her.

1019
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,480
 Remember, like, I'll tell you,

1020
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,880
 some of the healthiest marriages I know,

1021
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,560
 their story's like, man, we were serving together,

1022
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,760
 and I wasn't interested in him at all.

1023
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,480
 (congregation laughing)

1024
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:30,520
 But now, it's like this crazy healthy marriage.

1025
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:34,200
 Sometimes God just does something, okay?

1026
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,400
 Let me say it like this.

1027
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:40,280
 Let me just invite you into the Pucluta household, okay?

1028
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,680
 So we'll go last night.

1029
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,600
 So my wife, she's sick, okay?

1030
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,960
 It's kind of been going around, this flu-like thing,

1031
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,800
 and so my wife is sick, my three-year-old is sick, okay?

1032
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,360
 And so, like, I'm being stopped up,

1033
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,640
 like, just no energy, running a fever.

1034
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:57,360
 Okay, we got a four-month-old at home, okay?

1035
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,040
 And then we got a five-year-old at home,

1036
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,560
 and so my five-year-old, right,

1037
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,460
 like, she has to, she's in kindergarten,

1038
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:04,840
 she has a homework assignment, she has to write a book.

1039
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,280
 I'm like, what, write a book?

1040
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,800
 Literally, she has to write a five-page ABC book

1041
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,000
 on animals, draw the animals, illustrate it, and everything,

1042
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,240
 and so I'm sitting there,

1043
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,800
 I'm sitting there trying to help her do this.

1044
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,360
 Monica's like, hey, can you pick up Weston?

1045
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,200
 Weston's crying.

1046
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,480
 I pick up Weston, I'm like, hey,

1047
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,800
 you know, I'm doing that beatbox thing

1048
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,320
 that sometimes I'll post on Facebook.

1049
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,160
 I'm doing that, and he just,

1050
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,800
 bleh, projectile vomits all over me, okay?

1051
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:26,040
 Like, the nasty, sticky, white stuff

1052
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:29,320
 hits me right here and runs down my shirt and my jeans,

1053
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,280
 and I'm grossed out by that, by the way, okay?

1054
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,600
 So, like, I'm not the cool dad.

1055
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:35,700
 I'm like, oh, take him, take him, take him!

1056
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:38,120
 And so Finley's crying because she's sick,

1057
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:40,360
 and Monica's not feeling well, and Presley needs help,

1058
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,680
 and now Weston's crying.

1059
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,640
 This is all happening last night, okay?

1060
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,680
 And then we go to bed.

1061
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,440
 Let me tell you something, Weston's teething.

1062
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:49,180
 So he's up four times last night, four different times,

1063
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:52,120
 and when he wasn't up, my sick three-year-old, she's up.

1064
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,020
 And so they were trading off.

1065
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:54,640
 It's like they communicated, hey, I'll get up,

1066
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,920
 and then when I go back, when they go back to sleep,

1067
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,240
 then you start crying, okay?

1068
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,880
 And so then she's like, okay, Finley, you okay?

1069
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,480
 And then, Weston, okay, you okay?

1070
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,440
 Now, Finley, you okay?

1071
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,280
 And so we're doing that.

1072
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,100
 Let me tell you something.

1073
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:04,680
 I don't need a trophy wife.

1074
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:08,480
 I need someone to go to war with me.

1075
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,580
 You tracking with that?

1076
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:10,880
 (congregation laughing)

1077
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,080
 I need someone to step into battle with me.

1078
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,440
 Like, that's cool and all, you know?

1079
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,320
 Hey, that was fun, you know?

1080
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,360
 You looked good in a bikini,

1081
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:22,960
 but now it's time to go to war, okay?

1082
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:27,180
 I just got vomited on, you know?

1083
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:31,220
 And I'm just telling you, it's logic.

1084
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:34,960
 That is where you're headed, okay?

1085
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,040
 And it's funny because the family,

1086
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,220
 we no longer value that.

1087
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:39,560
 I'm telling you, in America,

1088
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:41,800
 people are getting married exponentially less

1089
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:44,160
 than they ever have, and they're having less kids,

1090
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,640
 so much so, they're saying America won't sustain itself

1091
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,320
 because people aren't having children.

1092
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,140
 Why?

1093
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,560
 Because we're selfish and self-absorbed

1094
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,520
 more so than we ever did.

1095
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,400
 We're pursuing pleasure more than we ever have,

1096
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,240
 and listen to this one.

1097
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,280
 This was the most interesting.

1098
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,320
 We're the most depressed we've ever been.

1099
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,480
 Do you get that?

1100
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,540
 It's logic.

1101
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:03,240
 We've shifted off of God's values.

1102
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,680
 It's that simple.

1103
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,620
 We say, man, I wanna be about me.

1104
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:10,500
 And it ends tragically.

1105
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:13,840
 See, some of you guys,

1106
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:18,160
 some of you guys know guys pursuing godly girls.

1107
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,480
 You're like, man, what's he doing?

1108
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,680
 She's not that hot.

1109
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,920
 What's he doing with her?

1110
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:27,320
 You think he's missing the target.

1111
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:29,720
 You don't know, man, he's drilling it.

1112
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,680
 He's hitting that little character

1113
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:35,480
 to the up and to the left, just killing it, okay?

1114
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:37,240
 Let me pray.

1115
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:42,240
, God, I think they're wrestling with this right now.

1116
00:42:42,240 --> 00:43:01,400
 You love 'em more than I do even.

1117
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:08,440
 And so, Father, in your Holy Spirit, in your power,

1118
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:10,320
 would you take that what is true

1119
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:12,600
 and would you stir it in their hearts

1120
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:13,720
 and not let 'em shake it?

1121
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:16,040
 Like some of them, they know that they're dating

1122
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:17,520
 someone no good for 'em, and so would you give 'em

1123
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,520
 the courage to have that conversation tonight?

1124
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:22,080
 Say, hey, man, we're done here.

1125
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:26,920
 Some of them have made compromises

1126
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:29,640
 that they need to ask each other's forgiveness,

1127
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:32,200
 and I pray that you let them do that.

1128
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:33,840
 Confess it in context of community

1129
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:35,880
 and move on to higher ground.

1130
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:41,340
 Some of them know that they've been pursuing

1131
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:44,300
 the wrong things, and I just pray that in your power,

1132
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:47,280
 you would help them reset the sights, reset the scope.

1133
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:52,000
 Aim at the right target.

1134
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:57,320
 And Father, for all of us, I pray that we would pursue Christ

1135
00:43:57,320 --> 00:44:01,460
 more than a spouse, even my married friends,

1136
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:05,740
 even us, help us to pursue you more than our spouse,

1137
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:08,480
 that you would be ultimate.

1138
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,960
 Father, I thank you that we are all gonna be

1139
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:15,960
 well married one day to your perfect bridegroom,

1140
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:19,400
 to your perfect son.

1141
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:20,600
 Help us to hope in that.

1142
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:25,120
 Man, that's just what you guys need to hear.

1143
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:27,740
 Some of you, I know that you're forgiven.

1144
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,960
 Every stupid thing you've done,

1145
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:35,220
 every wicked thing you've done,

1146
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:37,820
 if you've trusted Jesus died for it,

1147
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:38,740
 that's what it takes.

1148
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:40,500
 I know there's some whack theology out there

1149
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:43,540
 saying some other things, but it's this simple.

1150
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:48,540
 He died for all your sins, or he died for none of your sins.

1151
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:52,980
 He purchased your way to God.

1152
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:57,860
 And if you trust in that, then you're a new creation.

1153
00:44:57,860 --> 00:45:00,640
 And the crazy thing about new creations

1154
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:03,240
 is they do new things.

1155
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:06,360
 And so instead of being tempted to pursue yourself

1156
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:08,520
 and tempted to pursue those things

1157
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:11,440
 that have brought death to your life, pursue new things.

1158
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:14,880
 Pursue the abundant life Christ came to bring.

1159
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,080
 It's John 10, 10.

1160
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:17,280
 It's from the scripture.

1161
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:20,320
 And so I just want you to leave here.

1162
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:22,760
 Remember the application, don't forget it.

1163
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:25,760
 Move the crosshairs to the right thing.

1164
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:30,220
 Godly character, okay?

1165
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:31,540
 Godly character.

1166
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:33,500
 Remember you guys can ask questions on Twitter

1167
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:35,500
 and we'll try to address them in the next four weeks.

1168
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:36,980
 We'll do our best to.

1169
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:37,820
 I love you guys.

1170
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:39,860
 Go in peace to love and serve the Lord.

1171
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:40,700
 Amen.

1172
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:42,860
 (silence)

1173
