[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420]   (soft music)
[00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:27.120]   - Hello, hello, how we doing?
[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.360]   Greetings, Dallas, Fort Worth, Houston,
[00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.600]   as you gather in the chapel there,
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.720]   we're praying for you as well.
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.800]   And anyone listening around the world,
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.180]   tuning in, streaming live, we're excited to be here.
[00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.720]   We just sang a song here in Dallas that says,
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.120]   "Nothing formed against me will stand."
[00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.240]   And life doesn't always feel that way.
[00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.880]   And in fact, I'll start by asking you this question.
[00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.840]   Have you ever been facing accusation,
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.880]   condemnation, or separation?
[00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.280]   Are these things that you've ever faced?
[00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.480]   I'll tell you about a time that I did,
[00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.560]   and that's just as a disclaimer
[00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.020]   in case you're a guest with us.
[00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.360]   I did not walk with Jesus in college.
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.600]   I was not a Christian.
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:09.440]   I was not a believer.
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:10.280]   I was a fool.
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.600]   I was a complete and total idiot in college.
[00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.500]   And so I was pursuing the things of the world.
[00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.880]   I thought there was life in girls.
[00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.600]   I thought there was life in the party,
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.880]   life in getting drunk, life in getting in a fight.
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.200]   I mean, these were my life goals, if you will.
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.560]   And so this one particular evening in college,
[00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.040]   we kind of, this girl had invited us to a party,
[00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.880]   but we really didn't want to go there.
[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.360]   We went to another party, and when that party was over,
[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.720]   we were looking for the after party.
[00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.080]   So we thought at this point, we'd go to this girl's party.
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.680]   So we go to her house, but it's dead.
[00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.480]   And like, no, you know, there's nothing going on.
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:45.680]   It's just like, man, we can't win.
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.080]   You know, there's nothing going on.
[00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.480]   We walk in, there's a couple of people
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.280]   sitting around the island in the kitchen talking.
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.520]   We're like, "Hey, where's our friend?"
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.800]   They're like, "She's asleep."
[00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.560]   We're like, "Oh, okay, great, sweet party."
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.240]   And so as we're leaving, my buddy, the guy that I'm with,
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.000]   there's three of us, and I'm with this guy,
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.240]   and he gets in this little verbal argument
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.440]   with one of the girls that was sitting there in the kitchen,
[00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.220]   kind of like insulting their party
[00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:07.120]   because it wasn't happening.
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.200]   He's leaving, too much to drink, you know, you get it.
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.880]   And so as we're walking out,
[00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.160]   they get in this verbal argument.
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.240]   I'm like, "Man, we just can't win."
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.400]   And as it gets outside onto the sidewalk,
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.840]   it escalates to such a point where like,
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.360]   she's in his face, you know, like, you know, doing this.
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.920]   And I'm like, "I don't know where this is going
[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.160]   "with, you know, Xena the warrior princess
[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.200]   "or what's about to happen."
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.240]   But, and as he's just like, "Get away from me."
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.960]   And she says, "Boom!"
[00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.880]   And I mean, Ronda Rousey, this fool.
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.080]   And he's like, "Whoa," you know, like,
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.160]   "JP, did you see that?"
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.440]   I'm like, "How could I miss it?"
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.960]   Like, "We can't win, where is this gonna go?"
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.720]   And she's just still like, "Come on, what?"
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.080]   You know, and I'm like, "Oh my goodness,
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.840]   "this is not gonna go well for us, right?"
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.680]   And so I'm like, "Let's go, let's go."
[00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.760]   Well, meanwhile, all of these guys come out of the woodwork.
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.480]   Like, I don't know if they were sleeping in the bushes
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.040]   or what was going on, but they just start closing in on us.
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.660]   I'm like, "We cannot win, okay, let's go.
[00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.240]   "Come on, buddy, let's go, let's go."
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.560]   We get in my truck, like we're running from these guys,
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.400]   running from, you know, Ronda Rousey.
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.160]   And we get in my truck and as we're pulling away,
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.040]   which is foolish because we've been drinking,
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.440]   as we're pulling away, whoop, whoop.
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.520]   And I'm like, "Oh, we cannot win."
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.920]   And so I stop and this police officer comes to my door,
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.800]   opens the door, a Coors Light spills out from my truck
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.800]   onto his shoes, to which he says, "You're going to jail."
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:43.720]   And so they cuffed me, put me in the back of the car,
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.960]   the police car, and I sit there for an hour and a half
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.880]   and here's what happens.
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.920]   For an hour and a half, they begin to meet
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.720]   with the other guys who came out of the woodworks,
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.420]   you know, the secret ninjas that showed up.
[00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.840]   They begin to meet with them one by one
[00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.080]   and right outside the window of where I'm at
[00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.880]   in the back of the car, and I listened to these guys
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.240]   and they said, "Yeah, man, they were beating up on her."
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.240]   And I'm like, "What?"
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.560]   And I find out the reason that the police
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.760]   were so aggressive with us was the call they got
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.620]   was that there were three men beating up
[00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.800]   on this Baylor student, this girl.
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.080]   That's the call they got.
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.960]   And I'm like, "Oh no, like we cannot win."
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:19.960]   I'm sitting back there and I'm continuing
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:22.280]   to listen to accusation after accusation.
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.120]   It's like, "Yeah, they came out, you know,
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.440]   "they were just looking for a fight.
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.480]   "They got in a fight with the,"
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:27.960]   and I'm just like, "Are you serious?"
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.960]   Then I find out that this girl, said girl,
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.000]   is the granddaughter to the judge in Waco.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:43.400]   And I'm just like, I'm like saying my goodbyes mentally,
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.280]   like wonder if prison is air conditioned, you know.
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.800]   These are the questions like I can't win.
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.280]   Have you ever been in this place
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.520]   where you find yourself in such a hole,
[00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.500]   it's like there's no way you're going to dig out.
[00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.080]   It's like a wave knocks you over
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.040]   and you get up and another wave knocks you over
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.320]   and you get up and another wave knocks you over.
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.580]   Now don't get me wrong, we were fools.
[00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.200]   We were guilty.
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.120]   We just weren't that guilty, right?
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.080]   We weren't guilty of all of the accusations
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.980]   that were coming against us, but we were certainly guilty.
[00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.380]   Certainly deserved some punishment.
[00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:23.460]   And I don't know if you've ever been in this place in life
[00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.660]   and it may not, you may be here
[00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.380]   and you've walked with Jesus for a while,
[00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:29.140]   praise God for that.
[00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.220]   And it may not be that you're facing
[00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.420]   the kind of accusations that I was facing
[00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:35.680]   or the kind of condemnation
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.600]   or the kind of separation that I was facing.
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.740]   But maybe you've gone through a breakup,
[00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.940]   maybe it's that you were laid off,
[00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:48.460]   maybe your roommate moved out or you're being evicted,
[00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:52.060]   you can't pay rent, maybe just a difficult day,
[00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.820]   maybe you didn't get the promotion.
[00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.860]   And you're in this place
[00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.860]   where people are saying things about you
[00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.300]   and it feels like God is far.
[00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.420]   Like you said, okay, I'm a Christian,
[00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:07.140]   like I thought life would be a little easier than this
[00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:10.860]   and it feels like God is far from you
[00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:13.880]   and this is why you desperately, desperately
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.320]   need this promise tonight
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.940]   because this is for when you are tempted
[00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:20.420]   to doubt that God is not in this,
[00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:23.380]   this is when you are tempted to doubt God's love for you,
[00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:25.540]   this is why the apostle Paul
[00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:29.300]   scribed this passage to the church in Rome,
[00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.540]   a people group whom he had not met
[00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:35.140]   in the 50th century,
[00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:41.100]   saying, hey, you guys need to hear this.
[00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:44.400]   You need to hear this promise from God to you
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.640]   and so tonight we're in the finale of Romans 8,
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:49.360]   the series that we titled Walk by the Spirit
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:50.560]   and here's the subject,
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.500]   I wanna give it to you, write it down if you can.
[00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.420]   It's this, it's the love of God
[00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:57.920]   cuts through all accusations,
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.760]   condemnation and separation
[00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:03.280]   to give you good without reservation.
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:07.280]   I'll say it again so you can tweet it out,
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:08.880]   write it down, whatever you're going to do,
[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:12.340]   the love of God cuts through all accusations,
[00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:16.280]   condemnation and separation
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:18.320]   to give you good without reservation.
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:20.680]   That is the best summary I could come up with
[00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.680]   out of this text, let me read it to you.
[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:26.340]   We've looked at the Christian life,
[00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:28.500]   we talked about letting the spirit drive,
[00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:30.080]   how we're God's children,
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:31.580]   all out of Romans chapter eight,
[00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:33.580]   we talked about how God waits for us
[00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:35.660]   and then last, two weeks ago rather,
[00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:37.180]   we took a break last week from Romans 8,
[00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:39.740]   two weeks ago we talked about how God flips
[00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:42.180]   everything for your good and so Paul says,
[00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:45.040]   what then, if this is true, what then,
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:47.420]   shall we say in response to these things?
[00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:49.900]   If God is for us, who can be against us?
[00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:53.060]   He who did not spare his own son
[00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:55.720]   but gave him up for us all,
[00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:58.040]   how will he not also along with him
[00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:00.740]   graciously give us all things?
[00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:04.140]   Who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen?
[00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:06.460]   It is God who justifies.
[00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:08.140]   Who then is the one who condemns?
[00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:09.580]   No one.
[00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:11.900]   Christ Jesus who died, more than that,
[00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:14.900]   who was raised to life is at the right hand of God
[00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:17.520]   and is also interceding for us.
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:20.860]   Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?
[00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:23.540]   Shall trouble or hardship or persecution
[00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:26.740]   or famine or nakedness or danger or sword?
[00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:31.700]   As it is written, for your sake we face death all day long.
[00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:34.660]   We are considered as sheep to be slaughtered.
[00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:38.660]   No, in all these things we are more than conquerors
[00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:39.820]   through him who loved us.
[00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:41.820]   For I am convinced, Paul writes,
[00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:44.060]   for I am convinced that neither death nor life,
[00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:46.060]   neither angels nor demons,
[00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:47.820]   neither the present nor the future,
[00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:50.140]   nor any powers, neither height nor depth,
[00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:52.340]   nor anything else in all creation
[00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:54.460]   will be able to separate us from the love of God
[00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:56.900]   that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:59.580]   Amen.
[00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:04.060]   And so we're gonna go through that passage verse by verse.
[00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:08.180]   And then I'm gonna give you four truths from the passage
[00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:12.820]   as we wrap up this amazing chapter in the scriptures.
[00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:15.220]   And so Paul is coming out, hey, you have been,
[00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:16.900]   God is going to glorify you.
[00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:19.760]   This is the specific good that he's giving to you.
[00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:21.140]   We know that in all things,
[00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:23.760]   God works together for the good of those who love him,
[00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:26.060]   who have been called according to his purpose.
[00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:27.780]   And two weeks ago, if you missed it,
[00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:30.580]   listen on the app or online if you missed it,
[00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:31.780]   two weeks ago we talked about
[00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:33.780]   what that good is specifically.
[00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:35.580]   And so Paul says, what then?
[00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:40.420]   I like to picture it like a rap battle or something.
[00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:41.860]   What then?
[00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:45.280]   What then?
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:51.500]   Shall we say in response to these things,
[00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:55.440]   if God is for us, who can be against us?
[00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:56.860]   And I think you're tempted to read that
[00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:59.180]   like God is on your team.
[00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:01.740]   Like maybe you're playing three on three basketball
[00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:05.180]   and you've got LeBron James on your team.
[00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:08.460]   And you're thinking, who then can stop us?
[00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:10.840]   That's not what this passage is saying.
[00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:13.820]   It's not saying that God is on your team
[00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:15.420]   and he's a really good player.
[00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:18.060]   It's saying that God is the referee
[00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:19.880]   and he's already said who's won.
[00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:23.140]   He's saying, no, God determines the outcome.
[00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:24.020]   It's been determined.
[00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:26.500]   And as you play the game, you know you've won
[00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:28.680]   because God gets to decide who won.
[00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:30.900]   This is not David and Goliath saying,
[00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:35.220]   oh, that's a giant, but I've got a bigger giant on my side.
[00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:37.260]   No, this is David fighting Goliath saying,
[00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:40.400]   yeah, that's a giant, but my giant controls that giant.
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:43.380]   My giant's numbered his days.
[00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:46.540]   My giant knows that he's about to die
[00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:49.640]   by a rock through his forehead, little giant.
[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:51.660]   Let's go.
[00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:57.140]   He who did not spare his own son,
[00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:59.100]   but gave him up for us all,
[00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:01.300]   how will he not also along with him
[00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:03.340]   graciously give us all things?
[00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:09.580]   In the gospel, God proves himself to be crazy.
[00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:13.120]   Seems blasphemous.
[00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:14.260]   I find it to be true.
[00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.700]   I want you to consider if it is that God proves himself
[00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:21.000]   to be crazy out of his mind for you.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.780]   You say, well, JP, how can you say that?
[00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:26.700]   Let me just give you a very direct metaphor
[00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:29.000]   or illustration if I might.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.740]   If your heart fails and you need a heart transplant,
[00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:36.380]   and I have my son, Weston, my three-year-old son,
[00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:39.280]   whom I love very, very much, my only son,
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:42.940]   and I say, you need a new heart, take Weston's.
[00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:45.980]   You can have Weston's heart.
[00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:48.600]   Oh, I love Weston, but you can have his heart
[00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:49.660]   so that you can live.
[00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:53.140]   Would you not think for a moment, man, this guy's crazy.
[00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:54.420]   At least he's crazy about me.
[00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:56.900]   Why? He loves me more than his son.
[00:11:56.900 --> 00:12:00.100]   I mean, as he loves his son, he loves me,
[00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:02.460]   that he would give his own son's heart
[00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:05.300]   so that I might live like this is crazy.
[00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:10.540]   And what you wouldn't do is you wouldn't wonder,
[00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:12.640]   wonder if I can ask him for a stick of gum
[00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:17.100]   or a dollar.
[00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:21.900]   No, you'd be like this guy who is willingly handing over
[00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:24.860]   his son for my life would give me anything.
[00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:27.180]   If he would give his son, he'd give me anything.
[00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:28.740]   This is what this passage says.
[00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:34.300]   Who will bring any charge against those
[00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:35.560]   whom God has chosen?
[00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:36.520]   Verse 33.
[00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:41.360]   It is God who justifies.
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:45.500]   It's saying that God is the judge,
[00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:49.900]   and if the judge is for us, if the one who decides
[00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:52.820]   whether you are guilty or innocent is completely,
[00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:56.300]   totally, and radically on your side,
[00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:57.500]   who can be against you?
[00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:02.700]   Who then, verse 34, who then is the one who condemns?
[00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:03.540]   Who?
[00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:05.620]   Who can condemn us?
[00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:06.460]   Right?
[00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:09.100]   He answers it here in the NIV 2011.
[00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:10.800]   It says no one.
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:14.020]   Because, and here's why the no one,
[00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:16.540]   because Christ Jesus who died, more than that,
[00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:19.340]   who was raised to life and is now at the right hand of God,
[00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:21.500]   he didn't just die for your sins.
[00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:24.500]   He's alive so that he can intercede for you
[00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:26.460]   on your behalf to God, the creator
[00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:27.300]   of the heavens and the earth.
[00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:29.460]   He's there saying no, he's not guilty.
[00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:30.780]   Remember, I paid for that.
[00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:32.180]   I paid for what she did.
[00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:33.700]   I paid for that abortion.
[00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:35.440]   I paid for that porn addiction.
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:36.840]   I paid for that sex.
[00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:38.020]   I paid for that alcoholism.
[00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:39.740]   I paid for that self-righteousness.
[00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:41.980]   I paid for that legalism.
[00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:43.280]   I paid for it on the cross.
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:44.120]   They're not guilty.
[00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:45.340]   It's been paid for.
[00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:47.040]   If he's interceding for you,
[00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:50.700]   right, he's at the right hand of God.
[00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:53.540]   He's also interceding for you.
[00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:54.940]   You know what happened in that story?
[00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:55.780]   It's crazy.
[00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:58.780]   There I sat in the back of that police car
[00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:00.900]   waiting for my fate.
[00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:03.360]   Certainly it wasn't going to be good.
[00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:06.900]   And the girls whose house it was woke up.
[00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:10.420]   Police lights in her front yard, you know.
[00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:11.700]   Of course she woke up.
[00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:15.840]   And as guy after guy after guy who was,
[00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:17.940]   they were holding court essentially outside my door.
[00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:18.880]   He's guilty.
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:20.660]   He's guilty, that guy.
[00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:22.180]   That guy beat up a girl.
[00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:23.080]   He's guilty.
[00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:26.220]   She comes up.
[00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:27.060]   She goes, no, no.
[00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:30.100]   Hey guys, listen, policemen, come here.
[00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:31.500]   No, this is my house.
[00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:32.560]   I invited these men.
[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:34.900]   No, they were here.
[00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:35.740]   What?
[00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:36.560]   They hit, I know these guys.
[00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:37.460]   They hit a girl.
[00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:39.420]   Hey, they didn't hit you.
[00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:40.260]   Did they hit?
[00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:41.100]   They didn't hit you.
[00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:41.920]   That's what I thought.
[00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:42.920]   They didn't hit her, see.
[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:45.580]   What?
[00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:48.340]   Open the door.
[00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:49.580]   Unlock the cuffs.
[00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:51.680]   Told us to walk home.
[00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:54.940]   What?
[00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:55.760]   She steps up.
[00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:57.360]   I've never seen anything like it.
[00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:02.780]   The enemy's like, she had an abortion, God.
[00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:05.060]   Kill her.
[00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:07.940]   No, no.
[00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:09.580]   He's a pervert.
[00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:13.060]   Did you see what he did in his bathroom all by himself?
[00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:14.260]   He's a pervert.
[00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:15.100]   Kill him.
[00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:20.980]   Did you see them at Lake Louisville hitting the funnel?
[00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:25.180]   Did you see them on 8th Street?
[00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:28.300]   Did you see what they were doing?
[00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:29.380]   They said they loved you.
[00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:31.460]   Just kill them.
[00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:34.460]   No, because I killed him.
[00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:40.380]   Because I killed him instead of them.
[00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:41.220]   They're mine.
[00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:43.060]   They're mine.
[00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:48.340]   They belong to me and my kingdom forever.
[00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:49.740]   That's the beautiful gospel.
[00:15:49.740 --> 00:16:00.500]   Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?
[00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:02.300]   Verse 35.
[00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:04.660]   If God is the judge determining the outcome
[00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:07.820]   and Christ is giving testimony in your defense,
[00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:10.860]   not that you're good, but that he's paid for your wrong,
[00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:12.820]   he's paid for the wrong you've done,
[00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:16.780]   then if that is the case, shall trouble or hardship
[00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:21.780]   or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword,
[00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:27.420]   as it is written, for your sake we face death all day long.
[00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:30.300]   We are considered as sheep to be slaughtered.
[00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:34.220]   That comes from Psalm chapter 44, verse 22.
[00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:36.540]   And I believe that is in here
[00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:40.660]   because Paul is saying, this is not a new idea.
[00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:44.500]   People who have followed Jehovah have suffered
[00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:47.420]   in the Old Testament, BC, before Christ.
[00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:50.060]   They've suffered from the beginning.
[00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:51.020]   They've suffered.
[00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:53.220]   What's gonna separate us from the love of Christ?
[00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:56.900]   He's saying, Christian, every evil thing
[00:16:56.900 --> 00:17:00.260]   that could happen to you will happen to Christians.
[00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:02.820]   In this fallen world, it will happen.
[00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:07.820]   You trusting in Christ does not mean that you're protected
[00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:10.380]   from the evil that can happen to you.
[00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:12.260]   It means that you can overcome it.
[00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:15.820]   It means that you can rise above it.
[00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:20.540]   It means that you will be rewarded through it, for it,
[00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:24.100]   conformed to the image of Christ because of it.
[00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:30.620]   And so you say, we don't have clothes to wear.
[00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:31.980]   How can God be good?
[00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:34.020]   We're hungry.
[00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:36.340]   How can God be good?
[00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:39.900]   Christians are losing their heads.
[00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:42.580]   How can God be good?
[00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:46.180]   Or maybe you say, I'm still single.
[00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:48.700]   How can God be good?
[00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:51.020]   I don't make enough money.
[00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:51.980]   How can God be good?
[00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:53.220]   I can't pay rent.
[00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:55.340]   How can God be good?
[00:17:55.340 --> 00:18:01.420]   Verse 37, you win in Jesus, you win.
[00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:05.340]   No, in all these things,
[00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:09.300]   we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.
[00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:12.340]   No, in all of these sufferings, we are more than conquerors.
[00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:13.380]   It's like a made up word.
[00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:15.900]   It's like, Paul is not saying, hey, you're an endurer.
[00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:17.540]   In all these troubles, you're gonna endure.
[00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:18.380]   You're an endurer.
[00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:19.900]   He's not saying in all of these troubles,
[00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:21.300]   you'll overcome, you're a conqueror.
[00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:22.940]   He's saying, no, you're, I don't know,
[00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:24.500]   you're more than a conqueror.
[00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:27.540]   You'll have something greater than victory.
[00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:30.180]   Something I don't even have a word for.
[00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:32.140]   You're more than a conqueror.
[00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:34.860]   We win.
[00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:37.180]   Let me tell you something.
[00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:39.300]   Jesus promised you two things.
[00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:41.580]   It's John 16, verse 33.
[00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:44.940]   He says, in this world, you will have trouble.
[00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:46.180]   I'll read it from the beginning.
[00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:49.300]   It says this, I have told you these things
[00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:52.660]   so that in me, you may have peace.
[00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:57.140]   In this world, in Dallas, in Fort Worth, in Houston,
[00:18:57.140 --> 00:19:01.020]   and wherever you're at, you're going to have trouble.
[00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:04.420]   That's, I'm promising you, you're going to have trouble.
[00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:07.500]   But take heart, I've overcome the world.
[00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:10.180]   Here are the two promises.
[00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:13.540]   Promise one, you're going to have trouble.
[00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:17.420]   Promise two, you can trust him for peace.
[00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:18.740]   He says, have peace.
[00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:22.980]   Take heart, I've overcome the world.
[00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:26.140]   Okay, so here's the two promises.
[00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:28.580]   You're going to have trouble and you can trust him.
[00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:32.700]   Do not forsake the second promise because of the first.
[00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:35.580]   Do not get to the trouble and say, I can't trust God.
[00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:36.900]   No, when you get to the trouble, you say,
[00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:39.500]   oh, God told me I was going to have trouble.
[00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:40.700]   He promised me that.
[00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:42.340]   That means if I could trust that promise,
[00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:45.460]   that I could trust this promise, that I could trust him.
[00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:48.660]   Let the trouble serve as a reminder that you can trust him.
[00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:52.580]   Oh, I'm suffering.
[00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:55.180]   Oh, this world is broken, it's hard.
[00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:56.820]   I feel alone, I feel lonely.
[00:19:56.820 --> 00:20:01.220]   Oh, that's right, God, Jesus promised me that I would.
[00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:03.420]   He promised me that I would.
[00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:04.580]   And what was the other promise?
[00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:05.980]   Oh, he told me that I could have peace.
[00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:07.420]   He told me that I could trust him
[00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:08.820]   because he's overcome the world.
[00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:13.100]   What this means is he's already promised this future world
[00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:15.500]   that he's kind of building through his people.
[00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:17.300]   It's this weird, theologians call it,
[00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:19.700]   already, not yet theology.
[00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:23.060]   It's this crazy idea that we're in this world,
[00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:25.780]   this earth that will be completely new
[00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:27.460]   and renovated and perfected,
[00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:30.060]   and we will live in it forever and ever and ever and ever.
[00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:31.300]   And 100 years from now,
[00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:32.940]   it will not matter that you're single.
[00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:34.140]   100 years from now,
[00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:35.740]   it will not matter that you got laid off.
[00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:37.660]   100 years from now, it will not matter,
[00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:39.460]   dare I say it, that you have cancer.
[00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:42.540]   It won't matter.
[00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:48.220]   A billion years from now, it won't matter.
[00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:53.340]   For I am, verse 38, convinced
[00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:56.340]   that neither death nor life,
[00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:58.100]   neither angels nor demons,
[00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:01.620]   neither the present nor the future or any powers,
[00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:03.220]   neither height nor depth,
[00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:05.100]   nor anything else in all creation
[00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:07.180]   will be able to separate us from the love of God
[00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:09.820]   that is in Christ Jesus, our Lord.
[00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:12.220]   He's saying there is no state of being,
[00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:15.940]   no created being, no time, no power, no measurement,
[00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:18.860]   not anything in all of creation
[00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:24.420]   that ever was or that ever will be
[00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:26.980]   that will separate you from God's love for us
[00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:28.700]   that is secured by Jesus Christ.
[00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:30.260]   It cannot happen,
[00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:32.620]   and it leaves no room for the possibility.
[00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:35.780]   It is an impossibility for you to be separated
[00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:37.780]   by God's love for you.
[00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:39.180]   And so let's look at four truths
[00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:40.660]   from this passage for you tonight.
[00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:41.540]   We'll go quickly.
[00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:44.700]   Number one, there is no accusation brought against you
[00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:46.300]   that will prevail.
[00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:49.500]   This comes from verses 31 through 33.
[00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:52.500]   You will not be found guilty of any accusation
[00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:54.340]   that the enemy will bring against you,
[00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:56.620]   even those that you are guilty of.
[00:21:56.620 --> 00:22:03.180]   This guy's drunk in the back of this car, innocent.
[00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:06.740]   What?
[00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:09.900]   The enemy says you're guilty,
[00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:14.100]   and Jesus says, nope, I paid his sentence.
[00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:16.500]   The enemy says you had an abortion, you had sex,
[00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:18.300]   you're a pervert looking at porn,
[00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:20.340]   and it wasn't just normal porn.
[00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:21.740]   It was same-sex porn.
[00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:23.780]   He said, crazy things against you.
[00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:27.140]   You cut yourself, you're so gross.
[00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:32.220]   And Jesus says, no, man, they're not gross, they're mine.
[00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:34.980]   And they win, and you lose,
[00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:38.540]   and everything that is mine is theirs.
[00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:41.300]   It's like they're rewarded in me,
[00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:44.780]   and I take joy in forgiving them their sins no longer.
[00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:47.780]   The scripture says no longer holding their sins
[00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:48.620]   against them.
[00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:51.260]   It is for God's pleasure that he does it.
[00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:53.620]   They're not gross, you fool.
[00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:58.020]   They're mine, my children, praise him.
[00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:02.100]   At the foot of the cross, there is accusation,
[00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:05.300]   but at the empty tomb, there is none.
[00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:11.220]   The second truth from this sentence, or this passage,
[00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:14.460]   there is no condemnation sentenced to you
[00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:15.840]   that you will pay.
[00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:18.620]   This comes from verse 34.
[00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:21.540]   There is no condemnation sentenced to you
[00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:22.380]   that you will pay.
[00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:24.460]   You will not be punished or sentenced
[00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:26.900]   for any said accusation.
[00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:29.660]   The enemy says, give them to me, let them burn in hell
[00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:31.580]   like they deserve, and Jesus says, no.
[00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:34.620]   Remember when I paid an eternal punishment on the cross
[00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:36.000]   because I'm an eternal God.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.400]   I'm the only thing on the planet
[00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:40.540]   that can satisfy an eternal sentence.
[00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:41.900]   Because I'm an eternal God,
[00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:44.540]   in a moment it can be satisfied on the cross.
[00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:47.260]   I've paid for the hell that they deserve.
[00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:48.500]   They will not go there.
[00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:50.980]   It was satisfied on me.
[00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:54.700]   Because of his porn, because of his self-righteousness,
[00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:57.220]   because of her need for approval from men,
[00:23:57.220 --> 00:24:01.700]   because of her lack of trust and parents
[00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:04.240]   or authority or whatever, I paid for it.
[00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:09.320]   Here's the classic illustration, one I love is,
[00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:12.980]   it's like you stand before the judge, he's there,
[00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:15.020]   you're in the courtroom, you're front and center.
[00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:18.900]   The accusations have been piled on, you're found guilty.
[00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:23.340]   The judge in his robe stands up from the chair
[00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:28.340]   and hits the gavel, guilty, guilty.
[00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:33.000]   And then he steps down from the platform,
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.940]   from behind the podium.
[00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:37.420]   He walks to the ground, he takes his robe off,
[00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:38.720]   he puts it on you.
[00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:43.320]   And he says, I'll pay the sentence.
[00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:46.660]   I'll pay the punishment they deserve.
[00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:49.700]   And not only that, but my loved one,
[00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:53.180]   my dear, dear daughter, my dear son,
[00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:56.340]   you move into my place, you move into my estate,
[00:24:56.340 --> 00:24:59.320]   my mansion, my palace, where I live, it's yours.
[00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:01.920]   I'm gonna go to prison for you.
[00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:04.540]   This is the gospel.
[00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:11.260]   Third truth is there is no separation of you
[00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:15.100]   from God's love, comes from verses 35 through 36
[00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:16.640]   and 38 through 39.
[00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:22.180]   You will know what you've been missing,
[00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:25.380]   this void in your heart that you've been trying to fill
[00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:27.720]   with the approval of men, a boyfriend,
[00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:32.620]   significant others, a job, material things, a car,
[00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:35.380]   the obsessions that you have, shows, whatnot.
[00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:37.540]   That void that you've been trying to fill,
[00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:39.540]   you'll see it filled completely
[00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:42.700]   and why you were left wanting that it was only God,
[00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:44.940]   only Jesus who can fill that.
[00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:47.460]   And so you will know what you've been missing
[00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:51.480]   and you will not be missing anything all at one time.
[00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:53.780]   You will know what you've been missing
[00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:55.980]   and you will not be missing anything all in one time.
[00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:58.720]   The fullness of everything you ever wanted realized
[00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:00.760]   in God's presence.
[00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:04.620]   And it says that his love, it's following you.
[00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:06.420]   You can't be separated from it.
[00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:08.580]   It's following you like your shadow.
[00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:11.420]   You ever tried to outrun your shadow?
[00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:14.220]   No, no, it's following you like your shadow.
[00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:17.980]   And not only that, but it's in front of you like the horizon.
[00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:19.980]   Everywhere you go, it's behind you.
[00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:21.980]   Everywhere you go, it's in front of you.
[00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:24.040]   You turn here, it's there.
[00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:26.200]   You turn here, it's there.
[00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:29.020]   You turn here, it's there and there and there, right?
[00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:30.580]   It's all around you.
[00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:34.060]   You cannot get away from God's love.
[00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:35.260]   It won't happen.
[00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:38.060]   You cannot outrun the love of God.
[00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:41.860]   You cannot outrun the love of God.
[00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:43.900]   It's following you like a shadow.
[00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:46.700]   It's in front of you like the horizon.
[00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:49.080]   And the fourth truth from this text is this.
[00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:52.440]   God gives good to you without reservation.
[00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:55.900]   That's verse 32.
[00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:57.820]   God gives good to you without reservation.
[00:26:57.820 --> 00:26:58.940]   And I think this is the one
[00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:00.580]   you might struggle with the most.
[00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:06.980]   And I think we say, well, what good, JP?
[00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:09.620]   What good is he giving?
[00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:10.820]   It's not the good I want.
[00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:11.860]   I mean, this is the good I want.
[00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:12.860]   I don't have it.
[00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:15.380]   Why don't I have the good that I want?
[00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:17.020]   And here's what I would tell you as lovingly as I can.
[00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:18.680]   You don't know what you want.
[00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:20.820]   Like you don't want,
[00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:23.500]   what you want today is not what you wanted yesterday.
[00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:25.960]   It's not what you wanted last week or a year ago.
[00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:29.180]   You don't know, like who should determine what you want?
[00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:31.780]   God, the sovereign being creator of the heavens
[00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:34.660]   and the earth who is been eternity past
[00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:36.820]   and eternity future?
[00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:38.260]   Or you in a moment.
[00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:42.420]   I've heard it said, if we knew everything God does,
[00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:44.580]   then we would pray for what he gives.
[00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:47.140]   If we knew everything that God does,
[00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:49.280]   then we would pray for what he gives.
[00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:51.380]   The good that you want, it's always changed, man.
[00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:53.940]   Let me try to prove this to you.
[00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:56.780]   I've got three children, Presley, who is nine,
[00:27:56.780 --> 00:28:00.640]   Finley, who is seven, and Weston, who is three.
[00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:02.140]   I love them all.
[00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:03.060]   I sat with them this week.
[00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:05.140]   I asked them this question.
[00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:07.260]   I said, kiddos, come here.
[00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:09.740]   If God could give you anything,
[00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:11.980]   right now, if he would give you anything that you ask for,
[00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:13.700]   what would you ask him for?
[00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:16.660]   Presley, my oldest, spoke up.
[00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:19.220]   She said, I would ask him for enough food
[00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:20.980]   to feed everyone who was hungry.
[00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:24.380]   It's where you say, oh, oh, that's sweet.
[00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:28.500]   Oh, Presley, very benevolent, very kind, very caring.
[00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:32.260]   What a selfless ask of God, feed those who are hungry.
[00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:35.540]   Finley, what about you?
[00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:38.100]   Said, daddy, I would ask for wings so I could fly.
[00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:39.220]   (congregation laughing)
[00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:43.940]   Okay, all right, all right, good.
[00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:46.180]   Weston, what about you?
[00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:48.580]   I want a donut.
[00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:52.180]   (congregation laughing)
[00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:54.140]   Okay, got one.
[00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:57.980]   The spectrum is enough food to feed everyone and a donut.
[00:28:57.980 --> 00:28:59.980]   I mean, that's the end of the spectrum.
[00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:02.060]   These are the things that I want.
[00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:04.420]   And so he's just like, hey, I want a donut.
[00:29:04.420 --> 00:29:05.660]   And so I don't know what you would ask for.
[00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:08.900]   You might be, I want a spouse or a new job or health,
[00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:10.980]   and you're gonna get up there and you're gonna find out
[00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:14.780]   that thing that you wanted most, it was a donut.
[00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:16.860]   He wanted a donut.
[00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:19.060]   And you're like, no, no, no, JP, how can you say that?
[00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:20.180]   I'm like, yeah, of course, right?
[00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:21.740]   We always think that we've graduated
[00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:24.660]   to some higher learning, some higher level of education
[00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:26.740]   or understanding, and today is not the day
[00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:29.220]   we're asking for a donut, just like Weston thinks.
[00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:32.420]   No, it's not a donut.
[00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:35.260]   You're gonna get up there and be like, man, how?
[00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:39.060]   Today, today, it won't be on that day, today,
[00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:42.980]   how dare you that you kept me single?
[00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:45.540]   How dare you that you took that loved one?
[00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:49.620]   How dare you that I didn't get that job?
[00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:51.700]   You were tempted to doubt God's goodness,
[00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:52.540]   and you get up there and you're like,
[00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:54.140]   oh, I was asking you for a donut.
[00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:57.000]   I see that now.
[00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:00.940]   I was down there like saying,
[00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:03.740]   God, would you give me a glazed crispy cream?
[00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:06.100]   You know, it's like that's the reality of my,
[00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:07.820]   and it's insult, you're furious.
[00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:09.100]   Some of you are furious right now.
[00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:11.280]   How dare you have the audacity?
[00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:17.460]   For I know that all things work together
[00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:19.780]   for the good of those who love Him
[00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:21.680]   who have been called according to His purpose.
[00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:23.840]   It's not me who has the audacity.
[00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:27.720]   It's the God that created you that says,
[00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:29.980]   no, it may not look good, smell good,
[00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:32.460]   taste good, seem good, but wait for it,
[00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:35.180]   'cause it will produce good.
[00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:38.300]   There's not a single person at the cross
[00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:41.780]   that's like, you tell me,
[00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:44.020]   like 'cause I'm just, I'll be transparent with you.
[00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:45.700]   Like I'm following Jesus, Jesus,
[00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:46.780]   I'm betting the farm on you.
[00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:49.080]   Everybody says that I'm, everybody says that I'm crazy,
[00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:51.260]   but then there's something, you're doing something, okay.
[00:30:51.260 --> 00:30:53.200]   I'm going all in with Jesus.
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:56.860]   Next thing you know, Jesus is screaming on two sticks
[00:30:56.860 --> 00:30:58.940]   with nails in His hand, bloody.
[00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:00.160]   Everybody's laughing at Him,
[00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:02.400]   entertained by His gruesome death.
[00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:04.460]   And you're standing there and you're,
[00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:08.020]   I promise you more than any other time in creation,
[00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:11.320]   you're gonna be tempted to doubt the goodness of God.
[00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:12.500]   That ain't good.
[00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:15.340]   That's not good.
[00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:17.580]   I went all in with Him.
[00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:19.860]   There's no way that could be good.
[00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:20.980]   He's dead.
[00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:24.460]   Wait for it.
[00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:28.300]   Wait for it, man.
[00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:32.500]   I'm gonna show you something really amazing.
[00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:35.100]   Wait for it, trust me.
[00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:41.060]   In this world, you will have trouble and wait for it.
[00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:47.060]   So in summary, let me give this to you again.
[00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:51.240]   The love of God cuts through all accusations,
[00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:56.740]   condemnation, and separation
[00:31:56.740 --> 00:32:00.600]   to give you good without reservation.
[00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:05.700]   Every night, most nights, not tonight, I'm with you.
[00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:10.040]   Most nights I tuck my kids in, we say our prayers.
[00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:13.380]   I ask them two questions all the time.
[00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:16.280]   Multiple times a week, I ask them the same two questions.
[00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:18.420]   Same two questions.
[00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:25.220]   Here's what I ask them, Presley, Finley, Weston.
[00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:29.120]   What would make me stop loving you?
[00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:33.880]   And the only right answer is nothing.
[00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:38.560]   And they say nothing, they respond to nothing, Daddy.
[00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:42.000]   Sometimes they have fun with it,
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.200]   sometimes I have fun with it.
[00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:45.360]   They'll begin to ask rhetorical questions.
[00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:48.520]   Daddy, what if we run away from home?
[00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:52.380]   I'll find you, I won't stop loving you.
[00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:55.680]   What could make me stop loving you?
[00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:57.240]   Daddy, what if someone takes us?
[00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:59.740]   I'll go Liam Neeson on 'em, man, they'll find you.
[00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:00.880]   (congregation laughing)
[00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:02.160]   I will find you.
[00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:06.760]   Daddy, I mean, the other day, right,
[00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:07.960]   they're messing with me now, right?
[00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:10.220]   She's like, what if we worship Satan?
[00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:12.400]   Come on, man.
[00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:18.820]   I'm not gonna stop loving you, I'll be sad.
[00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:21.700]   I'm like, where did you learn that?
[00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:22.900]   Did your mama teach you that?
[00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:24.740]   (congregation laughing)
[00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:26.660]   I'm not gonna stop loving you.
[00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:29.720]   There's nothing that can make me stop loving you.
[00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:32.260]   And the second question is this,
[00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:34.620]   who loves you more than Daddy?
[00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:39.940]   To which they say God, to which I say, who else?
[00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:42.180]   And they say no one.
[00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:44.100]   Sometimes they say Jesus, 'cause we haven't got
[00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:46.420]   the Trinity thing down and we're working on that.
[00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:48.220]   I'm like, no, God is Jesus and the Holy Spirit,
[00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:49.860]   but we'll later, you know?
[00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:53.440]   But I say, who loves you more than Daddy?
[00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:55.820]   God.
[00:33:55.820 --> 00:33:59.620]   There's a daddy that says, there's nothing
[00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:02.400]   that's gonna make me stop loving you, I promise.
[00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:06.580]   There's nothing that's going to make me stop loving you.
[00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:09.820]   I promise you.
[00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:12.220]   And there is someone who loves you more than me.
[00:34:12.220 --> 00:34:14.020]   He's perfect.
[00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:15.740]   My love's so imperfect.
[00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:19.180]   It's got my emotions and weird insecurities wrapped up in it
[00:34:19.180 --> 00:34:24.180]   but this God, this being, this person loves you perfectly
[00:34:24.180 --> 00:34:28.300]   more than I do.
[00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:29.820]   And there's nothing in the world
[00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:31.460]   that's gonna separate you from that.
[00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:33.740]   That's what I want you to leave here with.
[00:34:33.740 --> 00:34:37.360]   I want you to leave here with the promises of God.
[00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:39.660]   So I'm gonna pray, my friends are gonna sing,
[00:34:39.660 --> 00:34:41.700]   come up and sing a song over us.
[00:34:41.700 --> 00:34:44.020]   You can listen to the words as you sit there
[00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:48.300]   and you'll have a chance to respond in just a moment.
[00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:50.180]   But I want you to listen carefully
[00:34:50.180 --> 00:34:53.620]   to the promises of God tonight.
[00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:55.460]   And so Father, thank you so much
[00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:59.840]   that your love for us is not conditional.
[00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:03.980]   God, we don't know unconditional love.
[00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:06.380]   Every love that we've experienced on this earth
[00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:09.300]   is some flavor of conditional love
[00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:12.220]   based on our performance or based on a covenant
[00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:14.580]   or based on us keeping something
[00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:16.560]   and yet you love us unconditionally,
[00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:18.620]   not because of what we can do for you
[00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:21.020]   but because of what you've done for us.
[00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:23.380]   Father, would you please help us know that,
[00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:26.180]   help me understand that for my friends
[00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:27.900]   who followed you for a while,
[00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:30.500]   would you awaken that truth and hope in their hearts?
[00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:32.700]   And for my friends that don't know you in the room
[00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:33.980]   or that are listening,
[00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:39.380]   Father, would you please penetrate their hardened hearts,
[00:35:39.380 --> 00:35:44.340]   crack them open and overwhelm them with this reality
[00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:47.380]   that they can't run fast enough
[00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:53.140]   or sin hard enough to get away from your love,
[00:35:53.140 --> 00:35:59.660]   that there is nothing that's going to separate us from it,
[00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:06.300]   not anything in all of creation,
[00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:10.580]   not anything that could come against us,
[00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:12.960]   not anything that could be done to us,
[00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:18.980]   that there is nothing that will separate us
[00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:21.300]   from your love, God.
[00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:24.460]   Would you help us believe that?
[00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:29.540]   As we sit here and as this song is sung over us,
[00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:33.060]   Father, would you remind us of these truths?
[00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:35.400]   We love you so much.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.580]   (gentle music)

[00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:48.120]   - For as high as the heavens are above the earth,
[00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:52.320]   so great is His love for those who fear Him.
[00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:54.800]   As far as the east is from the west,
[00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:58.240]   so far has He removed our transgressions from us.
[00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:03.040]   - God has said, "Never will I leave you.
[00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:05.520]   "Never will I forsake you."
[00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:09.860]   So we say with confidence, "The Lord is my helper.
[00:40:09.860 --> 00:40:12.280]   "I will not be afraid.
[00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:14.520]   "What can mere mortals do to me?"
[00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:18.640]   - The Lord is the everlasting God,
[00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:20.920]   the creator of all the earth.
[00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:23.680]   He never grows weak or weary.
[00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:26.760]   No one can measure the depths of His understanding.
[00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:31.000]   He has power to the weak and strength to the powerless.
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:35.560]   - Though the mountains be shaken,
[00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:37.080]   the hills be removed,
[00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:42.080]   yet my unfailing love for you will not be shaken,
[00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:45.040]   nor my covenant of peace be removed,
[00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:48.400]   says the Lord who has compassion on you.
[00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:53.060]   - There is therefore now no condemnation
[00:40:53.060 --> 00:40:56.200]   for those who are in Christ Jesus,
[00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:58.600]   for the law of the spirit of life
[00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:02.840]   has set you free in Christ from the law of sin and death.
[00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:08.360]   - For I am convinced that neither death nor life,
[00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:10.680]   neither angels nor demons,
[00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:13.840]   neither the present nor the future nor any powers,
[00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:17.400]   neither height nor depth nor anything else in all creation
[00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:20.960]   will be able to separate us from the love of God
[00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:23.520]   that is in Christ Jesus, our Lord.

[00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:19.240]   He's crazy about you, man.
[00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:22.800]   And daughter, sons,
[00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:27.800]   he is wildly in love, madly, crazy,
[00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:33.120]   truly, deeply, incredibly in love with you.
[00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:38.000]   And don't you dare,
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:41.960]   don't you dare insult the cross.
[00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:45.440]   Do not insult the death of Jesus Christ
[00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:47.560]   by thinking that you've sinned
[00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:50.360]   to some past degree that he can forgive.
[00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:53.360]   That would be ridiculous.
[00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:56.040]   And whenever you face the troubles in this world,
[00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:58.000]   you hold fast to the reality
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:59.840]   that Jesus looked you in the face
[00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:01.920]   through the word of God, by the spirit of God,
[00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:03.460]   and said, "That's gonna happen.
[00:44:03.460 --> 00:44:05.520]   "You can trust me.
[00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:08.320]   "I got you.
[00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:10.600]   "I'm doing something in you
[00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:13.060]   "that is better than you could ever imagine,
[00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:15.560]   "and you're going to be somewhere more beautiful
[00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:17.500]   "than you can fathom with me
[00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:20.000]   "in the presence of God in his fullness
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:23.380]   "forever and ever and ever and ever and ever,
[00:44:23.380 --> 00:44:26.940]   "and it's better than anything that you even know of

[00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:32.200]   That's the truth.
[00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:34.520]   It's been so fun to be with you
[00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:38.120]   moving through this single chapter
[00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:40.800]   in the Bible that is so rich with theology
[00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:43.080]   and truths about our God and creator,
[00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:45.940]   our savior and Lord, his Holy Spirit.
[00:44:45.940 --> 00:44:49.480]   And so tonight, hang out with us.
[00:44:49.480 --> 00:44:51.740]   We have ministry partners out there.
[00:44:51.740 --> 00:44:55.080]   You can go and talk through, interview,
[00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:58.080]   meet with other organizations that we partner with here
[00:44:58.080 --> 00:45:00.000]   as we sit on the porch and look out on our city
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.460]   and meet the needs of the city.
[00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:04.120]   If you're going through life alone
[00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:05.080]   and you're in this place where you're like,
[00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:06.820]   "Man, I just don't know any cool Christians, man.
[00:45:06.820 --> 00:45:09.600]   "I don't know anybody that I just even want
[00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:12.100]   "to hang out with that knows Jesus."
[00:45:12.100 --> 00:45:13.960]   If you're a guy, I'd strongly encourage you
[00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:17.120]   to walk down this hallway and into a room over there,
[00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:18.500]   and there'll be lots of other guys
[00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:20.380]   asking some of those same questions
[00:45:20.380 --> 00:45:22.160]   in this deal we call Open Community Group.
[00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:24.360]   If you're a girl, walk down this hallway
[00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:26.120]   and in a room over there,
[00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:27.880]   and there'll be lots of girls in that room
[00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:29.460]   asking those same sorts of questions.
[00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:32.160]   If you're looking for community or have questions about it,
[00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:33.360]   please check that out.
[00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:34.720]   Up here is gonna be a lot of folks
[00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:36.320]   with light bulbs on their shirts,
[00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:39.140]   basically ready to answer your questions,
[00:45:39.140 --> 00:45:41.760]   to pray with you, to wrestle with you out there.
[00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:43.080]   Is that what you're telling me?
[00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:44.240]   Everywhere, they're everywhere.
[00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:46.040]   Ali Wall says they're everywhere.
[00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:47.000]   She wants you to know.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:49.040]   Our people with light bulbs on their shirts.
[00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:50.840]   And so go up to them, ask them, say,
[00:45:50.840 --> 00:45:52.280]   "Hey, will you pray for me?"
[00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:53.160]   That's why they're here.
[00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:54.220]   You can just walk up and say,
[00:45:54.220 --> 00:45:56.220]   "Hey, I'd love to ask you this question.
[00:45:56.220 --> 00:45:57.960]   "I'd love for you to pray for me."
[00:45:57.960 --> 00:45:59.080]   And they would love to do that.
[00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:01.040]   I love you guys so much, I really do.
[00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:02.340]   I wanna change the world with you
[00:46:02.340 --> 00:46:03.960]   for the sake of Jesus Christ,
[00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:07.000]   for his glory, for his fame, for his namesake.
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:10.360]   And so, hey, Shane B wrote that song this week,
[00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:11.200]   we just sang, we were like,
[00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:12.080]   "Hey, will you write a song?"
[00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:13.400]   So let's thank him for that.
[00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:16.820]   [congregation applauding]
[00:46:16.820 --> 00:46:20.400]   It's a gift.
[00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:22.960]   It's a gift to the church, these guys and their voices,
[00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:24.480]   and just the way they lead us in worship.
[00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:26.200]   And so thank you guys.
[00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:28.160]   Go in peace to love and serve the Lord.
