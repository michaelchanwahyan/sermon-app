[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:24.960]   All right, what's up everybody?
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.160]   Welcome everybody in the room.
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.440]   >> [APPLAUSE] >> Everybody tuning in online, and
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.520]   I wanna give a special welcome to a handful of the Porch Live locations.
[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.840]   Welcome all of you, but Des Moines, Iowa, Northwest Houston, a newer location,
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.600]   Southwest Minnesota, Tulsa, Northwest Arkansas, Scottsdale, Phoenix, Arizona.
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.440]   All the Porch Live locations, everybody tuning in.
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.720]   We are continuing this series about anxiety and mental health.
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.520]   And let me start by asking a simple question.
[00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.840]   What is the greatest movie of all time?
[00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.120]   >> [APPLAUSE]
[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.640]   >> Nacho Libre, wow, wow.
[00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:04.920]   >> [APPLAUSE]
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.920]   >> That's a hot take, man,
[00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:08.760]   Nacho Libre.
[00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.960]   I think that the greatest movie of all time is Remember the Titans.
[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.800]   >> [APPLAUSE]
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.400]   >> If you have not watched that movie,
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.320]   we're actually gonna watch it for the rest of the night right now.
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.400]   >> [APPLAUSE]
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.720]   >> I also think that the best genre, and
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.480]   this is where I'm going, the best genre of movies, in my opinion, is feel good
[00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.840]   movies, movies that have a happy ending.
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.640]   The worst genre of movies, well, let me start,
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.920]   the second worst genre of movies is the suspense horror movies.
[00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.960]   In my opinion, I think there's something wrong with you.
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.080]   I don't know, I don't know what you're doing.
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.840]   I know, I know, I know, I know there's like a following of that.
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.240]   And even below that, I would say the worst genre of movies
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:09.600]   is the dramatic tragedy movies, movies that end with just sadness,
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.600]   that leave you feeling like why did I just pay $14 for
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.960]   a ticket and $18 for popcorn to leave here feeling so sad?
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:26.640]   Perhaps the most real experience I had of this was when on vacation with my wife,
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.400]   this is a handful of years ago, we were down in Galveston, Texas.
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.160]   It was in the summer, and the beaches in Galveston are not the greatest beaches in
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.480]   the world, and so we decided we're gonna go see a movie.
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.920]   Go see a movie, my wife said this movie that she wanted to see,
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.040]   she buys two tickets, we go to the theater, go sit down.
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.480]   And here was the movie that we began to see.
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.000]   I didn't know anything about it, it was called The Fault in Our Stars.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.400]   >> [APPLAUSE]
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.900]   >> Wow.
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.800]   I am about to really offend some of you.
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.000]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.560]   >> I don't know anything about the movie,
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.040]   so I go on, I'm sitting there, I'm eating the popcorn, and like I said,
[00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.920]   I like feel good movies, so I'm like, this is gonna be great.
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.360]   If you don't know this movie, it is the most tragic movie of all time.
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:11.520]   It's two cancer patients who fall in love, and
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:17.360]   I'm sitting there watching the movie, where is this going right now?
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.600]   So I pull out my phone, I pull up Wikipedia, I just read ahead on the plot.
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:21.760]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.960]   >> And discover that the movie that I was
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.600]   hoping would be a feel good, like, it's bad now, but it's gonna be great,
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:28.640]   and everything's gonna be great.
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:29.840]   No, it gets worse.
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.880]   The guy dies at the end, they fall in love, it's just a tragic thing the whole time.
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.280]   So I'm reading ahead, and I literally get up in the movie,
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.760]   my wife is sitting there, she loves it.
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.800]   I get up in the movie, and I just walk out, just say I gotta go to the bathroom, and
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.480]   I just stay out the rest of the time.
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:45.120]   I don't even tell her.
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.520]   I went and sat in the car, because I was like, I'm not watching a tragic movie
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.880]   about two people who are young, and they fall in love, and then tragically,
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.840]   one of them dies, and they both had this cancer.
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.080]   That is just, life is sad enough.
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.000]   I don't need anything else to make me more sad.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.400]   And I literally just sat, I didn't even tell her.
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.840]   I just sat in the car, waited for it to get done, frustrated that we had just
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.040]   bought tickets to this incredibly sad, tragic movie.
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.960]   It was just so depressing.
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.960]   Now what does that have to do with what we're going to talk about tonight?
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:21.560]   Well, that's an example of a moment where those feelings of sadness, and grief,
[00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:27.000]   and depression, and not wanting to feel that way, and that happens in life.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.360]   And it's not just as a result of a movie, it's a result of living in this world.
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.680]   It happens in regards to something that we call depression.
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.800]   But unlike in that scenario where there's depressing thoughts, and hey,
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.080]   I can walk out of the theater, there's going to be depressing seasons,
[00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.400]   or seasons of depression.
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.800]   And what do you do when you can't walk out of the theater of life?
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.680]   How do you cope, and what does God call us to do to deal with, and
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.160]   to fight against, the issue of depression?
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:05:00.480]   Now, depression is an issue that the Bible says is related to anxiety, and
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.520]   that they often go hand in hand together.
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:07.040]   In fact, there's a verse in Proverbs chapter 12, verse 25,
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:12.840]   that says, anxiety in the heart of man causes depression.
[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:17.800]   And one of the sources and causes of depression is prolonged anxiety.
[00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:23.520]   Anxiety, or excuse me, depression is one of those feelings, and
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.560]   coming out of COVID, the spikes and the levels of people who have just walked
[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.040]   through, and circumstantially, they've gone through things that have just created
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.520]   a deep sadness.
[00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:37.480]   And what do you do in those moments when there isn't an ability to just leave
[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:37.960]   the theater?
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.520]   And that's what I want to talk about for the next handful of minutes,
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.440]   because this is an increasingly common issue.
[00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:45.680]   By depression, let me define it.
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:50.080]   According to Oxford Dictionary, we'll get at some of the Bible's examples of it.
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.240]   It's called severe despondency or dejection.
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.800]   Typically felt over a period of time and
[00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:01.360]   accompanied by feelings of hopelessness and inadequacy.
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.160]   That it is an extended season of grief.
[00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.520]   It's when sorrow is not just something that you experience in a phase,
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.000]   it becomes almost a way of life.
[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.320]   And so how do you cope with it?
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:16.960]   And tragically, this is an issue the church hasn't talked a lot about.
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:21.320]   And Christians have not always and don't often open up and share about it.
[00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:24.560]   It's unusual to even hear somebody sharing about their depression.
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:28.360]   My son, I've shared this before, when he was like four, he learned the song
[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.600]   Waymaker, and at the end of the live version of Waymaker, which is the,
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.400]   Waymaker, miracle worker.
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:36.560]   At the end of the live version, the singer goes into how,
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.800]   your name is above depression.
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.400]   And as a four year old, he would listen the entire way through, and
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.920]   he would go out just in public and he would sing that song and
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:48.360]   around total strangers go into, your name is above depression.
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:54.680]   It was like, and it's unusual to hear a four year old, but
[00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:58.520]   it's also sadly unusual to hear a 40 year old.
[00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.120]   We just don't talk about it.
[00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:03.040]   And it's an issue that is plaguing a lot of our lives.
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:07.040]   Studies have shown that in the past ten years, the cases of depression,
[00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:10.720]   anxiety and suicide attempts have increased,
[00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:13.640]   doubling in the past ten years.
[00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:16.360]   And then you add COVID on top of all of that, and
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:21.160]   there's epidemic levels of people experiencing depression, deep sadness.
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.720]   And if that's where you are tonight, I think God has words and
[00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:26.480]   truths to meet you where you are, and
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.520]   to help you not just have an immediate fix for it.
[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:34.440]   Though I wish that was the case, but a framework for how to battle it.
[00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:39.520]   Americans, as it relates to anxiety and depression,
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:44.720]   take three times more antidepressants than the rest of the world combined.
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:48.880]   The leading cause of suicide in America is depression.
[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:54.280]   There are more suicides than homicides in America.
[00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:59.440]   You are more likely to die at your own hands because of depression
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:00.120]   than to be murdered.
[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:02.960]   It's a really tragic thing.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.120]   And it's a heavy topic.
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:08.280]   And I think that's one of the reasons why we don't often talk about it, but
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:10.720]   it's also really important and really relevant topic.
[00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:16.520]   Because statistically, either you are in a season of depression or
[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:17.800]   someone around you is.
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:21.640]   And so what do you do when you can't leave the theater?
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:26.440]   We're gonna talk about battling depression for the next handful of moments.
[00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:29.080]   Specifically, what's true about your depression.
[00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:34.040]   And then I wanna walk into how we fight against depression.
[00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:35.280]   So what is true about your depression?
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:37.680]   Number one, it's real.
[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:41.040]   The idea that depression is not something that actually can happen to somebody or
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:43.640]   they can't get in a state where they just prayed more or
[00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:47.600]   they just had a little bit more faith it would go away, it's not true.
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:50.280]   Someone can be in a state of depression that is real.
[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:53.840]   Biblically, there are examples of man after man after man and
[00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:59.000]   person who experienced what we would classify as an extended state of grief.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.880]   Sorrow, being overwhelmed by depression.
[00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:03.080]   What do I mean by that?
[00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:05.080]   The oldest book in the Bible is a book named Job.
[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:06.880]   Job was a guy who had everything.
[00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:09.400]   He had the business, had the family, had the house.
[00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:11.440]   And in a moment, it all got taken away from him.
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:14.760]   And here's how he describes after that happened.
[00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:17.160]   After all of his children were killed,
[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:20.000]   after foreigners basically destroyed his business.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.920]   He said, depression haunts my days.
[00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:27.800]   At night, my bones are filled with pain which gnaw at me relentlessly.
[00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:30.400]   With a strong hand, God grabs my shirt.
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:33.680]   He's describing what he feels.
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:37.320]   He grips me by the collar, my coat, he's thrown me into the mud.
[00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:38.800]   I'm nothing more than dust and ashes.
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.800]   I cry to you, God, but you don't answer.
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:43.480]   I stand before you, but you don't even look.
[00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:46.320]   It's incredibly honest.
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:52.560]   As he just displays and describes, this is how I feel right now.
[00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:59.600]   Elijah, Elijah's another guy that saw God move in incredible ways.
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:03.040]   And yet also found himself towards the end of his life
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:07.120]   wrestling with what would be described as suicidal thoughts
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:09.680]   or depressing feelings.
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:12.360]   Where he says this in 1 Kings 19, verse 4.
[00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:14.240]   I have had enough, Lord.
[00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:18.720]   Take my life, for I'm no better than my ancestors
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:20.760]   who have already died.
[00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:26.800]   Jonah, in the book of Jonah, talks about his battle with depression.
[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:29.240]   King David, King David, a man after God's own heart,
[00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:30.840]   wrote so many of the Psalms.
[00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:33.280]   Over 40 of the Psalms that we have, there's only 150,
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:35.560]   which is about a third of them, are laments.
[00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:37.320]   Lament is a song of sadness.
[00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:40.120]   These would have been worship songs that he sang
[00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:41.800]   that many of which King David wrote.
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:45.880]   And here's one example of David pouring his heart out and saying,
[00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:46.880]   this is how I feel.
[00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:47.840]   Where are you, God?
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:49.480]   I feel all alone.
[00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:51.360]   In Psalm chapter 6, verse 5 and 7, he says,
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.600]   I am worn out from sobbing.
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:57.240]   All night I flood my bed with weeping,
[00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:58.840]   drenching it with my tears.
[00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:03.560]   My vision is blurred because of grief.
[00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:05.800]   I can't even see straight.
[00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:08.280]   I've cried so much that my eyes are blurred.
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:14.200]   Maybe the most dark,
[00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:18.680]   powerful depiction of depression
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:20.240]   comes from Psalm 88,
[00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:23.040]   where the author writes this,
[00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:26.600]   I am forgotten and cut off from your care, God.
[00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:29.240]   You have thrown me into the lowest pit,
[00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:30.200]   into the darkest depths.
[00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:31.560]   Your anger weighs me down.
[00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:34.280]   With wave after wave, you have engulfed me.
[00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:38.080]   And then it ends with some of the darkest words,
[00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:40.280]   I think, in the entire Old Testament.
[00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:44.240]   Darkness is my closest friend.
[00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:47.720]   I mean, he's like a Simon and Garfunkel,
[00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:49.000]   hello darkness, my old friend,
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.320]   way before that ever happened.
[00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:53.800]   And he says, this is what I feel like.
[00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:56.440]   And over and over throughout the New and Old Testament,
[00:11:56.440 --> 00:12:00.400]   there's people describing what today would be classified
[00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:03.160]   as man, I just feel so down.
[00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:06.880]   Jeremiah, as a final one, says this.
[00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:09.400]   Jeremiah is one of the saddest books in the whole Bible,
[00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:10.480]   is a book called Lamentations.
[00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.520]   And it's just lament or sorrow after sorrow.
[00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:14.760]   It's what the book, Lamentations just means laments
[00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:17.600]   or sorrows that he depicts.
[00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:20.080]   And in it, he says, I have cried,
[00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:21.840]   Lamentations chapter two, verse 10.
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:27.040]   I have cried until the tears no longer come.
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:28.320]   My heart is broken.
[00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:31.120]   I wanna ask you a question.
[00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:35.980]   Why do you think God preserved these?
[00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:39.760]   Why would God have man after man after man,
[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:40.960]   those are just some of the examples
[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.880]   we could keep going of person after person
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:47.760]   who describes in raw, real, honest, emotional ways.
[00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:49.280]   God, where are you?
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:53.000]   Because I'm crying and I don't even have
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.440]   enough tears left to cry.
[00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:58.720]   Could one of the reasons be that he wants you to know
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:00.800]   if you've ever experienced the pain and sorrow
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:02.780]   of a broken world, you are not alone.
[00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:06.600]   Isaiah chapter 53 describes Jesus
[00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:11.380]   in a way that I know is not the way that I run
[00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:15.020]   to think of him, it says he was a man of sorrows,
[00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:17.760]   deeply acquainted with grief.
[00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:21.560]   And if you're in that place where it feels like darkness
[00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:26.560]   is your closest friend, you're not alone,
[00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:30.280]   God is not far, there is still hope
[00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:33.040]   and we're gonna walk through why that is the case
[00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:36.780]   but you're also in good company
[00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:40.320]   because many of the Christian men and women
[00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:41.980]   in the Bible, even outside of the Bible,
[00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:46.400]   Mother Teresa, Charles Spurgeon, which is a pastor,
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:49.040]   over and over men who battled deep depression
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:52.320]   and yet found hope as they walked through that.
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:55.600]   This world is so broken, I mean, eventually
[00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:59.280]   you just get kicked and you see how messed up
[00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:02.400]   and hurting and hard it is and God is good
[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:04.440]   and there's hope and we can have joy
[00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:07.540]   in whatever we face because of Christ.
[00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:10.680]   But it's also a really tragically sad world.
[00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:12.640]   This is a picture of my grandfather.
[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:16.700]   He is, if God doesn't do something,
[00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:20.400]   soon going to see Jesus face to face.
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:25.960]   And he's 93 years old and he's been married
[00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:29.160]   to his wife, my grandmother, for 66 years
[00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:34.040]   and he's losing his mind and as often happens
[00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:39.040]   whenever you are on your way and passing away,
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:43.060]   your mind can go and that's a full life.
[00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:44.980]   I mean, he's a follower of Jesus,
[00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:47.740]   he's been married 66 years, he's 93 years old.
[00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:49.640]   I think a lot of us would go like, man, that's amazing,
[00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:52.700]   that's incredible and as incredible as it is,
[00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:55.260]   it also will end in a very tragic, heartbreaking,
[00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.300]   sad scenario where he will leave behind someone
[00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:59.420]   he's been with seven decades.
[00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:03.220]   Life is so tragic.
[00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:05.100]   Our world, the scriptures say in Romans chapter eight,
[00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:07.620]   it groans with the pain of childbirth
[00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:09.180]   and I didn't come in here, my heart is not
[00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:10.780]   to make you feel any sadder or make any of that,
[00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:13.120]   I'm just saying if you look at the world
[00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:15.380]   and the brokenness of it and feel sorrow,
[00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:19.820]   it's not because you're broken, it's because it's broken
[00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:22.240]   and because you've been made in the image of God
[00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:24.620]   and you can look and you can grieve
[00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:26.620]   and say this is not how it was supposed to be
[00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:31.180]   and God agrees, which is why Jesus came
[00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:35.460]   and why we have hope because one day,
[00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:38.340]   all that is wrong will be made right and put back together.
[00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:40.740]   So first idea, what's true about your depression?
[00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:42.420]   It is real.
[00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:47.420]   The second idea is that it has a cause.
[00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:50.740]   There is something that causes your depression.
[00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:53.300]   There is something behind it that is causing it
[00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:56.220]   and it could be biological, it could be physiological,
[00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:57.700]   it could be a hormonal deficiency,
[00:15:57.700 --> 00:15:59.260]   there could be something there
[00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:03.480]   but it also could be something spiritual
[00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:07.600]   or something physical as in like some way of operating
[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:09.480]   that is causing it, it could be hidden sin,
[00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:10.760]   there's a number of different cases.
[00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:12.680]   In Psalm 42, David, the psalmist says,
[00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:15.560]   "Why are you so down, oh my soul?
[00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:18.240]   "Why are you so disturbed within me?
[00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:19.780]   "Put your hope in God.
[00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:21.360]   "Why am I depressed?"
[00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:23.240]   Is what David just said.
[00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:25.320]   This is the question if you're walking through depression
[00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:27.360]   that you have got to seek an answer.
[00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:30.080]   Seek with other Christians in your life an answer to,
[00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:31.900]   seek with other people in your life an answer to,
[00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:34.040]   why am I depressed?
[00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:35.220]   There could be a number of reasons.
[00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:37.660]   As I mentioned already, prolonged anxiety
[00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:41.700]   which is what Solomon 3,000 years ago brilliantly wrote.
[00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:44.040]   Anxiety, Proverbs chapter 12,
[00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:45.680]   "In the heart of a man causes depression
[00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:48.260]   "but a good word makes him glad."
[00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:51.620]   Solomon knew what today people are figuring out
[00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:54.680]   which is anxiety and depression can go hand in hand
[00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:55.980]   and often even go together
[00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:58.180]   and prolonged anxiety can cause depression
[00:16:58.180 --> 00:17:00.740]   which is why if you ever see a psychiatrist
[00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:02.940]   or you saw a psychiatrist or someone in your life,
[00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:06.360]   you know that they often will medicate anxiety disorders
[00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:08.940]   and depressive disorders with the same pill.
[00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:11.660]   You're anxious, take this antidepressant.
[00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:14.460]   You're depressed, take this antidepressant.
[00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:16.160]   Solomon knew that years and years ago
[00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:18.100]   that prolonged anxiety,
[00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:20.960]   if you don't deal with the anxiety and the roots behind it,
[00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:23.760]   it can create depression in this life.
[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:25.460]   Like I said, it could be something biological,
[00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:27.180]   physiological.
[00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:29.420]   It could also be fueled by circumstances.
[00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:32.660]   That somebody you know and love died.
[00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:36.180]   That the person you thought you were gonna marry,
[00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:39.300]   be your wife or be your husband, you guys broke up.
[00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:42.320]   You got diagnosed with an autoimmune disease.
[00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:44.100]   You lost your job.
[00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:46.100]   It could just be disappointment that happens
[00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:48.060]   and often it's not even just one,
[00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:49.980]   it's like 85 things happened at once
[00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:51.880]   and you just feel so overwhelmed.
[00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:55.500]   I don't know that I've ever dealt with
[00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:58.820]   or battled or exactly experienced all the depression
[00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:00.140]   and so I won't pretend to understand
[00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:01.540]   and fully be able to empathize.
[00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:03.100]   I do know that God understands it
[00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:05.540]   more than any person you have ever met
[00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:07.260]   and he understands your heart and your mind
[00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:10.420]   and he understands you and he loves you.
[00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:16.660]   In 2018, one of my closest friends left.
[00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:18.580]   JP teaches here all the time,
[00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:20.660]   may even be back at some point soon.
[00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:22.820]   Went to go lead a church in Waco
[00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:24.420]   and I was so caught off guard.
[00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:26.980]   I mean, we did it for like 10 years
[00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:28.660]   doing ministry and teaching together
[00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:30.620]   and I remember and God just stirred his heart
[00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:33.820]   and brought him away and I just remember feeling
[00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:37.220]   the closest I've ever experienced to depression,
[00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:42.220]   of going, man, I thought we were gonna do this for life.
[00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:48.460]   What are you doing, God?
[00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:51.820]   And then Garrett, who also has been here recently,
[00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:53.940]   he at the same year left and it was like,
[00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:56.100]   man, everything and all the different thoughts
[00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:58.300]   and plans and hopes that I had.
[00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:03.340]   And I know that pales in comparison
[00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:04.580]   to what a lot of you guys are experiencing
[00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:07.100]   and the loss that a lot of you have experienced.
[00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:07.940]   But whatever the range
[00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:11.460]   and whatever your experience with it, there's a cause.
[00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:14.780]   And the emotions you feel today
[00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:16.940]   will not be the emotions you feel tomorrow.
[00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:21.500]   And God wants to meet you in the midst of the pain.
[00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:23.900]   The Psalms say he is close to the brokenhearted.
[00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:28.100]   It may not be any of those circumstances.
[00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:31.940]   It could be depression is a result of unconfessed sin,
[00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:34.380]   that you are addicted to pornography,
[00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:35.940]   you're sleeping with your boyfriend or your girlfriend
[00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:38.620]   and that is God's conviction on your life.
[00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:40.660]   David in Psalm 32 says this,
[00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:45.020]   "When I refused to confess my sin, my body wasted away.
[00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:46.940]   "And I groaned all day long, day and night,
[00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:49.780]   "your hand of discipline was heavy on me."
[00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:51.820]   Am I saying that depression
[00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:53.540]   is always a result of unconfessed sin?
[00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:56.340]   No, but it could be.
[00:19:56.340 --> 00:20:01.260]   Another cause behind it could just be struggles
[00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:04.380]   that come with living in this world.
[00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:05.260]   What do I mean by struggles?
[00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:07.140]   I mean, things that are not exactly sin,
[00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:09.060]   but they also are not exactly ideal.
[00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:11.380]   Example, perfectionism.
[00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:13.260]   Any perfectionists in the room?
[00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:14.100]   Raise your hand.
[00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:16.120]   There we go, five of you.
[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:17.620]   The perfectionists in the room,
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:21.620]   you live constantly thinking everything could be better
[00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:23.460]   and you hold standards for other people
[00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:25.700]   and constantly find yourself being critical and cynical
[00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:26.780]   and it's hard not to.
[00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:28.460]   And candidly, the hardest person you are,
[00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:30.900]   the person you're hardest on is yourself.
[00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:33.340]   And the Bible says that perfectionism is a bad philosophy
[00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:35.380]   and bad style or bad way to live
[00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:36.860]   because you live in a broken world
[00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:39.860]   and you have a broken heart or a broken sin nature.
[00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:41.620]   That according to Romans chapter three,
[00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:45.020]   everyone has sinned and everyone falls short
[00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:49.140]   of the standard that God requires,
[00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:51.720]   meaning nobody's perfect, including you.
[00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:55.300]   The average person, a study concluded
[00:20:55.300 --> 00:21:00.300]   that the average person makes 35,000 decisions a day.
[00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:03.700]   You don't think you're gonna get one of those wrong?
[00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:04.660]   Of course you are.
[00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:07.100]   But if you and I live in this state
[00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:08.740]   of everything could be better and I could be better
[00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:10.180]   and I could be better, it can be depressing
[00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:11.180]   because it won't.
[00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:15.020]   Another common cause as it relates to struggle,
[00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:17.860]   I think is just the self-focused culture
[00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:20.500]   that we all live in, are probably all unaware
[00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:22.660]   of how selfie focused we are.
[00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:24.580]   We're the selfie generation.
[00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:25.660]   And the world around me that tells you,
[00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:28.220]   you focus on you, you do you, you speak your truth,
[00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:29.840]   not the truth, you speak your truth,
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:31.580]   you do what you think is best.
[00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:36.820]   And that self-focus of how great I am, how awesome I am,
[00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:41.380]   or same cause but a different style of it
[00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:46.380]   is how terrible I am, how loath I feel towards myself.
[00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:49.580]   And self-love and self-love are both the same problem
[00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:50.860]   'cause they're focused on self
[00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:54.060]   and you were not created to focus on self.
[00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:57.060]   Life focused on you is not how life was created to be lived.
[00:21:57.060 --> 00:22:01.300]   And it will compound and create depression.
[00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:05.140]   The Bible says in Philippians chapter two,
[00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:07.260]   you and I are not to operate out of self-focus
[00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:09.180]   but rather out of others focused.
[00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:10.860]   And it uses an antidote of humility.
[00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:14.140]   It says, do nothing out of selfish ambition or vanquishy.
[00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:17.700]   Rather in humility, value others above yourselves,
[00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:20.060]   not looking to your own interests
[00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:22.700]   but each of you to the interests of other people.
[00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:27.140]   That humility is not thinking bad about yourself,
[00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:29.140]   man, I'm terrible, man, I'm horrible.
[00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:33.620]   It's not thinking about yourself and thinking about others.
[00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:35.420]   And when you do, you experience life.
[00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:37.420]   It's like you weren't made to focus
[00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:39.580]   and be consumed about me and about me.
[00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:42.420]   And when you do and when I do, it can lead to depression.
[00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:46.340]   I don't know what it is, but there's something,
[00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:48.860]   there's a root behind all depression.
[00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:49.980]   There's something that's causing it.
[00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:51.180]   And like David in Psalm 42,
[00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:54.580]   you gotta ask, why am I so discouraged?
[00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:56.140]   You may need to invite others in.
[00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:57.980]   In fact, you should invite others in,
[00:22:57.980 --> 00:23:00.940]   especially if you find yourself unable
[00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:02.140]   to answer that question.
[00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:04.780]   In my backyard, there's a tree
[00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:07.060]   that we wanted to have cut down
[00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:08.620]   because it was just kind of an inconvenient,
[00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:11.980]   like totally ugly, get out of the way, this large plant.
[00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:14.660]   And so I had tree cutters,
[00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:17.140]   whatever those are called, arborists, they came out.
[00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:19.140]   And I asked, hey, what would it cost to cut down the tree?
[00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:20.540]   And he was like, it'll be 200 bucks.
[00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:22.780]   But if you want the stump and all the roots removed,
[00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:24.060]   it'll be an extra 500 bucks
[00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:26.020]   'cause I have to go get a stump grinder
[00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:27.460]   and bring it back and remove it.
[00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:29.220]   And I was like, man, I'm gonna go for that 200.
[00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:30.140]   That sounds great to me.
[00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:33.260]   And I'll take an ax out to that stump or do something.
[00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:35.540]   And I'm sure that'll be enough to put it back in its place
[00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:36.980]   and keep it in the ground.
[00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:37.820]   Definitely was not.
[00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:40.020]   And so six months later, the tree full grown
[00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:41.340]   all the way back to the size it was
[00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:44.100]   when the guy came out and cut it down.
[00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:44.940]   Why?
[00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:49.280]   Because I hadn't dealt with the roots.
[00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:51.980]   And when you don't deal with the roots of something,
[00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:53.420]   it doesn't go away.
[00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:56.740]   It may look a little minimized
[00:23:56.740 --> 00:23:59.820]   or it may be able to pass
[00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:05.140]   and not be noticed by everybody, but it's not going away.
[00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:06.340]   And it's gonna keep coming back.
[00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:09.020]   And in order for you to address the anxiety
[00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:10.780]   or to address the depression,
[00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:12.700]   you have got to deal with the roots.
[00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:17.020]   There is a reason and a cause behind your depression.
[00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:19.900]   And so how do we fight depression?
[00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:21.740]   It's the final idea I wanna talk about.
[00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:26.340]   Again, this is not a one-stop shop fix-all.
[00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:30.140]   This is a framework that maybe you've never heard taught
[00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:31.320]   from the Bible before.
[00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:36.500]   The first part of us fighting it is understanding
[00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:41.100]   that you are what would be called an integrated person.
[00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:42.620]   Here's what I mean by that.
[00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:43.780]   You can throw any label you want.
[00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:46.060]   It just means that what you do physically
[00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:49.500]   impacts you emotionally.
[00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:52.020]   What you do physically can have an impact
[00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:55.220]   on your soul or spiritually.
[00:24:55.220 --> 00:24:57.080]   That all of these things are connected together.
[00:24:57.080 --> 00:25:00.180]   And so anytime we battle anxiety or we battle depression,
[00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:03.140]   it involves attacking them on different fronts.
[00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:05.660]   It involves addressing them on different fronts.
[00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:06.860]   So addressing them physically,
[00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:07.980]   addressing them emotionally,
[00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:09.500]   addressing them spiritually.
[00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:11.540]   God cares about all of those things
[00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:14.180]   in a way that far too few of us understand
[00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:18.500]   that God actually cares about your body.
[00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:19.340]   It's the only body you have.
[00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:20.980]   In fact, it says it's his, it's on loan.
[00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:24.140]   And you and I are called to steward it in this life.
[00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:25.620]   And one of the ways that we fight depression
[00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:28.140]   is by fighting it physically.
[00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:30.620]   What do I mean by what you do and how you live
[00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:33.340]   can affect your soul experience of peace?
[00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:36.020]   Like, let me use a hypothetical illustration or example.
[00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:39.060]   Let's say tonight after the porch gets done, you go home.
[00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:42.060]   You stay up till 2 a.m. in the morning watching squid games.
[00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:44.340]   And you're wired, you can barely, you know,
[00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:45.220]   can't fall asleep.
[00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:46.260]   Eventually you fall asleep.
[00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:48.160]   You wake up, you miss your alarm tomorrow.
[00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:49.740]   It's 8.30, you're late for work.
[00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:51.840]   You rush to the car, you stop by Starbucks,
[00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:55.060]   you eat some latte and sugar and carbs,
[00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:56.900]   and you drive in bumper to bumper traffic,
[00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:59.140]   panicked about the fact that you're late for a meeting.
[00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:01.540]   You run into your meeting, you sit there,
[00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:04.340]   and you're still exhausted from the night before.
[00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:05.260]   And so after the meeting,
[00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:07.460]   you go to the office vending machine,
[00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:09.700]   you buy a Celsius, you buy whatever energy drink
[00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:11.660]   that you have there, and then you sit down
[00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:13.940]   and you wonder, why am I so stressed?
[00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:21.980]   Well, I don't think it takes a genius to figure out.
[00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:25.100]   And I'm not saying that is one size
[00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:26.220]   and applicable to everyone in this room.
[00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:29.180]   I'm just saying what you do and how we operate in life
[00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:32.780]   impacts us, that God cares about how you sleep.
[00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:35.040]   You may have never heard this before,
[00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:40.040]   but Psalm 127 says, "God, it is vain that you rise early,
[00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:42.660]   "and if you stay up late toiling for food to eat,
[00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:45.620]   "He grants sleep to those He loves,
[00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:49.980]   "or He gives to His beloved even in their sleep."
[00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:53.300]   What's another way physically that we address this?
[00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:57.160]   God created us to move, created us to be outside.
[00:26:57.160 --> 00:26:59.900]   Man was placed in a garden to work.
[00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:02.980]   You know, studies are even finding that exercise,
[00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:05.260]   there was a study done by the UK,
[00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:08.260]   and someone moving their body, going on a walk,
[00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:12.020]   going on a run, doing something active outside,
[00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:13.740]   the National Health Service in the UK revealed
[00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:16.040]   that regular exercise, like running,
[00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:20.100]   has the same effect on your body as antidepressants.
[00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:22.020]   That's published in the Journal of Psychiatry
[00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:24.620]   and Neuroscience in an article titled
[00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:28.780]   How to Increase Serotonin in the Human Brain Without Drugs.
[00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:33.380]   Now, my point is not medication, pro-medication, anything.
[00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:35.460]   I'm saying you were not created to sit,
[00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:37.660]   and sometimes one of the godliest things you can do
[00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:40.680]   is go move and move around.
[00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:44.260]   Going outside, like I said, God created us,
[00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:46.860]   and originally you're placed in a garden outside.
[00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:50.580]   Further studies are also showing exposure
[00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:55.020]   to natural light and strong links with the serotonin system.
[00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:56.300]   What does that mean in plain language?
[00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:58.340]   It means you need light to be happy,
[00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:03.020]   and that means you need to get outside, you need to move.
[00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:05.460]   Am I oversimplifying it and saying if you just get outside,
[00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:06.300]   everything will be okay?
[00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:08.340]   No, I'm not saying that.
[00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:10.060]   I am saying what you do physically
[00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:12.060]   impacts you spiritually and emotionally.
[00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:17.140]   Spiritually, how do we battle this spiritually?
[00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:19.860]   Like I said, anxious thoughts can lead to depressed feelings
[00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:23.980]   and so we address those anxious thoughts with God's Word.
[00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:25.780]   We take every thought captive.
[00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:28.860]   Second Corinthians chapter 10, verse four and five says,
[00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:30.960]   "We demolish arguments and every pretension
[00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:33.500]   "that sets itself up against the knowledge of God."
[00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:35.660]   And we take every thought captive,
[00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:37.620]   and we take every thought captive,
[00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:40.600]   and we take every thought captive,
[00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:44.240]   and make it obedient to Christ.
[00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:45.780]   That I take every thought, Paul says,
[00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:50.420]   you need to run through the filter of obedience to Christ,
[00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:52.180]   every thought that you have.
[00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:54.820]   And so when I find myself anxious
[00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:56.280]   over whether or not I'm gonna have the job,
[00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:58.460]   or whether or not my family member's gonna pass away,
[00:28:58.460 --> 00:29:00.420]   or whether or not I'm gonna be able to afford rent
[00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:03.180]   and increasing cost of living standards,
[00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:04.420]   I take that thought and I go,
[00:29:04.420 --> 00:29:07.860]   is this what Jesus would say obedient thinking looks like?
[00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:10.780]   And if not, I replace it with the truth.
[00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:13.700]   God is for me, He's promised to provide for me,
[00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:16.020]   He's promised He will never leave me nor forsake me,
[00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:18.140]   He's promised even if I can't afford that apartment,
[00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:20.140]   He's enough, He will sustain me,
[00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:21.620]   and I run everything through,
[00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:23.900]   is this thought obedient to Jesus?
[00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:27.700]   Because how we think impacts how we live,
[00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:29.600]   and how we think impacts what we feel.
[00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:32.220]   So spiritually, we do it with God's word,
[00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:34.420]   we run them through the filter of God's word.
[00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:42.620]   Finally, or additionally,
[00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:46.160]   this also looks like spiritually going to God in prayer.
[00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:47.820]   Perhaps one of the most encouraging things
[00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:49.620]   in all the stories that I just read
[00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:54.620]   were the blatant, shocking honesty that people had
[00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:56.960]   when they would talk to God.
[00:29:56.960 --> 00:30:01.620]   Like David in Psalm 13 is yelling at God
[00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:04.440]   like he can't find Him, which I don't know about you,
[00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:06.460]   I mean, he's literally like, where are you God?
[00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:09.080]   How long will you forsake me?
[00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:12.020]   And I don't know about you,
[00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:14.460]   but the fact that David is the only person in the Bible
[00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:16.900]   called a man after God's own heart,
[00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:19.500]   found himself in moments in life where he said,
[00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:22.780]   I feel like I can't feel you, I can't hear you,
[00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:24.100]   I can't see you,
[00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:28.380]   is deeply encouraging to me.
[00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:32.340]   And if you've ever had any of those experiences,
[00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:34.400]   emotions, feelings, you're not alone.
[00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:36.380]   In fact, you're in good company,
[00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:38.360]   and you have been invited to pour out your heart
[00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:41.540]   in prayer to God, to pray honestly.
[00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:43.220]   It's not like he doesn't see all the things
[00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:44.060]   that you're feeling.
[00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:45.980]   Maybe the most helpful or beneficial thing
[00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:48.140]   some of you could do would be go on a walk
[00:30:48.140 --> 00:30:52.020]   and say what you feel to God.
[00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:55.660]   God, I feel alone, I feel afraid, I feel sad,
[00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:57.940]   I feel overwhelmed, I feel like you don't care,
[00:30:57.940 --> 00:30:59.340]   I feel like you're not near.
[00:30:59.340 --> 00:31:01.700]   Here's what I know about God.
[00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:03.640]   He can handle it.
[00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:05.780]   He's God.
[00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:10.840]   And those feelings that you're afraid to say out loud,
[00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:13.440]   it's not like he doesn't know you feel them anyways.
[00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:16.860]   And he wants a relationship with you.
[00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:20.260]   And when you feel and express those things,
[00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:22.140]   and then you hold on to what is true,
[00:31:22.140 --> 00:31:25.380]   maybe you're in a place where you're like,
[00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:27.220]   man, you're listening to this at a later time,
[00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:29.980]   you're streaming right now, and you can't even get up.
[00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:32.840]   So for you, looking like battling,
[00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:34.860]   and really for all of us battling against depression
[00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:37.440]   involves doing it communally
[00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:38.740]   with other people that come over,
[00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:40.440]   and they pray when you can't pray.
[00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:42.780]   And they talk to you, and they talk about God,
[00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:43.940]   and they read scripture over you,
[00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:45.220]   and they come alongside of you,
[00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:47.340]   and they help you walk through that.
[00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:52.080]   That you and I are called to battle communally,
[00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:55.500]   having people in our life to help bear burdens.
[00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:59.120]   Galatians chapter six says this in verse one.
[00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:02.540]   It says that you and I are to bear one another's burdens,
[00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:04.300]   or carry each other's burdens,
[00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:08.380]   and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.
[00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:11.860]   The part of fulfilling what Christ wants for your life
[00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:15.340]   involves you carrying other people's burdens,
[00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:17.220]   and them helping you carry your burdens.
[00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:19.400]   The word burden in the original Greek,
[00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:20.900]   which is what the New Testament was written in,
[00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:21.780]   is the word boros.
[00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:25.100]   It literally means a serious or heavy weight.
[00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:26.420]   It's as though the author is saying,
[00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:28.480]   there are some things in life,
[00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:31.860]   they're too heavy to carry all alone.
[00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:34.980]   And the worst place to be,
[00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:37.760]   if you're experiencing depression, is in isolation.
[00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:40.980]   And God is not done with you.
[00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:43.400]   Any lies that you may be believing,
[00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:45.160]   and the reason why you gotta start opening up
[00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:46.640]   and talking to other people about it,
[00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:48.240]   is because the farther and farther you get
[00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:50.320]   down the hole of depression, in isolation,
[00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:51.760]   the more you feel like I can't open up,
[00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:52.880]   and I can't share about it,
[00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:54.480]   and the more you feel like you're all alone,
[00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:55.780]   and everyone else's life is perfect,
[00:32:55.780 --> 00:32:58.480]   and everyone's life is happy, and I'm just so sad,
[00:32:58.480 --> 00:32:59.420]   and nobody even knows it,
[00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:00.640]   and I can't even open up about it,
[00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:03.000]   and all of a sudden you get on that track,
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.800]   and it takes to a dark place.
[00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:09.480]   And one of the ways that you remove the fangs
[00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:11.700]   of Satan,
[00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:15.100]   of an enemy, of a liar,
[00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:18.200]   is you speak it out loud.
[00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:19.700]   You share it to other people.
[00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:23.740]   And it releases some of that power over you.
[00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:25.340]   Does it release it entirely? No.
[00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:28.880]   Or that's certainly not guaranteed.
[00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:31.440]   But one of the ways you experience
[00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:34.960]   and battle against depression is doing it communally,
[00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:36.640]   with other people in your life.
[00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:38.180]   If you're at a place where you were considering
[00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:40.280]   ending your life, God is not done with you.
[00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:41.240]   God is for you.
[00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:42.080]   God loves you.
[00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:43.120]   He has a plan for you.
[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:44.680]   As bad as you feel right now,
[00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:46.960]   those feelings will not last for forever.
[00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:49.280]   And you've gotta open up,
[00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:51.360]   and you've got to share with other people.
[00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:54.820]   And deciding something that is permanent
[00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:56.880]   to address a temporary emotion
[00:33:56.880 --> 00:34:00.620]   is a terrible idea.
[00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:02.000]   And it does not come from God.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:03.480]   It will not lead to better life.
[00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:06.560]   It will not lead to anything good.
[00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:11.600]   And you've gotta open up with other people
[00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:12.480]   and talk about it.
[00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:17.640]   Additionally, we choose,
[00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:19.020]   and we choose to arm ourselves
[00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:20.580]   and think about what is true,
[00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:23.800]   to stir our affections for God.
[00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:27.840]   Some of you, you need to sit down and go,
[00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:30.680]   "What makes me love Jesus more?"
[00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:32.560]   Like, what, like, not just reading my Bible,
[00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:33.640]   you should read your Bible,
[00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:35.000]   but like, what actually, when I just,
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:36.680]   I'm sitting in nature, and it makes me just go,
[00:34:36.680 --> 00:34:38.340]   "God, you're amazing.
[00:34:38.340 --> 00:34:43.760]   "I just, I feel, I feel alive."
[00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:45.320]   Maybe it's, it is nature.
[00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:48.340]   Maybe it's doing something active outside.
[00:34:48.340 --> 00:34:50.660]   Maybe it's listening to worship music
[00:34:50.660 --> 00:34:52.040]   with yourself or with other people.
[00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:53.400]   I don't know what it is, but you need to know
[00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:56.280]   what stirs, to use that Christian language of like,
[00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:59.640]   what stirs your feelings, your emotions for God,
[00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:01.680]   and do that.
[00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:05.480]   And one thing that stirs our emotions
[00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:07.340]   is the habit of practicing gratitude.
[00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:10.480]   In other words, by choosing to cultivate gratitude,
[00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:12.200]   you can actually choose to cultivate joy in your life,
[00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:13.040]   and here's what I mean by that.
[00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:15.520]   Do you know a study was done that proves
[00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:17.720]   what Paul says in 1 Thessalonians, chapter five,
[00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:20.680]   of give thanks in every circumstance.
[00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:24.920]   The Bible commands you and I to give thanks in all things,
[00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:27.360]   for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus.
[00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:28.240]   And do you know that Harvard
[00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:30.620]   and the American Psychological Association
[00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:35.460]   did a study that showed that a person expressing
[00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:37.440]   a thankful journal is what they called it,
[00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:39.360]   but basically five minutes a day
[00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:41.840]   of expressing things that they're thankful for.
[00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:43.960]   Writing those down, five minutes a day,
[00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:45.840]   here's just some things I'm thankful for.
[00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:49.000]   They did a study, and the conclusion of the study
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.840]   was that a person expressing gratitude
[00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:53.380]   for just five minutes or just a few moments
[00:35:53.380 --> 00:35:57.220]   every single day will increase their happiness in life
[00:35:57.220 --> 00:35:59.840]   the same equivalent as doubling their salary.
[00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:03.560]   Now, I don't know about you, but my guess is,
[00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:05.740]   if I said, you know what,
[00:36:05.740 --> 00:36:08.100]   I'm gonna double everybody's salary in here,
[00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:09.240]   you'd probably take it.
[00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:13.160]   All right, I'll do it, okay.
[00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:16.160]   (audience laughing)
[00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:20.800]   And yet, you have the American Psychological Association
[00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:23.680]   saying, you may not be able to double your salary tomorrow,
[00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:25.760]   but you can decide to increase the amount of joy
[00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:27.660]   that doubling your salary would
[00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:29.980]   by expressing thanks to God
[00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:33.320]   and continually expressing, God, thank you.
[00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:35.460]   Man, thank you that my car broke down
[00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:37.120]   because it means I have a car.
[00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:40.080]   I'm one of the 1% in the world that have a car.
[00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:44.200]   God, thank you that I got a cold today
[00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:46.100]   because it makes me thankful for all the other days
[00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:48.640]   that I don't feel bad.
[00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:55.140]   God, thank you that I wasn't able to sleep in my room
[00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:57.360]   because we had friends that were coming in town
[00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:58.540]   because it means that I have friends.
[00:36:58.540 --> 00:37:00.340]   I don't know what it is, but you can take anything
[00:37:00.340 --> 00:37:02.320]   and you can express gratitude to God.
[00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:03.360]   God, thank you.
[00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:08.120]   I don't know what y'all laughing at right now.
[00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:09.720]   Is it the friend, friend coming in town?
[00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:11.400]   Look, I'm making these up on the spot, people, okay?
[00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:14.120]   Give me some good grief.
[00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:17.200]   But whatever it is that you and I can choose
[00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:20.040]   and cultivate joy, will that make it all go away?
[00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:22.400]   No, but you and I are called
[00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:24.800]   to combat it physically, spiritually,
[00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:27.700]   and to choose to trust that even
[00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:29.680]   if God doesn't make it go away,
[00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:32.980]   you can still pursue the calling
[00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:37.900]   and the purpose God has for your life of knowing him,
[00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:39.780]   walking with other people that know him
[00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:41.240]   and making him known.
[00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:44.660]   In 2 Corinthians 12, verse nine,
[00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:47.660]   it says that God's power is made perfect in weakness.
[00:37:47.660 --> 00:37:50.540]   And I wish so desperately I could just say,
[00:37:50.540 --> 00:37:52.580]   hey, if you will just hit this button,
[00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:55.500]   any depression you feel or ever face
[00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:57.940]   for the rest of your life will go away, but I can't.
[00:37:57.940 --> 00:37:59.100]   And it would be a lie.
[00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:03.140]   But no matter what you face,
[00:38:03.140 --> 00:38:06.860]   God has promised that he can sustain you.
[00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:09.860]   And as dark as it feels, he is near.
[00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:13.340]   And he has not forgotten you.
[00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:15.260]   And he's invited you to call out to him
[00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:17.600]   and experience a real relationship with him.
[00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:19.800]   Finally, we wait patiently with hope.
[00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:24.160]   That healing, if you break your arm,
[00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:26.240]   it's gonna take time to heal.
[00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:28.360]   When you're depressed, it's a breaking of your heart
[00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:29.920]   and it takes time to heal.
[00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:32.440]   And the good news is Jesus is an amazing healer,
[00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:34.760]   but we wait patiently and we wait in this world
[00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:36.640]   knowing that even if he never takes it away,
[00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:38.880]   even if I battle this for the rest of my life,
[00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:42.360]   there's coming a day when he will wipe every tear
[00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:44.760]   away from my eye, Revelation chapter 21 says.
[00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:46.480]   He will make everything broken
[00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:47.920]   and put it all back together again.
[00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:50.640]   And in the meantime, he promises everything bad
[00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:52.520]   that you face, Romans chapter eight, verse 28.
[00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:54.040]   Think about this verse.
[00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:57.780]   In all things, God works for the good of those who love him.
[00:38:57.780 --> 00:39:03.860]   All things, that means anxiety, depression, all things.
[00:39:03.860 --> 00:39:10.000]   That he is at work and we wait patiently with hope.
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.200]   The apostle Paul in that same chapter
[00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:13.400]   and about to land the plane said
[00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:17.180]   that I consider our present sufferings not worth comparing
[00:39:17.180 --> 00:39:20.040]   with the glory that will be revealed in us.
[00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:21.960]   Romans chapter eight, verse 17 and 18.
[00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:23.720]   Paul, who suffered a lot.
[00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:25.560]   I mean, the apostle Paul,
[00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:26.560]   I don't know what you know about his story,
[00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:28.520]   multiple times, thrown in prison for being a Christian,
[00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:30.320]   attempted suicide on his life,
[00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:33.640]   had physical scars all over his body
[00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:35.600]   from being whipped for the name of Jesus,
[00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:38.220]   was shipwrecked multiple times,
[00:39:38.220 --> 00:39:42.960]   experienced tremendous pain and hardship.
[00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:47.960]   And he says, I consider everything we suffer in this life,
[00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:52.980]   including the beheading he was about to face,
[00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:57.120]   all of it not worth comparing to what's coming.
[00:39:57.120 --> 00:40:00.340]   And he would say, if he's here, don't lose hope.
[00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:02.500]   Don't let go in the midst of that darkness.
[00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:03.740]   Talk to other people about it.
[00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:05.140]   In the midst of being overwhelmed
[00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:06.940]   and what you're feeling about it, you're not crazy.
[00:40:06.940 --> 00:40:08.780]   You're not alone, but don't let go.
[00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:09.780]   It's gonna be worth it.
[00:40:09.780 --> 00:40:10.820]   It's gonna be worth it.
[00:40:10.820 --> 00:40:11.980]   It's gonna be worth it.
[00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:17.000]   And what's ahead, there's no comparison
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.040]   to whatever you face.
[00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:20.940]   Pretty mind boggling statement to say.
[00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:25.640]   When a couple years ago,
[00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:28.920]   I was invited to do a wedding in Crested Butte, Colorado.
[00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:31.880]   And the wedding, basically, the couple said,
[00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:35.360]   hey, if you can do it, man, we'll cover everything.
[00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:39.080]   Cover your flights, cover the hotel, and cover your room.
[00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:40.280]   And so we added onto the wedding,
[00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:42.200]   just like a family vacation.
[00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:43.560]   And the day came and we packed up
[00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:44.800]   and we got to the airport.
[00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:46.200]   And in order to get to Crested Butte,
[00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:49.320]   you had to kind of take multiple different plane flights
[00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:51.840]   and then get in on like a three-hour car ride drive.
[00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:52.900]   And when you travel with kids,
[00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:54.260]   I know none of this room knows this,
[00:40:54.260 --> 00:40:55.960]   but there's coming a day, if you have kids,
[00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:57.040]   you're gonna get on a plane.
[00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:59.200]   And I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy.
[00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:00.760]   Whatever we do to ISIS,
[00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:02.580]   I wouldn't want them to experience this,
[00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:04.520]   because you're traveling with kids,
[00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:06.520]   and it's just horrid, especially when they're little kids,
[00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:08.200]   'cause you're carrying multiple car seats
[00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:09.340]   and you're carrying pack-and-plays,
[00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:11.320]   which is like a name for a portable crib.
[00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:12.400]   And you're carrying all this luggage,
[00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:14.600]   you got your stuff, and then you got kids
[00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:16.200]   that you can't carry,
[00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:17.680]   'cause you're carrying all of those stuff.
[00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:18.640]   So you're just trying to like,
[00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:20.360]   "Hey, come on, little Johnny."
[00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:21.600]   And you're trying to walk through the airport
[00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:23.880]   and trying to get in, it's like you're doing a maze
[00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:25.600]   and they're running everywhere all around you
[00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:26.760]   and you put everything down.
[00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:29.080]   It just is a nightmare.
[00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:30.240]   And the entire time I was thinking,
[00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:32.640]   "If we could just get to the hotel,
[00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:34.840]   "if we could just get to the hotel,
[00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:36.040]   "if we could just get to the hotel,
[00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:36.880]   "it's gonna be worth it.
[00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:38.680]   "It's terrible right now, it's horrible right now.
[00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:40.200]   "I'm taking years off of my life,
[00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:41.880]   "but if we can just get to the hotel,
[00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:43.140]   "it's gonna be worth it."
[00:41:43.140 --> 00:41:46.820]   And the Apostle Paul would say,
[00:41:46.820 --> 00:41:49.720]   "It's gonna be worth it.
[00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:51.060]   "It's gonna be worth it.
[00:41:51.060 --> 00:41:52.220]   "It's gonna be worth it."
[00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:53.900]   And for billions and billions of years,
[00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:57.500]   the pain and the sorrow and the heartache, which is real,
[00:41:57.500 --> 00:41:58.660]   it's gonna be worth it.
[00:41:58.660 --> 00:42:01.780]   So don't let go, don't lose sight.
[00:42:01.780 --> 00:42:06.300]   Finally, Jesus tells us,
[00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:10.680]   we're told about Jesus, like I mentioned earlier.
[00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:14.200]   He not only understands what you're going through
[00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:16.160]   because he understands the human heart,
[00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:20.560]   he's a God who's able to empathize and move towards you
[00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:25.560]   because he himself experienced horrific pain, sorrow,
[00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:29.920]   was described in Isaiah 53, verse three,
[00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:32.000]   he was despised and rejected.
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:36.180]   A man of sorrows.
[00:42:37.180 --> 00:42:40.720]   I don't know what your favorite description of Jesus is.
[00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:44.800]   My guess is that's not one of them,
[00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:47.840]   but it's certainly one of the descriptions
[00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:49.600]   the Bible gives us.
[00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:51.320]   And when he's on this planet, he was a man of sorrows,
[00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:53.640]   acquainted with the deepest of grief.
[00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:56.640]   In the garden, Jesus prayed,
[00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:59.080]   "My soul is crushed to the point of death."
[00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:06.540]   Jesus, in Hebrews chapter two, we're told,
[00:43:06.540 --> 00:43:11.740]   was made in every respect like us,
[00:43:11.740 --> 00:43:15.380]   his brothers and sisters,
[00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:18.420]   so that he could be our merciful
[00:43:18.420 --> 00:43:21.380]   and faithful high priest before God.
[00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:24.500]   Then he could offer a sacrifice
[00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:26.380]   that would take away the sins of his people
[00:43:26.380 --> 00:43:30.580]   since he himself had gone through suffering and testing.
[00:43:30.580 --> 00:43:35.400]   He is able to help us when we are in a time of need,
[00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:38.200]   that God who is there, he sees all the heartache,
[00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:40.540]   he sees all the pain, he sees the depression,
[00:43:40.540 --> 00:43:43.000]   and he's not unable to empathize.
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   If anything, he's more acquainted with grief
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.720]   than anyone you will ever know.
[00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:50.120]   And he did so on the cross where he went to die,
[00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:52.180]   to defeat death, to defeat depression,
[00:43:52.180 --> 00:43:53.640]   and he came back alive
[00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:58.520]   so that we have hope in the face of heartache,
[00:43:58.520 --> 00:44:01.300]   so that we know no matter what we face in this life,
[00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:03.440]   the victory and depression, it will not win.
[00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:06.800]   And listen to me very closely, here's the heart that I have.
[00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:11.300]   There are friends in this church,
[00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:16.300]   there are people who were overwhelmed by that darkness,
[00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:18.460]   and they made a decision
[00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:22.940]   out of that depression to end their life.
[00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:23.940]   And they were Christians,
[00:44:23.940 --> 00:44:25.900]   and they were attempting to follow God,
[00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:29.060]   and they acted out of that
[00:44:29.060 --> 00:44:30.700]   because they felt unable to break
[00:44:30.700 --> 00:44:31.820]   the power of that depression,
[00:44:31.820 --> 00:44:35.060]   and depression is powerful, but Jesus is more powerful,
[00:44:35.060 --> 00:44:37.420]   and you've gotta open up, and you've gotta go to him,
[00:44:37.420 --> 00:44:39.040]   and you've gotta talk about it with other people.
[00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:40.060]   You're not alone,
[00:44:40.060 --> 00:44:45.940]   and yet you have got to make the decision.
[00:44:45.940 --> 00:44:48.180]   I'm gonna get up, I'm gonna do something about this,
[00:44:48.180 --> 00:44:49.940]   I'm gonna choose even when I don't feel like it,
[00:44:49.940 --> 00:44:51.500]   I'm not following those feelings,
[00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:52.740]   I'm gonna choose to talk to other people
[00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:55.100]   about where I'm struggling, where I need help.
[00:44:55.100 --> 00:44:56.380]   It's gonna be worth it,
[00:44:56.380 --> 00:44:59.440]   and you will find God is near to the brokenhearted,
[00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:02.740]   and is a God who's able, like Hebrews tells us,
[00:45:02.740 --> 00:45:07.740]   to empathize with our weaknesses,
[00:45:07.740 --> 00:45:10.280]   with our sadness, with our sorrows.
[00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:12.940]   Let me pray.
[00:45:12.940 --> 00:45:14.900]   Father, I pray for anyone in this room,
[00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:19.000]   anyone listening online,
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:21.800]   anyone in the 14 different PortsLive locations,
[00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:28.560]   that they are sitting in the valley of depression,
[00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:30.100]   sadness, sorrows,
[00:45:30.100 --> 00:45:31.940]   whether it's from things that have happened to them,
[00:45:31.940 --> 00:45:34.260]   or whether it's just from whatever the case.
[00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:35.980]   You would meet them where they are.
[00:45:35.980 --> 00:45:39.340]   You would be bigger than the fear, bigger than the sadness.
[00:45:39.340 --> 00:45:43.940]   Their awareness of you would be more real
[00:45:43.940 --> 00:45:47.060]   than what they're walking through,
[00:45:47.060 --> 00:45:48.180]   and you would help them to open up
[00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:49.420]   and share with somebody else.
[00:45:49.420 --> 00:45:50.580]   They'd be reminded of what's true.
[00:45:50.580 --> 00:45:52.020]   You're not done, you have a plan for them,
[00:45:52.020 --> 00:45:54.820]   and you want life to be experienced by them,
[00:45:54.820 --> 00:45:56.060]   and so I pray that you would meet them there,
[00:45:56.060 --> 00:45:58.220]   and if you don't, take it away.
[00:45:58.220 --> 00:45:59.500]   They would walk with you.
[00:45:59.500 --> 00:46:01.640]   They would sing in the storm,
[00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:08.520]   and in doing so, others would see the goodness of our God,
[00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:11.920]   and marvel at the faith of his people.
[00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:14.900]   Thank you that you died on that cross
[00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:16.340]   to defeat depression once and for all.
[00:46:16.340 --> 00:46:18.740]   One day, you will come and wipe away every tear,
[00:46:18.740 --> 00:46:20.140]   and while we wait, would you help us,
[00:46:20.140 --> 00:46:21.500]   strengthen us, sustain us?
[00:46:21.500 --> 00:46:22.740]   We worship you now in song.
[00:46:22.740 --> 00:46:23.580]   Amen.
