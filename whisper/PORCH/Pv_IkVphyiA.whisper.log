[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   - James is made up of 108 verses.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.840]   54 of them are imperatives.
[00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.460]   An imperative is a command.
[00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.040]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:22.280]   That Jesus was not just his half-brother,
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:23.360]   he was his Lord.
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.640]   - Yes, he is his Lord and our Lord tonight.
[00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:28.800]   Welcome back, Porsche.
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.520]   We are going into James, like she said.
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.000]   Our friends watching live in Porsche, Indianapolis,
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.160]   Porsche, Des Moines, Iowa, Porsche, Houston,
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.200]   and of course my friends tonight here in the room in Dallas.
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.040]   How we doing?
[00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.080]   Love it.
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.240]   So excited to be with you guys.
[00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.880]   And like she said, tonight, James chapter four.
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.000]   We've been navigating through the book of James.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.040]   James is the half-brother of Jesus.
[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.520]   If you haven't been tracking with us
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.120]   and we are discovering the full truth,
[00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.020]   what it looks like to follow Jesus
[00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.960]   from his literal half-brother,
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.560]   a blood relative, James himself.
[00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.320]   And we've just been committed to going verse by verse,
[00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.280]   teaching you guys what it looks like
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.560]   to navigate through an entire book of the Bible together.
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.880]   So we've been enjoying it.
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.800]   Last week, David talked about the power of our words.
[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.240]   And tonight, James is gonna give us what my Bible,
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.960]   I studied the ESV translation.
[00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.560]   So before I prep for a message like this,
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.120]   I like to just open up the Bible
[00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.200]   that I do my quiet times in.
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.120]   And there's like, you know, there's like subtitles.
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.600]   And the subtitle for mine was Warning Against Worldliness.
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.040]   Any ESVs out there?
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.320]   ESV lovers, like me, yeah.
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.240]   Warning Against Worldliness.
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.440]   And I was just thinking about this idea of warning.
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.400]   And so before we read James's warnings to us tonight,
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.340]   I wanna tell you about a time where I didn't take heed
[00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.360]   to a man named Billy Bob's warnings.
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.980]   And I was trying to think
[00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.920]   as I was articulating the story out loud earlier,
[00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.880]   like I just need to draw pictures for you guys
[00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:54.880]   to help better illustrate it.
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:55.960]   So I'm not really good.
[00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.080]   I'm not an artist,
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.080]   but they'll come up as we tell the story.
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.920]   So here it goes.
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.020]   It was summer in college.
[00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.840]   I was given the task of leading about 40 leaders
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.200]   in our church to go and bond and get to know each other.
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.480]   They're like, you can do whatever you want.
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:10.000]   And I was like, what better way to bond
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.960]   and get to know someone than a canoe trip?
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.580]   If you've ever tried it, you should like take someone out,
[00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:15.800]   go canoeing, I don't know.
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.120]   And so we go on this canoe trip.
[00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.680]   We Google cheapest way to go on a canoe excursion
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:21.920]   for 40 people.
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.700]   And this place called Billy Bob's Yo-Yo Canoe Trip
[00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.320]   pops up in Louisiana.
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.680]   And we're like, do it now, do it.
[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.360]   So we go, we get in the cars.
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.400]   I make everyone dress up in like Indian headwear
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.520]   and like paint and like teeth and like different,
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.680]   I don't know, it was weird.
[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.440]   And we're getting in the cars, we're going.
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.880]   And then we start to get off road and go into a dirt road.
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.180]   And we're going further and further and further back.
[00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.740]   And I'm just looking for like a sign,
[00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.440]   anything that says Billy Bob's Yo-Yo Canoe.
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.560]   And then suddenly, you know, surely enough,
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.040]   we pull up on this little log cabin
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.760]   and it says Billy Bob's and this guy,
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.920]   I mean, exactly when you hear the name Billy Bob,
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.200]   and what you think, he walks out,
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.140]   overalls, no undershirt, one's undone,
[00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.320]   trucker hat, you know, missing teeth.
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.560]   He walks out, "Waltza, come on y'all."
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.480]   He welcomes us in.
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.680]   He's like, "Who's the leader of this here excursion?"
[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.560]   And I'm like, "Me and me and my friend walk up."
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.820]   And he tells us how it's called a Yo-Yo Canoe Trip
[00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.240]   because you go down the stream.
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.520]   And then we're like, this is important.
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.440]   When you go down the stream and you go for four miles or so,
[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.520]   and then it's lunchtime.
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.120]   And then it's really important
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.440]   where you choose to eat lunch
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.280]   because the reason why it's called a yo-yo
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.720]   is because then during your lunch,
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.120]   you're gonna hear the dam open.
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.160]   And when that dam opens, it's gonna release water
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.720]   and it's gonna shift the current back this way.
[00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.160]   So you'll zip back exactly the way
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.520]   that you came with the current.
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.360]   And I'm like, "Okay."
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.520]   And he's like, "But here's the warning."
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:42.400]   And he gets out this napkin
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.040]   and he draws a picture like this.
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.640]   He says, (congregation laughing)
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.920]   he says, "There's the dam, eat here, don't eat here."
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.080]   And so we're coming where that arrow is.
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.100]   And I'm like, we traveled for four miles.
[00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.680]   I dropped the napkin in like the water, it's all soggy.
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.080]   And they're like, "All right, I'm starving.
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.600]   It's time to eat our peanut butter and jellies
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:04.960]   and Cheetos and all of that."
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:05.880]   And I'm like, "Okay."
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:06.880]   They're like, "Where should we eat?"
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:07.880]   And I'm like, "Hmm."
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.520]   And I look at the napkin, I throw it away.
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.880]   And I'm like, "Here."
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.620]   So that's where I decided to take us.
[00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.520]   So I'm there, about 40 people,
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:19.080]   and I wanna be the guy that everyone likes.
[00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:20.000]   And they're like, "It's hot."
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.800]   And I'm like, "Well, the water is so nice
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.940]   and clear and shallow, go eat there."
[00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.200]   And so they're all happy.
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.880]   They're eating out in the middle of the water.
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.260]   And the reason why Billy Bob said,
[00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.600]   "Hey, you don't wanna be eating anywhere else but here,"
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.640]   is because when this dam opens,
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:41.800]   it releases class four level-sized rapids.
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.800]   And I'm like, we are in Louisiana.
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.820]   Like, this is not National Geographic, kayakers.
[00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.040]   Like, this is like, what are you talking about?
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.200]   And so they're eating out there.
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.880]   And surely enough, right on time, you hear,
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.720]   "Eat, eat, eat, eat."
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.680]   And, okay, the story's getting a little ahead of me,
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.800]   but you see where this is going.
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.520]   Maybe you don't, I'm not a good drawer.
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.720]   But they're sitting there,
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.440]   and suddenly the water starts to rise.
[00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.480]   And they're like, "Oh, look, JD, like class four rapids.
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:12.040]   Like Billy Bob, like, what's he talking about?"
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.040]   And I'm like, "Yeah, you guys."
[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.840]   And then before I could say, "Look out."
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.840]   I mean, it was like a stampede.
[00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.320]   We look over and they're like, "JD, pfft."
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:26.240]   And rapids take away people that were with us
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.640]   that I barely know.
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.200]   So I'm like, "Grab the canoes."
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.440]   And so we're grabbing the canoes,
[00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:36.080]   and I'm watching girls just get swept into these rapids,
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.120]   just one by one, losing people.
[00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.380]   And I'm supposed to be leading these people.
[00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.700]   So they go, and we're just like watching people disappear
[00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:45.480]   into class four level rapids.
[00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:46.560]   And I am just, I mean,
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.280]   wives are losing their husbands in these rapids.
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:50.120]   They're praying.
[00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.080]   I look over, girls are like, "Dear Jesus."
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.720]   Like they're praying together.
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.980]   People are trying to climb up the bank to escape
[00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:58.280]   as the water is rising up our knees.
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.060]   And then we all, I look at everyone,
[00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:01.640]   and the rapids finally subside.
[00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.880]   And I'm like, "I don't know where half of our crew is."
[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.520]   And I'm like, like a good leader, every man for himself,
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.680]   get back however you can, just get back.
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:10.520]   We're losing canoes.
[00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:11.680]   We lost all of our food.
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.680]   So people just get back to the destination,
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.300]   and we sit there, and guys, it is like nighttime
[00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:21.520]   before finally you just see people in a pack,
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:26.240]   dragging, canoes, soaking wet in water.
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.720]   Their feathers from the Indian headwear are like,
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.000]   on their face, the paint smeared.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.880]   And they're like, I'm like, "Hey guys, what?"
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.080]   And they're like, "Uh-uh, uh-uh.
[00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:35.920]   We don't want to hear from you."
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.600]   And they're like, "Why would you do that?"
[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.560]   And I'm like, and the guy's like, "I told him."
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:41.820]   They all look at me.
[00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:43.600]   And I'm like, "Ah."
[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:47.200]   And I start there because just like I did not take heed
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.640]   to Crazy Billy Bob's warning,
[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.520]   tonight we're gonna hear from James,
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.400]   the author of this book.
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.120]   And he's gonna list out a lot of warnings
[00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:58.040]   for young adults like you and I,
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:59.800]   and what it looks like to have a relationship
[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.960]   with God in the world.
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:03.880]   And I think when we hear warnings,
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:05.000]   a lot of things come to mind.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.740]   Like in our young adult years,
[00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:08.400]   we get a lot of warnings in front of us.
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:12.320]   Our parents, pastors, leaders, coaches are constantly saying,
[00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:14.800]   "Hey, like I wouldn't buy that new shiny car.
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:15.840]   Like you're gonna get in debt.
[00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:17.680]   I would go with an older car for a season
[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:18.520]   until you get more money."
[00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:20.260]   And you're like, "No, I'll be making bank.
[00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:21.100]   It'll be fine.
[00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:21.920]   I'll pay it off.
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:22.760]   You get the new car."
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:24.400]   Or they're like, "Hey, pastors, oftentimes up here,
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:27.560]   like, hey, I would not have sex before marriage.
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:28.400]   I would really."
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:29.840]   And you're like, "What are you talking about?
[00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:30.920]   Everyone's doing it.
[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:32.760]   Like you're so behind the times.
[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:33.840]   It's a, it's a bog.
[00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:34.800]   It's like expression.
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.320]   Like it's an act of love.
[00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:38.160]   Like you're so like, what are you, it'll be fine.
[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:39.980]   Like it's, there's no consequences from it.
[00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:42.680]   It's fine and we're not taking heed to warnings
[00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:43.760]   in our young adult years."
[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:46.000]   And I think there's a few reasons why you and I,
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.640]   we don't necessarily listen to warnings.
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:50.960]   I was just thinking about one of the first reasons
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:51.780]   why I don't think we listen
[00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:53.800]   and why I didn't listen to even Billy Bob
[00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:56.080]   is because we don't trust the person
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:57.760]   the warning's coming from.
[00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:59.260]   We don't know them.
[00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:00.240]   We're like, "Hey, why would,
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:04.400]   why would I dictate my choices based off of what you say?
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.480]   Like you don't have any credibility with me.
[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:07.440]   I don't trust you.
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:08.280]   You're out of touch.
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:09.440]   What are you talking about?"
[00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:10.860]   Another reason why we don't listen to warnings
[00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:13.300]   is because we think that we're outliers.
[00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:15.440]   Like this, this will pan out maybe for everyone else,
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:16.760]   but I'll be different.
[00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:18.480]   Like my story will be different.
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:20.000]   I'm exempt.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.440]   I won't have that consequence
[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:22.720]   or I'll work my way around it,
[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:25.340]   or I can go past the system.
[00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:27.820]   Or the third reason is because we think that
[00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:29.680]   someone who is giving us warnings
[00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:31.880]   is not doing it out of love and care,
[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:34.640]   but actually to keep us away from fun and a good time.
[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:36.840]   Like they don't want us to experience their withholding.
[00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:38.480]   They're trying to like keep us back.
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:40.040]   And for some, whatever reason, we're like,
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:42.360]   "I don't want to listen to you."
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:43.880]   But when I think about tonight
[00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:45.920]   and the warnings we see in this passage,
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:48.880]   like think about the person who is giving us
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:50.560]   these warnings in James chapter four,
[00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:52.960]   the literal half brother of Jesus,
[00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:54.560]   someone that you can trust,
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:56.840]   someone that walked with Jesus, ate with Jesus,
[00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:58.560]   talked to Jesus, learned from Jesus,
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:01.080]   watched Jesus die for you and me.
[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:03.960]   And he's like, "You can trust me."
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.520]   He has no ulterior motive.
[00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:07.680]   Like he's not alive.
[00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:08.840]   He died for this stuff.
[00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:10.440]   So really think about that.
[00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:14.000]   Like, why would James take the time to die for this?
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.640]   Like, why would he give his life over
[00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:18.840]   to living a life for Jesus this kind of way?
[00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:22.760]   And it's because he loves us.
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:24.620]   Like he loves you and I enough
[00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:26.760]   to write down these things and go, "Trust me.
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:27.840]   I saw Jesus.
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:29.160]   I walked with Jesus.
[00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:30.920]   Take heed to these warnings."
[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:32.740]   And tonight I'm even asking you
[00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:34.320]   as the messenger of God's word,
[00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:36.120]   as I'm just reading from the book of James,
[00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:37.720]   and guys, it's a weighty text.
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:38.680]   It's a hard text.
[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:40.720]   It like, this thing shifts so many gears
[00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:41.960]   and goes so many different directions.
[00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:42.920]   I'm like getting whiplash.
[00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:44.920]   I'm like, "What's going on?"
[00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:46.680]   But as I stand up here, I'm asking you,
[00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:49.400]   "Hey, as we study James together, like, trust me.
[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:50.280]   I love you.
[00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:51.560]   You guys are my people.
[00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:52.480]   You guys are my friends.
[00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:53.520]   We are in this together.
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:55.720]   We are in this walk together."
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:58.680]   And so may we all not be people who walk
[00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:01.080]   with a blind eye and deaf ears,
[00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:02.440]   but we take heed to warning,
[00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:04.600]   which is why tonight we're gonna look at
[00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:08.440]   three warnings to prevent us from ruining our lives.
[00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:11.920]   Three warnings to prevent you from ruining your life,
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:13.800]   found in James chapter four.
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:16.420]   So here we go, starting in verse one.
[00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:21.440]   "What is causing the quarrels and fights among you?
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:24.520]   Don't they come from the evil desires at war within you?
[00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:26.080]   You want what you don't have,
[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:28.360]   so you scheme and kill to get it.
[00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:30.120]   You are jealous for what others have,
[00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:31.560]   but you can't get it,
[00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:35.000]   so you fight and wage war to take it away from them.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.080]   Yet you don't have what you don't want
[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:39.200]   because you don't ask God for it.
[00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.480]   And even when you ask,
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:43.480]   you don't get it because your motives are all wrong.
[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:48.340]   You want only what will give you pleasure.
[00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:51.020]   You adulterers, don't you realize that friendship
[00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:53.400]   with the world makes you an enemy of God?
[00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:55.220]   I say it again.
[00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:58.480]   If you wanna be a friend of the world,
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:01.220]   you make yourself an enemy of God."
[00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:02.060]   That's heavy.
[00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:05.600]   "Do you think the scriptures have no meaning?
[00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:07.440]   They say that God is passionate,
[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:09.240]   that the spirit he has placed within us
[00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:10.640]   should be faithful to him,
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:13.560]   and he gives grace generously.
[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:14.800]   As the scriptures say,
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:17.520]   God opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble.
[00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:19.320]   So humble yourselves before God,
[00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:21.400]   resist the devil and he will flee from you.
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:23.640]   Come close to God and God will come close to you.
[00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:26.400]   Wash your hands, you sinners, purify your hearts,
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:29.700]   for your loyalty is divided between God and the world.
[00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:32.640]   Let there be tears for what you have done.
[00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:35.400]   Let there be sorrow and deep grief.
[00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:38.120]   Let there be sadness instead of laughter,
[00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:40.320]   and gloom instead of joy.
[00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:43.020]   Humble yourselves before the Lord,
[00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:46.820]   and he will lift you up in honor."
[00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:49.740]   This is a lot.
[00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:52.500]   I mean, I was reading this like, "Oof, here we go."
[00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:55.840]   So warning number one found in James 4,
[00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:59.920]   verses one through 10 is trust God, not yourself.
[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:02.500]   Simply put, warning number one,
[00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:05.420]   hey, always, always trust God,
[00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:09.200]   and never, never trust yourself.
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:10.240]   Look at verse one again.
[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:12.700]   "What is causing the quarrels and fights among you?
[00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:16.420]   Don't they come from the evil desires at war within you?"
[00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:17.340]   What does he mean,
[00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:19.840]   this like these evil desires at war within you?
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:21.340]   Here's what he means.
[00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:23.980]   When you were born, you had something inside of you,
[00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:26.400]   we talk a lot about here called a sinful nature,
[00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:27.560]   a sin nature.
[00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:29.340]   That is a result of the fall of man
[00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:31.180]   all the way back in the beginning of the Bible,
[00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:33.000]   the first book, Genesis chapter three,
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.340]   when Adam and Eve chose to partake of the fruit,
[00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:37.340]   disobey God, they sinned.
[00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:38.740]   They brought sin into the world,
[00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:41.020]   and there was a curse of ramifications
[00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:43.660]   because of that sin that produced a sin nature
[00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:46.300]   in every human being.
[00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:47.300]   You and I don't have to earn it.
[00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:48.140]   We don't have to work for it.
[00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:49.660]   We have sin inside of us.
[00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:50.700]   We are born with it.
[00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:53.940]   We naturally crave to satisfy ourselves
[00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:56.500]   with the desires and the things of this world.
[00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:59.400]   And because of that sin nature,
[00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:00.700]   we go chasing after the world.
[00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:02.680]   But if you call yourself a Christian tonight,
[00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:03.780]   if you're here tonight,
[00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:06.720]   and you have surrendered your life over into God's hand
[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:09.540]   and claimed yourself as a son and daughter of God,
[00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:12.220]   you no longer are identified by your sin,
[00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:15.100]   but you're now identified by the spirit in you.
[00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:16.420]   When you accept Jesus,
[00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:19.860]   he gives you something, a gift called the Holy Spirit.
[00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:21.700]   And that is now who he identifies you by,
[00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:24.300]   no longer your sin, but now the spirit.
[00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:26.620]   The problem is, is the spirit is light
[00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:28.460]   and your sin is dark.
[00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:30.060]   And the last time we all checked,
[00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:31.900]   light and darkness cannot coexist.
[00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:34.880]   So those two things are creating this friction inside of you.
[00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:36.400]   They're at constant war.
[00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:37.860]   When you are faced with that decision
[00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:39.820]   to not choose God and to choose sin,
[00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:42.140]   and when you're there sitting there faced with temptation,
[00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:43.700]   and you're like, I really want to do that,
[00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:46.320]   even though I know it's no good for me,
[00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:48.940]   there's this war that James is talking about
[00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:50.820]   going on inside of you where your spirit is like,
[00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:55.540]   hey, you know better, don't do it, trust God, not yourself.
[00:13:55.540 --> 00:14:00.540]   But your sin is like, do it, give in, do it, do it, do it.
[00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:03.540]   And that's the war that he's referring to.
[00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:06.560]   And when you choose to not trust God
[00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:09.100]   and listen to this warning and trust yourself,
[00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:14.060]   the product of that is you fight, he says,
[00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:17.020]   you quarrel, you search,
[00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:20.420]   you're full of jealousy and hatred and anger
[00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:23.380]   and frustration and stress and striving
[00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:26.100]   and anxiety and depression and exhaustion.
[00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:28.060]   And you're going and you're going and you're going.
[00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:29.220]   And you see this, what you think
[00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:30.900]   is the right desired outcome.
[00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:33.440]   You have this like image of what life should look like
[00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:35.420]   or what you should have or what you should achieve
[00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:37.300]   or what you want, whatever it is,
[00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:39.540]   your flesh is like, hey, I want that.
[00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:43.180]   And you think that you are the means to get your solution.
[00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:46.020]   Like you think that you are the solution to your problem.
[00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:51.980]   And so you do whatever it takes to get what you want
[00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:55.660]   because you trust yourself and not God.
[00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:58.820]   You think the problem is that you don't want,
[00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:00.940]   you don't have what you want.
[00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:04.500]   So you do all of these things that result in hurt
[00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:06.500]   and frustration to get it.
[00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:09.580]   But James would say, hey, that's not your problem.
[00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:12.080]   What does James articulate is the actual problem?
[00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:15.180]   He says in the end of verse two,
[00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:18.900]   you are jealous for others have, but you can't get it.
[00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:21.240]   So you fight and wage war to take it away from them.
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:23.780]   Yet you don't have, listen to this,
[00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:25.660]   yet you don't have what you want
[00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:28.020]   because you don't ask God for it.
[00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:31.180]   He goes even a step further and says in verse three,
[00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:33.400]   and even when you ask, you don't get it
[00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:35.540]   because your motives are all wrong.
[00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:38.620]   You want only what will give you pleasure.
[00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:41.260]   I think a lot of times you and I, if we're real with ourself
[00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:43.540]   when you think about your prayer life
[00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:46.300]   and you think about the things that you ask God for,
[00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:48.300]   how often is it to meet your agenda
[00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:49.660]   and not to bring him glory?
[00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:53.100]   Like how often on the end of your prayers
[00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:55.380]   is this secret motive in the back of your head
[00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:57.660]   that's like, yeah, God, like I'm coming to you
[00:15:57.660 --> 00:16:01.060]   and I'm talking to you, but you better do what I want.
[00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:02.920]   Like you better do what I'm asking.
[00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:05.680]   You better give me what I want.
[00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:07.960]   But James is saying, hey,
[00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:10.760]   that's not what being a Christian is.
[00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:13.600]   The definition of a Christian is someone who is Christ-like,
[00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:17.540]   someone who has surrendered their life to God's authority.
[00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:21.100]   And you don't trust yourself anymore.
[00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:23.420]   You don't want to satisfy yourself anymore.
[00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:25.660]   You wanna live for God and God alone.
[00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:26.780]   You wanna come to God and say,
[00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:29.460]   hey God, I trust you, whatever it is.
[00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:32.020]   I know I have this idea of what I think I want.
[00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:33.980]   I know I had this idea of success.
[00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:36.100]   I know I had this idea of a relationship.
[00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:38.580]   I know I had this perfect timeline set out
[00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:41.500]   and I think I want what I want, when I want it,
[00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:43.500]   how I want it, but I trust you.
[00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:46.820]   He's a good father.
[00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:49.760]   He wants you and I, he wants his children to come
[00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:51.780]   and make the request.
[00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:54.580]   But that request can't be like this, like, okay, God,
[00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:57.680]   like, I guess, like, no, it has to be like this.
[00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:01.460]   Palms up, open-handed saying, God, I'm coming.
[00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:03.360]   I'm telling you what I want
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:05.300]   and I'm trusting you with the results.
[00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:08.680]   Your problem is, is yeah, you have wants.
[00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:11.180]   Yeah, your heart wants things.
[00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:12.900]   That's not bad though.
[00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:14.940]   Your actual problem is that you're not trusting God
[00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:17.300]   with the outcome of your wants.
[00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:19.140]   You're not trusting that he will actually give you
[00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:20.620]   what you need.
[00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:22.760]   And James would say, hey, here's the first warning,
[00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:26.060]   trust God, not yourself.
[00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:27.140]   I was with a friend this weekend
[00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:30.340]   and just practically in his life,
[00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:32.740]   he's just, he's memorizing the verse in Proverbs 3
[00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:35.000]   that says, trust in the Lord with all your heart,
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.060]   lean not on your own understandings
[00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:38.740]   and all your ways acknowledge him
[00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:40.820]   and he will make your path straight.
[00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:43.260]   And so when something happens in his life
[00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:45.660]   that goes against what he wanted,
[00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:48.660]   he takes a deep breath, he opens up his hands and says,
[00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:51.040]   Jesus, I trust you.
[00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:54.300]   And it's so simple, but I was like,
[00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:56.080]   dang, Matthew, that kind of hit.
[00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:57.300]   Like, that was good.
[00:17:57.300 --> 00:17:59.500]   So I wanted to do something.
[00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:01.300]   Everyone open your hands right now.
[00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:02.260]   Open your hands.
[00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:04.980]   So you're like, what's going on?
[00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:05.980]   This is kind of cold.
[00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:08.180]   (congregation laughing)
[00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:10.340]   If yoga can do it, so can we, all right?
[00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:13.460]   That's not good, sorry, take that back.
[00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:17.780]   So here we go, take a deep breath.
[00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:19.620]   Let's say, Jesus, I trust you, ready?
[00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:25.220]   Jesus, I trust you.
[00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:29.740]   Yes, it's that simple,
[00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:33.940]   but you got to believe it in every situation.
[00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:36.940]   Like, what if we woke up every day and said, God,
[00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:41.560]   whatever it is today, inhale, exhale, Jesus, I trust you.
[00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:45.520]   I trust you, not myself.
[00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:47.560]   Why can't we trust ourself?
[00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:50.260]   Because that war, that war that's going in.
[00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:54.060]   Jeremiah 17, nine through 10 puts it like this.
[00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:57.300]   The human heart is the most deceitful of all things.
[00:18:57.300 --> 00:18:58.780]   It's desperately wicked.
[00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:01.700]   Who really knows how bad it is?
[00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:03.780]   But I, the Lord, search all hearts
[00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:05.420]   and I examine secret motives.
[00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:07.300]   I give all people their due rewards
[00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:09.540]   according to what their actions deserve.
[00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:11.300]   You don't have to sit in this temptation
[00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:13.620]   or this like tension of going, man, I know I'm a war,
[00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:16.660]   like I'm in a war, my heart, my flesh, and then the spirit.
[00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:18.860]   And like, how do I know if this is like God's will
[00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:20.500]   or my will, and I'm so stressed out.
[00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:22.900]   And it's like, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
[00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:27.900]   God is in control, open up your hands, ask him what you want,
[00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:31.500]   but trust him with the results, not yourself.
[00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:33.880]   Trust him.
[00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:39.200]   But a lot of times though, like, I know for me,
[00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:41.560]   trusting God can be really hard
[00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:43.440]   and it doesn't make a lot of sense.
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:45.760]   And there's things that you're like, well, I tried to trust
[00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:48.640]   him and he let me down or he didn't show up.
[00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:51.560]   And that caused a lot of pain and it caused a lot of hurt.
[00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:53.040]   I was thinking about a time in my life,
[00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:57.440]   a couple of summers ago where I, some of you,
[00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:59.040]   like, I don't know if you'll heard this or not,
[00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:01.920]   but like all my best friends,
[00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:04.360]   my senior year of college got married.
[00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:06.000]   And then they all do different times.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.520]   They ended up pretty much in Austin together.
[00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:10.120]   They all kind of live in the same neighborhood.
[00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:12.920]   They're all in their second rounds of kids together.
[00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:15.920]   And there was this season of just such loneliness
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:20.760]   for a summer where I'm like, God, like, what are you doing?
[00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:21.920]   I'm so lonely.
[00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:23.240]   I'm so behind.
[00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:24.420]   I'm missing out.
[00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:25.600]   I have FOMO.
[00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:26.440]   I'm over here.
[00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:27.260]   I'm 26.
[00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:28.220]   Like, what is going on?
[00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:29.640]   I want to find my person.
[00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:30.840]   I want to find my spouse.
[00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:33.200]   Don't you say that a spouse is a good thing.
[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:35.500]   Like a man should not be alone.
[00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:36.440]   Like, where are you at, God?
[00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:38.040]   What are you doing?
[00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:40.080]   And over time, I didn't feel like he was answering me
[00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:41.080]   according to my time.
[00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:43.780]   And so I went on my own way in the name of like praying
[00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:46.520]   and like, you know, asking God, I was like, you know, God,
[00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:49.320]   like, you know what sounds good right now?
[00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:50.320]   My ex.
[00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:54.520]   We've all been there, okay?
[00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:56.720]   You get to that point, all right?
[00:20:56.720 --> 00:21:00.720]   And I'm like, God, I know.
[00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:03.480]   I know that you wanted that door to close.
[00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:06.920]   Like you're the God who wanted that door to close.
[00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:11.800]   And I knew deep, deep, deep down
[00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:14.640]   that God did not want me to go back to my ex.
[00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:16.200]   But I thought maybe if I would knock,
[00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:17.280]   he'd surprisingly open.
[00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:18.280]   So I knocked.
[00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:20.720]   That's, I'm just being real.
[00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:25.180]   And in the name of prayer and trust,
[00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:27.340]   I went around this roundabout way
[00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:28.440]   and I didn't listen to God.
[00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:33.040]   I listened to myself and I trusted myself and I knocked.
[00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:37.200]   She opened the door and she said, no, thank you.
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:38.160]   And she closed it.
[00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:40.680]   Praise God.
[00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:48.360]   But I say that, I say that because after that moment,
[00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:51.240]   I remember being so frustrated with not her,
[00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:54.080]   not myself, but God.
[00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:59.000]   Because I'm like, hello, what's wrong with you?
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.160]   She's a godly girl.
[00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:01.920]   Like the breakup wasn't bad.
[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:03.040]   Like this could work out.
[00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:05.040]   Why don't you want this to work out?
[00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:07.640]   And he was like, because JD,
[00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:11.680]   I want you to see that I am enough.
[00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:15.360]   That I will never leave you nor forsake you.
[00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:17.620]   That I am with you.
[00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:21.220]   That I can meet the deepest longings of your soul
[00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:24.260]   in a way that a human being was never created to.
[00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:26.100]   That's my job.
[00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:29.320]   Trust me, not another person, not yourself,
[00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:30.580]   not another relationship.
[00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:32.280]   Trust me.
[00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:37.660]   And I had to learn in that season
[00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:41.420]   of what was such loneliness to surrender and trust God.
[00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:44.540]   I know a lot of us are there tonight.
[00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:46.860]   What do you need to stop putting your trust in yourself in
[00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:48.180]   and start trusting God?
[00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:52.020]   Do you need to listen to James's warning tonight?
[00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:54.280]   Because if you don't,
[00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:56.280]   it'll set you up for warning number two.
[00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:59.400]   Because when you choose to not trust God
[00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:00.920]   and not trust his heart,
[00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:02.680]   you will no longer see him as good.
[00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:06.840]   And what was once this amazing loving relationship
[00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:09.260]   will start to grow stale and dry
[00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:11.960]   and you'll go looking for love somewhere else.
[00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:13.640]   Which leads me to warning number two.
[00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:15.500]   Love God, not the world.
[00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:17.920]   Love God, not the world.
[00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:21.120]   Verse four, James takes his hard left turn
[00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:24.520]   and he's like, "You adulterers,
[00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:26.800]   "don't you realize that friendship with the world
[00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:28.760]   "makes you an enemy of God?
[00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:29.880]   "I say it again."
[00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:31.300]   I find that so interesting.
[00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:33.920]   I mean, this man is sitting here with a quill and a scroll
[00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:35.400]   and all of that, and he's writing.
[00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:36.980]   And then he's like, "You know what?
[00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:37.820]   "Double tap."
[00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:38.640]   They need to hear that again.
[00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:40.320]   I'm gonna write that down again.
[00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:42.800]   "I say it again.
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:45.700]   "If you wanna be a friend of the world,
[00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:49.480]   "you make yourself an enemy of God."
[00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:50.400]   And I don't know about y'all,
[00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:51.520]   but when I read the scriptures,
[00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:53.880]   a lot of times I like to see things that feel really good
[00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:55.120]   and be like, "Yes, Lord."
[00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:56.540]   Repost on the gram.
[00:23:56.540 --> 00:23:58.400]   But when I see verses like this,
[00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:00.360]   I'm like, "Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm."
[00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:02.260]   And I turn the page.
[00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:04.880]   'Cause I find myself deep down super convicted
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:06.480]   'cause I'm like, "An enemy?"
[00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:10.520]   Like friendship with the world to be an enemy of God,
[00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:11.920]   what does that mean?
[00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:12.760]   An adulterer?
[00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:16.860]   Like a cheater?
[00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:18.280]   Nobody likes a cheater.
[00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:21.040]   Nobody likes a cheater.
[00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:24.420]   And he says, "You're an adulterer."
[00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:25.920]   Why does he use that language?
[00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:29.380]   Like think about how adultery takes place.
[00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:31.820]   No one wakes up that's in love with their spouse
[00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:33.180]   and is in a good, healthy marriage
[00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:34.280]   and wakes up one day and is like, "You know what?
[00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:37.100]   "Today's the day I commit adultery on that person."
[00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:37.940]   No one does that.
[00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:39.500]   No one just wakes up and decides that.
[00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:42.620]   It's this slow, gradual process
[00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:45.060]   where you begin to forget about your love
[00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:46.740]   that you've committed your whole life to,
[00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:49.480]   that you said you and I ride or die 'til the end.
[00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:50.640]   You begin to look at that person,
[00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:52.460]   the things that once attracted you to them
[00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:53.480]   are kind of annoying.
[00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:56.160]   That laugh when she snorted, now you can't tolerate it.
[00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:58.720]   All these different things.
[00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:00.800]   You begin to fall out of love with this person.
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:01.840]   The things that brought you in
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:03.260]   are now kind of getting dry and stale,
[00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:05.240]   and you just don't feel the thing you once felt.
[00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:06.760]   The sex hasn't been as passionate.
[00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:08.160]   The things aren't that good.
[00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:10.000]   And so you start to slowly drift away,
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.200]   and it's like a slow, gradual process
[00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:15.040]   where you're arguing more, you're fighting more,
[00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:17.000]   and then one day you're at work,
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.200]   and you're at maybe like a happy hour function or something,
[00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:20.880]   or you're relaxing,
[00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:23.480]   and you meet a cute girl from the fifth floor.
[00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:26.740]   She's vibrant, she's new, she's fun, she makes you laugh.
[00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:27.640]   She doesn't snort.
[00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:30.720]   And at the end, you're like,
[00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:32.180]   "Hey, we have that function in the spring.
[00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:34.180]   "How about I get your number so we can talk about work?"
[00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:35.020]   And you get the number,
[00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:36.920]   and then you find yourself talking about work,
[00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:38.040]   forcing the conversation,
[00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:40.320]   and then now without your spouse knowing,
[00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:42.360]   you're talking to them, and you see it on Netflix.
[00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:45.160]   Like, they start talking, they start emotionally connecting,
[00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:46.800]   they find themselves alone at the office,
[00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:49.600]   and the next thing you know, boom, adultery's committed.
[00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:53.720]   And then this process begins
[00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:55.240]   where this person now has to live
[00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:57.820]   in this tension of two worlds,
[00:25:57.820 --> 00:26:02.420]   where they're a father or a wife, a mother.
[00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:05.080]   They have kids looking up to them, needing them,
[00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:07.220]   and yet there's this scandal going on,
[00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:09.880]   and they're living in both worlds.
[00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:11.120]   And you know how the story goes.
[00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:13.640]   Every single time, you can't do it.
[00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:15.280]   You can't be married to two people,
[00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:18.500]   you can't live two lives, you get caught.
[00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:22.580]   And James is saying, "Hey, warning.
[00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:26.160]   "When you begin to love the world
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:27.940]   "and fall in love with the world
[00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:29.760]   "and leave your first love,
[00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:31.680]   "that commitment you made with God,
[00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:36.220]   "it's gonna result in so much hurt, so much pain,
[00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:39.600]   "because that's what you and I do.
[00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:41.360]   "You have that camp high experience.
[00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:42.560]   "You all remember that moment
[00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:44.360]   "where you were at youth camp and you went with a friend
[00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:46.320]   "and you decided to surrender your life to God,
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:47.620]   "or you had that moment in college,
[00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:49.680]   "that night of amazing worship that hit you,
[00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:51.160]   "and you're like, 'I'm going all in.
[00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:52.600]   "'I'm going all in with you, God.
[00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:53.480]   "'Take my life.'
[00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:54.800]   "You found yourself at rock bottom,
[00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:56.440]   "and you're like, 'I'm never going back.
[00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:57.620]   "'I'm never going back.'
[00:26:57.620 --> 00:26:59.740]   "And you enter into this covenant with God,
[00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:02.000]   "this surrender to God, this like,
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:03.320]   "what James would say, like a marriage.
[00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:04.960]   "We are the bride of Christ as the church.
[00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:05.800]   "He is the bridegroom.
[00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:07.400]   "And you enter into this deep,
[00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:09.120]   "intimate relationship with God,
[00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:10.440]   "and then slowly but surely,
[00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:11.840]   "when he doesn't seem as good,
[00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:13.020]   "when he doesn't seem as faithful,
[00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:14.100]   "when you can't feel him,
[00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:14.940]   "when you're quiet times,
[00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:16.740]   "when you're reading the Bible and it just isn't hitting,
[00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:18.380]   "when your prayers feel like they're hitting the ceiling,
[00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:19.740]   "when you come here time and time again,
[00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:21.640]   "it's just stale and it's stagnant,
[00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:22.940]   "and you're like, 'This isn't as fun.
[00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:24.440]   "'I can't go out and do the things I once did.
[00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:25.460]   "'I've lost my friends.
[00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:26.540]   "'I've lost everything.'
[00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:29.380]   "And you slowly start to drift
[00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:31.060]   "into friendship with the world.
[00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:33.700]   "And you go back,
[00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:36.360]   "and you fall out of love with God
[00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:38.080]   "and back in love with the world.
[00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:39.800]   "And James would say,
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:42.440]   "'Hey, you're committing adultery on your first love.
[00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:47.980]   "'And if you wanna make yourself a friend of the world,
[00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:51.380]   "'you're knowingly making yourself an enemy of God.
[00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:53.300]   "'I'm warning you.
[00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:54.960]   "'I'm showing you.
[00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:56.680]   "'You cannot be a friend of the world

[00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.700]   And you might be wondering right now,
[00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:01.080]   "What do you mean by a friend of the world?
[00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:04.820]   "What does it look like to be a friend of the world?
[00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:05.660]   "We always say around here,
[00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:09.600]   "Hey, you are the sum of your five closest friends."
[00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:11.600]   Like when you look at somebody,
[00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:13.880]   you are looking at the sum of their five closest friends,
[00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:15.460]   because when you hang out with people enough,
[00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:17.800]   you start to talk like them, act like them,
[00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:20.600]   walk like them, laugh like them, dress like them.
[00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:23.240]   You become the people that you hang out with.
[00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:24.080]   How you doing?
[00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:28.400]   And when you ask yourself,
[00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:31.660]   "Hey, what does it mean to be a friend of the world?"
[00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:33.720]   Well, in the same ways, I would look at a person and go,
[00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:34.960]   "Well, how do their friends dress?
[00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:36.200]   "How do their friends act?"
[00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:37.020]   I would look at you
[00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:39.640]   and you can just do a self-evaluation right now
[00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:42.100]   and ask yourself, "Hey, how do I dress?
[00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:44.920]   "How do I dress?
[00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:48.040]   "Do I dress how culture tells me to dress?"
[00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:50.760]   Like, fellas, do you wear things with like brands
[00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:52.200]   or to look a certain way
[00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:56.640]   to give off a certain image or confidence?
[00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:58.040]   Like, ladies, do you dress a certain way
[00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:00.440]   because the world says, "Hey, like celebrate you.
[00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:01.680]   "Life's all about you."
[00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:03.120]   Or, "Hey, I'm gonna reveal this
[00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:04.620]   "so guys want to come up to me
[00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:06.760]   "and seek, I want to get affirmation from them
[00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:07.580]   "and validation.
[00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:09.480]   "So I'm gonna show a little more skin than usual
[00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:11.080]   "when I go out on the weekends."
[00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:13.740]   Like, what dictates how you dress?
[00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:16.160]   Is it your friend, the world?
[00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:18.700]   Do you do it the world's way?
[00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:20.000]   Or what God would say is best
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.480]   as you honor Him with your body
[00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:25.080]   and with your clothes and with your decisions?
[00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:26.040]   How do you talk?
[00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:30.280]   Do you talk like the world says to talk?
[00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:33.480]   Are you one of those like hard users of the F word?
[00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:37.200]   Like, you're not talking about this people.
[00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:40.040]   You're like, "Ah, Lord."
[00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:43.840]   Do you talk inappropriately?
[00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:46.140]   Do you use vulgarness, slaying?
[00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:48.300]   Do you gossip?
[00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:49.500]   Do you complain?
[00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:53.900]   Do you just talk and talk and talk and never listen?
[00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:56.580]   Do you talk the world's way or God's way?
[00:29:56.580 --> 00:29:57.740]   How do you act?
[00:29:57.740 --> 00:29:58.860]   How do you live?
[00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:00.060]   What do you do?
[00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:01.220]   What do you listen to?
[00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:02.300]   What do you watch?
[00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:03.640]   How do you spend your time?
[00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:06.800]   How you spend your time says what you care about.
[00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:09.240]   And do you care about the things of the world
[00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:10.520]   or the things of God?
[00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:14.060]   Do a self-evaluation.
[00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:16.680]   Do the hard work to do the proper hard work
[00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:20.640]   and ask yourself right now, "Am I a friend of the world?"
[00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:24.600]   Because if you're a friend of God,
[00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:27.620]   if you're around other friends of God who are saying,
[00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:30.080]   "I don't care what the world says.
[00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:31.660]   We are gonna do it God's way
[00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:34.000]   because we have lived and experienced
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.480]   and seen that God's way is the best way."
[00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:39.060]   You should not look like the world.
[00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:44.200]   We have produced in the church today a lot of Christians
[00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:46.040]   that you cannot tell the difference
[00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:48.000]   between the church and the world.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.320]   You could not tell the difference
[00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:53.200]   between Christ followers and world followers.
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:56.200]   They have blurred the lines and it looks a lot alike.
[00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:59.000]   And James is saying here is you cannot do both.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.960]   You can't.
[00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:04.940]   And guys, when I read this, I mean, I was convicted
[00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:08.540]   'cause I thought about the songs I listened to,
[00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:11.860]   the Netflix shows I watched, the conversations I partake in,
[00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:13.200]   the things that I do.
[00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:18.240]   And I'm like, "Man, I don't wanna be a friend of the world.
[00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:21.700]   I wanna be in love with God.
[00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:22.860]   I wanna do things God's way.
[00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:24.300]   I wanna look different.
[00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:27.900]   I wanna be set apart.
[00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:30.420]   I wanna walk like God calls me to walk
[00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:34.980]   because I love Him and He loves me."
[00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:37.540]   So take heed of the warning.
[00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:40.740]   Love God, don't love the world.
[00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:42.380]   Don't be an adulterer.
[00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:44.300]   Don't cheat on your first love.
[00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:48.220]   Stay in love with God, not the world.
[00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:54.140]   The last warning,
[00:31:56.820 --> 00:31:59.340]   because here's was a, just before we get to that,
[00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:01.780]   a verse, verse five.
[00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:04.180]   I thought this was so interesting.
[00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:06.700]   It says, "Do you think the scriptures have no meaning?
[00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:08.340]   They say that God is passionate,
[00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:10.540]   that the spirit He has placed within us
[00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:12.140]   should be faithful to Him."
[00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:15.620]   A lot of your translations there where it says passion,
[00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:17.260]   they say that God is passionate.
[00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:19.860]   Your probably translates to jealous.
[00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:24.060]   Like God is jealous for us.
[00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:28.060]   And what a wild concepts that we commit adultery on God.
[00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:29.740]   We cheat on God with the world.
[00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:32.540]   And His response, like our response to like a cheater
[00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:37.540]   is like divorce, rebuke, push away, exile, cancel.
[00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:39.740]   Everyone around you is like, how dare they?
[00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:41.160]   They pushed them, they unfollowed them,
[00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:42.180]   they get them out of their life.
[00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:44.720]   But God's response is jealousy.
[00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:48.820]   He has this, like how God can have a righteous anger.
[00:32:48.820 --> 00:32:50.860]   He has a righteous jealousy.
[00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:52.360]   And why is that?
[00:32:53.580 --> 00:32:56.020]   Though we abuse His love,
[00:32:56.020 --> 00:32:57.980]   though we go to the world and forsake Him,
[00:32:57.980 --> 00:33:01.520]   why would God be jealous in one us after all we do?
[00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:05.000]   And after we cheat on Him time and time again?
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.400]   It's because He wants us.
[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:12.240]   He's like, "Hey, that's mine.
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:13.620]   That's my son.
[00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:14.480]   That's my daughter.
[00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:15.660]   That's my child."
[00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:17.940]   And He wants a better way for us.
[00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:19.540]   He wants a better life for us.
[00:33:19.540 --> 00:33:21.460]   He wants life and life to the full.
[00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:25.380]   And He's like, "I love you too much to leave you out there.
[00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:26.540]   I'm not divorcing.
[00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:27.660]   I'm not canceling.
[00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:28.740]   I'm not going anywhere.
[00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:30.060]   I'm jealous for you.
[00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:33.660]   I want you come back to me.
[00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:35.840]   Come back."
[00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:38.140]   And some of you tonight,
[00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:39.820]   as you've done your self-evaluation,
[00:33:39.820 --> 00:33:41.920]   you might be like, "Oh, I've been a friend
[00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:45.460]   with the world, therefore I've been an enemy of God."
[00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:48.580]   And the invitation tonight is, "Hey, He's jealous for you.
[00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:50.300]   He wants you back.
[00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:51.320]   So come back."
[00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:53.640]   Come back.
[00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:57.360]   But when you come as you are to God
[00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:58.880]   in the midst of all your,
[00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:00.480]   maybe the shame and the guilt that you feel,
[00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:01.700]   and you're like, "I'm so sorry, God,
[00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:03.700]   for leaving and abandoning you."
[00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:05.240]   And you come back to Him.
[00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:08.500]   Yes, He invites you to come as you are,
[00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:10.000]   but He does not want you,
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:10.840]   'cause if He loves you,
[00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:12.720]   He does not want you to stay as you are.
[00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:15.960]   He wants you to change.
[00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:19.240]   No one goes back to a relationship
[00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:21.180]   and is like, "I'm so sorry I cheated on you.
[00:34:21.180 --> 00:34:22.720]   Let me just continue to cheat on you,
[00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:24.320]   and cheat on you, and cheat on you."
[00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:25.760]   That's not love.
[00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:26.940]   You never came back.
[00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:30.960]   So you come back and you acknowledge who you are
[00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:32.000]   and who you've been,
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.800]   but then, because you recognize that He wants you back
[00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:36.000]   and that love for you,
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.960]   you have no choice but to wanna change out of love for Him.
[00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:41.560]   You don't change to get His love,
[00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:43.400]   you change because you've been loved.
[00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:45.660]   And when you do that,
[00:34:45.660 --> 00:34:48.360]   you have no choice but to wanna lift Him higher,
[00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:51.080]   and higher, and higher in your life
[00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:53.040]   which would be warning number three,
[00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:56.120]   exalt God and humble yourself.
[00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:59.360]   Exalt God, humble yourself.
[00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:00.540]   What do I mean by exalt?
[00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:04.380]   I just mean to elevate Him in your life as Lord and as King,
[00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:06.960]   that you go to Him with decisions,
[00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:08.800]   you go to Him with your love,
[00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:10.520]   you go to Him with the things that you cherish,
[00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:11.660]   the things that you want,
[00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:14.400]   you lift Him higher above everything else in your life.
[00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:15.720]   He gets more time from you,
[00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:17.480]   He gets all your affections from you,
[00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:18.680]   He gets everything.
[00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:21.080]   You surrender yourself to Him and you exalt Him,
[00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:22.980]   and then you humble yourself,
[00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:24.720]   you lower yourself and you're like,
[00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:29.260]   God, I need you, I need you.
[00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:32.040]   That's what humility causes you to do.
[00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:35.960]   And I think most of us,
[00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:37.200]   why James has to warn us
[00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:39.160]   because we spend our young adult years
[00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:42.680]   doing everything we can to exalt ourselves.
[00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:43.680]   Like think about it,
[00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:47.000]   even the best Christians in the room,
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.640]   you want the resume, you want the influence,
[00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:51.960]   you want the followers, you want the sidearm candy,
[00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:53.300]   you want all these different things
[00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:55.880]   to raise yourself up higher
[00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:59.720]   'cause you wanna exalt yourself.
[00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:04.680]   But when you recognize God's love for you
[00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:08.140]   in the midst of your sin, He calls you back to Him.
[00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:10.760]   You wanna come and then you wanna change,
[00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:13.520]   you wanna lift Him higher and lower yourself.
[00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:17.460]   Romans 6 says this,
[00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:20.340]   "Well then, should we keep on sinning
[00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:22.080]   "so that God can show us more and more
[00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:24.300]   "of His wonderful grace?
[00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:25.880]   "Of course not.
[00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:27.520]   "Since we have died to sin,
[00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:30.560]   "how can we continue to live in it?"
[00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:33.540]   Read James 6, it says,
[00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:35.940]   "And He gives grace generously,
[00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:37.220]   "as the Scriptures say,
[00:36:37.220 --> 00:36:42.120]   "God opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble."
[00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:43.180]   So James is articulating,
[00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:46.700]   hey, you've cheated on God, you've ran from God,
[00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:48.500]   you recognize that He's jealous for you,
[00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:50.620]   He wants you back, you come back,
[00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:53.320]   He gives you grace generously.
[00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:55.580]   But the problem with that is I think a lot of us,
[00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:57.380]   we abuse that grace.
[00:36:57.380 --> 00:37:00.220]   We abuse God's love.
[00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:01.540]   When you're faced with temptation,
[00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:03.420]   you're rationalizing with yourself,
[00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:05.980]   you're like, "Well, I could do this.
[00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:07.240]   "I could do this bad thing.
[00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:10.180]   "I could forsake God and satisfy myself
[00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:12.920]   "because grace, grace abounds.
[00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:15.300]   "More love, I get to experience more grace."
[00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:17.380]   And that verse we just read in Romans says,
[00:37:17.380 --> 00:37:18.980]   hey, so should we keep on sinning
[00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:20.020]   so we can get more grace?
[00:37:20.020 --> 00:37:22.740]   Absolutely not, that's ludicrous, that's crazy.
[00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:27.740]   How can someone who says they died to sin still live in it?
[00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:29.440]   What does he mean by that?
[00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:33.980]   Well, he's referring to our parallel
[00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:37.040]   with the story of the gospel, the good news.
[00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:39.060]   That when Jesus came and left heaven
[00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:40.860]   and came down to earth because of our sin
[00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:43.380]   and its separation between us and God,
[00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:46.260]   he paid our penalty, our price on the cross.
[00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:48.820]   He was the perfect sacrifice because he never sinned
[00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:51.860]   knowing that you and I would, and he hung on the cross.
[00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:55.020]   And he died, they buried him, and he rose again.
[00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:58.140]   And he defeated sin, he conquered sin.
[00:37:58.140 --> 00:38:01.500]   And now we get to experience freedom.
[00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:03.180]   We get to experience grace.
[00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:04.860]   We get to experience love.
[00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:08.380]   And I think a lot of us like to experience the risen Lord.
[00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:10.020]   We like to be the same with Christ
[00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:12.940]   and experience freedom and grace and love,
[00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:15.940]   but you can't experience the benefits of the resurrection
[00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:18.720]   without sitting in the reality of the death.
[00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:21.980]   Like so many of you want to experience,
[00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:23.540]   like we want to experience,
[00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:27.620]   I want to experience grace and love from God,
[00:38:27.620 --> 00:38:30.420]   but I don't want to sit in the reality of why I need it,
[00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:32.960]   of my sin,
[00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:37.260]   because I continue to disobey him
[00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:40.780]   and go back to the world and trust myself.
[00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:42.780]   I don't take heed of these warnings.
[00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:48.580]   And so Paul and James, what they're saying here is,
[00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:52.900]   "Hey, when you come back to God,
[00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:54.500]   "there should be a change in you."
[00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:56.380]   Like I said, you get to come as you are,
[00:38:56.380 --> 00:38:58.860]   but there's nothing loving that would allow God
[00:38:58.860 --> 00:39:00.420]   to want you to stay as you are.
[00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:03.460]   There should be a change in you
[00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:06.420]   because of the realization of his love for you.
[00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:08.380]   And so how does that change come to be?
[00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:11.340]   Well, like he lays it out,
[00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:12.860]   like he closes out the section,
[00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:15.100]   which is going verse by verse,
[00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:16.860]   of when you recognize God's love for you
[00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:18.720]   and it produces that change in you,
[00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:20.500]   when you take heed of these warnings,
[00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:21.660]   when you don't trust God,
[00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:24.620]   or when you don't trust yourself and you trust God,
[00:39:24.620 --> 00:39:26.680]   when you don't love the world and you love God,
[00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:28.900]   when you begin, because of his love for you,
[00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:31.120]   exalting him and lowering yourself,
[00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:34.780]   the changes, they look like this.
[00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:35.620]   What does he say?
[00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:38.780]   "Humble yourselves before God."
[00:39:38.780 --> 00:39:40.820]   What does that mean?
[00:39:40.820 --> 00:39:42.700]   Like what I've been saying, it's like putting a posture,
[00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:44.860]   it's getting up every day and like Matthew saying,
[00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:46.200]   "Jesus, I trust you."
[00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:48.860]   Creating that posture of dependency
[00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:50.660]   where you get down on your knees and you say,
[00:39:50.660 --> 00:39:53.820]   "God, I need you, I want you.
[00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:56.840]   "I invite you into my life every day.
[00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:59.420]   "I need you, I want you, I trust you,
[00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:01.480]   "I need you, I want you, I trust you.
[00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:03.180]   "I have no good apart from you.
[00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:05.840]   "I'm gonna try and try again to make life about me,
[00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:08.340]   "but I wanna decrease, I want you to increase.
[00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:11.740]   "I wanna exalt you above everything that I have."
[00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:15.380]   And then he goes on to say, "Hey, resist the devil
[00:40:15.380 --> 00:40:16.960]   "and he will flee from you.
[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:21.420]   "Don't forget that you have the power to resist the devil.
[00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:23.360]   "And I know the temptation seems hard.
[00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:25.100]   "I know the sin seems great.
[00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:27.560]   "I know it seems fun and you'll get a quick fix
[00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:29.400]   "and a short time satisfaction.
[00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:30.780]   "But I know that you also know
[00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:33.320]   "on the end of that sin is guilt and shame
[00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:34.700]   "and you know you don't wanna do it,
[00:40:34.700 --> 00:40:36.840]   "but it feels so heavy and so hard.
[00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:38.280]   "But you can resist the devil
[00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:39.700]   "because you have the power
[00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:41.380]   "of the Holy Spirit inside of you.
[00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:43.540]   "You can say, no, I resist you.
[00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:44.740]   "I'm not giving in.
[00:40:44.740 --> 00:40:48.240]   "I'm choosing God, I'm loving God, I'm trusting God.
[00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:50.780]   "I'm taking heed of these warnings and I'm not giving in.
[00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:52.220]   "I resist you, Satan."
[00:40:52.220 --> 00:40:54.580]   And it says, he will flee.
[00:40:54.580 --> 00:40:56.700]   He'll flee.
[00:40:56.700 --> 00:40:59.880]   And when he's gone,
[00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:03.680]   you now get to come in and come near to God.
[00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:06.760]   That's amazing.
[00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:12.800]   That God would want adulterers, cheaters,
[00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:16.660]   lovers of the world to come near to him.
[00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:21.120]   Because of Jesus, we get to come near to God.
[00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:25.040]   And what's even crazier is he then comes near to us.
[00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:28.200]   When we exalt him, he exalts us.
[00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:33.000]   He comes near to us and begins to listen, meet our needs,
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:35.680]   give us our wants because we are choosing
[00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:37.400]   to make him Lord of our lives.
[00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:41.440]   He says, wash your hands, purify your hearts.
[00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:44.720]   He's talking about confess, be changed,
[00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:46.780]   be transformed, be healed.
[00:41:46.780 --> 00:41:49.120]   Let your life begin to change.
[00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:52.000]   Put off the old self of sin
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.600]   and put on a new life with Christ.
[00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:56.960]   Wash away.
[00:41:57.960 --> 00:42:02.160]   By the blood of Jesus, be pure, be clean before him.
[00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:07.440]   And then this is the part that I was like,
[00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:09.560]   man, this is like a Debbie Downer.
[00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:12.680]   Like to end on this is like, really James?
[00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:15.080]   Here's what he tells us to do.
[00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:19.320]   Let there be tears for what you have done.
[00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:25.240]   Let there be sorrow and deep grief,
[00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:30.240]   sadness instead of laughter, gloom instead of joy.
[00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:36.400]   And I was reading that, I was alone in a room
[00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:39.400]   and I was prepping and I read that.
[00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:41.840]   And I'm like, but wait, I thought that like following God
[00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:43.960]   and like grace and freedom and like love
[00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:46.320]   was supposed to be just as happy life of blessings
[00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:49.640]   and favor and like happiness all the time
[00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:50.880]   and joy all the time.
[00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:53.400]   And like, I thought if I was obedient to God,
[00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:54.640]   like that would be the case.
[00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:57.240]   And the reality is,
[00:42:57.240 --> 00:43:03.200]   the reality is, is there needs to be a season, a time
[00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:07.240]   where before we sit in the weight of God's love for us,
[00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:11.320]   we sit in the weight of our need of God's love.
[00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:14.760]   And I think that we don't like that.
[00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:19.360]   Like I think that we like to laugh.
[00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:20.680]   I think we like joy.
[00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:22.160]   I think we like happiness.
[00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:23.880]   We like feeling good.
[00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:25.240]   And that's okay.
[00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:29.920]   But you know what will make that laughter sweeter,
[00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:31.240]   that joy longer,
[00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:36.120]   is when you truly take time to understand
[00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:37.560]   how you have access to it.
[00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:43.560]   When you take time to sit in the weight of your sin.
[00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:47.600]   And guys, as I was like writing all of this stuff,
[00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:50.360]   here's what I thought about.
[00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:53.840]   Like the Bible talks about how it was our sin
[00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:55.120]   that put Jesus on the cross.
[00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:56.720]   Like he did it for you, you, mine sin,
[00:43:56.720 --> 00:43:58.440]   like because of his love for us,
[00:43:58.440 --> 00:44:00.680]   that while we were sinners, he died for us.
[00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:02.640]   And it says that by his stripes,
[00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:04.200]   like by the whips on his back,
[00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:06.360]   you and I are healed from our sin.
[00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:11.720]   And I was thinking about how when I read these warnings,
[00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:14.840]   and it says, hey, you cannot love the world and God,
[00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:16.440]   and yet JD, you love the world,
[00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:17.760]   and then you try to love God.
[00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:19.960]   And hey, if you continue to sin,
[00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:21.560]   like it's gonna bring you further from God.
[00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:22.840]   And like you're committing adultery
[00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:23.760]   and all these different things.
[00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:25.240]   I'm like, why would I do that?
[00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:28.080]   And right now, I want you to think about the person
[00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:30.000]   in your life that loves you the most.
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:33.680]   Like think about the person in your life
[00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:36.040]   that loves you the most,
[00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:39.680]   and how they would do anything for you,
[00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:41.120]   how they would die for you.
[00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:48.400]   And imagine you walking up and hitting that person,
[00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:54.320]   spitting on that person, whipping that person.
[00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:57.960]   We don't like that.
[00:44:57.960 --> 00:44:59.320]   I don't like that.
[00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:00.400]   I think about my dad.
[00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:03.920]   I would never do that to my dad.
[00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:04.760]   He loves me.
[00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:12.280]   And then I was prepping and I was like, God loves me.
[00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:15.520]   Jesus loves me so much more than my dad.
[00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:21.840]   And James is saying, hey, you need to sit
[00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:25.560]   in the weight of your sins and let it produce tears
[00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:27.800]   and be okay with mourning and grieving
[00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:29.840]   how you've turned your back against God.
[00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:36.360]   And I sat, I sat in it.
[00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:43.120]   I thought about my sin and the stripes on Jesus' back
[00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:47.780]   and the price that he paid for me.
[00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:51.140]   And I thought about how some of us tonight
[00:45:51.140 --> 00:45:54.020]   will hear these warnings and still not listen
[00:45:54.020 --> 00:45:56.580]   and still not believe that God is enough
[00:45:56.580 --> 00:46:00.260]   and that he's worth it and that Jesus died for you
[00:46:00.260 --> 00:46:01.260]   and he's worth it.
[00:46:01.260 --> 00:46:04.140]   And it was just more stripes.
[00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:11.620]   And then when I sat in that,
[00:46:11.620 --> 00:46:15.580]   I then was forced to then sit in the weight of love,
[00:46:16.780 --> 00:46:17.820]   of grace.
[00:46:17.820 --> 00:46:21.300]   God was like, hey, hey, it's okay.
[00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:24.900]   This is why he died.
[00:46:24.900 --> 00:46:26.060]   There's no greater love than this,
[00:46:26.060 --> 00:46:28.460]   that a man would lay down his life for his friend.
[00:46:28.460 --> 00:46:33.000]   This is why he died, so that you could be free.
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:35.900]   And my mourning turned into joy.
[00:46:35.900 --> 00:46:39.260]   My tears turned into laughter.
[00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:41.500]   My sadness turned into happiness.
[00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:43.540]   I was like, thank you, God.
[00:46:43.540 --> 00:46:46.300]   Thank you, God.
[00:46:47.140 --> 00:46:49.380]   (gentle music)
[00:46:49.380 --> 00:46:51.480]   For the way that you gave me out of my sin
[00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:55.340]   and for bearing my sin on the cross that I could be free.
[00:46:55.340 --> 00:46:59.420]   And tonight, I wish that everything in me,
[00:46:59.420 --> 00:47:01.620]   I could end with this hope-filled message of like,
[00:47:01.620 --> 00:47:02.940]   so let's go and be free.
[00:47:02.940 --> 00:47:05.560]   But as I was wrestling with God
[00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:06.580]   of how to close this message,
[00:47:06.580 --> 00:47:08.180]   I think we need to actually sit,
[00:47:08.180 --> 00:47:13.340]   do that self-evaluation and sit in the weight of our sin.
[00:47:14.660 --> 00:47:19.420]   Mourn, appropriately mourn and grieve our sin.
[00:47:19.420 --> 00:47:24.540]   Not stay in it, but sit in it for a little bit.
[00:47:24.540 --> 00:47:28.500]   And let that produce obedience,
[00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:33.500]   trust, love, produce change.
[00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:37.020]   People that once neglected warning,
[00:47:37.020 --> 00:47:40.920]   we now wanna listen to it because Jesus paid for our sin.
[00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:44.180]   And so tonight, if that's you,
[00:47:44.180 --> 00:47:46.620]   if you're going, hey, I've been committing adultery,
[00:47:46.620 --> 00:47:48.980]   I've been running from God and I wanna run back to him.
[00:47:48.980 --> 00:47:50.620]   Don't wait.
[00:47:50.620 --> 00:47:53.620]   As we respond in worship, just take a moment,
[00:47:53.620 --> 00:47:55.660]   sit in it and go, God, I need you.
[00:47:55.660 --> 00:47:58.220]   I need you, exalt him, humble yourself.
[00:47:58.220 --> 00:47:59.060]   Say, God, I need you.
[00:47:59.060 --> 00:48:00.880]   Open up your hands, say, Jesus, I trust you.
[00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:02.940]   What have you not been trusting him with?
[00:48:02.940 --> 00:48:05.840]   Say, Jesus, I trust you.
[00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:07.300]   If you've been loving the world and not loving him,
[00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:08.140]   say, God, I'm coming back.
[00:48:08.140 --> 00:48:09.540]   I love you, I love you.
[00:48:09.540 --> 00:48:11.900]   Thank you for loving me, I'm coming back.
[00:48:11.900 --> 00:48:14.140]   And when you come back, say, and I wanna lift you higher.
[00:48:14.140 --> 00:48:16.500]   And I wanna be obedient and I wanna respond.
[00:48:16.500 --> 00:48:21.740]   Lay down your life, give him your life
[00:48:21.740 --> 00:48:23.380]   because he gave his life for you.
[00:48:23.380 --> 00:48:28.920]   And let that change you, let it change you.
[00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:30.740]   Take heed to James' warning.
[00:48:30.740 --> 00:48:32.140]   Don't walk out of here the same.
[00:48:32.140 --> 00:48:35.940]   Hear the warning and change, respond,
[00:48:35.940 --> 00:48:40.140]   trust, love, and exalt God, humble yourselves.
[00:48:40.140 --> 00:48:42.020]   We're gonna take a time right now just to do that.
[00:48:42.020 --> 00:48:43.820]   And I don't know if this might be weird for some of you,
[00:48:43.820 --> 00:48:45.140]   like if you need to get on your knees
[00:48:45.140 --> 00:48:47.820]   and turn in your chair, get on your knees.
[00:48:47.820 --> 00:48:49.740]   If you need to just open up your hands
[00:48:49.740 --> 00:48:52.060]   and say, I trust you, open up your hands.
[00:48:52.060 --> 00:48:54.460]   If you need to grab some people and get around and pray,
[00:48:54.460 --> 00:48:56.100]   do that, whatever it looks like.
[00:48:56.100 --> 00:48:58.660]   But tonight, I think God is calling the people
[00:48:58.660 --> 00:49:02.860]   in this room and watching to sit and mourn
[00:49:02.860 --> 00:49:04.980]   how our generation has turned their back on God
[00:49:04.980 --> 00:49:06.100]   time and time again.
[00:49:06.100 --> 00:49:10.180]   But the beauty of it is because of the gospel,
[00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:13.460]   we then get to be exalted.
[00:49:13.980 --> 00:49:17.100]   God exalts us, his children, we get to worship him.
[00:49:17.100 --> 00:49:18.060]   So let's take a time to do that.
[00:49:18.060 --> 00:49:23.060]   Father, I know that the weight of our sin
[00:49:23.060 --> 00:49:28.700]   is heavy here tonight.
[00:49:28.700 --> 00:49:31.060]   I know that the weight of my sin is heavy here tonight.
[00:49:31.060 --> 00:49:33.380]   And I know that we need you.
[00:49:33.380 --> 00:49:36.100]   I know that time and time again, we choose not to trust you.
[00:49:36.100 --> 00:49:37.500]   We choose not to love you.
[00:49:37.500 --> 00:49:38.780]   We love the world.
[00:49:38.780 --> 00:49:42.800]   We exalt ourselves.
[00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:44.060]   We don't exalt you.
[00:49:44.060 --> 00:49:49.740]   So I pray that this would be a moment where we come back,
[00:49:49.740 --> 00:49:53.580]   where we lay ourselves down and we say, God, I'm sorry.
[00:49:53.580 --> 00:49:54.660]   God, I need you.
[00:49:54.660 --> 00:49:55.740]   God, I trust you.
[00:49:55.740 --> 00:49:57.180]   God, I humble myself.
[00:49:57.180 --> 00:49:59.300]   God, I wanna honor you with my life.
[00:49:59.300 --> 00:50:01.000]   I don't wanna continue to cheat on you.
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:02.900]   I don't wanna continue to be a friend of the world
[00:50:02.900 --> 00:50:04.300]   and try to love you and do both.
[00:50:04.300 --> 00:50:05.300]   I'm done doing both.
[00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:06.380]   I'm done being exhausted.
[00:50:06.380 --> 00:50:08.500]   I trust you, I love you, I'm coming back.
[00:50:10.500 --> 00:50:15.140]   And that we sit in our need for you.
[00:50:15.140 --> 00:50:18.680]   And that we stand and sing with confidence
[00:50:18.680 --> 00:50:20.980]   because of your love for us.
[00:50:20.980 --> 00:50:24.080]   That you'd send your son down to die for us.
[00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:25.640]   Thank you, Jesus.
[00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:27.440]   Thank you, Jesus.
[00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:29.200]   You are who we bow down to,
[00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:32.200]   who we humble ourselves before and exalt tonight.
[00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:33.480]   May he be glorified.
[00:50:33.480 --> 00:50:34.940]   In the name that I pray, amen.
