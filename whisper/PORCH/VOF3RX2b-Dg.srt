1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,280
 I'll be in Luke 10 tonight if you want to turn there.

2
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:22,560
 I'll start by sharing with you one of my most private fantasies.

3
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,080
 Everybody looked up.

4
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:29,440
 That's funny.

5
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:34,480
 I don't even know that I've ever said this before today, but I have found it to be incredibly

6
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,520
 true even in looking back.

7
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,040
 So here it is.

8
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:45,320
 I want to be Batman.

9
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:52,440
 And you might be like, yeah, that's every guy or lots of people do, but I'm like looking

10
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,320
 back on my life and I realized like this is something that has marked me.

11
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,440
 Like I've like bought stuff.

12
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,880
 I'm coming, it's coming all out in the open right now.

13
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:07,280
 Like I've like bought grappling hooks and samurai swords and, and like vehicles that

14
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,480
 can go off road just in case, you know?

15
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,800
 And I'm just thinking, I want to be a vigilante.

16
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,240
 I want to be this person that is quick.

17
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:21,600
 Like where does he get these wonderful toys that is able to move into any situation, you

18
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,040
 know, kind of lurk in the darkness and fight evil.

19
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,800
 And this is something that it seriously resonates deep within me.

20
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,160
 And there's this show that has become our favorite show that Monica and I watch.

21
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,240
 In fact, we came home early from date night the other day because we're like, Hey, let's

22
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,560
 just go home and, and watch another episode.

23
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,760
 And it's kind of Batman recreated.

24
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,360
 It's about a guy who leaves this city.

25
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,320
 He gets trained in all these martial arts and he gets all this equipment and returns

26
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,760
 to the city to fight evil and redeem the city and save the city.

27
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:52,600
 I want to save the city with all of you.

28
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,720
 We can be Batman, you know?

29
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,080
 And so this honestly, I mean, you could think about this.

30
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,080
 Okay.

31
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,360
 I do think this is something that resonates with us.

32
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:07,280
 I think this is why, you know, we get guys by guns and drive big trucks with big tires.

33
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,760
 You ever, I mean, in Dallas, right?

34
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:16,960
 He's like, dude, wait, why you got a big truck just in case someone gets stuck at the Galleria.

35
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,560
 I mean, come on, get stuck.

36
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,560
 Where?

37
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,560
 Six 35.

38
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,560
 I mean, what are we talking about?

39
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,560
 Stuck in traffic.

40
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,560
 You know, it's like we do this.

41
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,560
 We're like, man, I just want to be ready.

42
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,240
 It's why like Hummers, remember Hummers, everybody was buying Hummers before gas prices went way

43
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,240
 up.

44
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,840
 It's just like, there's something in us that's like, man, I just want something big and bad

45
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,800
 and just in case, you know?

46
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:42,560
 And uh, and so I was, this is how I was going to start the message exactly like this.

47
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,480
 And I showed up this morning to staff prayer like I do any Tuesday and Todd Wagner, our

48
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,480
 senior pastor begins staff prayers.

49
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,760
 This is what we do every Tuesday.

50
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,160
 Our staff prays for you guys and we gather and we pray and everything going on at watermark

51
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,160
 and whatnot.

52
00:02:55,160 --> 00:03:00,920
 And, and uh, and he says, guys, this is how he starts that for guys today, you're going

53
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:01,920
 to meet Batman.

54
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,520
 And I was like, come on, he read my notes.

55
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,880
 And so essentially it was Gary Haugen.

56
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,880
 I don't know if you know who that is.

57
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,080
 He's the president of international justice mission.

58
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:16,920
 And so what Gary is responsible for setting more slaves free in 2014 than any other living

59
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,920
 human being.

60
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:23,080
 And so he works through attorneys, uh, to, uh, shut down brothels, both in the United

61
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:28,480
 States and overseas, all throughout Thailand and India and other places as well.

62
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,200
 He goes and he works through their judicial system, staying and remaining within the laws

63
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:37,840
 to shut these down and to put pimps in prison and people, slave owners in prison.

64
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,840
 This is what he does.

65
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:45,320
 And when we hear it, it resonates deep within us because you begin to get a glimpse of why

66
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,200
 you are alive.

67
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:53,320
 You begin to have a picture of why God left you here after he saved you.

68
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:58,760
 Slavery should not be sex trafficking should not be injustice should not be.

69
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,400
 I will stop it.

70
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:09,120
 I will be Batman like Gary and it, and it, while it resonates with us deeply, I believe

71
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,160
 we forget that the moment that someone kicks in the door, the brothel and sets the slaves

72
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:21,240
 free, there were thousands and thousands and thousands of hours behind the desk doing meaningless

73
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:28,960
 activity or what might feel like menial activity, rather timeless activity of working and studying

74
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,080
 and knowing what we need to do.

75
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:41,640
 And everyone wants a heroic moment, but very few are willing to live a heroic mission.

76
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:45,880
 And that is the call of the scripture, not that you would live for one heroic moment

77
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:50,080
 that you would, you know, get this opportunity where someone bows up around you or you see

78
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,360
 someone hit his girlfriend and you go and you like, yeah, you know, but that you would

79
00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:07,160
 live a heroic mission every day of your life for the name and the glory of Jesus Christ,

80
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,880
 the one who died for you.

81
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,560
 This is the call of the believer.

82
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:19,600
 Somebody asked Mr. Hogan a question and just said, Hey, you know, sex trafficking is kind

83
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,560
 of the cool thing.

84
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,560
 Everybody wants to get involved.

85
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,120
 And he said, well, let me describe it to you.

86
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,400
 You can tell me if fighting it sounds cool to you.

87
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:32,120
 Can you imagine driving four hours in a vehicle to a, to another town, I think Houston or

88
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:41,240
 Lubbock and waiting in the DMV line for hours and doing that 60 times so many hours.

89
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:47,720
 In fact, in this one particular case represented 6,000 hours waiting on a judge in a courtroom,

90
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,720
 6,000 hours.

91
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:54,680
 You weren't even in high school, 6,000 hours so that these slaves could be set free.

92
00:05:54,680 --> 00:06:00,160
 He goes, does that sound cool and fun and exciting and sexy?

93
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,200
 He said, because that's what we do.

94
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,200
 Yeah.

95
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:08,000
 You read in the headlines when we kicked down the doors, but you don't realize all the work

96
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:14,240
 that went into training Batman and equipping Batman.

97
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:20,280
 And if you're here and you have the Holy spirit, you have been equipped and trained to do such

98
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:27,200
 a thing as these for moments such as this, that we exist in very particular moments in

99
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:31,640
 the history of the world that God has kept you here to live and exist in that you would

100
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:40,480
 find your mission to fight evil, to be a vigilante of good.

101
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:45,520
 There are vigilantes in this room right now whom I know personally by day, they are civil

102
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:52,800
 engineers and consultants and school teachers, but when they're off, they are fighting evil

103
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,920
 in our city strategically and they're winning.

104
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:03,400
 They are experiencing victory in a way that you're naive to unaware of.

105
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:11,560
 They are setting sex slaves free, shutting down crack houses, putting drug Lords in prison

106
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:15,520
 in Dallas and in Fort worth.

107
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,320
 If you're tuning in around the country or in Houston or in Fort worth, we're talking

108
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,800
 about our city tonight.

109
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:26,600
 I want you to hear your city because we need lights shining in darkness in your city as

110
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:32,480
 well, just as I will call us in our city to shine in the darkness.

111
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:37,420
 And so we're talking about today, saving our city in a series called unashamed.

112
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,920
 This is week number two.

113
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:43,080
 Unashamed is based on a scripture in acts chapter one, verse eight, where it says this,

114
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,080
 I'll read it to you.

115
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,840
 It says, but you will receive power when the Holy spirit comes on you.

116
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:52,200
 This is Jesus talking to the disciples before he ascends to go and be with God.

117
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,920
 And so his last words to the disciples, this is the great commandment as it is found in

118
00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:00,520
 the book of acts, but you will receive power when the Holy spirit comes on you and you

119
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,920
 will be my witnesses.

120
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,960
 It's the same word for martyrs.

121
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:12,120
 You will die for this mission in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and to the ends

122
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,120
 of the earth.

123
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,260
 And we take in that last section and broke it up into three weeks.

124
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:17,020
 Last week we talked about Jerusalem.

125
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:19,120
 That is the places that you go every day.

126
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,240
 That is your Starbucks.

127
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,760
 That is your grocery store.

128
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,800
 That is your school and your job.

129
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:27,760
 That is the path that you drive all the time that you would shine there, that you would

130
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,880
 be a light wherever you are.

131
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,200
 Today we're talking about Judea and Samaria.

132
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,980
 Samaria is a place that as Jesus's disciples would hear this, they would say, we don't

133
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,620
 even go there.

134
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:43,840
 Even though that's our area, an area, the size of relatively DFW, those are places we

135
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,280
 don't go to.

136
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:51,780
 He's saying, I'm calling you to go to those places now that you would intentionally and

137
00:08:51,780 --> 00:09:02,200
 strategically be a light in dark places are Judea and Samaria places in DFW.

138
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:11,920
 Gary said this morning that a match, if struck, it's hard to see in a lit room, but it shines

139
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,240
 the brightest in darkness.

140
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:19,240
 Wherever there is light, darkness cannot coexist with it.

141
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:24,760
 If you will go intentionally to dark places and shine a light there, you will make a difference.

142
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:32,960
 If we do it together, you will, we will, God through us will change the world.

143
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:36,480
 Change the world.

144
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,360
 This evening we're going to talk about who is our neighbor.

145
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:44,520
 I'm going to give us several excuses that we use, essentially asking the question, what

146
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,840
 keeps us from being a neighbor?

147
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:52,040
 And then before you leave here this evening, how will we love our neighbors?

148
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,800
 I told you we would be in Luke 10.

149
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:58,480
 I'm going to start in verse 25, but to set this text up, I want you to know that Jesus,

150
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:04,800
 he gathers the 12 during his ministry and he sends them out and he tells them, pray

151
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:09,120
 to the God of the harvest for the harvest is plenty, but the workers are few and the

152
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,120
 12 come back.

153
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,840
 And then he sends out what we know of as the 72.

154
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:18,560
 We see this in Luke chapter 10 and he told them in Luke chapter 10, verse two, the harvest

155
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,320
 is plentiful, but the workers are few.

156
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:26,200
 Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore to send out workers into his harvest field.

157
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:34,180
 Go, I am sending you out like lambs among wolves, which would be terrifying unless we

158
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:37,820
 had the power of the Holy Spirit.

159
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:43,540
 So Jesus sends out the 12, then he sends out the 72 and tonight, 2014, he's going to send

160
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,540
 out the 2,500.

161
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:53,420
 I pray to God that he does, that you catch a vision of what a life on mission looks like.

162
00:10:53,420 --> 00:11:00,460
 Everyone wants a heroic moment, but very few live a heroic mission.

163
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:06,980
 I pray that you would.

164
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:12,020
 Verse 25, on one occasion, an expert in the law stood up to test Jesus teacher.

165
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:14,800
 He asked, what must I do to inherit eternal life?

166
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,940
 We see this question throughout the scriptures.

167
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:17,940
 The same thing.

168
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:20,780
 The rich young ruler asked Jesus, what must I do to inherit eternal life?

169
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:24,740
 It's the same question you're asking Jesus, or you've asked Jesus at some point, what

170
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,500
 must I do to get into heaven?

171
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,020
 What must I do to be with you forever?

172
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:32,460
 Jesus, what do I got to do to get my reward at the end of this life?

173
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:35,300
 Now when you hear an expert in the law, do not think lawyer.

174
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:38,540
 Remember, they were in a theocracy, the Jews were.

175
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:43,380
 And so this is a person, an expert in Mosaic law, essentially an expert in the Bible.

176
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:47,180
 This is an Old Testament scholar that is quizzing Jesus.

177
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:51,680
 And it says that his motive is not to sincerely know what must I do to inherit eternal life.

178
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,820
 His motive is to test Jesus.

179
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,620
 That's why he's asking this question.

180
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,960
 Jesus, of course, being God, knows this.

181
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,740
 And he says this, what is written in the law?

182
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:04,260
 He replied, Jesus replied, how do you read it?

183
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:08,660
 Now Jesus would often answer questions in one of two ways, with a question or with a

184
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,060
 story.

185
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:12,740
 In this passage, he's going to do both.

186
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,580
 Here he answers with a question.

187
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:15,580
 What is written in the law?

188
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,820
 How do you read it?

189
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,500
 How do you read it was a question that rabbis were known to ask.

190
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,380
 How do you read it?

191
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,420
 How do you interpret that law?

192
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:24,420
 This is an expert in the law.

193
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:27,140
 Jesus says, how do you read it?

194
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:30,900
 He answered, love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with

195
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:36,980
 all your strength and with all your mind and love your neighbor as yourself.

196
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:39,140
 This is the great commandment.

197
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:41,580
 Earlier we looked at the great commission.

198
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:43,940
 This is the great commandment.

199
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:46,900
 Love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind and strength and love your neighbor

200
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:47,900
 as yourself.

201
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,420
 Jesus said this.

202
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,420
 This is also in the law.

203
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:54,180
 If you don't know, Deuteronomy six says, love your, love the Lord your God with all your

204
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,180
 heart, soul, mind and strength.

205
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:58,980
 And then Leviticus 19 verse 18 says, love your neighbor as yourself.

206
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:04,980
 And Jesus said all of the law on the, of the prophets, which were 613 in number, Jesus

207
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:10,820
 being an amazing teacher, an expert on the law himself said all 613 of those laws can

208
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,040
 be summarized in these two.

209
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,520
 If you would just do these two.

210
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:18,780
 And so this guy answers with these two and Jesus says, you have answered correctly.

211
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:21,860
 Do this and you will live, which is interesting.

212
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:25,420
 I mean, Jesus just said, Hey, if you do this, you'll inherit eternal life.

213
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:26,420
 And we'd be like, wait a minute.

214
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,420
 You got to trust in Jesus.

215
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,420
 His death and resurrection.

216
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,580
 That hadn't happened yet.

217
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:32,500
 But also keep in mind that no one who can do that, who can love the Lord, their God

218
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:36,000
 with other hearts, soul, mind and strength and their neighbors themselves without the

219
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,700
 help of the Holy spirit, who can do that.

220
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:43,660
 But it says he wanted to justify himself.

221
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,580
 So he asked Jesus and who is my neighbor?

222
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:46,580
 Here's what's going on there.

223
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:47,580
 There's this expert in the law.

224
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:51,340
 He's there among his friends to the Jewish people or specifically to an expert in the

225
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:55,020
 law, his neighbors would have been maybe what you think of when you think of neighbor, those

226
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:59,140
 right beside him, the people who live next door.

227
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:01,580
 And so he says, the text says he wants to justify himself.

228
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:02,580
 This is what's happening.

229
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:06,740
 He's like, Hey Jacob, tell him how I mowed your lawn the other day.

230
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:07,740
 Tell him.

231
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:08,740
 Yeah.

232
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:09,740
 Yeah.

233
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:10,740
 I want to listen.

234
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:11,740
 Okay.

235
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:12,740
 Jesus, tell him who my neighbor is.

236
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:13,940
 Show them how I've done this so well.

237
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:16,420
 Maybe you're thinking that you're like, Oh man, you know, I did my roommate's dishes

238
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:19,020
 the other night, you know, even though they left them out, like they always do and they

239
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,820
 never take out the trash, but I took it out.

240
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:21,820
 This is what I did.

241
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,460
 Jesus justify me.

242
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:27,140
 Show them how I've loved my neighbor.

243
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:29,620
 He says, who is my neighbor?

244
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:33,780
 And replied, Jesus now answers with a story.

245
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:38,620
 A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho when he was attacked by robbers.

246
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,860
 They stripped him of his clothes.

247
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:43,620
 They beat him and went away, leaving him half dead.

248
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:49,180
 The road from Jerusalem to Jericho was 17 miles and it descends 3000 feet.

249
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,700
 So when it says he was going down, he was literally going down.

250
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:52,900
 This was a well-known road.

251
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,900
 It was full of robbers that was known.

252
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:58,940
 History shows us this just to show you how smart Jesus is, how, what a great teacher

253
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,860
 is and how this fits in history.

254
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:07,500
 Josephus, a historian from this time writes about this very same road.

255
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:12,500
 In fact, he talks about how Herod, King Herod had fired 40 of his employees and they went

256
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:16,300
 to be all 40 of them went to be robbers on this road.

257
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:21,420
 That this road was called the path of blood by some that many went here to die or to be

258
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,820
 bit beaten or robbed.

259
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:27,780
 It would have been foolish to be on this road, not on a donkey or riding something.

260
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:29,220
 And so Jesus is telling a story.

261
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,220
 It's a real story.

262
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:33,820
 I mean, it's a story that he's making up, but he sets it in their, their scene and their

263
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,060
 circumstance.

264
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:39,460
 A priest happened to be going down the same road.

265
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:41,460
 And when he saw the man, certainly he helps him, right?

266
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,980
 Because he's a priest and that's what priests do.

267
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:45,020
 No, he passed by on the other side.

268
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,020
 Okay.

269
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:49,060
 Now the priest is someone who the expert in the law would have resonated with, right?

270
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:50,060
 That would have been his hero.

271
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,060
 Oh, a priest.

272
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,060
 Okay, great.

273
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,060
 So a priest isn't what he does.

274
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,060
 What?

275
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,060
 Okay.

276
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:58,100
 So to a Levite.

277
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:01,820
 Now a Levite was a descendant from the tribe of Levi, but not of Aaron.

278
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:04,300
 So a priest would have been from the descendant of Aaron.

279
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:07,540
 A Levite would have been someone who helps the priest.

280
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,580
 Okay.

281
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:11,420
 So think pastor and youth minister or something.

282
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:12,420
 Right.

283
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:19,580
 And so a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him passed by on the other side, but

284
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:23,900
 a Samaritan as he traveled came where the man was.

285
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,640
 And when he saw him, he took pity on him.

286
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:31,060
 He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine.

287
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:37,500
 Then he put the man on his own donkey, brought him to an inn and took care of him.

288
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:41,900
 The next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper.

289
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,580
 Look after him, he said.

290
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:48,060
 And when I return, I will reimburse you for any extra expense you may have.

291
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:52,300
 The story just got crazy scandalous.

292
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:55,900
 There's a thousand years of racism going on here for this man.

293
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:59,620
 The expert in the law would have hated a Samaritan.

294
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:06,340
 Jews at this time would go a day's travel out of the way to avoid any Samaritan village.

295
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:12,300
 Samaritans to them represented a time of sin, a time of that their people had mixed racially

296
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:16,060
 with people that they weren't supposed to interact with racially.

297
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:18,320
 And so the Samaritans were the offspring of this.

298
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,280
 They would have considered them half breeds.

299
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,420
 There was serious, serious racism going on.

300
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:26,600
 And so Jesus doesn't just put the Samaritan in the story.

301
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,380
 He makes him the hero.

302
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:32,460
 Now you've got to feel this, okay, to understand what's going on.

303
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,700
 You have a prejudice.

304
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:34,700
 Everyone here has a prejudice.

305
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,940
 I don't know what it is.

306
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:38,860
 That's the crazy thing about our prejudices that we're blind to them.

307
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:41,940
 We can't see them.

308
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:46,740
 And so who is it in the story for you?

309
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,300
 Who is it maybe for you?

310
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:52,860
 Jesus is telling the story and he's like, well, there's this pastor walks by and then

311
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:58,620
 there was this youth minister walks by and then there was a Muslim who came to this man

312
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:04,820
 and he took off his turban and he used it to bandage his wounds.

313
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:10,460
 Maybe your racism or your prejudice is it was a gay man.

314
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:20,380
 Gay man came up, homosexual guy came up and cared for this hurt guy.

315
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:27,220
 Maybe as a Baptist, maybe as a Catholic, maybe as an Aggie.

316
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:30,020
 Hey, don't go there.

317
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:31,500
 Right?

318
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,260
 What is your prejudice?

319
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,760
 What are you prejudiced towards?

320
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,760
 Who would it be?

321
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,760
 I want you to put them in.

322
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,740
 Maybe it's a Democrat.

323
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:41,780
 Maybe it's a Republican.

324
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:42,780
 Maybe it's Obama.

325
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:47,000
 Obama comes and man, you're like, what?

326
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 He would never.

327
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 I don't know.

328
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 Maybe, right?

329
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,060
 I'm saying that's on you.

330
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:56,300
 I'm just saying hypothetically.

331
00:18:56,300 --> 00:19:00,060
 Maybe you're like, it's a telemarketer.

332
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,060
 I don't know.

333
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:03,060
 Who are you prejudiced towards?

334
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:08,620
 Jesus puts that person in the story.

335
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:15,140
 He has your attention and he says, this one was more righteous than you.

336
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:19,240
 This one understands my commands.

337
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:26,700
 This one is more of a Christian than you ever thought you were.

338
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:30,540
 Jesus asked the question, which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who

339
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:34,520
 fell into the hands of robbers and the expert in the law replied, the one who had mercy

340
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,520
 on him.

341
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,140
 He couldn't even say Samaritan.

342
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:44,240
 He just says the one who had mercy on him and Jesus says, go and do likewise.

343
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:52,960
 He's calling us to show mercy to those that can do nothing for us in return.

344
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,300
 And so my first point, the first question rather I want to ask from this text is who

345
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,900
 is our neighbor?

346
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,300
 Who is our neighbor here in Dallas and in Fort Worth?

347
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,300
 Who is your neighbor?

348
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:05,680
 And it says that our neighbor is anyone in need around us.

349
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:10,980
 Anyone who has need around us, regardless of race, religion, background, or social status,

350
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:15,980
 think someone not like you, maybe someone that you're very unlikely to go up to and

351
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:16,980
 help.

352
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:20,980
 Maybe someone you're very intimidated by or someone you think you can't understand.

353
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,680
 And that is your neighbor.

354
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:27,860
 If they have need around you and you cannot miss this basic teaching of the Christian

355
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:28,860
 faith.

356
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,980
 You come here, then you say, I'm a Jesus follower.

357
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,860
 I'm a Christ follower.

358
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:34,100
 But you've missed this thing.

359
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,140
 You've missed it.

360
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:41,060
 You've missed something very key to the scripture.

361
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:46,820
 So what do you think of when you think of your city?

362
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:55,800
 When I think of Dallas, I think of pretentious, pretty, uptown, entrepreneurship.

363
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,800
 What do you think of?

364
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,060
 What would you write down when you think of Dallas?

365
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,220
 What would you write down?

366
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,220
 What would you list out?

367
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,220
 I think of business.

368
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,220
 I think of money.

369
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:05,980
 I think of nice cars and buildings.

370
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:14,540
 I think of clean and contemporary.

371
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:20,500
 But I love comics, particularly comics of vigilantes that display vigilantes because

372
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,140
 they often show the two tails of one city.

373
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:27,820
 They show the poor and the very rich and how they're connected by a bridge of crime and

374
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:32,500
 sex and drugs.

375
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,500
 And our city is no different.

376
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,500
 Our city has two sides.

377
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:39,820
 In fact, I'll tell you one, some statistics of an area less than five miles away, an area

378
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,940
 that when you travel to Fort Worth, you drive through.

379
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:49,300
 Our brothers and sisters in West Dallas, these come from the 2010 US Census Bureau, 67% of

380
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,660
 children born there are born to single moms.

381
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:55,060
 That's the vast majority born to single moms.

382
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,740
 This is in your city.

383
00:21:56,740 --> 00:22:00,860
 The average per capita income is $9,183.

384
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:06,580
 37% of families are living below poverty level.

385
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:11,220
 70% of the adult population has less than a high school education.

386
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:17,700
 I need you to care about that, particularly if you're a teacher or you can read well because

387
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:18,780
 you can make a difference.

388
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,120
 You can be the solution.

389
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:23,580
 Only 2% of the population has a college degree, only 2%.

390
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:27,220
 60% of the population have no health insurance of any kind.

391
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:31,660
 Now let's just talk about Dallas in general because we're here.

392
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:33,460
 That is all about West Dallas.

393
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:36,140
 This comes from the Dallas Task Force 2012 study.

394
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:38,020
 This is your city.

395
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:40,220
 We are the nation's worst child.

396
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,900
 We have the nation's worst child poverty rate.

397
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:45,100
 I did say worst, not one of the worst, not among the worst.

398
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:48,260
 We have the worst child poverty rate in America.

399
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:51,960
 We're the second largest in growth of overall poverty rate from 2000.

400
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:58,560
 We're the third worst overall poverty rate at 24%, but our poverty rate grew by 41%.

401
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,680
 It is a growing problem.

402
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,660
 It's getting worse here in our city.

403
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:05,160
 And this is a quote, "The poverty level in the Dallas Independent School District is

404
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:09,800
 one of the highest in the country, higher than New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Houston,

405
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,800
 and Detroit.

406
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:15,260
 In the last 12 years, the Dallas population has increased by 5% in the same amount of

407
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:22,500
 time those living in Dallas and poverty has increased 41%."

408
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:25,580
 Crime is absolutely on the rise in your city.

409
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:28,820
 94% of American cities are safer than Dallas.

410
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:30,420
 And this was in the Dallas Morning News yesterday.

411
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,420
 Are you ready?

412
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:37,020
 Dallas County is the deadliest place for a woman in Texas last year.

413
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:43,660
 The new report says, "Dallas County is the single deadliest place in our country for

414
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:46,140
 a woman to live."

415
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:50,780
 We have a $99 million sex trafficking industry right here among us.

416
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:54,980
 In fact, there is a brothel half a mile away that we are completely oblivious to as we

417
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:59,660
 sit in this room and we read from the scriptures from a man who tells us to go and care for

418
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:05,020
 the least of these.

419
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:08,540
 Fort Worth, I wish I had a better story for you.

420
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:12,780
 There's lots of grim stats, particularly in the past 12 months.

421
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:14,820
 Oppression for you is up 12%.

422
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:17,260
 Homelessness is up 60%.

423
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:20,140
 That comes from the Star-Telegram and CBS.

424
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,980
 Crime is on the rise in Fort Worth.

425
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:26,420
 Violent sex acts are on the rise in your city.

426
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:30,740
 And one of the most impoverished areas in DFW is right across the street from where

427
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:36,540
 you are right now.

428
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:43,660
 And I know that you'll go to these areas when it's cool to do so, when it's hip and trendy

429
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:45,860
 to do so.

430
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:49,300
 You go to Bishop Hearts or Trinity Grove and call it a mission trip.

431
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,260
 It's there on mission.

432
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:55,020
 Eating food, having fun on mission.

433
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:59,820
 Go to the Fairmount, wherever that is for you.

434
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:05,460
 But all we're doing is we're taking less people that we might consider less fortunate than

435
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:06,820
 us and we're just moving them.

436
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:10,900
 We're just going there and we're raising real estate prices and they have nowhere else to

437
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:11,900
 go.

438
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,180
 They just kind of continue to shift around.

439
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,340
 It's a shell game.

440
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:16,380
 We're not actually solving the problem.

441
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:17,380
 It's called gentrification.

442
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:21,620
 If that's a word that's new to you, look it up later, Google it or something, but it's

443
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:23,300
 something that you need to know.

444
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:26,020
 We're not actually helping them.

445
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:32,460
 We're hurting them by mobilizing wealthy into those areas, not caring for them, not meeting

446
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:33,460
 where they're at.

447
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:36,300
 We're waiting until they're hip and trendy and then we'll move there.

448
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:39,820
 But you might need to move there right now.

449
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:42,860
 But that's unsafe.

450
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:47,980
 The gospel's unsafe.

451
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:50,020
 You know those 12 guys, they all died, right?

452
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:53,740
 You know, not of old age.

453
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:55,420
 Not of natural causes.

454
00:25:55,420 --> 00:26:01,220
 They were murdered.

455
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:06,060
 Seven of them were murdered.

456
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,060
 These are examples.

457
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:09,180
 This is how we know the gospel.

458
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:11,420
 And so what prevents us from being a neighbor to those in need?

459
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:18,060
 My second question from this text, what prevents us from being a neighbor to those in need?

460
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:25,420
 I believe that when you see the hurting, every human being has an impulse reaction, an instinct

461
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:29,500
 that responds to the hurting, depending where you are on a spiritual chart, where you are

462
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:35,260
 with God or where you are, maybe you're an atheist, and where you are with morality.

463
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,780
 You respond in one of three ways.

464
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:40,060
 The first one is to hurt them, okay?

465
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:42,660
 And you say, "Well, who responds this way?"

466
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:45,340
 People do indeed, to take advantage of those.

467
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,780
 You do so usury.

468
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:48,780
 And some of you guys are like, "I would never do that."

469
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:51,300
 You do every single time you've looked at porn.

470
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:58,340
 You're taking advantage of someone in a situation we might consider unfortunate.

471
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:02,380
 Someone that grew up in a parentless home or someone that grew up with resources that

472
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:05,780
 you do not have available to you, you are exploiting them.

473
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:13,500
 You are part of the sex trafficking problem when you go to a strip club, okay?

474
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:17,740
 And so one impulse would be to hurt, to take advantage of that situation for your own personal

475
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:19,740
 benefit.

476
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,220
 Another one would be to help.

477
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:22,420
 I see someone in need.

478
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:23,700
 I want to be a good Samaritan.

479
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:28,060
 I will be mobilized to them to understand their need, to identify their need, and to

480
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:29,580
 meet their need.

481
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:33,180
 And the third one is to ignore it.

482
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:36,620
 All three of those responses are represented in the room tonight.

483
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:39,740
 There are those of you that when you see an opportunity, you're opportunistic, you want

484
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:41,300
 to take advantage of it.

485
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:44,860
 You want to see how you can get it to benefit yourself, how you can make money or profit

486
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:48,420
 from it, how you can find pleasure in it.

487
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:50,540
 You want to hurt them.

488
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:55,020
 Or those of you move to compassion and you say, "Well, when I see someone in need, I

489
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,020
 want to help them.

490
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:57,020
 I want to render aid.

491
00:27:57,020 --> 00:28:01,140
 I want to go to where there is need and help."

492
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:10,580
 And so many of us in the room say, "JP, just let me get back to my normal life in my city.

493
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:11,580
 Let me just respond.

494
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:12,980
 Let me just be naive to this stuff.

495
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:14,700
 I don't want to hear there's a brothel half a mile away.

496
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:17,580
 I might have to do something about that.

497
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:18,980
 Don't tell me these statistics.

498
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:21,300
 JP, I'm numb to statistics.

499
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:28,580
 You just read a bunch of percentages my heart had no response to because I have been ignoring

500
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:29,940
 it for so long.

501
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:32,620
 I don't care that people can't read.

502
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:35,140
 I don't care that people are poor.

503
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:37,660
 I don't care that people are hungry.

504
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:41,300
 I don't care that girls in my city are being raped for sport.

505
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,300
 I don't care.

506
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:47,300
 I just want to sit comfortably on my couch and watch my TV and make my money and drive

507
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:51,260
 my car and go to the party.

508
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:53,100
 Why are you trying to interrupt that?"

509
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,100
 I'm not.

510
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:59,180
 The Holy Spirit is.

511
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,860
 And so why don't we help those in need?

512
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:03,420
 Because one, we're too busy.

513
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:05,780
 It's inconvenient.

514
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:06,980
 It doesn't fit in our agenda.

515
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:07,980
 It takes time.

516
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:12,580
 And to be a good neighbor, we must make margin to be a good neighbor.

517
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:17,540
 Some of you, to make margin sounds like an impossible, daunting task.

518
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:18,540
 How do I make margin?

519
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:22,020
 How do I create time?

520
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:24,420
 You have to follow Jesus as you're following Christ.

521
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:26,780
 I'm not saying to get into heaven.

522
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:34,340
 But to follow Jesus, you have to create margin to care for those in need.

523
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:39,340
 Secondly, I believe that we focus too much on orthodoxy rather than orthopraxy.

524
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:41,420
 Two big words, let me define them.

525
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:44,140
 Orthodoxy, ortho just means right.

526
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:45,460
 Doxy means belief.

527
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:47,540
 Ortho means correct or right.

528
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:50,300
 Doxy means belief, or we get the word doctrine.

529
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:53,540
 And so the orthodoxy, that's the head knowledge.

530
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:57,020
 And so to be a Christian, it is lived out.

531
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:59,160
 We live out knowledge.

532
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:05,180
 We always respond and act according to our belief that you're orthopraxy, right practice

533
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:07,020
 or right action.

534
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:10,500
 And so this man, this expert in the law, he had a high orthodoxy.

535
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,580
 Do not forget that he won the question.

536
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:14,260
 I mean, he won the sword drill.

537
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:16,500
 He won the quiz, if you will.

538
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,580
 Jesus said, how do you read it?

539
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:20,820
 He responds, "Love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength.

540
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:21,820
 Love your neighbor as yourself."

541
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,260
 Jesus says, correct, ding, ding, ding.

542
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,980
 You've got it right.

543
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:26,260
 You know a lot of Bible.

544
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:27,620
 You've got some memory verses.

545
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:29,380
 You study the scriptures.

546
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:34,060
 And all of this head knowledge has missed your heart because you do not respond to it.

547
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:35,900
 Your heart has been calloused.

548
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:41,420
 You've been a Christian so long that you forgot what it means to be a Christian.

549
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:45,500
 You've been taking in information and not doing anything with it.

550
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:48,220
 We have an orthodoxy, but we do not have an orthopraxy.

551
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:50,120
 We do not live it out.

552
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,780
 You even heard those words before.

553
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:53,860
 You even heard the sermon before.

554
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:57,860
 In your heart, you're rolling your eyes like, I know what those words, orthodoxy, orthopraxy.

555
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:03,460
 You've got to wake up.

556
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:07,980
 The priest and the Levite, keep in mind, they're coming back from Jerusalem because they've

557
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,260
 been in the temple.

558
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:14,460
 Do you know that it would have been against their religious duty to help a bloody man

559
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:15,880
 who would have been unclean?

560
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,880
 They couldn't.

561
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:21,780
 Their religion wouldn't allow them to, which is so convicting to me because I remember

562
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:29,100
 a day that so much of my life was geared toward serving the poor and the widow and the orphan.

563
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:34,460
 It seemed like every time I turned around, I was going on an international trip or just

564
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:37,460
 traveling around here.

565
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:38,460
 And now I've gotten religious.

566
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:42,380
 Now I've always got to study the Bible to teach the Bible.

567
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:44,500
 And the orthodoxy is growing.

568
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:51,380
 The orthopraxy is being hurt in my own life.

569
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:58,060
 But God says this is the religion he wants, James 1, verse 27.

570
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:03,020
 Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless as this to look after orphans

571
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:10,620
 and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.

572
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:15,500
 Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless as this to look after orphans

573
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:21,820
 and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.

574
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:23,660
 Why don't we do this?

575
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:29,460
 Thirdly, because we are focused on our comfort, not compassion.

576
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:32,940
 We are focused on our comfort like compassion.

577
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:33,940
 We're just like the priest.

578
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:34,940
 We're like the Levite.

579
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:37,900
 We don't want to get dirty because make no mistake about it, if you pick up a bloody

580
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:41,260
 man who has been stripped of his clothes, you're going to get dirty.

581
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:42,420
 Make no mistake about it.

582
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:46,940
 It takes time and effort to love people who are different than you.

583
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:47,980
 And you might get messy.

584
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:51,500
 You might get dirty as you enter into their lives and as you get to know them and as you

585
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:58,260
 build a relationship from a pure heart, it might cost you something.

586
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:07,820
 And we'd rather have comfort than display or be given to compassion.

587
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,380
 I'll give you a real example of this.

588
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:15,540
 Just occurred, you know, when Ebola came to Dallas, it was just like mad, madness.

589
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:18,720
 Like people were worried and anxious and am I going to get it?

590
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,340
 And this is very ironic to me for a number of reasons.

591
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:25,340
 But do you understand that in the first century church that Christians would have heard that

592
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:27,980
 Ebola came to their city and they would have moved towards that?

593
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:30,660
 They'd have been like, where?

594
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:31,820
 We've got to go render aid.

595
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:32,820
 That's what we're here for.

596
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:34,260
 That's why we live.

597
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:35,920
 We've got to go help out.

598
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:38,340
 And you say, but they would get it and they would die.

599
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:41,140
 And they would say, exactly.

600
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:42,140
 Don't you know?

601
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:46,500
 That's how Christianity blew up in the first, second and third centuries, right?

602
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:50,600
 Christians were loving those that had been hit by a plague that was killing them.

603
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:56,240
 Up in Rome, 5,000 daily dying and everyone left and their families left and everyone

604
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:03,000
 who loved them left and Christians moved in so that they would exchange their health for

605
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 that person's comfort as they died.

606
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,780
 And we hear it and it's moving, but we don't want it for ourselves.

607
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:11,320
 And the world asks, who loves like this?

608
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:17,040
 And they say, Jesus, Jesus.

609
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,620
 Don't you know the gospel?

610
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:27,960
 That he loved me so much that he died for me so that I might live.

611
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:32,620
 And so I'm just a little Jesus in the first, second, third, fourth century.

612
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:35,140
 Christians live this out.

613
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:36,860
 We'll just be little Christ.

614
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:40,060
 And it's somehow in the comfort of Dallas.

615
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:43,460
 The DFW, we've forgotten that.

616
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:48,460
 And we hear Ebola and we're on Google and reading articles and can you catch it?

617
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:51,500
 Can it spread through the air?

618
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,380
 Should I wear a SARS mask or something?

619
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:56,380
 What do I need to do?

620
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:59,380
 I'm terrified.

621
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:04,180
 You know what it means to be a superhero.

622
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:07,920
 Like everyone in Acts 1, 8, when the power of the Holy Spirit comes to you, you know

623
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:12,380
 that you've got this superpower, it's the greatest superpower known to man, you became

624
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:14,380
 immortal.

625
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:16,140
 You know that?

626
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:19,600
 That anybody here who's trusted in Christ in the room, you don't die, you live forever

627
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:23,180
 and ever and ever, that's kind of what we believe.

628
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:27,620
 Like the greatest day that you will ever live will be the day that you go to live and be

629
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:29,700
 with the Lord forever and ever and ever.

630
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:32,980
 It only gets better for you, believer.

631
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:36,420
 You know that, right?

632
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:40,260
 Like you get up there and you're like, he's like, "What happened?"

633
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,260
 Caught Ebola.

634
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:44,260
 "Oh, you're so stupid.

635
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:47,660
 How, you know, didn't you wear the mask?"

636
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:57,880
 You know?

637
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:00,700
 This is why, I don't know if you know this or realize this or have thought about it,

638
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:04,180
 this is why hospitals have church's names on the top of them.

639
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:08,860
 This is why you go to St. Jude's or Presbyterian Hospital or United Methodist Hospital, you

640
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:12,700
 know, all of these names are tied back to the scripture or some denomination.

641
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:15,820
 This is why, because hospitals were born out of Christian movements.

642
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:18,500
 It was Christians who were loving sick people.

643
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:21,780
 They were going and moving toward them and saying, "Hey, how can I care for you in time

644
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:22,780
 of need?"

645
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:26,100
 And then these institutions were built and then hospitals exist and you drive through

646
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:29,900
 Dallas or Fort Worth or Houston or wherever you're at and you look at these hospitals

647
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:32,300
 and they have some church's name on the top of them.

648
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:33,300
 Why?

649
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:39,740
 Because they were founded by churches because it's churches who care for the sick.

650
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:41,940
 Like some of you, you're hearing that for the first time, your mind's kind of blown,

651
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:46,620
 you're like, "Well, I never had thought about that."

652
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:50,660
 It's us, we're the one setting the pace.

653
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:58,820
 And it's going to be, and you've got to hear me, it's going to be lost in your generation.

654
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:04,020
 It's going to be lost in your generation as you seek comfort over compassion.

655
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:09,260
 This will be gone in millennials and Gen Y because, man, we're all about having fun and

656
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:13,860
 a good time and tolerance and, man, how can we just raise the bar on freedom and doing

657
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:14,860
 what we want to do?

658
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:22,800
 Meanwhile, people in your city are dying and you're so Christian you forgot what it means

659
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:29,660
 to be Christian.

660
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:30,660
 I'm not unashamed.

661
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:31,660
 I'm ashamed.

662
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:34,660
 What happened to us?

663
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:42,320
 What's going on in our generation, guys?

664
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:47,340
 I asked Todd, I was with him the day and I just said, "Man, how do you think this,"

665
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:49,700
 because I've seen your pastor here if you don't know who that is, "How do you think

666
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:50,700
 this goes?

667
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,700
 Like, do you think we wake up?

668
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:53,780
 You think revival happens?

669
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:54,960
 You think an awakening happens?

670
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:58,680
 You think our hearts return back to God or do you think this is Him removing His hand

671
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,060
 from us and we fall off?"

672
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:05,860
 And the world that our, the America that our children grow up in is a very different America,

673
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:06,860
 very dark, dark America.

674
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:11,300
 He said, "It depends on how you preach tonight."

675
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:19,300
 Here's what he's saying.

676
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:22,500
 "It depends on how you respond.

677
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:25,660
 It depends on what you do with it.

678
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:35,940
 Do not lose our country, guys, out of convenience and comfort, forgetting your missions, forsaking

679
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:36,940
 your mission."

680
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:53,460
 The third question from this text is, "How can we be good neighbors?"

681
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:56,100
 How can we be good neighbors?

682
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:58,020
 The expert asked, "Who are my neighbors?"

683
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:01,860
 And Jesus responds with a very different answer.

684
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:04,100
 He says, "This is what it looks like to be a good neighbor."

685
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,740
 The guy asked, "Who are my neighbors?"

686
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:09,540
 Jesus says, "Hey, if you do this, then you are a neighbor."

687
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:14,220
 And He's saying, as He's displaying through the Good Samaritan, that it starts with compassion.

688
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:15,820
 This word in the Greek is a unique word.

689
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:18,680
 It only shows up a couple times in the New Testament.

690
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:19,940
 And it's a strange word.

691
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:20,940
 It's hard to explain.

692
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:25,060
 It has in it your bowels because they believe that this is something that happened from

693
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,060
 deep within you.

694
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:30,660
 It essentially is saying when the Good Samaritan saw Him, He was kicked in the gut.

695
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,340
 He was stopped in His tracks.

696
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:38,580
 It's the same word that we see when the prodigal son comes home and the father has compassion

697
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:43,500
 on him and he runs out to him and he restores him back to his inheritance.

698
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,420
 It's the same word.

699
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:47,340
 He says he's moved with compassion.

700
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:52,580
 It starts simply by us actually caring.

701
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:58,020
 We talked last week about engaging and sharing and inviting.

702
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:01,440
 And it's the same this week, that you would engage with someone, that you would care to

703
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:05,900
 know them, that you would share truth in trying to assess their need, and then you would invite

704
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:09,700
 them to where their need can be found.

705
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:10,700
 Or met, rather.

706
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:11,700
 Where their need can be met.

707
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:14,820
 Let me explain what I mean by assess their need because this is important.

708
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:17,740
 Before you leave here, you have to get this.

709
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:25,240
 When I say assess their need, what their stated need is might not be their actual need.

710
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:29,600
 Like when a guy says, "Hey, I need a dollar," that may be the very worst thing for him.

711
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:33,960
 And to find out what is the best thing for him is going to take a relational interaction.

712
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:38,360
 It's going to take time and effort and sincere compassion and actually caring.

713
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:41,880
 The very easiest thing for you to do might be to hand a dollar.

714
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,160
 Let me explain.

715
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:47,040
 When you go to the doctor and you say, "My leg hurts," the doctor doesn't just put a

716
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,120
 cast on it.

717
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,360
 The doctor says, "Hey, does this hurt?"

718
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:54,520
 He pokes and prods and you may have a torn muscle, you may have a pulled muscle, it may

719
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:57,080
 be something else that a cast wouldn't heal.

720
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,400
 And so you don't just go, "Hey, my leg hurts.

721
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,400
 Okay, let's put a cast on it."

722
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,280
 You say, "Hey, let's assess the problem.

723
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,520
 Let's find out what's really going on."

724
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:06,720
 And so when you're talking to someone and you say, "Hey, what's going on, man?

725
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:07,720
 I'm just looking for money."

726
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:08,720
 "Cool, what are you looking for money for?"

727
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:09,720
 "Well, I'm hungry."

728
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:10,720
 "Cool, can I buy you food?"

729
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,720
 "No, I don't want food."

730
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:12,720
 "Okay, let me understand.

731
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,720
 You're looking for money for food, but you don't want me to buy you food?"

732
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:15,720
 "No."

733
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,720
 "Okay, that doesn't add up.

734
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:17,720
 Let's talk.

735
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:18,720
 Hey, do you know Christ?"

736
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,680
 "Yeah, yeah, man, I know him.

737
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:21,680
 Let me tell you.

738
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,680
 You know, this is what I know."

739
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,920
 And you're engaged in these conversations.

740
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,160
 Let's talk about it.

741
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:34,200
 When I first understood this, I made it a goal to, or I used to, when people would come

742
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:37,960
 up to me as a non-believer, it would always be, "Hey, sorry, dude, only got credit cards.

743
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:38,960
 Only credit cards."

744
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,440
 Then I realized I was lying as I became a believer.

745
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,960
 I'm like, "Okay, that's probably not good.

746
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:42,960
 I shouldn't lie."

747
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,440
 And so then I'd make it a game to engage first.

748
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,760
 Whenever I saw someone kind of doing it at the gas station, going from car to car, you

749
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:51,200
 know, I would just engage, "Hey, bro, come here.

750
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,200
 Hey, come on.

751
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,200
 Hey, what are you doing, man?

752
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,200
 Talk to me, man.

753
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,200
 I'm pumping gas.

754
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,200
 I want to hear your story.

755
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,200
 I saw you talking to people, man.

756
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,200
 What do you need?

757
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,200
 What's going on?

758
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,200
 You know, let's talk about it."

759
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:05,360
 As soon as I committed to doing this, like right after I committed to doing this, I bumped

760
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:08,720
 up against one gentleman, or he was at a gas station kind of going from car to car.

761
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,560
 I yelled across the parking lot, "Hey, come talk to me.

762
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,920
 Hey, man, listen, come and talk to me.

763
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:12,920
 Hey, man, are you hungry?

764
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:13,920
 Can I help you?

765
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:14,920
 You want something?

766
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:15,920
 Let me buy you some food."

767
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:16,920
 "No, dude, I'm not hungry.

768
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:17,920
 I'm full.

769
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:18,920
 I just ate."

770
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:22,220
 I'm like, "Cool, didn't see that coming, but all right.

771
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:23,220
 What else is going on?"

772
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:26,640
 And he begins to share with me, and I say, "Let me ask you a question, bro.

773
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:30,960
 Hey, do you know that God loves you so much?"

774
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:31,960
 He says, "Yeah."

775
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:37,360
 Hebrews 13, 2, and he walks off.

776
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:42,880
 And I'm like, "What is Hebrews 13, 2?"

777
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,200
 I'll read it to you.

778
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:50,640
 "Do not forget to show hospitality to strangers, for by doing so, some people have shown hospitality

779
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:51,960
 to angels without knowing it."

780
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:52,960
 I don't know, man.

781
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:56,960
 Dude said, "Hebrews 13, 2," and then he disappeared.

782
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:57,960
 No, he didn't.

783
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:58,960
 I'm just playing.

784
00:42:58,960 --> 00:42:59,960
 He didn't disappear.

785
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:06,680
 I'm just kidding.

786
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:10,640
 Find people who can do nothing for them, for us, rather, and we assess their need, and

787
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:11,640
 we meet that need.

788
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:16,280
 Hey, guys, does this sound familiar?

789
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:18,000
 Is this not what Jesus Christ did for you?

790
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,880
 If you're here and you're a follower of Jesus Christ, at some point, you were flat on your

791
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:24,320
 back, you realized you could do nothing for your own salvation, and you understood that

792
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:29,920
 someone in spite of you died on your behalf, that they paid your eternal price in your

793
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:30,920
 place.

794
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:32,760
 This was Jesus Christ.

795
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:38,080
 This is love, that when you could do nothing for him in return, he took you, and he cleaned

796
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:43,160
 you up, and he loved you, and he cared for you so much that he endured every piece of

797
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:47,320
 pornography you looked at, every dude you slept with, everything that you've done wrong,

798
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:50,440
 every time you've been drunk, every curse word you've said, every movie you've seen

799
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:57,880
 that you shouldn't have, every concert you've gone to, and he died for it to set you free

800
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:59,880
 so that you could be with God forever.

801
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:00,880
 It is the gospel.

802
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,380
 It's 1 John 3, verse 16 and 17, says this.

803
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:05,440
 This is how we know what love is.

804
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:09,840
 Jesus Christ laid down his life for us, and we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers

805
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:10,960
 and sisters.

806
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:15,600
 If anyone has material possessions and sees a brother or sister in need but has no pity

807
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:21,680
 on them, how can the love of God be in that person?

808
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:26,880
 I'm asking you now, what if contemporary Christianity is not what Jesus had in mind at all?

809
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:31,480
 That we would go to these places and enjoy fun and fellowship, and then we'd go home

810
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:35,040
 and live our lives, and then we'd go back and enjoy fun and fellowship, and we'd be

811
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,240
 like, "Is the speaker good?

812
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,240
 Is the worship good?

813
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:38,240
 Are the seats comfortable?

814
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,480
 Do they have coffee?"

815
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:44,360
 What if that's just not what Jesus had in mind?

816
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:45,720
 I don't think it is, by the way.

817
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:50,240
 I've kind of spent some time reading this book, and I think he had something really,

818
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:52,460
 really different in mind.

819
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:58,640
 He never wanted to create an audience but an army.

820
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:01,920
 At the porch, we are not an audience.

821
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:10,300
 We are an army, an army of vigilantes that exist to live within the law to fight evil.

822
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:14,400
 We do so by day and night wherever we are, not just shining a light where we are, but

823
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:15,400
 we go to darkness.

824
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:18,720
 We run towards it, and we shine lights there.

825
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:19,720
 We change it.

826
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:22,480
 We are the solution.

827
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:29,240
 We are his plan A, and there's no plan B. I've seen people do this here.

828
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:39,120
 My friends Chital and Christy, two ordinary girls here.

829
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:42,420
 Their hearts stirred with compassion around a problem that they saw in their city, and

830
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:46,080
 they said, "We will give our lives to solving it.

831
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:51,960
 We'll do everything within our power to extinguish that problem."

832
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:53,960
 And it's not brute force.

833
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:56,440
 Everybody thinks about kicking in some door and bursting in.

834
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:58,320
 It takes brains.

835
00:45:58,320 --> 00:45:59,320
 It takes smarts.

836
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:01,560
 It takes the gifts and the talents that you've been entrusted.

837
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:02,720
 You say, "What can I do?

838
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:03,720
 I don't know."

839
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:05,280
 Some people say, "What can we do?"

840
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:08,860
 Others say, "What can we do?"

841
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:13,800
 You might need to paint a picture or write a song, write a story, write a blog.

842
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:16,160
 You might need to go to some place you've never been.

843
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,840
 You might need to tutor some kid in math.

844
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:18,840
 Maybe you're good at math.

845
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:22,000
 They need math tutors.

846
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,080
 Maybe brute force is what you bring to the table.

847
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:25,240
 We need that too.

848
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:29,960
 We need that too.

849
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:33,000
 I don't know what you have to offer.

850
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:38,080
 Ryan Wall, normal dude, man, just a regular porch goer, stumbled in here, heard an announcement

851
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:43,520
 where we needed someone to go to South Dallas to build a playground.

852
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,400
 He went building a playground, met Chris.

853
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:47,040
 Chris said, "Hey, come to Nicaragua with me."

854
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,040
 Ryan said, "Okay."

855
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:49,920
 They go overseas serving the poor.

856
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:50,920
 They come back to Dallas.

857
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:53,560
 Ryan's like, "We got to do this here."

858
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:57,860
 Goes to Haiti with me, catches a vision for what it looks like to serve your city and

859
00:46:57,860 --> 00:47:02,720
 starts to immobilize young adults, regular people just like you who are in the room right

860
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:06,960
 now who said, "We will be vigilantes in our city.

861
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:09,680
 We will fight evil in our city."

862
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:14,200
 They just go throughout the city working with our trusted ministry partners to care for

863
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:20,960
 the poor, to care for the widows, to fight sex trafficking, to care for those that have

864
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:24,240
 been taken advantage of, to care for the fatherless.

865
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:27,260
 They say, "We will give our lives to this.

866
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:30,480
 We will do this instead of the club, instead of the bar, instead of whatever the world

867
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:31,480
 is.

868
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:32,480
 How do I create margins?"

869
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:38,240
 Start doing that stupid stuff and start doing this.

870
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:48,000
 Turn off the TV, shut the book maybe, and start making war because it's going on with

871
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,480
 or without you.

872
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:53,200
 I need some of you to step in the game.

873
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:57,960
 You're like, "Okay, what can I do?"

874
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:01,240
 Some of you have moved to West Dallas.

875
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:03,820
 Maybe you should do that.

876
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:07,700
 Some of you begin to mentor kids through Mercy Street Ministries.

877
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:08,700
 Maybe you could do that.

878
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:10,440
 Some of you have begun to coach their games.

879
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:14,920
 Maybe you're just a good referee or an umpire and work through Mercy Street to do that.

880
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:16,580
 Some of you have gone to Brother Bill's.

881
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:22,440
 My boy Phil goes to Brother Bill's for the first time, raises a bunch of money and people.

882
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:25,640
 It's a free grocery store for those that are in need.

883
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:29,080
 He starts delivering these groceries with Molly and Jennifer.

884
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:31,160
 They go to this one man's house and they share the gospel.

885
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:32,160
 Now the man's a believer.

886
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:35,120
 He trusted in Christ and he's going to be in heaven with them one day.

887
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:38,680
 Now they're friends.

888
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:39,680
 You're sitting on the outside.

889
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:42,680
 You're watching this, being entertained like the angels.

890
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:45,880
 That's the angels' entertainment, not your entertainment.

891
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:50,000
 We're to be a part of the game, a part of the solution.

892
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:58,600
 Maybe you can volunteer as a mentor or tutor the students in our partner Cornerstone School,

893
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:00,440
 Crossroads Academy.

894
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:04,880
 My friend Christy Lichtenberg works, one of my heroes, who drives down to South Dallas

895
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:08,400
 from Carrollton every single day against popular opinion.

896
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:15,640
 She's been shot at, fought, cursed at.

897
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:20,080
 Tiny little woman who said, "Man, these kids need someone to love them.

898
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:21,080
 I'll do it.

899
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:24,580
 I'll give my life to this."

900
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:27,880
 Maybe you join hundreds of young adults serving in Second Saturday, which just happens to

901
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:31,920
 be this Saturday, to help rebuild our cities in some areas, some of the poorest areas in

902
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:32,920
 our community.

903
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:36,720
 You can sign up in the Welcome Center.

904
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:40,820
 And I have a specific thing that you can do tonight is you can go to an unashamed meeting

905
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:45,420
 in the loft and you can hear more of Ryan Walsh's story, more of how God has used him

906
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:47,360
 as we're going to do another unashamed weekend.

907
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:49,780
 Maybe that's step one.

908
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:52,460
 If you're like, "Hey, I don't know the gifts and the talents that the Lord has entrusted

909
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:55,640
 me to use," you go to your Find Your Mission class.

910
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:56,640
 It's Monday.

911
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:59,600
 This Monday, 7.30 or 7 p.m., I believe.

912
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:02,320
 More information there on the Porch app.

913
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:03,320
 That's step one.

914
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:06,320
 If you've done that and you're like, "Hey, I know what I'm supposed to do," you go to

915
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:08,000
 unashamed because here's the deal.

916
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,240
 You were made for this.

917
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:12,320
 It's why God left you here.

918
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:15,120
 You were equipped for such a time as this.

919
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:19,840
 Let me explain and I'll close.

920
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:24,120
 I'll wrap up.

921
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:25,120
 I love motorcycles.

922
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:26,840
 Weird thing to say.

923
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:29,200
 I always have as long as I could drive.

924
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:30,200
 I've always liked motorcycles.

925
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:31,360
 I've always had one.

926
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:35,120
 I've had over 20, just truth be told.

927
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:37,200
 I really like the idea of motorcycles.

928
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:42,360
 I don't ride them anymore because I've come to the light.

929
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:44,520
 I'm now a scooter man.

930
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:48,160
 Scooters are better.

931
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:49,160
 Here's what happened.

932
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:52,000
 I was on a motorcycle once and I hit a pothole.

933
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,320
 That's just bad news on a motorcycle.

934
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:58,000
 I went airborne and then I was kind of shaking up and I was like, "I don't want to ride motorcycles

935
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
 anymore."

936
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,000
 I came to scooters.

937
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,080
 There's one particular scooter.

938
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:05,360
 I'm going somewhere with this.

939
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:06,360
 I'm Batman.

940
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:09,520
 There's one particular scooter that I really like.

941
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:12,600
 It's called the Big Ruckus.

942
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:13,600
 I had it.

943
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:17,400
 It has these big tires, big fat knobby tires.

944
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:20,560
 It's like this all steel frame, these huge shocks.

945
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:23,000
 It's kind of this off-road scooter.

946
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:27,120
 It's really industrial scooter, something Batman would drive.

947
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:32,520
 When I had it, I would notice that I was driving and I was once afraid of these potholes, but

948
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:36,920
 I realized that as I was driving down the road and I see potholes on my Big Ruckus,

949
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:42,680
 I'd kind of move toward them because potholes on the Ruckus are fun.

950
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:43,680
 Why?

951
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:47,000
 Because it's built for such a thing.

952
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
 That's you.

953
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:52,000
 If you're here and you have the power of the Holy Spirit, you've been built for such a

954
00:51:52,000 --> 00:52:00,200
 thing and you're wasting your life if you don't go and shine light in dark areas.

955
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:06,240
 You're like a dirt bike on 635, which I saw the other day, and it looked very out of place.

956
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:07,240
 It's out of place.

957
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:09,600
 That's not where you belong.

958
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:14,760
 You can be there by day, but when you're off, you go and you find people in need and you

959
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:15,920
 meet that need.

960
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:20,440
 You engage with them and you care for them and you build relationships with them because

961
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:22,720
 you have been equipped for this.

962
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:29,300
 You have been invited into being Batman, being greater than Batman.

963
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:31,000
 You are immortal.

964
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,600
 Batman wasn't immortal.

965
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:34,680
 You will live forever.

966
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:38,680
 Let me pray.

967
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:45,840
 Father, I pray that you would stir our hearts around such a message.

968
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:52,640
 As Jesus sent out the 12 and then the 72, I pray tonight, Lord, that you would send

969
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:55,640
 out the 2,500.

970
00:52:55,640 --> 00:53:05,880
 2,500 young adults just like the apostles, just like the disciples, armed with the Holy

971
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:11,240
 Spirit and the Word and gifts and talents that you've entrusted to them for such a time

972
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:12,240
 as this.

973
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:17,280
 Father, help us not to waste our lives, but to live it for you, loving you with all of

974
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:22,960
 our heart and our soul and our mind and our strength and loving our neighbor as ourself.

975
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:25,240
 I love how you said as ourself.

976
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:31,520
 You knew how narcissistic we would be, that we would love our neighbor as we love ourself.

977
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:34,760
 Would you help us do that in Jesus' name?

978
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:37,760
 Amen.

979
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:40,240
 They're going to read about you in history books.

980
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:44,000
 It's a fact.

981
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,920
 Will be a fact.

982
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:50,120
 They're going to read about you in history books.

983
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:57,720
 It will read something like this millennial generation rose up and tried to overcorrect

984
00:53:57,720 --> 00:54:02,000
 something from its parents' generation.

985
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:10,220
 They were inoculated to truth that they stopped believing and they lost our country to values

986
00:54:10,220 --> 00:54:16,640
 that were very different than the values that our country was built on.

987
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:22,600
 Or it will read this generation rose up and corrected something they saw in their parents

988
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:32,080
 and they returned a nation's values back to the very values that it was built on.

989
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:36,500
 And I promise there's enough of you in this room to make a difference.

990
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:41,280
 If you don't believe me, try me.

991
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:42,280
 Try me.

992
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:44,520
 We're doing everything we can with affinity groups and Unashamed.

993
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:49,400
 We're doing everything we can to reproduce disciples that will reproduce disciples so

994
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:51,840
 that you would give your life away for this cause.

995
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:56,120
 And if we can help you, if there's anything special you think, "Hey, I'm a really special

996
00:54:56,120 --> 00:55:00,260
 case and need some really special attention," fine.

997
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:01,640
 We're open, we're ready, we're willing.

998
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:02,640
 Let's talk.

999
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:03,080
 Let's figure it out.

1000
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:14,080
 [silence]
