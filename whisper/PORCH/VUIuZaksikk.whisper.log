[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:26.980]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:27.640]   All right.
[00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:28.920]   Hey, it's porch day.
[00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.400]   How we feeling?
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.840]   Yes.
[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:34.880]   I feel similarly.
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.360]   It's so good to be back.
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.720]   You know, I look forward to every single Tuesday,
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.640]   and I'm so glad that you chose to be here with us.
[00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.080]   We've also got some very special friends joining us
[00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.920]   from around the nation.
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.760]   We have Porch Live locations tuning in,
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.000]   and we want to give a special shout out to Porch Live Dayton
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.760]   and Porch Live Des Moines.
[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:53.560]   We love you guys.
[00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.880]   Thanks so much for being here with us.
[00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.800]   Hey, tonight we're starting a brand new series,
[00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:58.880]   and it's going to be great.
[00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.080]   I'm excited about it.
[00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.200]   But to kick things off, I just want to lead off with a story.
[00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.120]   The beginning of this year, I found myself
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.200]   in the midst of the most stressful situation
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.400]   I've probably encountered in the last year or so.
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.480]   My car decided to break down.
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.760]   Very unexpectedly, something that I was not
[00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.400]   planning for at all-- you know, we're
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.280]   good stewards of our finances, and so we
[00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.680]   were saving up for the day when we would buy another one.
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.440]   But you know, my engine failed.
[00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.280]   And so it was time to buy a new vehicle.
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.860]   And I needed to do it quick, because it
[00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.480]   was in the middle of our move to Dallas.
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.560]   You know, whenever you transition tests, trials,
[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.400]   they come a mini.
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.280]   And so this was one of the many that we found ourselves facing.
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.640]   And so we decided, OK, we've got to find a car.
[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.040]   And so I immediately got to work.
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.360]   I needed to find something that was easy on the pocketbook,
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.680]   that was reliable to drive, gently used, no damage at all.
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.000]   And so I started hunting it down, you know?
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.320]   And what you would expect, given that criteria,
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.640]   is that I was probably looking for a nice family sedan,
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.160]   a Toyota Corolla, you know, or a Honda Civic.
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:13.000]   That's what your mind would naturally run to.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.520]   My mind's different.
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:23.360]   I naturally ran to a 1990s single cab Ford pickup truck.
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.080]   You know?
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.620]   The heart wants what the heart wants,
[00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:26.620]   and that's what I wanted.
[00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.840]   And so I applied myself, man.
[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.040]   Like, I put myself to the test.
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.760]   I went to work trying to hunt down this unicorn of a vehicle.
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.400]   And what I found is that I was spending
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.720]   an obsessive amount of time on things
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.360]   like Craigslist, and Facebook Marketplace, and AutoTrader.
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.400]   Anywhere I could look, I was looking,
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.360]   because I wanted so desperately to find this truck.
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.200]   It's the one thing that I wanted most of all.
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.960]   And yet, no matter how hard I looked, I could not find it.
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.300]   At least not one that met the specs I needed.
[00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.720]   Again, my criteria was I needed to be reliable.
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.240]   I needed to have zero damage.
[00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.120]   I need something that's somewhere less than 100,000
[00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.040]   miles, you know?
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.800]   And it needs to be easy on the pocketbook.
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.520]   Like, there's a lot of trucks out there,
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.720]   but not many that are 34 years old that meet that criteria.
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.080]   And so I wisened up, you know?
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.660]   And I decided, OK, I probably just need
[00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.000]   to change my search criteria.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.440]   I need to stop looking for trucks,
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.640]   and I need to start looking for nice family sedans.
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.960]   And so within a matter of a couple of days, I found one.
[00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:43.000]   I found a 2010 Ford Fusion.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.760]   Yeah, man.
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:44.280]   It's OK.
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.680]   Save your pity laugh, pity applause.
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:48.960]   It met my criteria, OK?
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.560]   66,000 miles.
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.280]   It was cheaper than dirt to buy.
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.360]   And I decided, OK, let me test drive the thing.
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.520]   Let me pick it up and get it mechanically inspected.
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.280]   I'll visit with the owner, and we can agree on a price.
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.440]   And it was all but a done deal.
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.440]   That is until I found this.
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.920]   [CHEERING]
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.440]   You can actually cheer for this one,
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.080]   because this met my search criteria.
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.840]   And so I bought it.
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.040]   [CHEERING]
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.440]   Now, how did I find this?
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.880]   Like, all hope was lost, you know?
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.240]   I had been on the hunt, working the grind,
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.600]   trying to find this thing to no avail.
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.360]   So how did I actually find it?
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.280]   In the 11th hour, I persevered.
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.840]   When other men would have given up and settled
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.800]   for lesser glory, I decided to keep after it.
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.160]   And what I found was the one thing
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.440]   that I'd been seeking after.
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:59.920]   You see, I decided not to settle for just anything,
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:03.880]   but I persisted in seeking the one thing that was actually
[00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.480]   worthy of my wanting.
[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.640]   Why do I tell you that tonight?
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.360]   Well, first, I really just wanted
[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.560]   to show you my new truck.
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.080]   I'm really proud of it.
[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.560]   And it is just as amazing as you would expect.
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.400]   But then, two, I share that with you,
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.200]   because God has told us of all the things
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.680]   that we could seek in this life--
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.240]   and there are many things that we could seek in this life.
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.400]   We could seek popularity.
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.120]   We could seek influence, approval, power, success,
[00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.280]   advancement.
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.000]   Of all the things we could seek, God
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   has made it clear that there is one thing worthy of seeking
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.880]   most of all.
[00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.800]   This is what he's revealed by way of his word.
[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.440]   You see, he's told us there's something
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.240]   that should claim the top spot in our life, something
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.120]   that we should obsess to find.
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:59.520]   And tonight, he wants to reveal it to you and I.
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.120]   And the place that he does it is in Psalm chapter 27.
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:04.880]   So if you have a Bible, you can pull it out.
[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.760]   You can turn with me to Psalm chapter 27
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.400]   while you're doing that.
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.120]   Tonight, we're starting a brand new series called Essential,
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.560]   where we want to unpack what God claims to be--
[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:18.520]   what God claims is the most important pursuit in your life.
[00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.840]   Like, amidst all the things in life
[00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:24.840]   you could spend your time chasing,
[00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:28.080]   God wants to make clear what's the one thing you should
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.880]   spend your life chasing.
[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.920]   That's what this series is all about.
[00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:34.760]   When you read through the Bible, there
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:39.720]   are five one-thing statements that
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:43.920]   help us to realize the one thing that brings everything
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:45.080]   else into focus.
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.840]   This is the goal of the series.
[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:50.600]   It's to simplify your seeking after that
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.880]   which is most important.
[00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:58.640]   And so we see in Psalm 27, starting in verse 4,
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:06.240]   these words, "One thing have I asked of the Lord,
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:10.120]   that will I seek after, that I may dwell in the house
[00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:12.920]   of the Lord all the days of my life,
[00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:15.280]   to gaze upon the beauty of the Lord,
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:18.520]   and to inquire in his temple."
[00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:21.480]   You see, at the time that David, who is the author of the Psalm,
[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:25.440]   is writing out this Psalm, what we know
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:28.280]   is that most scholars believe David
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:31.280]   was fleeing through the wilderness from King Saul,
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.480]   which if you look at the record books,
[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:37.800]   would have dated him somewhere between 22 and 30 years old.
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:40.360]   For reference, that would put David,
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:44.520]   the author of this Psalm, in this room.
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.080]   He's your age.
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:49.400]   He's a young adult. And what he just said
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.960]   is something that feels comical to read.
[00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.240]   He just said, hey, there's one thing
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:57.320]   that I'm really after, one thing that I'm obsessing to find,
[00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:00.080]   one thing that I'm asking of God.
[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:02.720]   And it feels comical because who in here would say
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:07.240]   there's only one thing you want God to help you out with?
[00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:08.520]   Nobody.
[00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:11.920]   Like I asked for more than one thing today from God already,
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:14.080]   and I'm the guy standing on stage.
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:16.960]   You know, like not a single one of us
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:18.600]   between 22 and 30 years old,
[00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:20.720]   identifying as young adults would sit here tonight
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:21.920]   and say, yeah, there's only one thing
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.520]   I really want from God.
[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:27.120]   No, like in the sea of all our busyness,
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:30.520]   we need God for a lot.
[00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:33.120]   We want so much from God
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:36.960]   because of all it is that we're underneath.
[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:40.040]   You see, the world is demanding your attention.
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:42.720]   But hear me on this.
[00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:49.720]   Whatever you give your attention to is commanding your life.
[00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:54.400]   The world is demanding your attention.
[00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:56.600]   Hey, look over here, pay attention to me,
[00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.080]   pursue this thing instead.
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:03.120]   But whatever it is you give your attention to
[00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:07.880]   is commanding your life.
[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:11.120]   It's like when you go grocery shopping.
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:13.600]   I was thinking about this earlier too.
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.600]   It's the third grocery illustration
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:17.800]   I've used in three sermons.
[00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:19.040]   I need some new material.
[00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:23.720]   But when you go grocery shopping, what do you do?
[00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:27.400]   You walk in with a list prepared.
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:28.240]   Why?
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:29.560]   If you don't have a list,
[00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:32.480]   that's the quickest route to spending more money
[00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:35.000]   and gaining unwanted weight, right?
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.120]   Because everything in the store is saying,
[00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:40.520]   buy me, pick me up, put me in the car.
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:41.520]   Like that's everything.
[00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:44.640]   It's all window shopping and window dressing.
[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:46.680]   So you don't walk in there without a list.
[00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:48.440]   That would be foolish.
[00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:52.360]   You walk in prepared because you know
[00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:55.080]   everything in the store is going to demand my attention.
[00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:59.040]   And so since my attention commands my life,
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.800]   since it drives my decisions,
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:04.520]   let me determine in advance what my attention should go to,
[00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:08.760]   what is actually deserving of my priority.
[00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:14.520]   You see, if that's true,
[00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:19.480]   we should do ourselves the service of asking tonight,
[00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:22.040]   what is it that you're giving your attention away to?
[00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:25.560]   Like David's got one thing he's focusing on,
[00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:27.560]   but what are the myriad of things,
[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:28.760]   the multitude of things
[00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:31.240]   that you're actually giving yourself away to,
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:32.360]   that you're thinking about,
[00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:34.760]   that stirs up all the emotions you feel,
[00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:36.720]   that leaves you sleepless in the evening,
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:38.760]   that you wake up in the morning already thinking about,
[00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:40.280]   what are those things?
[00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:42.920]   Because those are the things
[00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:45.800]   that have already called for your attention.
[00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:51.120]   You see, David is telling us tonight,
[00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:52.200]   of all those things,
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:56.520]   there's one thing that's actually worthy
[00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:58.640]   of paying attention to.
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:02.000]   And for him, as he says it here in verse four,
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.280]   it's to dwell in the house of the Lord
[00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:08.360]   all the days of your life.
[00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:10.000]   So you tell me I'm supposed to just go to church
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.640]   every single day for the rest of my life?
[00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:15.480]   No, that's not what David's talking about.
[00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:18.920]   It sounds like it because it is religious rhetoric.
[00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:19.960]   And yet what you need to know
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:21.760]   is when David talks about the house of the Lord,
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:22.800]   what he's talking about
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:26.000]   is he's talking about the tabernacle in his context.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.840]   It's where the presence of God dwelt.
[00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:30.400]   And so David is saying, hey,
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:35.160]   the tabernacle, where God's presence is,
[00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:37.080]   that's where I wanna be.
[00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:39.240]   I wanna give all of myself,
[00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:43.440]   my singular focus and my undivided pursuit
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:44.760]   to being in that place.
[00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:45.640]   That's where I wanna be.
[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:47.640]   This is what David is pointing to.
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:52.320]   He is saying that God's presence is the priority.
[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:56.840]   Like all David wants is to be near to God.
[00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:58.520]   He just wants to be close.
[00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:01.780]   He just wants to be close by.
[00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:02.620]   That's it.
[00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:04.280]   That's what he's pursuing for.
[00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:06.680]   And what we'll find as we read through this chapter
[00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:09.840]   is the guy's in the midst of trouble
[00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:11.200]   and hardship and difficulty.
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:13.440]   Like there's adversity all about him.
[00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:15.400]   He could ask for so many other things,
[00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:18.520]   deliverance, God, save me from my enemies, God.
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:20.040]   But he doesn't do that.
[00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:22.520]   Instead, what David does is he just says,
[00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:23.920]   God, I wanna be near to you.
[00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:25.480]   I wanna be close to you, God.
[00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:27.920]   My proximity, I can't get close enough.
[00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:31.520]   I just want to be as tied next to you as possible.
[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:34.600]   This is the heart of David in this moment.
[00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:38.520]   And he wants it so bad that he starts speaking in extremes.
[00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:39.560]   Like he's that friend that's like,
[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:43.200]   oh, there's one thing that I ask.
[00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:45.300]   And I want it all the days of my life.
[00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:47.060]   Like David, why so dramatic, bro?
[00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:49.080]   Like, calm down, man.
[00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:50.000]   I mean, we get it.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   You want this, but you don't need to exaggerate.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.760]   And yet he's not speaking in extremes needlessly.
[00:12:55.760 --> 00:13:00.080]   David, he speaks in extremes because he has good reason,
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:02.000]   which he wants to give to you and me.
[00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:07.360]   Namely two reasons for why we should seek
[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:09.080]   the presence of God,
[00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:12.440]   why we should increase our proximity to him.
[00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:15.760]   And they're both in verse four.
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:17.680]   So read it with me again.
[00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:20.580]   One thing I seek to dwell in the house of the Lord
[00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:22.800]   all the days of my life.
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:24.360]   Why?
[00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:27.300]   To gaze upon the beauty of the Lord
[00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:29.620]   and to inquire in his temple.
[00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:33.600]   You see, the first reason David wants to draw near
[00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:38.480]   to the presence of God is to see God's beauty.
[00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:39.680]   That's the first reason.
[00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:40.640]   Reason number one,
[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:42.680]   we seek to get as close to God as possible
[00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:45.160]   is to see God's beauty.
[00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:48.640]   So years ago, I worked for a ministry in College Station,
[00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:50.520]   obviously hand in hand with a bunch of college students.
[00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:52.240]   And what you find when you work with college students
[00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:55.200]   is they are navigating some of the biggest life decisions
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:56.840]   they will make.
[00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:58.960]   Over the course of a four year, five year spread,
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:00.480]   they are making huge decisions.
[00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:01.760]   Decisions like, what do I want to do
[00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:02.720]   with the rest of my life?
[00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:04.760]   Where do I want to live for my first job?
[00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:07.120]   What year am I going to graduate?
[00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:09.720]   And with what degree am I going to do so?
[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:10.920]   Who are going to be my friends?
[00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:13.480]   Likely the people that may or may not stand in my wedding.
[00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:14.960]   Am I going to have a wedding?
[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:16.100]   Am I going to get married?
[00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:17.880]   Am I going to meet that person here?
[00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:21.880]   And they're navigating all these major life decisions.
[00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:23.820]   And if there was always one that came up
[00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:25.540]   that was most interesting to me,
[00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:29.200]   and it was this, it was the topic of dating.
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:31.360]   You see, because most of the guys that I was mentoring,
[00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:34.020]   they would inevitably come across some young lady
[00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:35.480]   that they were interested in.
[00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:38.160]   And so whenever this would happen,
[00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:40.000]   when I would find out that one of my guys
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.160]   had an interest in someone,
[00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:44.560]   another interest in a girl,
[00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:47.400]   what I would do is I would spring into action.
[00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:50.400]   I would unload a set of carefully crafted
[00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:52.760]   and meticulously perfected questions
[00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:55.200]   that I had prepared over a long period of time.
[00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:59.240]   The first of which is really simple.
[00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:00.100]   What's her name?
[00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:03.420]   (congregation laughing)
[00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:06.520]   The second, how do you know her?
[00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:14.140]   Of all the places.
[00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:14.960]   Instagram.
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:19.340]   Like that was often the answer I received from these guys.
[00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:23.820]   They would tell me, yeah, yeah, I met her on Instagram.
[00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:25.100]   What are you talking about?
[00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:26.900]   You met her on Instagram.
[00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:30.340]   Like I understand if it's virtual dating,
[00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:31.780]   because those people,
[00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:33.420]   whether it's a dating app or something other,
[00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:36.260]   they've romantically self-selected that they're viable
[00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:37.100]   and they're interested.
[00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:39.220]   They're looking for suitors, partners.
[00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:42.060]   But on Instagram, like it's the wild west.
[00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:43.180]   Just shooting your shot off, you know,
[00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:45.360]   sliding into DMs and just trying to see
[00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:46.520]   what will actually hit.
[00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:50.620]   Doesn't seem like the best strategy, my guy.
[00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:53.740]   And yet this is what my boys were doing so often.
[00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:55.900]   They were finding people they were interested in
[00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:58.840]   and they were just making instinctive moves.
[00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:01.260]   And so it would always lead me to my third question.
[00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:03.300]   Well, what do you know about her?
[00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:05.060]   This is when the nerves really sink in.
[00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:06.200]   You know, like you could just see them,
[00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:08.580]   they kind of squirm in their seat,
[00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:11.660]   because oftentimes they would come up
[00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:13.100]   with some combination of,
[00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:15.460]   well, I mean, like she's got,
[00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:17.420]   there's a Bible verse in her bio
[00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:19.460]   and there's photos of her at a coffee shop.
[00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:21.820]   And it seems like she's got really good friends
[00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:23.080]   from the pictures I can see,
[00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:27.660]   as if this was a suitable resume for a romantic pursuit,
[00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:30.200]   which brought me to my fourth and final question.
[00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:34.240]   You just think she's pretty, don't you?
[00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:37.980]   To which often the case was yes.
[00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:39.580]   Why do I tell you that?
[00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:45.720]   Well, first, because I can't speak to the success rate
[00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:47.320]   of sliding into someone's DMs.
[00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:51.540]   But what I can say from that experiment
[00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:56.900]   is that external beauty may spark your interest,
[00:16:56.900 --> 00:17:01.920]   but internal beauty will keep your attention.
[00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:05.920]   External beauty, it may spark your interest,
[00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:09.220]   but internal beauty will keep your attention.
[00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:11.780]   You see, for my guys, and the same happens for girls,
[00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:13.480]   if you put the shoe on the other foot,
[00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:17.260]   many of them walk into date number one so excited,
[00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:21.300]   and then they walk out of date number one so disappointed.
[00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:23.140]   Why, why is that the case?
[00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:25.820]   Because though they liked what they initially saw,
[00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:30.820]   they learned that without character, intrinsic beauty,
[00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:33.700]   the relationship had no staying power.
[00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:36.180]   Why do I bring that up to us tonight?
[00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:38.740]   Because David, in this scripture,
[00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:42.580]   has seen something in God that not only sparked his interest
[00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:43.900]   but kept his attention.
[00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:49.420]   He saw in God an intrinsic beauty, a character,
[00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:52.500]   a nature that held him arrested,
[00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:54.000]   and he couldn't get away from.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.800]   So let me ask you this, what makes something beautiful?
[00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:00.660]   Well, there's an old saying
[00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:03.560]   that beauty is in the eye of the beholder,
[00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:07.700]   which just simply means that beauty is subjective,
[00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:09.740]   to which I would agree.
[00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:12.740]   I'd say, yeah, of course, beauty is subjective
[00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:17.740]   in all areas of life but one, God.
[00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:21.600]   God is not subjectively beautiful.
[00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:24.440]   He is objectively beautiful.
[00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:29.660]   You see, the beauty of God is not determined
[00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:34.100]   by what you see of him but how much of him you see.
[00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:40.380]   Now, as I say that, here's what I know.
[00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:44.360]   I know that there are people in the room tonight
[00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:46.640]   that hear me say that
[00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:48.860]   and just have this impulse of skepticism.
[00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:52.620]   Like, you're sitting here and you've heard me say,
[00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:53.460]   God's objectively beautiful.
[00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:54.280]   You're like, well, man,
[00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:56.360]   you must know a different God than I do.
[00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:59.600]   Like, the God you've seen is not the same God that I've seen
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:01.740]   because I'm dealing with past hurts
[00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:03.440]   that I'm still trying to heal from.
[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:05.500]   I'm carrying around scars, the likes of which
[00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:08.860]   I never would have inflicted and yet am enduring.
[00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:11.200]   I'm working through a pain
[00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:13.920]   that cannot seem to be put to rest.
[00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:16.040]   So this God that you say is so beautiful,
[00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:17.840]   he may be beautiful to you
[00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:19.840]   but he's not been beautiful to me, Kyla.
[00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:23.400]   To you, I would tell you
[00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:25.400]   what one of my seminary professors said.
[00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:28.960]   And I quote,
[00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:33.680]   "If God did not allow bad things to happen,"
[00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:35.040]   and you need to hear that,
[00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:38.320]   not cause them to happen but allow them to happen.
[00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:41.680]   "If God did not allow bad things to happen,
[00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:44.260]   "how much of God would we then not know?
[00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:48.880]   "For without evil, we do not know God's grace.
[00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:51.900]   "Without agony, we do not know God's peace.
[00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:55.480]   "Without despair, we do not know God's joy.
[00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:58.100]   "Without hurt, we do not know God's healing.
[00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:02.360]   "Without death, we do not know God's gift of life."
[00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:05.240]   Friends, listen to me.
[00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:09.640]   The greatest good in all the world
[00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:13.200]   is to see as much of God as possible.
[00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:16.160]   But hear me on this.
[00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:22.800]   Such sight is impossible without the presence of pain.
[00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:27.120]   You cannot see all of him
[00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:31.640]   without the presence of pain.
[00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:39.200]   I tell you that as someone that has lived through suffering
[00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:40.960]   and stands on the other side of it,
[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:44.040]   never wishing to go back,
[00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:47.260]   and yet so thankful God took me there.
[00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:51.080]   You see, God will lead you into places
[00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:53.280]   you would never go
[00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:57.740]   to show you things you would never see.
[00:20:57.740 --> 00:21:01.560]   He wants to show you as much of himself as possible.
[00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:05.440]   That is the greatest good, and he knows that's the case,
[00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:07.240]   so he's bringing you into it.
[00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:12.640]   And what's amazing is David, as we said,
[00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:14.980]   is deeply afflicted in this Psalm.
[00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:18.280]   If the scholars are right, he is on the run for his life,
[00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:23.280]   and yet his response is not to distance himself from God,
[00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:25.480]   it's to draw near to God.
[00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:27.640]   God, I wanna be close to you.
[00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:29.080]   That's the one thing I need.
[00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:32.480]   I don't need rescue or relief from all my circumstances.
[00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:34.320]   I just need to be near to you, God.
[00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:36.080]   That's his response.
[00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:39.280]   So if you're here tonight in that sort of place,
[00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:42.640]   if you're in that spot, what's your response?
[00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:45.480]   David has given you good reason to seek his presence
[00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:48.240]   because God is beautiful.
[00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:51.000]   But not only that,
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:57.300]   God is also knowable,
[00:21:57.300 --> 00:22:00.260]   which is the second reason David gives us
[00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:01.640]   that he seeks the presence of God.
[00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:03.480]   It's to see the beauty of God,
[00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:05.680]   and it's to know God personally.
[00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:08.640]   This is the second reason David gives.
[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:10.720]   It says in verse four that part of his reason
[00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:12.120]   for dwelling in the house of the Lord
[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:14.440]   was to inquire in God's temple.
[00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:15.880]   If you go and you read the Hebrew,
[00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:17.620]   that word for inquire is a word
[00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:20.840]   that doesn't just mean to casually know about someone.
[00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:24.080]   It means to closely, intimately, personally
[00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:25.960]   know someone or something.
[00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:30.800]   David wants to have a face-to-face relationship with God.
[00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:34.740]   How do you know someone's face closely?
[00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:38.860]   Not by standing across the room from them,
[00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:43.080]   but by getting near to them.
[00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:44.200]   That's what David wants.
[00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:46.800]   He knows, "God, I can know you,
[00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:49.680]   "but the best way for me to increase in that end
[00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:51.740]   "is to come close by.
[00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:55.720]   "I can know you, God, and it's that that I want."
[00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:57.980]   So something you should know about me
[00:22:57.980 --> 00:23:01.720]   is I have a wildly obsessive personality.
[00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:02.760]   I joke all the time.
[00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:04.320]   If you wanna know what I'm interested in,
[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:05.640]   if you wanna know what my thought life
[00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:07.520]   currently consists of,
[00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:09.760]   you should just go to my YouTube page
[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:12.640]   and look at whatever the algorithm is recommending
[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:15.320]   because they've got me pinned down pretty well.
[00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:18.720]   And typically, because I'm not a mile wide and inch deep,
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:20.840]   but I'm very narrow and very deep
[00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:22.700]   on the things I'm interested in,
[00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:25.860]   you can get an idea of what I'm currently obsessing over.
[00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:28.240]   So I looked it up.
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:30.000]   I'm bringing you in.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.440]   Don't judge me.
[00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:34.360]   But in no particular order, here are the results.
[00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:39.100]   Those things which currently have my mind's eye.
[00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:44.200]   The first is golf.
[00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:48.440]   Specifically, how not to slice my driver.
[00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:49.440]   I'm working on that one.
[00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:51.240]   Number two, Gordon Ramsay.
[00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:52.080]   (congregation laughing)
[00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:53.000]   Do with that what you want.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.060]   I'm a Renaissance man.
[00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:56.880]   Number three, mid-sized truck reviews.
[00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:58.340]   (congregation laughing)
[00:23:58.340 --> 00:23:59.860]   Because now I own one.
[00:23:59.860 --> 00:24:03.560]   And then lastly, and I don't know how to feel about this.
[00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:04.740]   You know, this is what happens
[00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:05.580]   when it's late in the evening
[00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:07.640]   and you just find yourself stuck on YouTube
[00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:10.160]   and then you can't get away from it.
[00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:13.020]   It's the black hole known as golden buzzer moments
[00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:14.480]   from America's Got Talent.
[00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:15.720]   (congregation laughing)
[00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:16.620]   You've been there.
[00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:18.600]   That's it.
[00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:20.220]   Like that's what my thought life consists of right now.
[00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:21.320]   Why do I tell you that?
[00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:25.180]   Because that is what I'm inquiring to know.
[00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:26.680]   That's what I'm obsessing over.
[00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:30.240]   Like that's what I want to learn as much about as possible
[00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:33.360]   in the same, but much more righteous way,
[00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:36.160]   David is doing that with God.
[00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:38.920]   Like David's YouTube feed is filled up
[00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:40.720]   with only videos of God.
[00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:43.920]   He just wants to learn as much as he can about the Lord.
[00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:46.520]   Like he knows, God, you are knowable.
[00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:50.080]   If that's true, then I want to know as much as possible.
[00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:52.100]   Like who is like you, God?
[00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:55.200]   Like no one is like you, Lord.
[00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:56.320]   Like, think about it like this.
[00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:58.840]   Like I was processing this idea.
[00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:02.040]   Like if there was someone in the world
[00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:05.080]   that you could spend every single day
[00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:07.960]   for the rest of your life learning about,
[00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:09.720]   what would have to be true of them?
[00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:13.280]   Don't think too hard.
[00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:14.100]   I did it for you.
[00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:20.480]   They would have to be the most unpredictable,
[00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:25.480]   ever growing, always changing personality imaginable.
[00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:27.040]   Right?
[00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:30.280]   Otherwise they would get dull and boring.
[00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:33.700]   That is not true of God.
[00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:38.640]   You see, God is not unpredictable.
[00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:41.220]   He's steadfast.
[00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:43.760]   God is not always changing.
[00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:45.840]   He is unchangeable.
[00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:47.840]   God's not always growing.
[00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:50.700]   He's already perfect.
[00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:57.880]   God is infinitely deep, inexhaustibly wonderful,
[00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:02.600]   and he is completely perfect.
[00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:06.840]   The scriptures say, because that is all true,
[00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:09.480]   you can seek to know him.
[00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:12.680]   Like they describe it, the authors in the scriptures,
[00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:15.240]   that God is unsearchable.
[00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:16.660]   What does that word mean?
[00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:18.160]   Like, I guess I'll never hear the end of that.
[00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:20.160]   I'll never learn as much about God as possible.
[00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:22.680]   No, it means God is one
[00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:24.360]   that you can never reach the end of.
[00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:26.340]   So go get it.
[00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:27.400]   Like, don't look elsewhere.
[00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:29.080]   Just keep going.
[00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:31.520]   Like it only ever gets better.
[00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:34.240]   This is what the scriptures say in Psalm 145, three,
[00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:37.120]   "Great is the Lord and greatly to be praised.
[00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:39.880]   And his greatness is unsearchable."
[00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:42.360]   Isaiah 40, 28, "Have you not known?
[00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:43.640]   Have you not heard?
[00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:44.980]   Listen up.
[00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:46.760]   The Lord is the everlasting God,
[00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:48.080]   the creator of the ends of the earth.
[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:49.760]   He does not faint or grow weary.
[00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:54.440]   His understanding is unsearchable."
[00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:59.000]   Romans 11, 33, "Oh, the depths of the riches
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.560]   and the wisdom and the knowledge of God."
[00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:02.400]   How?
[00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:04.880]   How?
[00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:10.160]   Are his judgments and how inscrutable are his ways.
[00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:14.600]   Friends, God is,
[00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:18.920]   he is both wildly beautiful
[00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:23.240]   and wonderfully knowable.
[00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:27.640]   And he's available to us.
[00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:32.120]   Does that not do something to you?
[00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:37.000]   Does that not stir your heart,
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.400]   stun your gaze,
[00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:43.880]   and arrest your whole being?
[00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:49.400]   So say we buy into this.
[00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:54.320]   Like you're here and all of that resonates with you.
[00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:56.160]   Each of those reasons you're in,
[00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:58.680]   you're like, "Man, I wanna give it a shot."
[00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:00.200]   What are the results then?
[00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:02.360]   What happens when you do?
[00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:03.640]   Well, David tells us.
[00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:07.980]   He says this, jumping back to verse one,
[00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:11.640]   "The Lord is my light and my salvation.
[00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:12.840]   Whom shall I fear?
[00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:15.140]   The Lord is the stronghold of my life.
[00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:16.580]   Of whom shall I be afraid?
[00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:19.460]   When evil doers assail me to eat up my flesh,
[00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:20.960]   my adversaries and foes,
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:23.040]   it is they who stumble and fall.
[00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:24.520]   Though an army encamp against me,
[00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:25.480]   my heart shall not fear.
[00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:29.000]   The war rise against me, yet I will be confident."
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.700]   You see, the first result of being near to God
[00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:33.520]   is fearlessness.
[00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:34.860]   That's the first result.
[00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:36.360]   It's fearlessness.
[00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:40.280]   Nearness to God makes you fearless in life.
[00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:41.840]   I'll say it again for the people in the back.
[00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:44.920]   Nearness to God makes you fearless in life.
[00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:47.320]   And we know this by our own experience,
[00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:49.360]   that when you're with someone you trust,
[00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:51.980]   your confidence, it increases, right?
[00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:54.340]   So if I went around this room and I said,
[00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:56.560]   "Hey, don't volunteer yourself,
[00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:58.520]   but volunteer a friend of yours
[00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:01.280]   that you know has a really good singing voice."
[00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:03.120]   We would all point to someone, right?
[00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:04.880]   Like we all know someone here that we would say,
[00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:06.400]   "Hey, yeah, like you right there,
[00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:08.420]   that your friend is totally outing in this moment.
[00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:10.680]   How would you feel if I brought you up onto this stage?"
[00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:13.380]   And I said, "In this moment, just sing for everybody."
[00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:16.280]   Not so good.
[00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:18.760]   Yeah.
[00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:23.760]   But what if I told you that Hayden and Davy,
[00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:25.000]   we're gonna come right out here
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   and they were gonna sing alongside you?
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.020]   Your nearness to them
[00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:32.680]   would make you fearless for this moment.
[00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:35.660]   You see, that's what happens when we walk with God
[00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:37.220]   in close proximity.
[00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:42.220]   We feel our fearlessness rise, our confidence surge.
[00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:45.440]   This is what happens to David.
[00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:46.760]   Like look at the way he describes it.
[00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:48.440]   He says, "The Lord is my light and my salvation
[00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:49.360]   and my stronghold."
[00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:51.880]   Why does he call God by all of these titles?
[00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:54.240]   Like David, are you just religiously riffing here?
[00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:55.960]   What are you talking about?
[00:29:55.960 --> 00:30:00.960]   No, he says, "When I face darkness, God was my light.
[00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:03.740]   When I face danger, God was my salvation.
[00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:07.260]   When I face disaster, God was my stronghold."
[00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:10.880]   Like David knew God provided for me in the past
[00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:13.540]   so I can trust him with my future.
[00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:18.800]   And what's amazing is he not only repeats
[00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:20.020]   that he shall not fear,
[00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:23.160]   but he does so in the face of escalating circumstances.
[00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:24.640]   Did you catch it?
[00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:26.240]   Like if you read through this,
[00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:29.520]   in these verses, he goes from general evildoers
[00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:33.680]   to personal adversaries, to an army encamped against him,
[00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:35.880]   to a war rising about him.
[00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:39.500]   Watch out, things are getting worse.
[00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:42.720]   But David doesn't escalate.
[00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:50.080]   He only grows more at ease
[00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:55.640]   because nearness to God makes you fearless in life.
[00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:59.980]   Charles Spurgeon, Prince of Preachers, once said,
[00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:02.120]   "I've learned to kiss the wave
[00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:04.340]   that throws me against the rock of ages."
[00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:07.680]   Friends, listen to me.
[00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:13.600]   God has not called you nor me to have a fair weather faith,
[00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:18.060]   and live through always easy circumstances.
[00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:22.260]   No, life's not like that.
[00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:24.440]   Life's hard.
[00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:27.640]   It's difficult.
[00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:29.880]   We know it through our own experience
[00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:31.240]   or through someone else's.
[00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:35.080]   And we also know it by God's word.
[00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:39.080]   Jesus himself said, "In this world, you will have trouble,
[00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:41.940]   but take heart, I've overcome the world."
[00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:47.800]   You will, as you walk with God, have a battle-tested faith,
[00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:51.540]   but what you'll find is the same thing David found.
[00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:54.840]   You'll find no matter what trouble comes,
[00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:58.160]   I'm safe 'cause I'm right beside you, Lord.
[00:31:58.160 --> 00:31:59.040]   I'm immovable.
[00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:00.760]   I'm anchored.
[00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:03.520]   I will not be shaken.
[00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:07.060]   This was David's approach, and it can be yours too.
[00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:15.320]   We see David continues in verses five through six,
[00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:16.700]   and he brings us to our second result.
[00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:20.340]   He says, "For he will hide me in his shelter
[00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:22.180]   in the day of trouble.
[00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:23.880]   He will conceal me under the cover of his tent.
[00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:25.420]   He will lift me high upon a rock,
[00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:28.080]   and now my head shall be lifted up
[00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:30.300]   above my enemies all around me,
[00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:33.460]   and I will offer in his tent sacrifices with shouts of joy.
[00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:35.680]   I will sing and make melody to the Lord.
[00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:41.820]   And now my head shall be lifted up."
[00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:44.420]   So let me ask you, what causes your head to hang low?
[00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:48.680]   What causes your head to hang low?
[00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:52.900]   Yeah, thank you.
[00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:56.060]   The Bible would say something very similar
[00:32:56.060 --> 00:32:58.340]   to those two things of shame and doubt.
[00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:01.820]   It would point, as you study the entire body of Scripture,
[00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:04.740]   that the two things that cause our eyes to drop
[00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:09.100]   and our heads to hang are fear of circumstances,
[00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:12.660]   doubt that God is good,
[00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:16.020]   problems at work, ruined relationship,
[00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:19.700]   betrayal from friends, reputation on the rocks,
[00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:24.300]   like fear of circumstances will cause your head to hang,
[00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:26.940]   and so will shame from sin,
[00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:30.340]   that you really are that bad,
[00:33:30.340 --> 00:33:33.780]   and you never will get any better, will you?
[00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:36.820]   This is what causes our heads to hang.
[00:33:37.660 --> 00:33:40.540]   And you know what happens when your head hangs low?
[00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:42.960]   You lose sight.
[00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:48.700]   You lose focus of the one thing
[00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:53.100]   you should keep your gaze fixed upon.
[00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:57.360]   You stop focusing on what matters,
[00:33:57.360 --> 00:34:01.020]   and you start focusing on what doesn't.
[00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:04.460]   You will hear me say this often,
[00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:09.220]   but for tonight, this is the first you've heard it.
[00:34:09.220 --> 00:34:12.860]   All of life is either a drawing near
[00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:14.560]   or a drifting away from God.
[00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:16.820]   All of life.
[00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:18.680]   Like there's no neutral option.
[00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:20.780]   There's never a neutral decision.
[00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:23.540]   Everything you do, the way you walked in,
[00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:25.980]   the music you listened to, the way you walk out,
[00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:27.460]   the way you talk to your neighbor,
[00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:28.860]   the things that you're thinking,
[00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:31.420]   all of it will either draw you in
[00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:34.140]   or drift you away from God.
[00:34:34.140 --> 00:34:35.300]   And the reason that's the case
[00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:38.460]   is because we have an enemy that hates us.
[00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:39.400]   He hates you.
[00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:43.300]   He doesn't want you to be close to God.
[00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:45.780]   He'll do everything in his power
[00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:49.720]   to distract your attention and divert your affections
[00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:54.720]   and ultimately distance you from the one that loves you.
[00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:59.920]   And so friends, we've gotta be vigilant.
[00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:04.220]   We have to hold fast and stay steady to the fact
[00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:08.460]   that God is the one whom we should hold onto.
[00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:12.320]   Not simply because with him we're fearless,
[00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:17.320]   but in so doing, the second result, we become joyful.
[00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:19.620]   We become joyful.
[00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:21.940]   You see, David is sitting here saying,
[00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:24.940]   "I don't need to cower in fear.
[00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:26.980]   "I don't care how many foes or enemies
[00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:29.580]   "or rivals I have that are out against me.
[00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:31.540]   "God has lifted me high upon a rock.
[00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:32.940]   "Like I don't need to hide in shame
[00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:35.020]   "because God has lifted my head.
[00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:35.980]   "I can rejoice.
[00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:38.940]   "I can offer in his tents with shouts of joy."
[00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:40.140]   This is what David is pointing to.
[00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:43.220]   He is saying the intensity of your joy
[00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:45.740]   depends on your proximity to God.
[00:35:45.740 --> 00:35:52.340]   The intensity of your joy, how hot you burn with gladness,
[00:35:52.340 --> 00:35:58.720]   it depends on your proximity to God.
[00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:03.420]   Psalm 1611, we read this a few weeks ago.
[00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:06.420]   Put this verse to memory.
[00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:10.940]   Says, "You, God, make known to me the path of life.
[00:36:10.940 --> 00:36:15.400]   "In your presence, as close to you as possible
[00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:18.840]   "is not just joy, but the fullness thereof.
[00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:22.900]   "At your right hand, God, are pleasures forevermore."
[00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:25.540]   If this is not sufficient reason to draw near to God,
[00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:26.780]   I don't know what is.
[00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:27.900]   And yet for many of us,
[00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:29.580]   while we might agree with this in theory,
[00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:33.460]   our lives would play advocate against us.
[00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:35.620]   They would instead suggest we are trusting
[00:36:35.620 --> 00:36:39.060]   in something else to give us the satisfaction we seek.
[00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:41.260]   But here's what you need to know.
[00:36:41.260 --> 00:36:42.800]   When it comes to joy,
[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:47.340]   you have two options in your pursuit.
[00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:51.000]   You can seek after it or you can search for it.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.380]   What's the difference?
[00:36:55.540 --> 00:37:00.540]   Seeking implies you know where to find it.
[00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:05.700]   Searching implies you don't know where to begin.
[00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:10.800]   Some of us have been searching for joy.
[00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:13.220]   We've looked in all manner of places.
[00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:14.660]   Like if we're honest with ourselves,
[00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:19.180]   we know that we've looked away from God
[00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:21.020]   in two other things in the hopes
[00:37:21.020 --> 00:37:24.440]   that that thing will give me the satisfaction I seek.
[00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:26.820]   So what's it for you?
[00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:31.280]   Like, is it approval from a guy?
[00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:33.300]   Even if it means reducing yourself
[00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:36.160]   in ways that belittle your self-worth?
[00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:39.560]   Is it acceptance from your coworkers?
[00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:41.600]   Even if it means you have to compromise
[00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:43.400]   in order to be let in?
[00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:45.960]   Is it piling on the good works?
[00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:49.380]   Because you're so desperate to be identified
[00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:53.680]   as a good person, yet it burns you out
[00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:55.060]   and leaves you wasted.
[00:37:55.060 --> 00:38:01.440]   Is it some sort of coping mechanism?
[00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:03.200]   Some kind of addiction you find yourself
[00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:04.840]   running back to time and time again?
[00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:09.180]   Food, drugs, substances, alcohol, pornography, you name it.
[00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:13.160]   Is it something that has a foothold in your life?
[00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:17.020]   What is it?
[00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:19.240]   What is it that you're running to
[00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:21.640]   in the hopes that joy might be underneath there?
[00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:26.600]   Listen, I've looked.
[00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:29.900]   It is found nowhere else but Him.
[00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:34.360]   There is joy nowhere else from Him.
[00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:37.160]   Sure, you may find something that scratches the itch.
[00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:39.280]   You may find something that ultimately curbs
[00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:41.400]   some little sense of satisfaction.
[00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:42.940]   You may find something that helps you
[00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:45.120]   to sleep better in the evening,
[00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:47.040]   but you will wake up the next morning
[00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:50.720]   and you will feel just as empty as the night before.
[00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:54.360]   This is what the world's offering you.
[00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:59.940]   This is what the enemy is deceiving you with.
[00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:06.840]   This word, His word, has come to tell you tonight the truth.
[00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:11.780]   You can search the whole world and no joy you'll find,
[00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:14.960]   or you can seek it in me and I'll give it in abundance.
[00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:19.120]   Will you seek after it with Him?
[00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:22.860]   Everything else in comparison,
[00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:27.000]   knowing that God is the giver of every good and perfect gift,
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:32.040]   it's rubbish in contest.
[00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:35.160]   He is better.
[00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:36.560]   He's better.
[00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:37.560]   He's better.
[00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:41.080]   He's better than whatever it is you find
[00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:44.320]   some sick sense of satisfaction or gratification in.
[00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:46.600]   I remember when I was in college
[00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:49.680]   struggling with a porn addiction,
[00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:52.140]   telling God, "I like this more than I like you."
[00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:55.240]   That was the most freeing honesty
[00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:57.680]   I could have given Him in that moment.
[00:39:57.680 --> 00:40:00.720]   To look at Him and say, "God, I do want this more,
[00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:02.100]   "but I know I shouldn't.
[00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:04.040]   "I want to want you."
[00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:07.280]   Will you stir that up in me, God, please?
[00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:11.400]   You see, God is better.
[00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:13.480]   He's deserving of desire.
[00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:15.040]   He's worthy of wanting.
[00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:17.800]   And tonight He is prompting your pursuit
[00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:21.280]   because in Him you're gonna find everything
[00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:24.380]   and more that you could ever want.
[00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:29.160]   So where do you start?
[00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:33.400]   You start where I did.
[00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:37.680]   In the corner booth of a Taco Bell
[00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:41.740]   at 11.30 p.m. as an 18-year-old.
[00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:46.820]   It was there that I sat across the table from a friend
[00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:51.320]   that spoke of the God we've been talking about,
[00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:53.300]   not the God that I knew,
[00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:58.400]   but a God that transcended my wildest imagination
[00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:03.400]   and confronted my personal presumptions of Him.
[00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:07.400]   It was there that everything changed
[00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:09.920]   because it was there as I saw someone
[00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:14.560]   genuinely walking with God that I wanted it for myself.
[00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:21.960]   I do not stand here tonight as someone saying,
[00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:22.960]   "Hey, follow me."
[00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:27.320]   That will never be the message I preach from this platform,
[00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:29.360]   but I will always stand from this stage
[00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:31.380]   and look at you and say, "Follow Him,"
[00:41:31.380 --> 00:41:36.380]   because in Him is everything you could ever desire.
[00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:39.780]   Are you walking with Him?
[00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:41.540]   Do you know Him?
[00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:44.840]   Tonight, He's bidding you come close.
[00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:48.940]   You see, this can be frustrating to you,
[00:41:48.940 --> 00:41:51.960]   or it can be fascinating to you.
[00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:55.340]   You could come tonight and say,
[00:41:55.340 --> 00:41:57.140]   "Just give me some directions, man.
[00:41:57.140 --> 00:41:58.820]   "What am I supposed to do?"
[00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:04.340]   Or you could just receive the desire
[00:42:04.340 --> 00:42:07.380]   that the Holy Spirit wants to prompt within.
[00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:09.960]   (gentle music)
[00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:14.980]   I don't want to move forward quickly to the next step.
[00:42:14.980 --> 00:42:16.660]   How do I do all of this?
[00:42:16.660 --> 00:42:18.300]   That's what this series is for.
[00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:24.340]   Tonight, I just want us to feel the fascination
[00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:31.620]   of a God that is more beautiful than we've known
[00:42:31.620 --> 00:42:35.780]   and more knowable than we dared to dream.
[00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:38.960]   (gentle music)
[00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:42.240]   And I want us to seek Him.
[00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:50.460]   And what you should know is we only can seek God
[00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:54.400]   because He first sought after us.
[00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:58.620]   You see, there is a God worthy of wanting,
[00:42:58.620 --> 00:43:03.620]   but what's crazy is He pursued a people unworthy of wanting.
[00:43:03.620 --> 00:43:06.100]   A people unworthy of wanting.
[00:43:06.100 --> 00:43:09.860]   That all the story of the scriptures is saying,
[00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:13.700]   "Man, God, He wanted to dwell amongst us.
[00:43:13.700 --> 00:43:16.820]   "He wanted to be present with you."
[00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:19.240]   And now the invitation through Jesus is on the table
[00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:21.520]   saying, "Hey, come and be present with me.
[00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:23.540]   "Come and experience my goodness."
[00:43:23.540 --> 00:43:30.340]   And yet what we know from the Bible
[00:43:31.420 --> 00:43:33.420]   is that no one sought after God.
[00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:36.660]   None, not one.
[00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:43.540]   And yet God, looking upon a people unworthy,
[00:43:43.540 --> 00:43:47.780]   unbefitting of His love, chose to love us instead.
[00:43:47.780 --> 00:43:51.660]   And so this presence that we've talked about all evening,
[00:43:51.660 --> 00:43:56.660]   the presence of God, became manifest in the person of Jesus.
[00:43:57.760 --> 00:44:02.760]   The God from up there became the God down here,
[00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:04.540]   walking amongst us in a way
[00:44:04.540 --> 00:44:07.400]   that would not have turned your eye,
[00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:09.960]   with no beauty or form or majesty
[00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:11.600]   that you would regard Him at all,
[00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:16.260]   and yet was so beautiful intrinsically
[00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:22.460]   that God had changed the world
[00:44:22.460 --> 00:44:27.640]   and motivated people to follow Him and learn from Him,
[00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:29.240]   seek to know Him,
[00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:33.520]   and in so doing become like Him.
[00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:37.720]   And this God, a God that came to be with you and I,
[00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:40.060]   didn't just come in the form of Jesus
[00:44:40.060 --> 00:44:42.080]   for the 33 years He lived here,
[00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:44.000]   but He came to give His life,
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:47.200]   that we might be with Him for all eternity,
[00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:49.300]   where He is today.
[00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:53.760]   Jesus, the Son of God, laid down His perfect life,
[00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:55.320]   beautiful life,
[00:44:56.520 --> 00:44:58.720]   for the sake of a world that was not worthy.
[00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:02.760]   He was hung upon a Roman execution rack,
[00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:06.800]   and in so doing, He absorbed the consequence of all our sin.
[00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:15.920]   And after being laid to rest, dead in the ground,
[00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:17.800]   He rose forth from the grave,
[00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:20.120]   saying, "I not only came to be with you,
[00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:23.560]   "I came to get you, to bring you where I now am."
[00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:25.240]   Do you know Him?
[00:45:25.240 --> 00:45:28.640]   He has come to seek after you.
[00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:33.640]   The question is, will you seek after Him in return?
[00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:34.960]   Let me pray for us.
[00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:38.840]   God,
[00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:44.160]   there is none like You, God.
[00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:47.760]   We say again, there is none like You,
[00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:51.200]   not in heaven, nor on earth, nor beneath the earth, God.
[00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:54.680]   You and You alone stand supreme.
[00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:57.240]   You and You alone stand distinct.
[00:45:57.240 --> 00:46:01.920]   You and You alone, God, are ultimately significant,
[00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:06.480]   transcendent, omnipotent, and worthy of our pursuit.
[00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:10.660]   Yet, God, none of us could arise to the standard, Lord,
[00:46:10.660 --> 00:46:13.720]   that we needed to be connected to You.
[00:46:13.720 --> 00:46:16.600]   And so, God, what You did is lowered Yourself
[00:46:16.600 --> 00:46:20.080]   to fulfill that standard, to live the life we could not,
[00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:22.400]   die the death we deserve.
[00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:24.960]   (gentle music)
[00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:28.080]   That all the sin, God, we were so weighted beneath
[00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:29.140]   might be paid for.
[00:46:29.140 --> 00:46:34.040]   And in rising forth, God, You extended an invitation.
[00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:40.280]   Come get me, come follow me, choose me,
[00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:44.400]   come close to me and see within me
[00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:46.560]   that beauty which you'll find nowhere else.
[00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:51.040]   Find within me that knowledge which you'll know nowhere else.
[00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:53.360]   (gentle music)
[00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:56.440]   And receive a kind of joy this world will never offer.
[00:46:56.440 --> 00:46:59.520]   Lord, we rejoice in the fact
[00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:07.500]   that while we were sinners, Christ died for us.
[00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:11.160]   We love You.
[00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:15.120]   Thank You, God, for the gift of Your pursuit.
[00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:16.840]   We respond in that pursuit now.
[00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:18.800]   It's in Jesus' name, amen.
