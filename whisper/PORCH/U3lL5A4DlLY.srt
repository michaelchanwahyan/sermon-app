00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 [music]

2
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 Alright, alright. Summer's here. How you guys doing? Anybody been swimming?

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 Alright man, three of you have been swimming. That's great.

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 My family and I went swimming. First inaugural swim of the summer,

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 which was a big deal. It was my niece's birthday party, and so it's at a swimming pool.

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 I'm excited. I like to swim. And I'm really excited because my son, he's about one and a half years old.

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 This is really going to be his first swimming test.

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 Last year, in the summer, he couldn't swim. He could just float around.

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 I don't even think he knew he was in water.

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 This year is going to be his first, "Hey, this is what water is. This is what we're going to do.

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 Daddy likes to swim. You're going to like to swim. That's how it's going to be."

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 He's at a strange age, though. He's about one and a half, and a little older than one and a half.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 I can't tell if he's disobedient, or he just doesn't know English yet.

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 He'll be running this way, and I'm like, "Weston, stop."

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 He'll stop, and he'll look, and he'll go, "Ha ha ha ha ha."

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 Then he'll just keep running. I don't know if I can discipline him,

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 because there's a part of me that just thinks he has no idea what I'm saying.

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 If somebody just told you to stop in another language, and you look at them like,

19
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 "What did you say? Okay, I'm going to keep going this way."

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 This is problematic when we're swimming, because when we go to the pool,

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 we show up, we walk through the gate, and I set him down, and he just starts running.

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 He sees the water. He doesn't know what it is, but it's sparkly.

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 It's like a giant bathtub or something, and he's just running for it.

24
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 I run after him. I grab him. I'm like, "Whoa, no, no, no. Hold on.

25
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 We've got to put your swim shirt on or something."

26
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 Poor kid. He's got a swim shirt and floaties.

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 It looks like he fell in with his clothes on.

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 We put his little floatie, wrap him up in floaties, and I'm taking him in.

29
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 I kind of carefully carry him into the pool, and he is like having a ball.

30
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 He's laughing and splashing, and he just thinks it's the greatest thing ever

31
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 that his feet are not touching the bottom of the bathtub, yet he's submerged in water and whatnot.

32
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 But all of a sudden, he's splashing, and he's kind of pushing away.

33
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 Then he's like, "No, no." He's learned the word "no."

34
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 He's like, "No," and he starts pushing me.

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 He wants to kind of go on his own in the swimming pool.

36
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 He wants to swim. Of course, he can't.

37
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 I'm like holding him. I'm like, "No, Weston. You've got to stay right here.

38
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 Let Daddy hold you." He's really fighting me now.

39
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 He's like, "No, no." Then I kind of turn around, and I'm looking at Monica.

40
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 I'm looking at the other girls, and in a moment, he overpowers me,

41
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 my one-and-a-half-year-old, and kicks out of my arms and just kind of bobs in the water,

42
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 like his head go underwater.

43
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 Now, I know most of you are not parents, and so I don't know if you've ever seen a baby

44
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 when they get submerged, but God has given them this incredible reflex

45
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 where kind of everything seals up, I guess, so they don't drown.

46
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 It looks like this. That's what it looks like.

47
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 He comes up out of the water, and he's just kind of frozen like that.

48
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 I'm like, "Weston, are you okay? Hey, Weston, Weston."

49
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 He's just like--and so for 20 seconds, and then all of a sudden, he comes to,

50
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 and he just goes, "Ahh," and just starts screaming the loudest I've ever heard him scream.

51
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 He starts reaching for the side of the pool.

52
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 I carry him over. I'm like, "Hey, it's going to be okay."

53
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 I set him on the side of the pool, and he runs from the water now.

54
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 There's a bunch of ladies there, and they all huddle around.

55
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 "Weston, are you okay? Hey, come here. Are you okay? Are you all right? Did you drown?"

56
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 I'm like, "He didn't drown. He's fine."

57
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 "Okay, let us talk. We need to talk, man-to-man here."

58
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 And so I-- "Hey, let me talk to my son here."

59
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 "Hey, buddy. Hey." And he's screaming.

60
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 And I'm like, "Hey." Remember, he doesn't know English.

61
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 "You've got to trust me, okay?

62
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 I have been placed in authority over your life, and I care about you,

63
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 and I love swimming, and I want to have fun with you,

64
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 but you've got to trust me in this pool."

65
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 And so we slowly, kind of slowly moved back into the water,

66
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 and I'm trying to show him that the authority over him is safe,

67
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 but he is rebellious towards authority.

68
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 My son, Weston, has an authority problem,

69
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 and this is what I know about that problem.

70
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 It's going to be a problem for the rest of his life.

71
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 And I know that because his daddy has the same problem.

72
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 "I just want to be free."

73
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 I'm just saying that because I'm free.

74
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 And freedom to me translates in my mind--freedom from rules,

75
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 freedom from anybody over me telling me what to do.

76
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 I want to be the person telling others what to do.

77
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 I don't want someone over me telling me what to do.

78
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 I want to create a kingdom for myself so that I can rise to the top,

79
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 have enough money and enough power so that no one can tell me what to do.

80
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 In my sinful desire, that is what I want.

81
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 I want to be free, and that's what freedom looks like.

82
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 But the Scriptures tell us that freedom actually looks different,

83
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 that true freedom in the Scriptures looks like a submission to authority,

84
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 that this is a call of the believer, of the Christian, of the one who follows Christ.

85
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 And so what Weston's struggle is, his struggle with authority,

86
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 is essentially, "I want to be in charge.

87
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 I don't understand why I'm not in charge.

88
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 And can I really trust the one who is in charge?"

89
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 Your struggle with authority is you want to be in charge.

90
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 You don't understand why you're not in charge.

91
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 And you're asking, "Can I really trust the one who is in charge?"

92
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 And I'm not just talking about God.

93
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 I'm talking about government.

94
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 I'm talking about your employer.

95
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 I'm talking about your church leaders.

96
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 I'm talking about anyone who is in authority over you,

97
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 which begs the question for you to answer before we go any further,

98
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 who is in authority over you?

99
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 And I've had young adults tell me, people who graduated from seminary tell me,

100
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 "Only God," which sounds very spiritual and extremely unbiblical.

101
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 "Only God, man. Only God."

102
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 Man, that sounds good. It's just wrong.

103
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 It's just not what God says,

104
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 that all of us are to exist under authority.

105
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 So before we go further, you should contemplate who is in authority over you.

106
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 And let me just say before we go any further also that bad authority is a fact.

107
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 It's a symptom of this really fallen world that we live in.

108
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 But how Christians, how those in the room who claim to follow Christ

109
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 or follow Christ maneuver through bad authority

110
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 is one of the greatest tests you will face in this world.

111
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 How you maneuver through bad authority.

112
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 And so I think for so many of us, our quarter-life crisis,

113
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 as we move through this series and we're talking about

114
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 kind of coming to this crisis that we face in our 20s and 30s,

115
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 one of them is, "I want to be in charge. I don't understand why I'm not in charge.

116
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 And I don't trust the one who says they are in charge."

117
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 And so this evening we're talking about submitting to authority.

118
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 Specifically the command of submitting to authority in the Scripture.

119
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 Then we're going to talk about who we submit to.

120
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 And before you leave here, why we can trust the authority over us.

121
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 And I'm going to be in the book of 1 Peter.

122
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 It's towards the ends of your Bible, towards the back of your Bible,

123
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 right after James.

124
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 So as you keep moving towards the back, you will eventually get to 1 Peter.

125
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 Turn to chapter 2 with me.

126
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 Let me set this up. The book is written to the persecuted church.

127
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 So this is the church under persecution under Nero,

128
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 the emperor's reign in about 64 AD.

129
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 So about 64 years after the birth of Jesus, when the calendar reset.

130
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 We're now 2014 years after that date.

131
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 This is about 64 years after that date.

132
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 Under Nero's reign, Peter writes to the church who is being persecuted

133
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 in this chapter about how they should submit to bad authority.

134
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 Or how to maneuver submitting to bad authority.

135
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 And we don't even like that word "submit," but it's a biblical word.

136
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 It's one we'll see over and over.

137
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 And honestly, this text, it almost reads like hyperbole.

138
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 It almost seems like an exaggeration.

139
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 It's going to cover the most extreme circumstances of authority,

140
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 as it says that we should submit to even that.

141
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 And we're going to talk about three forms of authority this evening.

142
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 The government, our government, our employer, and before you leave here,

143
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 the church, and as I said, we're going to talk about why.

144
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 So 1 Peter 2, verse 11.

145
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 And I'll tell you before I say this, that the reason this has landed

146
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 into the quarter-life crisis series is because it is a repeated idea

147
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 in the scripture.

148
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 It's an extremely important idea in the scripture.

149
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 And as I've met with many of you, I think it is something that

150
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 our generation really, really struggles with.

151
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 And I don't know that we fully understand the biblical command

152
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 as it relates to this idea of authority.

153
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 "Dear friends," verse 11, "Dear friends, dear porch, you guys, listen,

154
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 I urge you," this is a strong word, "I urge you," this is really just

155
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 to set up where we're headed, "as foreigners and exiles," or aliens,

156
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 "as people in this world that don't belong to this world,

157
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 what I'm asking you to do is to abstain from sinful desires

158
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 which wage war against your soul."

159
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 Do we have sinful desires which wage war against our soul still?

160
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 Or is this just a 64 AD thing?

161
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 Is it still a 2014 sinful desires wage war against our soul?

162
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 I'm glad I'm not the only one.

163
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 "Live such good lives among the pagans," so live such good lives

164
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 among those who do not believe in the God that you believe in,

165
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 "that though they accuse you of doing wrong or persecute you,

166
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 they may see your good deeds, they may see the good things that you do,

167
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 the good life that you live, and glorify God on the day that He visits us."

168
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 And so here's the premise that Peter sets up.

169
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 He says, "You live in a world that you do not belong to.

170
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 This is not your kingdom. God is the king of your kingdom.

171
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 You are in this temporary world. It's almost just a simple test

172
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 or simply a test, said otherwise, that you're here for just a little while,

173
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 and in this world there's going to be lots of temptations

174
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 that your flesh wants that are dangled in front of you

175
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 that the enemy persuades you towards.

176
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 Stand firm against those temptations which wage war against your soul

177
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 so that when others see you do good and live a godly life,

178
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 they would be attracted to your God."

179
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 It's so simple that you're like, "Hey, what is the purpose of my life?"

180
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 There it is laid out pretty simply.

181
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 "After you've trusted in Christ, so this is not a do good to be saved,

182
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 but because you have been saved, because God has saved you in spite of you,

183
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 you live a good life."

184
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 And then he says this, "Submit yourselves," there's that word,

185
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 "Submit yourselves for the Lord's sake to every human authority,"

186
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 what authority, God? "Every human authority,

187
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 whether the emperor as the supreme authority or the governors

188
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 who are sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to commend those who do right.

189
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 For it is God's will," what is God's will?

190
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 "That by doing good," it is God's will that you would do good,

191
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 "For by doing good you should silence the ignorant talk of foolish people.

192
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 Live as free people, but do not use your freedom as a cover-up for evil.

193
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 Live as God's slaves," okay, so ultimately submitting to God as his slaves,

194
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 "Show proper respect to everyone, love the family of believers,

195
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 fear God, and honor the emperor."

196
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 So my first point this evening is what does it look like to live under authority?

197
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 We're going to talk about living under authority.

198
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 What does it look like, the command for us to live under authority?

199
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 And so the "what" is right there in verse 13.

200
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 What do I need to do? What do I need to do with this text?

201
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 "Submit yourself for the Lord's sake to every human authority."

202
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 Okay, so let me just say this real quick because there's a few words that are real important.

203
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 "For the Lord's sake."

204
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 You can submit to authority and do so in a sinful way.

205
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 Because of the fear of man, because of the fear of consequences.

206
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 But he's saying, "No, you should submit to authority for the Lord's sake."

207
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 For the Lord's sake, this is why you do this.

208
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 Not because of the fear of man.

209
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 So the "what" is submit yourself to every human authority for the Lord's sake.

210
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 Why? Why would we do that? Why would the Scripture ask us to?

211
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 Really clearly right here in the Scripture.

212
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 "For it is God's will that by doing good you should silence the ignorant talk of foolish people."

213
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 "Said otherwise," or it will go on to explain,

214
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 "that others would see the good that you do and be attracted to your God."

215
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 That you're like a giant billboard pointing to Him.

216
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 Like, "Hey, this is the way to live."

217
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 He's made life, He knows how to live it better than any of you do.

218
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 Better than Dr. Phil does. Better than Cosmopolitan Magazine does.

219
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 Better than any book you could read does.

220
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 God knows how to live this life.

221
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 And so how should we do that?

222
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 The "what" is submit yourself.

223
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 Why? It's because by doing good we bring people to God.

224
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 How? How do we do that?

225
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 By showing, straight from the Scripture,

226
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 showing proper respect to everyone,

227
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 loving the family of believers,

228
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 fearing God,

229
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 and honoring the Emperor.

230
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 And so remember the premise, we do not belong in this world,

231
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 but by the way that we live in a world that we do not belong to,

232
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 others would be drawn to the king of the world that we belong to,

233
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 and they would want to belong to that world.

234
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 You guys get it?

235
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 An illustration.

236
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 Jackie Robinson was one of the first African Americans in Major League Baseball.

237
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 Branch Rickey, manager of the Dodgers, recruited him,

238
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 not because, maybe you've seen the movie 42,

239
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 it was a great movie,

240
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 one of the things that it left out, I read an article this week in USA Today,

241
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 one of the things that the movie 42 left out

242
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 was actually all about Jackie Robinson's faith.

243
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 He had an incredible faith in Christ.

244
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 And the reason Branch Rickey recruited him

245
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 was not solely because of his athletic ability.

246
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 There were other African Americans who could really play the game of baseball.

247
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 But the article said that Branch Rickey recruited him

248
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 because of his faith and honorable character.

249
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 Now why? Why would Branch Rickey hold dearly to faith and honorable character?

250
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 Here's why.

251
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 Because he knew that he was going to move Jackie Robinson

252
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 into an incredibly corrupt and turmoil organization

253
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 where people were going to persecute him,

254
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 say awful things about him, bring death threats to him,

255
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 bring death threats to his loved ones,

256
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 and the only way that this African American

257
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 was going to be able to persevere through this

258
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 was if he had a faith in something bigger than himself.

259
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 Was if he could trust or be under an authority

260
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 greater than the authority of this world.

261
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 And as we know, so Jackie Robinson moves to the team,

262
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 the team actually creates a petition to get him off the team,

263
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 his own teammates, out of their own ignorance and closed-mindedness,

264
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 they want him off the team.

265
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 And he wins them over how? By his conduct,

266
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 by the way he responded to people,

267
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 and by the way he played the game with excellence.

268
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 And in the same way, this is why you work,

269
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 this is how you are a citizen,

270
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 this is how you are a contributor in your church,

271
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 that others would see your conduct and glorify your Father in Heaven.

272
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 Man, I want to know what team they play for.

273
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 I want to play for their manager.

274
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 I don't like them, I don't agree with them,

275
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 but they've got my attention.

276
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 Because of the way that they live,

277
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 because of how they do good,

278
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 and because of how they do things with excellence.

279
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 And so we live as free people,

280
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 not free from authority,

281
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 but freed to honor authority

282
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 because of what Christ has done for us,

283
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 free from rebelling against authority

284
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 in a way that doesn't honor God.

285
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 Everyone is rebellious in nature,

286
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 we see that in Weston at one and a half years old,

287
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 that he didn't have to learn to be a rebel, right?

288
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 It comes natural to him,

289
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 and it comes natural to you,

290
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 but the way that you're different than the world

291
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 is you are free not to rebel.

292
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 And so, for the purpose of winning others to ultimate authority,

293
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 and so what authorities are over us?

294
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 My second point this evening, or second question,

295
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 what authorities are over us?

296
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 Let's understand that it says every human authority,

297
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 in fact in 1 Peter 5, verse 5, same book, different chapter,

298
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 it says that we're actually to submit to those who are older than us,

299
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 not even talking about elders of a church,

300
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 but just simply older people,

301
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 that there's this kind of hierarchy even in society.

302
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 And so it says to every human authority,

303
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 but I think of the three that this Scripture covers,

304
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 and three very relevant to young adults,

305
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 is the first one is the government.

306
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 We're to submit to the government.

307
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 What does that look like?

308
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 We obey the laws, okay?

309
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 The other day I got pulled over for speeding, okay?

310
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 Long story, it's not really a long story,

311
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 I was speeding, I got pulled over, that's the story.

312
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 You know what the first thing that went through my mind was?

313
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 This is the first, I'm sure I'm alone on this,

314
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 I'm sure you guys don't think this way,

315
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 but because I'm so rebellious,

316
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 the first thing that goes through my mind is,

317
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 "How do I get out of this ticket?"

318
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 Okay?

319
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 In spite of my efforts, I got the ticket,

320
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 and do you know what the second thing on my mind was?

321
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 After I received the piece of paper that was a ticket?

322
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 "How do I get out of paying this ticket?"

323
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 Right?

324
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 Why?

325
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 Because I'm rebellious.

326
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 Because I do not like an authority over me.

327
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 Let me say it like this,

328
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 I do not like to submit to authority.

329
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 I don't even want the consequences from my action.

330
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 I want to be free from the consequences for my action.

331
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 I want to feel like I am above authority.

332
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 I do not want to submit.

333
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 But this scripture has incredible implications for us.

334
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 It's not only that we obey the laws,

335
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 but that we would honor, it says, the president,

336
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 it says the emperor, but in our implications, the president.

337
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 That we do not slander our president.

338
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 Wow.

339
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 That you can express your opinion,

340
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 but make sure your conduct is louder than your speech.

341
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 What this means is that maybe you have an opinion

342
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 about marriage or abortion or about health care

343
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 or about POW exchanges.

344
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 Maybe you have opinions about these things,

345
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 but you make sure your conduct is louder

346
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 than the way that you speak about those in authority over you

347
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 so that others would see your conduct and say,

348
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 "Man, I want to listen to what they have to say.

349
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 "I don't just, the way she lives her life above her approach,

350
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 "the way he lives his life, I'm listening.

351
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 "And if he tells me abortion's wrong, I'm curious at least.

352
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 "I want to understand why."

353
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 And so, maybe right now you're thinking,

354
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 "Well, what if he's, what if the authority over me,

355
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 "what if the government that is placed over me at some point,

356
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 "what if they're wicked, what if they're corrupt?"

357
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 Cool. Let's talk about Nero for a second, okay?

358
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 Nero was not just a government raising your taxes

359
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 or passing bad health care.

360
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 Nero was a cross-dresser who was burning Christians alive.

361
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 He killed his mother and his first wife.

362
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 He married a boy child, had him castrated,

363
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 and had him dress up like a woman and pretend to be his wife.

364
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 And God, through Peter, is saying, "Honor that man."

365
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 Okay, so whatever government you have over you

366
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 at any time in the future, you go back and you look at Nero,

367
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 this guy seems to have, and I want to say something slanderous about him,

368
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 but I was encouraged not to, so I wouldn't even break the rule here.

369
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 It's interesting that the Scripture never does.

370
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 History tells us some crazy things about him,

371
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 but the Scripture never slanders him.

372
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 In fact, the Scripture tells us to honor him.

373
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 By the way, the very man who penned this letter,

374
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 Nero crucified him upside down.

375
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 The very man asking you to honor him was crucified upside down.

376
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 Here's what this means.

377
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 Whether you wear your seatbelt or stay under the speed limit

378
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 or slander the president has implications to God.

379
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 In fact, his glory is at stake.

380
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 Why? God cares.

381
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 That is what this Scripture is pointing out to us.

382
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 And so I would just encourage you to pray for President Obama

383
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 more than you slander him.

384
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 Consider what would happen if all of your prayers for him were answered

385
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 and live in such a way that others would be drawn to your opinion

386
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 because of how you live and conduct,

387
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 how you live and act around these issues.

388
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 Fear God and honor the president, the Scripture says.

389
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 The second thing that we submit to from the Scripture

390
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 is we submit to our employer, the one who is over us.

391
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 It says this in verse 18,

392
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 "Slaves, in reverent fear of God, submit yourselves to your masters."

393
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 Now, slaves and masters in this culture, it's not a racial slavery.

394
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 That's important to know.

395
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 All we know in this world is a racial slavery,

396
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 or at least in our culture is a racial slavery in recent history.

397
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 But here it's not a racial slavery.

398
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 It's actually an agreement that, hey, you would work here

399
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 and I would give you provision for life.

400
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 That's the slave and master relationship.

401
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 It's the closest thing that we have to an employee-employer relationship.

402
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 And so read here, "Employees, in reverent fear of God,

403
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 "submit yourself to your employers,

404
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 "not only to those who are good and considerate,

405
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 "but also to those who are harsh."

406
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 The Scripture says that bad employers are a reality

407
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 and that we're to submit ourselves to those who are even harsh.

408
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 It says, "In reverent fear of God."

409
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 That's, again, important.

410
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 Not because you fear man, not because you fear consequences,

411
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 but only because you fear God Almighty.

412
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 And, of course, you can sin in how you submit

413
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 if your perspective is off.

414
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 And so this slave-master relationship, though it was not a racial slavery,

415
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 it was also not always a pleasant relationship.

416
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 And so anybody here have a bad boss?

417
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 Don't raise your hand because they may be behind you.

418
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 And you don't know it.

419
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 And so certainly some folks here have had or currently have

420
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 or will have a bad supervisor, a bad boss.

421
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 Let me tell you that the Scripture's going to paint a picture of a bad supervisor.

422
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 "For it is commendable," God commends you,

423
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 "if someone bears up under the pain," and it means pain there,

424
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 "of unjust suffering because they are conscious of God.

425
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 "But how is it to your credit if you receive a beating,"

426
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 and it means beating, "for doing wrong and endure it?

427
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 "But if you suffer for doing good and you endure it,

428
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 "this is commendable before God."

429
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 And so I don't know what your boss has done,

430
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 but my hunch is he hasn't beaten you.

431
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 Right?

432
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 And so the Scripture is painting a picture

433
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 that the reason that you work,

434
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 that that employer-employee relationship

435
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 goes far beyond if you like your job.

436
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 It goes far beyond if you like what you're doing.

437
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 It goes far beyond if you're passionate about it.

438
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 And it says the reason that you are there

439
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 is because of some other relationship,

440
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 so that others would see you being the most excellent person there

441
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 and honoring your God,

442
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 and in fact the persecution that you endure there,

443
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 it says it is commendable to God.

444
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 And this is why we talk about work so much,

445
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 because what we do in our generation,

446
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 and I've done it too, I'm completely guilty of this,

447
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 is I jump into a job until it's difficult,

448
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 and then I jump out.

449
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 Like, "It's not God's will that I be there."

450
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 And then I jump into another job until it's difficult,

451
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 and then I'm like, "Well, it's not God's will that I be there either."

452
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 And so I jump into another job,

453
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 and so we know statistically our generation

454
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 is only at an employer for about two years,

455
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 which is a historical low by years,

456
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 because we're looking for contentment at work

457
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 when the Scriptures tell us that we're not entitled to it.

458
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 In fact, it says work is hard and work is toilsome,

459
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 as we covered a few weeks ago.

460
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 But it says that if you suffer for doing good,

461
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 it is commendable before God.

462
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 Colossians 3, verse 22, says it like this.

463
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 Slaves, read employees,

464
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 obey your earthly employers in everything and do it,

465
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 not only when their eye is on you to curry their favor,

466
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 which is what we often do, like, "Hey, if he's looking,

467
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 "like, I'm going to do everything I'm supposed to do."

468
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 But with sincerity of heart and reverence for the Lord.

469
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart

470
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 as working for the Lord, not for human masters.

471
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 Since you know that you will receive an inheritance

472
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 from the Lord as a reward,

473
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 it is the Lord Christ you are serving.

474
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 Here's my quick summary of the second part of that passage.

475
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 God distributes the promotions.

476
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 God's in charge of the promotions.

477
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 God chooses who gets promoted and who doesn't.

478
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 The rewards are up to God.

479
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 Do you believe that?

480
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 Do you believe that you're actually working for Him?

481
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 It's the Lord Jesus Christ you are serving.

482
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 That's who you're serving.

483
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 You are working for God at Starbucks.

484
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 You're working for God in retail.

485
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 You're working for God at Richardson ISD, at Dallas ISD,

486
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 at Plano ISD, at McKinney ISD, at whatever ISD.

487
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 You're working for God at Raytheon, at AT&T, at ABC Company.

488
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 And that God that you're actually working through

489
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 often works through bad bosses to bring about His will.

490
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 He works through corrupt employers to bring about His will.

491
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 I had a boss who was really difficult.

492
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 I won't even say he was a bad boss.

493
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 He was a very difficult boss.

494
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 He asked a lot of me, and I didn't like doing it.

495
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 Why? Because I do not like to submit to authority.

496
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 I like to be authority.

497
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 I don't like to submit to authority.

498
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 And so he would ask me to fill out these daily activity reports

499
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 to show what I did.

500
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 He would ask me to--we'd have to review my sales funnel.

501
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 This was when I was in sales.

502
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 He would ask me--he'd want to look at every customer

503
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 that I was calling on in detail.

504
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 He would ask me questions I didn't know the answers to,

505
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 and so I would squirm in my chair.

506
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 And he would always say this.

507
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 He would always say this, like, "Hey, JP,

508
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 "you only grow when you're uncomfortable.

509
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 "You only grow when you're uncomfortable."

510
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 And so I'm like, "Well, I'm growing here

511
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 "'cause you're making me uncomfortable."

512
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 And so I think about that, and it's interesting

513
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 'cause today, as I get to shepherd others and manage,

514
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 it's interesting that I manage more like him

515
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 than any other boss that I've ever had.

516
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 In fact, I learned a lot of leadership from him.

517
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 And he's right.

518
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 You do only grow, or growth, I'll say.

519
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 Growth happens most often when you're uncomfortable.

520
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 And so you don't know how God is going to use

521
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 the relationship that is over you today.

522
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 In fact, I had another boss tell me shortly thereafter,

523
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 "Jonathan, I think you have a problem trusting

524
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 "the wisdom that has gone, that comes from people

525
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 "who have gone before you."

526
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 And he's right.

527
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 Usually, and just to be transparent

528
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 and to show you grossness that's in here,

529
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 usually I'm sitting there thinking I know better

530
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 than everyone else in the room, and I know that's stupid.

531
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 But it happens a lot.

532
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 Like, I'm sitting there, and I'm like,

533
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 "No, I know how to solve that problem.

534
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 "You guys don't know how to, I mean, keep talking

535
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 "and wasting your time if you want,

536
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 "but if you want me to speak and tell you

537
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 "how to fix this, I will."

538
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 And it's gross.

539
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 And I'm usually wrong, right?

540
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 And he just said, "I think you have a problem

541
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 "trusting the wisdom that comes from those

542
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 "who have gone before you.

543
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 "You don't appreciate it."

544
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 But the scripture says that we actually should.

545
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 And so are you the best employee there?

546
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 Are you the one that they can't afford to lose?

547
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 It says in verse 21, "To this you were called

548
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 "because Christ suffered for you,

549
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 "leaving you an example that you should follow

550
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 "in his steps."

551
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 And so who did Christ suffer for?

552
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 I know that John 3:16 says, "For God so loved

553
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 "the whole world that he gave his only begotten Son."

554
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 But actually, Christ suffered for his bride, the church.

555
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 And so this letter is written to the church.

556
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 And so this letter isn't even to you.

557
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 If you're on the outside looking in,

558
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 if you're not a part of the local church,

559
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 I'm not talking about big C church right now,

560
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 'cause here's the church are people,

561
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 church are those who follow Jesus.

562
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 But the way that we're to follow Jesus,

563
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 as it's outlined in the scripture,

564
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 is we're actually to, ready for it,

565
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 be under authority in the church.

566
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 So if you're wondering, "Well, am I at a church or not?"

567
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 It would be like this, who at a church,

568
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 okay, someone that God has put in a position

569
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 at a church is in authority over you.

570
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 And if you think it's just me on Tuesday nights,

571
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 I'm sad to tell you, you're wrong.

572
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 That if you're just here on Tuesday nights,

573
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 I am in no authority over you.

574
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 I teach from the scriptures, okay?

575
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 I can give you advice, so can Dr. Phil, okay?

576
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 So can your mom, right?

577
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 But let's be honest, you're not under my authority

578
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 or anyone else's if you're just here on Tuesday night.

579
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 But the scripture calls you to belong at a church,

580
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 and actually to submit to church leadership.

581
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 In verse 17 it says, it's written,

582
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 this is to the family of believers.

583
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 Hebrews 13 verse 17 says it like this.

584
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 "Have confidence in your leaders,

585
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 "and submit to their authority,"

586
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 the word leaders there is actually pastors,

587
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 "and submit to their authority,

588
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 "because they keep watch over you

589
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 "as those who must give an account.

590
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 "Do this so that their work will be a joy, not a burden,

591
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 "for that would be of no benefit to you."

592
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 And this is a clear idea, really repeated

593
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 throughout scripture that God's idea

594
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 or God's desires for the believer

595
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 is that you would be at a church.

596
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 And so if you're here and you're saying,

597
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 okay, how do I begin to be submissive to authority?

598
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 I wanna do this, I'm not a speeder,

599
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 I'm not wearing my seatbelt, I'm honoring my boss,

600
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 or I'm not, maybe you are, maybe you're not,

601
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 I don't know, where do I start?

602
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 Church is a great place to start.

603
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 If you don't belong to a church,

604
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 in case somebody told me, hey,

605
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 the reason people don't belong to church

606
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 is they don't know they're supposed to.

607
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 Can I just say it really clearly?

608
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 So that the 3,000 of you will know that you're supposed to.

609
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 You are supposed to belong to a church.

610
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 That is God's will for you, I say that.

611
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 Not even with fear and trepidation,

612
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 'cause I see it in the scripture.

613
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 That you would belong to a church.

614
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 And that you would be under the protection of a church.

615
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 And that protecting you would be a part

616
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 of what your pastors are actually compensated to do,

617
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 to help you in relationships,

618
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 to help you understand the scriptures,

619
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
 to help you live in community,

620
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 that they would help you in this,

621
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 that you would not be some rogue sheep on your own.

622
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 God's sheep, the sheep that belong to God,

623
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 are always under an appointed shepherd.

624
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 You can look at any time in church history,

625
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 and that has been the case.

626
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 That God's sheep are always protected

627
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 by an appointed shepherd.

628
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 It's certainly the case here in Peter's letter

629
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 to the persecuted church.

630
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 And so this might be the solution

631
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
 to your quarter-life crisis.

632
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 Like, possibly, the reason you're experiencing,

633
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 or have experienced, or will experience,

634
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 a quarter-life crisis is because you are

635
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 a rogue sheep without a shepherd.

636
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 And I'm not saying that you're not a Christian,

637
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 or not a believer, or not even, you know,

638
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
 you don't believe in God,

639
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 or you don't have a trust in Christ.

640
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 I'm saying that you are not under the authority

641
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
 of the church, quite possibly.

642
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 You have to answer that.

643
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 An application from this message for you.

644
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 And I'm not trying to grow Watermark, either.

645
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
 Like, maybe you live far away,

646
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 maybe it's some other church.

647
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 Okay, we're not holding a membership class after this.

648
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
 That's not what's going on here.

649
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 I'm admonishing you, I'm encouraging you

650
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 to join a church, to be at a church,

651
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 to be under authority of a church for your sake,

652
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
 as submission to God and His scriptures

653
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 and His Holy Spirit,

654
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:44,000
 that you would belong to a local body, the church.

655
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 And so, some of you must be here,

656
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
 and you have to be asking right about now,

657
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 well, when do we rebel?

658
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 There has to be a time when we rebel against authority.

659
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 Here's what I would say to you,

660
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 never apart from church.

661
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
 That's a part of those who have been entrusted

662
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 to shepherd you, to help you understand when to rebel.

663
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 So you could come to them and say,

664
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 hey, I've got this bad boss,

665
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
 and I don't want to slander him,

666
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,000
 but here's factually what he's asking me to do.

667
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
 He's telling me I've got to go to strip clubs

668
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 if I want to stay employed there.

669
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 He's telling me that I've got to, you know,

670
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 fudge the numbers.

671
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 He's telling me that I've got to lie here.

672
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 I don't know what to do.

673
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
 And the church can help you maneuver

674
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
 and navigate those waters.

675
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
 And so, we're all so rebellious

676
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 that at times we're asking, wait a minute,

677
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 like when does scripture give me permission

678
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
 to be rebellious?

679
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
 'Cause that would be awesome.

680
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 God tells me I can rebel.

681
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
 It's got to say, right, like, you know,

682
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
 and we're there, and we're like, man, I hope,

683
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 I hope Obama asks me to do something crazy

684
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
 so I can show him, I'm not gonna do it, I'll picket.

685
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
 The White House, that's what I'll do.

686
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
 And we all, like, have that inside of us.

687
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 We all secretly want to be Batman, you know,

688
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 some vigilante, like, hey, I want to take matters

689
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
 into my own hands, you know, I can't wait.

690
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
 Man, I hope, hey, I hope my boss,

691
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
 I hope my boss asks me to do,

692
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
 he might have asked me to go to strip club,

693
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
 I'm gonna blow up, I'm gonna tell him,

694
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
 no, I ain't going to strip club.

695
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
 (congregation laughing)

696
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 Right, and that's how we want to do it.

697
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
 And people will come to me like,

698
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
 yeah, you wouldn't believe what that guy,

699
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
 he would say, strip club.

700
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
 (congregation laughing)

701
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
 And I'm like, hey, hey,

702
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:16,000
 have you told him why you can't go to a strip club?

703
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 Yeah, I told him.

704
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
 Did you tell him like that?

705
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 'Cause I would fire you on the spot.

706
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
 (congregation laughing)

707
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
 Did you just sit there and say,

708
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 hey, I want to be the best employee that you have?

709
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,000
 Man, I want to do everything that you ask of me and more.

710
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
 I've got a moral issue with this thing right here

711
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,000
 because I serve a God who's asked me to do something else,

712
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
 and I can't do that.

713
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
 But can I suggest another way?

714
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
 Like, what if instead of the strip club,

715
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
 I took the customer to coffee?

716
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
 Okay, no naked women,

717
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
 but great baristas.

718
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
 (congregation laughing)

719
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
 I'm sorry.

720
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
 (congregation laughing)

721
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
 I'm sorry.

722
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:03,000
 And what if there we had a conversation?

723
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
 Like, that's what you can do when,

724
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
 see, we all want to bow up.

725
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
 We all want to take matters into our own hands.

726
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
 We're all rebels, and that rebel bleeds into

727
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
 even rebelling against that which we think is wicked,

728
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
 and there's a right way to do it.

729
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,000
 My daughter, Presley, she's such a rule follower.

730
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:25,000
 And in fact, she's been in school two years.

731
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
 She just graduated from first grade, or just passed first grade, I guess.

732
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
 Don't graduate, just pass.

733
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
 (congregation laughing)

734
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
 And she's only gotten in trouble one time,

735
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
 and by in trouble, I mean she had to change her color.

736
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
 Like, that's the kind of,

737
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
 you may have got your name on the board or something,

738
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
 but they have to change their color.

739
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
 And she's only had to do that one time,

740
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
 and I was actually in Haiti when it happened,

741
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
 and Monica called me, or we were FaceTiming.

742
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
 I was in Haiti, and Monica said,

743
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
 "Hey, Presley had to change her color today.

744
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
 "It was pretty devastating for her."

745
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
 And I said, "Well, what happened?"

746
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:00,000
 And so Presley's best friend in school is autistic.

747
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,000
 It's really sweet, and just, for whatever reason,

748
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
 God has put the two of them together,

749
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
 and her best friend is autistic.

750
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
 And Presley was at lunch,

751
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
 and these boys were making fun of her best friend.

752
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
 And Presley said, "Hey, will you stop it?"

753
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
 And they kept making fun of her best friend.

754
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
 And so my little sweet girl, little rule follower,

755
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 got up and started kicking him as hard as she could,

756
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,000
 saying, "Stop it, stop it, stop it!"

757
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
 And Monica's telling me this.

758
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,000
 And I'm secretly, like, shouting for joy, you know?

759
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
 I'm like, "Was it the roundhouse?"

760
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
 'Cause I taught her the roundhouse, you know?

761
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
 (audience laughing)

762
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,000
 And I realized, though, that she broke the rules.

763
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
 And so we have to have a conversation.

764
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
 And I sit Presley down, and I say,

765
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
 "Hey, Presley, I want you to know something."

766
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
 And maybe you're like,

767
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
 "Well, this is Presley's version of the story."

768
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,000
 No, this is the teacher who told me this version of the story.

769
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
 And so I said, "Presley, listen.

770
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,000
 "I completely understand why you did what you did.

771
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:03,000
 "You saw an injustice, and you stood against it.

772
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000
 "But I want you to know that God has put people there

773
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
 "to protect you.

774
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:15,000
 "And so, you know, you need to go through

775
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,000
 "those right layers in order to protect your friend."

776
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
 And so the right thing to do next time,

777
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
 rather than stand up and begin to kick--

778
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
 I go, "Did you kick him hard? How'd you kick him?"

779
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
 No.

780
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
 And so rather than kick them,

781
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,000
 you would go and you would get the teacher in the lunchroom,

782
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
 and you would say, "Hey, this is what's happening.

783
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
 "Can you help?"

784
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
 And that raised off lots of questions.

785
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
 "Well, Daddy, what if she doesn't do anything?"

786
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
 Or, "What if, you know, they start kicking me?"

787
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
 Or, "What if this? What if that?"

788
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
 That's when you get your daddy.

789
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
 All right?

790
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
 That's when you get your daddy.

791
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
 And I said, "Otherwise, here's what I would say to you.

792
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
 "That's when you trust your daddy."

793
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
 Okay?

794
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
 And in the same way that Presley has a daddy

795
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
 that's kind of over that to protect her,

796
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
 each of you should have a church that you belong to--

797
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
 God's expression of the local church that you belong to--

798
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
 that is there to protect you in these circumstances

799
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
 so that you can go to them and say,

800
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
 "Hey, will you help me here?"

801
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
 Every now and then, people will come to us,

802
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
 and they want help or financial help or whatever,

803
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
 and I just get to ask them these hard questions

804
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,000
 that are simple like, "Are you a member somewhere?"

805
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
 So I should say, "No, you don't understand.

806
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
 "I've been podcasting so-and-so and going here and whatever,

807
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
 "and I just need to pay rent, man."

808
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
 Man, I would love to help you pay rent, okay?

809
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
 Can you come here and come under our authority?

810
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
 It would be irresponsible for us just to give you a handout.

811
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
 We don't know you.

812
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
 We don't know how you're going to spend that money,

813
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
 but we would love to help you.

814
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
 Hear my heart.

815
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
 We would love to help you,

816
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
 but that would mean that you're a part of the flock

817
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,000
 that we shepherd, and so can we shepherd you?

818
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
 And far too often, that person says,

819
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
 in some way, form, or fashion,

820
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
 "No, I'm unshepherdable."

821
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
 And I say, "Oh, I understand how you got in your situation."

822
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
 And I'm not saying that that's always the case,

823
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,000
 but I have seen that case many, many times.

824
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
 Far too often, I would tell you.

825
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,000
 "He committed," Christ, "no sin,

826
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
 "and no deceit was found in his mouth.

827
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
 "When they hurled insults at him, he did not retaliate.

828
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
 "When he suffered, he made no threats.

829
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
 "Instead, he," that's Christ,

830
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
 "entrusted himself to him," that's God,

831
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
 "who judges justly," his daddy.

832
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
 "He himself bore our sins," the gospel,

833
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
 "in his body on the cross, so that we might die to sins

834
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
 "and live for righteousness," the gospel.

835
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,000
 "By his wounds you have been healed," the gospel.

836
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
 "For you were like sheep going astray,

837
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
 "but now you have returned to the shepherd

838
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
 "and overseer of your souls."

839
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
 You have come back to the ultimate authority

840
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
 who is the one who judges justly.

841
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,000
 He trusted himself to him who judges justly.

842
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
 My third and final point is simply,

843
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
 all authority is God's.

844
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
 This is why you can submit to bad authority,

845
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,000
 because all authority is under God's authority.

846
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,000
 It's not the what do I do, it's the who do I serve.

847
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,000
 I'm not actually serving the government

848
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,000
 when I buckle my seatbelt, I'm actually serving God.

849
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
 I'm not serving the government when I go to the speed limit,

850
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
 I'm actually serving God.

851
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
 I'm not serving my employer when I do this with excellence,

852
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
 I'm serving God.

853
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
 I'm not serving my employer, okay,

854
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
 when I sell, when I teach, when I do these things,

855
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
 when I take the TPS reports, whatever that is for you,

856
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,000
 you're serving God.

857
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
 That is what the scripture's saying.

858
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
 And so this means it matters to God what you do,

859
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
 whether you wear your seatbelt or not.

860
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
 It matters to God if you gossip about your boss or not,

861
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
 that really matters to God.

862
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
 It matters to God if you are under the authority

863
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:51,000
 of a church or not, that matters to God.

864
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
 And if you're not, you don't have a government problem

865
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
 or a boss problem or a church problem,

866
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
 you have a God problem.

867
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:05,000
 It is for Weston's good that he is under my authority,

868
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:10,000
 that he actually has a daddy who loves him.

869
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,000
 But all authority that you could possibly be under

870
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,000
 is actually under the authority of a daddy who loves you,

871
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
 and you need to know that.

872
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,000
 And he's asked you to submit to their authority

873
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:30,000
 in a way that honors him until they ask you to do something

874
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
 that goes outside of his ultimate authority,

875
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
 until you are asked to sin.

876
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
 But even when you are asked to sin,

877
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,000
 you respond in a way that honors him.

878
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
 It's really important, because I think we're all waiting

879
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
 for that time, "Well, I hope they ask me to sin

880
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
 "so I can show them what's up."

881
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,000
 No, no, you would honor God, even in that circumstance.

882
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:53,000
 And so this text shows you this amazing truth of the gospel,

883
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
 that you've been set free, that Christ has died

884
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
 on your behalf for your sins,

885
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
 that you don't have to pay for your sins,

886
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
 that Christ paid for your sins, and if you trusted

887
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
 that Christ paid for your sins through his death

888
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
 and resurrection, then you will be with God forever.

889
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:09,000
 Remember where we started, you belong to another kingdom, man.

890
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
 You're gonna be with God forever, man.

891
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
 For just a little while, it's a test,

892
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
 and then you're gonna die, and you're gonna go be with God

893
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
 forever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever

894
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
 and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever

895
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
 and a billion, billion years, you're still gonna be with God

896
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
 in his kingdom.

897
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
 And this was just a momentary and light affliction,

898
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,000
 a little test that you had to endure there at Starbucks

899
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
 or ABC Company or whatever it is, right?

900
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
 And so this test, or this text rather,

901
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,000
 shows Jesus' amazing example,

902
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
 the one who created all things, right?

903
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,000
 He spoke them into existence, that's King Jesus.

904
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
 And it shows how he submitted to authority.

905
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
 King Jesus submitted to authority.

906
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
 Remember when they came to him in the Garden of Gethsemane

907
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
 and they say, "Are you the one called the Christ?"

908
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
 And he says, "I am he," and they fall over.

909
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
 The army falls over, I wish I could've seen that.

910
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
 They just fell over like dominoes.

911
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
 Like, do you think he's authoritative?

912
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
 Do you think he has authority?

913
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,000
 And it says he submitted himself to authority.

914
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,000
 He didn't need to cuss back, he didn't need to spit back,

915
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
 he didn't need to fight back.

916
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
 He just trusted himself to the one who judges justly.

917
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,000
 In fact, in John 19, Jesus is before Pilate,

918
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,000
 and Pilate's asking him questions, and Jesus doesn't say anything.

919
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
 And Pilate says in verse 10,

920
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
 "Do you refuse to speak to me?"

921
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,000
 Pilate said, "Don't you realize that I have power

922
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,000
 either to free you or to crucify you?"

923
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,000
 And Jesus now speaks, he answers,

924
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
 "You would have no power over me

925
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,000
 if it were not given to you from above.

926
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,000
 Therefore, the one who handed me over to you

927
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,000
 is guilty of a greater sin."

928
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
 This idea is repeated in Romans 13,

929
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
 and here in 1 Peter 2, but Romans 13 says this,

930
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,000
 "For there is no authority except that which God has established.

931
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
 The authorities that exist have been established by God.

932
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
 Consequently, whoever rebels against the authority

933
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,000
 is rebelling against what God has instituted."

934
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
 And so Jesus is here, and he knows his daddy is in charge,

935
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
 and that his daddy can bring about good

936
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,000
 even through his persecution, even through his torture,

937
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
 even through his death.

938
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,000
 Did good come through Jesus' death?

939
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
 You've been set free, man.

940
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,000
 It is through Christ's death about 2,000 years ago

941
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
 that you have been set free.

942
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,000
 You are trusting in that for the forgiveness of sins.

943
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
 And so God hasn't lost control

944
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
 when you don't agree with your government.

945
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,000
 God hasn't lost control when you don't agree with your boss.

946
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
 God is still very much at work

947
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
 through the authorities he has in place,

948
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,000
 especially his church.

949
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
 And so remind yourself where we started,

950
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
 that you're not of this world.

951
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:51,000
 About 12 years ago,

952
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,000
 I wanted one thing in life,

953
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,000
 and it was to be free.

954
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
 I was just a kid born on a farm in a small town.

955
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,000
 Went to a small technical college you've never heard of.

956
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
 I moved to Dallas,

957
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
 and man, it was my ticket.

958
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
 Dallas was my ticket.

959
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
 It was my ticket to freedom.

960
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,000
 And here was my plan, and I had a good one.

961
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,000
 Work hard, make money,

962
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,000
 stack up a 401(k), flip some houses, okay?

963
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,000
 Work in corporate America, have my health insurance be covered

964
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
 and protected and be free from everything.

965
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
 Build my kingdom so that I could do--

966
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,000
 I wanted to work hard so my boss would stay off me,

967
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,000
 so that I could do whatever it was that I wanted to do.

968
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
 I wanted to be free.

969
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,000
 I was upstairs at a bar on Lower Greenville, a club.

970
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
 Someone invited me to a church.

971
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,000
 And even then, I thought I would strike this deal with God,

972
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
 like, "Hey, God, you give me some good tips and tricks

973
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
 "on how to live this life, okay?

974
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
 "I believe you're there, you're God.

975
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
 "You probably got some good information for me.

976
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
 "Can you kind of feed me some truth

977
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
 "that will get me through the week,

978
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
 "and let me just kind of go out and party

979
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
 "and do whatever it is I want to do?

980
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
 "I'll come back to you, I'll tell you I'm sorry,

981
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
 "you'll forgive me, like, I've heard that part of the gospel.

982
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
 "It's all good."

983
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
 And I stumbled in, I sat in the back of the church,

984
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:17,000
 I was hungover, smelled like smoke from the night before.

985
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:21,000
 And a guy told this story,

986
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,000
 and it changed my life, and it was a stupid story.

987
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,000
 It was the reason God used it to change my life,

988
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
 or it's a silly story, I'll say.

989
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
 It's actually a children's story.

990
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:35,000
 It comes from this book I later found out.

991
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,000
 The book I read to my little girls now,

992
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
 Adventures of Thunder Hoof.

993
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
 (congregation laughing)

994
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,000
 Here's the story.

995
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
 There was a wild stallion that just wanted to be free.

996
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
 Man, I can relate to that.

997
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
 I'm listening.

998
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
 He wanted to be free, man.

999
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
 He rode a horse, and he roamed the mountainside

1000
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
 in search of freedom.

1001
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
 And in his freedom, he had to hunt for food

1002
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,000
 and hunt for water and find protection

1003
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
 from the elements, from the storms and the rains

1004
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
 that would come.

1005
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
 And people would try to capture this horse,

1006
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
 but they would fail.

1007
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:14,000
 And one day, this farmer, this cowboy,

1008
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,000
 successfully captured this horse, this wild stallion,

1009
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:21,000
 and he took him home, and he loved him,

1010
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,000
 and he cared for him, and he provided for him.

1011
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
 And through that love, care, and provision,

1012
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:30,000
 eventually he was able to break this horse.

1013
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,000
 And in breaking this horse, he was able to mount this horse

1014
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
 and ride this horse.

1015
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
 And in riding this horse, he would lead him to food,

1016
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
 and he would lead him to water,

1017
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:44,000
 and he would lead him to protection from the elements.

1018
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,000
 And it was this line that changed my life.

1019
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:52,000
 It wasn't until he was fully submissive to his master

1020
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,000
 that he truly experienced freedom.

1021
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:59,000
 And I realized that I had been wearing myself out

1022
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:03,000
 in pursuit of freedom, all while taking this for granted,

1023
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,000
 telling you that I believed this, but doing nothing

1024
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,000
 that would tell you that I actually believed this.

1025
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
 Telling you that I was a part of the church,

1026
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,000
 but not belonging anywhere, podcasting this guy,

1027
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:19,000
 podcasting that guy, whatever, but not belonging anywhere.

1028
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:25,000
 Telling you that I loved God, but doing whatever I wanted.

1029
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
 And I sat there, and I said this prayer.

1030
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:32,000
 I said, "Lord, if you're God, if you created everything,

1031
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,000
 "then you know how to do life so much better than I do.

1032
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
 "I've heard you sent your son to die for my sins.

1033
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
 "This is good, 'cause I need someone to pay for my sins.

1034
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,000
 "There's a lot of them.

1035
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
 "Lord, would you drive?

1036
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
 "Lord, would you show me where to go?

1037
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,000
 "Lord, I submit my life to your care now,

1038
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,000
 "through the death and the resurrection of your son Jesus,

1039
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,000
 "believing that he died for my sins.

1040
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
 "Father, would you give me new life?"

1041
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
 And he did.

1042
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:05,000
 And what he killed in that moment was my rebellious spirit.

1043
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
 Every now and then it flares up,

1044
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,000
 but he's gracious to remind me who he is

1045
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,000
 in charge, and that he works through bosses,

1046
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
 and that he works through governments,

1047
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,000
 and that he works through churches to bring about his will.

1048
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:23,000
 And my job is to do as they've asked,

1049
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,000
 as long as it does not dishonor him.

1050
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
 I pray that you would do the same.

1051
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
 Let me do that now.

1052
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
 Father, help us.

1053
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,000
 There is something inside of us

1054
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:46,000
 that wants to run when we hear the word stop,

1055
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:51,000
 that wants to stop when we hear the word run,

1056
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,000
 that wants to flee when we hear the word submit,

1057
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
 that wants to fight.

1058
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
 And Lord, we realize now,

1059
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
 through the reading of your scriptures

1060
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,000
 and the understanding of the things that you have told us to,

1061
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
 the eternal truths,

1062
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:08,000
 that victory actually comes through surrender,

1063
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:13,000
 that freedom actually comes through submission.

1064
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,000
 So Lord, would you help us to find freedom

1065
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
 through submission,

1066
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
 first and foremost to you,

1067
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,000
 and then to every human authority that you have put in place,

1068
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,000
 that you are actually the authority over.

1069
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,000
 Lord, we love you, and we trust you.

1070
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
 Help us be free.

1071
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
 Amen.

1072
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,000
 It's strange, you know, the Christian faith,

1073
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,000
 the God who created the whole world,

1074
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:44,000
 that there's these strange, like, contradictions,

1075
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:49,000
 these weird paradoxes that victory,

1076
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,000
 like winning victory,

1077
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,000
 would come through surrender.

1078
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
 That it's like when you come to this place where you're like,

1079
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,000
 "I can't. I'm not good enough.

1080
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,000
 I'm not fast enough or strong enough or smart enough."

1081
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,000
 But God, I'm your servant,

1082
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,000
 that you find victory then.

1083
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:13,000
 And that freedom, like we have this desire in us

1084
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
 to be free, but we look for that,

1085
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
 we look to fulfill that desire in all the wrong things

1086
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
 through our own accomplishments.

1087
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,000
 We find self-worth through the things that we do,

1088
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,000
 but that real freedom actually comes

1089
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:30,000
 through tapping out, through surrender.

1090
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,000
 Through surrender, like, "I can't.

1091
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,000
 God, I need your help.

1092
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
 Lord, I'm listening. You speak.

1093
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,000
 Lord, I'll go. You send.

1094
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
 Father, help me."

1095
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:49,000
 [silence]
