1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:21,320
 - Y'all, welcome to The Porch, Dallas, Texas.

3
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,440
 (audience cheering)

4
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,080
 It's so good, it's so good to be here

5
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,960
 worshiping with all of you.

6
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,380
 And God is at work in this place, in this city.

7
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:31,900
 We've been praying all day for you,

8
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,560
 specifically like every seat, every row,

9
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,600
 you have been prayed for,

10
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,320
 we've been asking God to move in power.

11
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,160
 And there's others that we wanna acknowledge too

12
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,200
 as I look into these cameras

13
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,480
 because all across the nation,

14
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,680
 there are people gathered, young adults,

15
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,520
 but right now, tonight, we wanna recognize Fort Worth

16
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,800
 and Indianapolis and where else?

17
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,880
 Somewhere else, where else?

18
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:52,840
 Remind me.

19
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,080
 Tulsa, that's right, Tulsa, Oklahoma.

20
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,760
 Dude, so welcome Porch Live locations,

21
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,060
 those three and everyone else.

22
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,460
 And I'm thankful to be with you.

23
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:03,520
 My name is John, I'm one of the teaching pastors

24
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,220
 here at the church.

25
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:06,780
 And I wanna tell you about a time

26
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,540
 and I want you to know up front too,

27
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:13,000
 I've like felt like I'm on the verge of crying all day.

28
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,700
 I think because of this message

29
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,620
 that I believe the Lord has laid on my heart.

30
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:20,620
 And so I was sitting across from my grandfather,

31
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:22,220
 technically, he was my grandfather-in-law,

32
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:24,720
 my wife, Laura, her grandfather.

33
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:29,020
 We were at my in-law's ranch and he was there

34
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:30,520
 and he, at this point in his life,

35
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,580
 had been diagnosed with cancer, he was dying.

36
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:38,420
 And my grandfather was an agnostic,

37
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:39,780
 like I don't know if there is a God,

38
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,820
 he would always say like, "Well, if I die,"

39
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:42,840
 whenever we'd share the gospel, he's like,

40
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,260
 "If I die, I reserve the right to be surprised."

41
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:46,980
 I'm like, "Well, no, actually you don't.

42
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,760
 "Like once you died, the surprise that you will see,

43
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,040
 "it'll be too late, your fate will be sealed."

44
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,240
 As scripture says, it's appointed for man to die once

45
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,760
 and then face judgment, like that'll be it.

46
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,920
 And he was an atheist, he's like,

47
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,100
 at times, I think because of the loss

48
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,520
 that he had been through, he lost his wife

49
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,060
 and his daughter to cancer, just like anger.

50
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,580
 Like if there is a God, I don't want anything

51
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,500
 to do with him, so I'm just gonna say you don't exist

52
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,740
 'cause where were you in my greatest time of need?

53
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,800
 Never vocalized or verbalized those things,

54
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,900
 but you could just, the pain was there.

55
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,540
 And then I would say he was pantheistic,

56
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:21,820
 meaning God was everything and in everything.

57
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:24,220
 And so my wife and I, Laura,

58
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:27,060
 I was sharing the gospel with him on repeat

59
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:30,100
 throughout my 10 years that he got to be my grandfather,

60
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,500
 who's the grandfather I never had.

61
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,940
 And we're in Colorado once at his little cabin

62
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,900
 and I said, "Hey, this is who Jesus is.

63
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:39,860
 "You know my story.

64
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,420
 "I was an alcoholic, I was a bad person.

65
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,940
 "Jesus saves me, like I didn't decide the change.

66
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,780
 "He saved me, changed me.

67
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:47,760
 "I was forgiven of my sins.

68
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,700
 "I wasn't given a better life, but a new life."

69
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:53,120
 And he's just politely listening and he's like,

70
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,540
 "Uh-huh."

71
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:59,540
 I was like, "Who do you think made all this?"

72
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:02,520
 Looking at like the beauty of Colorado and he's like,

73
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,300
 "Well, I believe God is in the deer

74
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:07,620
 "and God is in the mountains and my church is the mountains."

75
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,620
 And it was just, it was animism, pantheism.

76
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:14,260
 So there we are sitting at the dining room table

77
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:17,140
 at my in-laws ranch and he pulls out a guitar.

78
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,820
 I'd never, I didn't even know he played guitar.

79
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:22,140
 He's an old like Korean war vet, fighter pilot.

80
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,460
 And pulls out this guitar.

81
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,940
 I was like, we called him Da, affectionately.

82
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,620
 Like that was his name.

83
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,740
 That's what my wife called him when she was a little kid

84
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:31,740
 before she could speak.

85
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,080
 She called him Da and we're like,

86
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,780
 "Da, I didn't know you played the guitar."

87
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,700
 And he's like, "Well, I dabble."

88
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:40,880
 And he starts to play and I was like,

89
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:44,500
 "Well, where did you learn to play this?"

90
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,740
 And he's like, "Oh, my friend from the Bog Riders taught me."

91
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:52,100
 And I was like, "The what?"

92
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,020
 And he's like, "The Bog Riders."

93
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:57,780
 I was like, he was missing teeth at this point in his life.

94
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:58,860
 I didn't know what he was saying.

95
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,660
 I'm like, "Da, I don't know what you're saying.

96
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,500
 Like, hold on, who taught you this?

97
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,260
 Like, where did you learn to play the guitar?"

98
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,020
 He's like, "The Bog Riders."

99
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:08,120
 I'm like, "What are you saying?"

100
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,500
 He's like, he leans down, he sets his guitar down.

101
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,860
 He's like, "Do you not know what a Bog Rider is?"

102
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,780
 As if I was the one that was,

103
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:18,380
 no, no, no one knows what a Bog Rider is, frankly.

104
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:22,540
 I was like, "No, I don't know what a Bog Rider is."

105
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:25,500
 He lays the guitar on his lap and he's like, "Oh."

106
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,540
 Well, the Bog Rider is the worst job

107
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,260
 that a cowboy could have.

108
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:31,700
 It's the job that no cowboy wants to have,

109
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:35,160
 but he must have if he's a good cowboy.

110
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:39,500
 You see, the Bog Rider, he rides to all the bogs

111
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,140
 because when the rains stop

112
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:44,520
 and the watering holes begin to dry up,

113
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,020
 cattle will go to those known watering holes

114
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:50,500
 and in order to get to the water that is now receded,

115
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,980
 they'll go further and further into the mud

116
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:55,540
 just to get to the water.

117
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:59,980
 And then when they get the water that they desired,

118
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,540
 they're stuck.

119
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:04,940
 They're stuck in that bog, B-O-G.

120
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:09,220
 And the birds of death start swirling.

121
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:13,020
 The vultures, the buzzards, knowing that cow,

122
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:16,260
 that livestock, that sheep is not getting out.

123
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,820
 This is a certain death.

124
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:21,380
 And so they begin to descend and they're swirling.

125
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:26,380
 But the Bog Rider begins to watch the sky and the horizon

126
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:30,460
 and he goes to all of the bogs, all of the creeks,

127
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:35,460
 the lakes, the tanks, the ponds in search of any stray

128
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:39,300
 rather than following him back to safe pasture,

129
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,220
 got stuck in one of the bogs.

130
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:44,120
 And when he finds a cow that's stuck in a bog,

131
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,740
 my grandfather tells me, he gets off of his horse,

132
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:50,620
 he ties the lasso to the saddle horn,

133
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:54,120
 then he takes the lasso and he can't just throw it

134
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,340
 around the cow because what would happen is,

135
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:59,740
 is it would go around its neck and the force and weight

136
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:02,800
 of the mud, the suction, the weight that's upon it,

137
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,420
 if he were to pull it out at that point,

138
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:07,820
 it would kill what he would gone to rescue.

139
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:11,340
 And so instead, the Bog Rider gets off of his horse

140
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:14,680
 and with a small hand shovel, begins shoveling out

141
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:19,360
 as he is immersed now in the muck and mire and the bog.

142
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,040
 He's now in where he does not want to be,

143
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,900
 taking all of that filth upon him,

144
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,720
 simply to rescue this animal.

145
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,080
 And then he puts it around the horns of the animal

146
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,240
 or maybe the legs and begins then to instruct

147
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,920
 and get the horse to pull it out.

148
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:39,760
 Now he's covered in total filth, dirty from head to toe.

149
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:43,140
 The cow often he said would just like kick and thrash

150
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,860
 against the very one who saved him,

151
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:47,580
 flinging mud up onto his face, knocking off his hat,

152
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,980
 losing things in the mud.

153
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,540
 And then he goes back to the mess hall

154
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:54,120
 and he just looks like the greatest fool.

155
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,900
 As everyone else has already been there,

156
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,760
 they're all cleaned up, they've done their work

157
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,600
 and here comes the Bog Rider.

158
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:05,580
 For the sake of one, just one, covered head to toe.

159
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:09,100
 But in faithfulness would go and do that.

160
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:15,040
 And then my agnostic, atheist, pantheist,

161
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:20,320
 animistic grandfather looks at me across the table

162
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,780
 with tears in his eyes.

163
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:24,560
 And he says, you know, John,

164
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:30,980
 my friend tells me that Christ is the great Bog Rider.

165
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:35,800
 I was like, he is.

166
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,580
 He is, dawg, he is the great Bog Rider.

167
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:42,660
 Like there's no greater explanation.

168
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,160
 That's what he did.

169
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,620
 Dawg, when I was dying in my alcoholism,

170
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:50,300
 I was so stuck living on a couch, gun to my head,

171
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,900
 wanting to die, knowing I was dying.

172
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:55,660
 The birds of death were swirling around me

173
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:59,340
 as doctors told me, if you keep drinking, you'll die.

174
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,220
 There was no way out.

175
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,860
 I tried quitting on my own.

176
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,300
 I was stuck, dawg.

177
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,500
 But I cried out to Jesus.

178
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,440
 And the filth that he took upon himself

179
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:13,640
 was the bog of sin that I was stuck in.

180
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:17,240
 And he saved me, and he'll save you too.

181
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,800
 And he said something to the effect of,

182
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,240
 I'm happy that he's brought you peace.

183
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:27,060
 And then went into singing Home on the Range.

184
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:30,580
 And I'm like, you gotta be kidding me.

185
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,320
 Like, God, I've been praying and petitioning

186
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,480
 for this man's life.

187
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,840
 He's dying of cancer.

188
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,780
 He just shared the gospel in a sense with me

189
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,900
 by saying Christ is the great bog rider.

190
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:43,140
 And there was a veil blocking his heart and mind

191
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,620
 that he cannot see Jesus for who he is,

192
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:49,000
 nor can he see the bog of sin that he is stuck in.

193
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,900
 And it haunted me.

194
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,580
 And I was sitting at my desk,

195
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:57,100
 and I'm just thinking about the bog rider,

196
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,060
 and I'm thinking about my grandfather,

197
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:03,540
 and I pull out my phone, my little ESV Bible app,

198
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:08,540
 and I search bog, B-O-G, search.

199
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:16,060
 One instance, one singular instance

200
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:18,980
 in the entirety of these scriptures

201
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:22,880
 is the word bog, B-O-G.

202
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,220
 Psalm 40, verse one through three.

203
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:32,860
 Awaited patiently for the Lord,

204
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:37,100
 he inclined to me and heard my cry.

205
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:41,220
 You think about one, an animal that's stuck in a bog

206
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:44,660
 and can't move, and the crying out that it would do

207
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:47,300
 knowing the certain death.

208
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,300
 And all you can do is wait.

209
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,140
 What are you gonna do?

210
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,980
 You have nothing to do but wait patiently and cry.

211
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:58,980
 He drew me up from the pit of destruction

212
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:02,140
 out of the miry bog.

213
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,220
 The bog rider.

214
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:10,940
 And set my feet upon a rock, making my steps secure.

215
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:16,100
 He put a new song in my mouth, a song of praise to our God.

216
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:21,380
 Many will see and fear and put their trust in the Lord.

217
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:25,940
 It's a psalm by David.

218
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:28,940
 David wrote the psalm.

219
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,700
 It says that it's recorded right there.

220
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:33,380
 To the choir master of David.

221
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:36,300
 And I'm looking at the verses and I'm like,

222
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,180
 I can't believe this.

223
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:40,480
 Like, out of the miry bog, that's literally the picture

224
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,340
 that I was just told of this bog rider.

225
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:47,340
 Like, God is, Christ is, Jesus is the bog rider.

226
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:51,340
 Just riding to the bogs of sin to find those

227
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:53,780
 who are waiting and crying out to him

228
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,860
 and then setting their feet upon a rock.

229
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:59,060
 And I'm reading it and my mind is blown

230
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,540
 because of this.

231
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:07,860
 I'm like, wait, David wrote this.

232
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:15,340
 David, before he was a king, was a rancher.

233
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:23,180
 David, David was writing what he had done hundreds of times.

234
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:27,060
 He was caring for sheep.

235
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:31,140
 And when a sheep gets wet or weighted down by water

236
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,980
 or by mud, that's it, game over.

237
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:39,140
 And David, I believe from this, knowing what he had done,

238
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:42,180
 he had gone to the bogs in search of the strays

239
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,940
 who didn't follow the voice of the shepherd, David.

240
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:47,100
 And so he went back, searched the bogs,

241
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,740
 knowing that there might've been one that had strayed

242
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:52,980
 that was doomed for death and pulled it out

243
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:57,980
 of the miry bog and set its feet upon a rock.

244
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:02,420
 He heard the cry of the sheep.

245
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:06,500
 And I'm like, oh my goodness, David's writing

246
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,460
 about what he had done for his sheep.

247
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:11,580
 And he's like, that's what you did for me, God.

248
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,620
 What he had done for his sheep, he's considering it.

249
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:17,100
 Maybe it was one day and he literally had been taking

250
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:20,460
 that sheep and all the mud and filth and excrement

251
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:24,140
 upon himself of that trapped one and stopped

252
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:27,700
 and paused in that moment, was like, oh my goodness.

253
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,540
 I waited patiently for the Lord.

254
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,200
 He inclined and heard my cry.

255
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:38,100
 He rescued me out of the pit of destruction,

256
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,380
 out of the miry bog and set my feet upon a rock.

257
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,860
 Like God, you've done this for me.

258
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:47,500
 And put it down in a Psalm inspired by the Spirit.

259
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,420
 And so the actions of David that you see in Psalm 40

260
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,900
 is that he was saved.

261
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:56,740
 Then you will see in verses six through eight

262
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,900
 that he was surrendered, he was saved,

263
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:02,300
 then he was surrendered, and then he spoke.

264
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:05,020
 There's a refrain throughout Psalm 40.

265
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,780
 He says, many will see and fear

266
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,140
 and put their trust in the Lord.

267
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:10,140
 And the reason that they would do that

268
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:14,420
 is because David was saved by the bog rider.

269
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:17,180
 Then he was surrendered to the will of God.

270
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,740
 And then he speaks.

271
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,020
 He can't help but speak.

272
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:22,700
 Like I'm gonna tell everybody of your deeds

273
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,620
 in the great congregation.

274
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,620
 That's the refrain, that's the response.

275
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,860
 The David's like, I'm about to tell everybody

276
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:31,100
 because I believe that everyone has sin,

277
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,100
 but not everybody has a savior.

278
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:35,460
 And so I'm gonna tell everybody what you have done for me,

279
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:37,580
 that you are the great bog rider,

280
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:40,500
 that you save us out of the bog, the pit of destruction.

281
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:44,140
 And I'm gonna tell everyone in my surrendering, I will speak.

282
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:47,540
 I will not restrain my lips, as the scriptures say.

283
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:50,220
 And then the actions of God are the great bog rider.

284
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:53,300
 He hears cries, he inclines his ear.

285
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:58,060
 He's listening for the cries of the one who was stuck.

286
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:00,940
 And truly everyone is stuck, but only some cry.

287
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:04,620
 And then he draws up from the pit of destruction.

288
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,100
 He makes us secure.

289
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,940
 He puts a new song in your mouth, not a better song,

290
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:11,380
 a new song because he gives a new life.

291
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:16,100
 And then he moves others to see and fear

292
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,780
 and put their trust in him, this ripple effect.

293
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:23,220
 And so if I'm you, I'm sitting there, I'm like, really?

294
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:26,980
 But really, is that just a good story from a grandpa?

295
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:29,220
 Really is Christ the great bog rider?

296
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:32,720
 You found one verse, Psalm 40.

297
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,960
 Listen to Hebrews chapter 13, verse 20.

298
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:41,680
 Now may the God of peace and the opposite of peace,

299
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:46,220
 just being turmoil and chaos and desperation,

300
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:49,820
 like the God of peace who brought again from the dead

301
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,580
 our Lord Jesus.

302
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:57,740
 Listen, the great shepherd of the sheep.

303
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:04,260
 He's the one who seeks after you.

304
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,220
 He's the one who laid down his life.

305
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:10,460
 He went into the bog, the pit of destruction.

306
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:14,800
 He went into sin and death to pull you out.

307
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,740
 And then after having laid down his life,

308
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:20,980
 he walked out of that pit of destruction alive

309
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,120
 and raised again.

310
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:25,060
 It's the gospel.

311
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,740
 It's the gospel.

312
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:29,420
 It's that everyone is in a pit of destruction.

313
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,020
 It's sin.

314
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:35,340
 And it's unloving to not tell someone that they have sin.

315
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:39,160
 Like how horrific to be like, I don't know, man,

316
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,880
 you do you, who am I to judge?

317
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:45,760
 Or rather to be like, man, everybody's got sin.

318
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,140
 Me foremost, let me tell you all about it.

319
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,840
 But I don't just have sin, I have a savior.

320
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:53,080
 It's Romans 6, 23, it says the wages of sin is death.

321
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:56,600
 Everyone has sin and what we get because of our sin

322
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,420
 is death, it says, but the free gift of God.

323
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:02,580
 There's nothing anyone stuck in a bog can do to earn that.

324
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:06,160
 That is only the love and mercy and grace

325
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,200
 of the one coming to rescue.

326
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,640
 But the free gift of God is eternal life

327
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,480
 in Christ Jesus, our Lord.

328
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,400
 And so there's two people in the room tonight.

329
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,440
 You're one of two people.

330
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,840
 You're either crying in the pit of destruction.

331
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,360
 You're in the pit of destruction right now

332
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,480
 and that cry may be so faint, that cry might sound like

333
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,360
 anger or rejection or scoffing at God,

334
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,940
 just like my grandfathers did.

335
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:35,080
 But if you're in a pit of destruction,

336
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:39,360
 if you're in that bog of sin, the response is to cry out.

337
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,400
 Save me.

338
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:46,580
 Or you've been saved from that miry bog.

339
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:50,000
 You've had your feet set upon the rock.

340
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,080
 Christ, the great bog rider has saved you

341
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,320
 and now he's put a new song in your mouth.

342
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,620
 And so you're either crying or you're singing.

343
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:59,240
 You're crying or you're singing.

344
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,920
 And the other two people that are in this room

345
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,000
 and you're one of two here also,

346
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:07,360
 is you're either in need of being saved

347
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,780
 or you're in need of surrendering.

348
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:15,100
 You either need to be saved to place your faith in Jesus

349
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,680
 for the forgiveness of your sins,

350
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:20,320
 believing that he died the death on the cross for you.

351
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,980
 Sinless Savior of all mankind, he died for you.

352
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:25,560
 It's not just that it's true, it's true for you,

353
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,380
 for your sins.

354
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,120
 Not just for sins, your sins.

355
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:33,760
 And believing that God raised him from the dead

356
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,120
 and that if you call out to him,

357
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,640
 for everyone who confesses that Jesus is Lord

358
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,880
 and believes that God raised him from the dead,

359
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,880
 will be saved, you're in need of saving

360
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,860
 or you're in need of surrendering.

361
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:49,320
 Because you can be saved and not surrendered.

362
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,460
 When it says the free gift of God is eternal life

363
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:54,040
 in Christ Jesus our Lord,

364
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,440
 Christ means the Messiah, the anointed one,

365
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,320
 the one who was to come,

366
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,160
 the one who would lay down on his life,

367
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,200
 who would go into sin and death on our behalf,

368
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,840
 lay down his life that we might go free

369
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,440
 and then he would take it back up his life again.

370
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:14,440
 You can believe in that, be saved and not be surrendered.

371
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:18,120
 And thus you wouldn't experience the full abundant life.

372
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,800
 Like Jesus says, I've come to give them life

373
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,840
 that they might have it to the full.

374
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,640
 And you're like, dude, I don't have that.

375
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:27,000
 Just feels like, nah, straddling the fence,

376
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,200
 like Reagan said, of the world and of Christ.

377
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,520
 And so you're either in need of being saved

378
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,920
 or in need of surrendering.

379
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:40,200
 And tonight you're gonna be met with that choice.

380
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,000
 Tonight you'll be met with that choice.

381
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,240
 But surely Christ is the great bog rider.

382
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:50,520
 And then my mind was blown again.

383
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,360
 So I'm thinking about the bog rider,

384
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,480
 I'm thinking about David being a rancher

385
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,000
 and that he's saving sheep.

386
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,480
 How many he must have gone,

387
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,760
 like stepped down into the mud.

388
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,200
 We know that he fought off bear and lion

389
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,440
 in order to rescue a sheep.

390
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,760
 In this case, I believe that he literally stepped

391
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:13,120
 into all that filth to rescue out his livestock

392
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,840
 as a rancher to save.

393
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:21,680
 But it goes on, we know from the Bible,

394
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:25,080
 like nobody had a sheep as a pet.

395
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,880
 Just wasn't a thing.

396
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,120
 Still not a thing to this day typically.

397
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,680
 Like no, but David wasn't raising sheep to be like,

398
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,960
 all right, here's my little flock

399
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,200
 and I'm just gonna, they're gonna live to a ripe old age

400
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,680
 and one day they'll get kind of old

401
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,560
 and man, I won't even put them down,

402
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,200
 I'll just bury them with a little, you know,

403
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,240
 cross in the yard and there's Geppetto

404
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,460
 and there's Tommy and he was a good one.

405
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:51,320
 But rather those sheep were being raised to be sacrificed.

406
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:55,560
 This is crazy.

407
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,680
 Total paradox.

408
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:00,520
 He is saving a sheep in one instance

409
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:03,280
 and then laying down sheep in another,

410
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,320
 be it for Passover or whatever meal,

411
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:08,680
 but that sheep was to give up its life,

412
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,800
 to give up its wool, to give up its life

413
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:16,600
 for the purpose of the master.

414
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:20,760
 And there comes the surrender.

415
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,360
 And as it says in Hebrews 13,

416
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:27,360
 when I just said that Jesus brought back from the dead

417
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,780
 is the great shepherd of the sheep,

418
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:32,320
 listen to how the verse continues.

419
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,700
 It says in 21,

420
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:39,840
 that he would equip you with everything good

421
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:44,640
 that you may do his will,

422
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,520
 not your will any longer.

423
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,920
 He saved you to send you out.

424
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,040
 He saved you to change you.

425
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:55,120
 He saved you that you might surrender

426
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,360
 and quit kicking against the goats,

427
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,600
 but instead to be like, you rescued me from all,

428
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,280
 I give you all.

429
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,720
 I surrender everything to you.

430
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,140
 How could I not?

431
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,680
 My life is yours.

432
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,720
 Now, in this case, the analogy breaks down

433
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,520
 because he's not sacrificing you

434
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,360
 and asking you to physically die,

435
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,400
 but it does say in Luke chapter nine,

436
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,360
 that if anyone would come after Jesus,

437
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,160
 he must take up his cross,

438
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:24,480
 deny himself daily to follow him.

439
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,400
 That there is a daily death of self

440
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,960
 and that daily death is a death to our own will.

441
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,640
 Like it's no longer my will, your will be done.

442
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:36,120
 That that's the only way to live.

443
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,320
 And so I'll tell you when my life changed,

444
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,040
 when my life radically changed,

445
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,560
 is when my life was falling apart,

446
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,480
 I placed my faith in Jesus.

447
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,320
 And then just like days later,

448
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,700
 I got on my knees,

449
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,640
 besides that couch that I was living on,

450
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,520
 face to the ground,

451
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,680
 and I surrendered everything.

452
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,900
 I was like, Jesus, I have been a really bad Lord of my life.

453
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:00,740
 You get everything.

454
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:02,440
 You get my money, you get my mind,

455
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,680
 you get my body, you get my relationships,

456
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,160
 you get my job, you get who I date,

457
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,120
 you get my computer, you get my phone,

458
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,280
 you get my car, you get where I live,

459
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,840
 you get my free time, you get everything.

460
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,560
 It's all yours.

461
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:20,340
 And in that surrendering came the greatest freedom.

462
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:25,080
 It's like I was just drowning,

463
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,880
 like barely getting a gasp of breath,

464
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,920
 and then like these weights were cut off,

465
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,220
 and I was free, free.

466
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:38,160
 Because I was no longer daily battling, hourly battling,

467
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,920
 between like the lust of the flesh,

468
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:43,440
 and what I wanted with women,

469
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,240
 versus like, no, my body is a temple,

470
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,920
 and those women are precious in the sight of the Lord.

471
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:52,520
 And I wanna be rich, filthy, dirty, rich.

472
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,460
 I wanna retire at 40 to like,

473
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:57,840
 I don't care about money anymore.

474
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,600
 It was actually a real problem in my life.

475
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,200
 And I want things.

476
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,900
 I want the townhouse, the lake house,

477
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:08,300
 the Land Rover, the BMW, all the things.

478
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:10,400
 That'll give me satisfaction to like,

479
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,840
 no, those things were a trap.

480
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,400
 And the more I had, the more they had me.

481
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,600
 And I want status.

482
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,960
 I wanna make a name for myself.

483
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,520
 I want people to know John Elmore,

484
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:25,560
 advertising exec in Austin, Texas.

485
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,620
 Such a joke.

486
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:31,440
 To like, no, I want people to know about Jesus.

487
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,900
 He saved me, and I'm gonna spend the rest of my life

488
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:37,000
 telling everybody that he is real.

489
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,460
 You are never too far gone, and he can change everything.

490
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,800
 Forget my name, the name of Jesus.

491
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,000
 Forget my kingdom, his kingdom.

492
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 Forget me trying to live by my power.

493
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,600
 It's all by his power.

494
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,560
 Forget me trying to live for my own vain glory.

495
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:53,060
 Let's live for Christ's glory.

496
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:54,880
 There was a surrendering, and in that surrendering

497
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,600
 brought total freedom, and joy, and peace.

498
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,320
 I was no longer striving against God.

499
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,240
 I was with him.

500
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:06,640
 We were at that same ranch, and we have trouble with hogs,

501
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,560
 like feral hogs that just tear up the land,

502
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:11,180
 tear up the fence, the cows get out, and all that.

503
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,140
 So we hunt the hogs.

504
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:14,700
 If you're an animal fan, I'm sorry.

505
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,600
 We didn't rescue them, we killed them.

506
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:24,460
 So we set the traps, steel traps, put in some corn,

507
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,900
 little trail of corn leading into it.

508
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:28,940
 The hog walks in, hits the trip wire, door shuts,

509
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:31,820
 shoot the hog, leave it for the vultures, circle of life.

510
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:36,020
 Some of you just tuned out, and some of you are like,

511
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:36,860
 I like him.

512
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,820
 (audience laughing)

513
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:40,760
 One shot, one kill.

514
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:43,740
 Anyway, that's how I'm training my son.

515
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:48,300
 But we go and we check the traps,

516
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:51,020
 and it's like hog, hog, hog, hog, baby hogs.

517
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:51,860
 That's a sad story.

518
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:54,400
 Anyway, we get to another one,

519
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:58,460
 we get to another one, and there's a white-tailed deer.

520
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:02,020
 And this deer is like, I mean, if I can make the sound,

521
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:04,500
 like, (hitting)

522
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:08,580
 just like shredding itself,

523
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:13,180
 full speed in a six by four steel cage,

524
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:17,500
 slamming its head as hard as it can into the sides,

525
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,120
 kicking, getting its legs stuck.

526
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,420
 It's got blood on its eyes.

527
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:22,340
 I mean, just like, oh my goodness, oh my goodness,

528
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:23,820
 I gotta get the deer out.

529
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:28,020
 And so I start walking up to it.

530
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:31,940
 And at this point, it's, I mean, it was going crazy.

531
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:35,860
 Now it's like bonafide out of its mind, this poor deer.

532
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:37,720
 You can see, like, I mean, its tongue's hanging out.

533
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,620
 It hasn't had water for hours.

534
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:43,060
 It went in for the corn, and now it's like so trapped.

535
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:44,980
 It thinks I'm like there to kill it.

536
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:47,220
 It's probably heard about me from the hogs, but I'm not.

537
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,220
 I'm there to free it.

538
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:50,780
 And I'm walking up, and I'm now,

539
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:52,500
 at this point it feels even dangerous

540
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,820
 because this thing is flailing.

541
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:57,020
 And Laura's like, be careful, be careful.

542
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:58,940
 I'm like, God, who are you talking to?

543
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:01,500
 And I've gotta release the spring,

544
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:04,060
 this big, like, garage door spring.

545
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:06,420
 And then I, like, take the latch,

546
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:08,940
 and it's like freaking out at the other side of the cage.

547
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:11,900
 I swing the door open, and once that thing

548
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,960
 sees just a little two by three,

549
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,900
 no longer any kind of mesh, bolts,

550
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:19,660
 like as fast and far as it can.

551
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:21,960
 And in that moment, it feels so free.

552
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:25,900
 But it's actually running to certain death.

553
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:30,320
 Like, the best thing in the world for that deer to do

554
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,540
 would be to just, like, lay down at my feet.

555
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:33,740
 Dude, we'd adopt that thing.

556
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:36,880
 My daughter, Penny, she would be, like,

557
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,020
 the best deer whisperer to that little injured deer.

558
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:42,140
 Like, I mean, we would adopt it.

559
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:42,980
 We would care for it.

560
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:43,980
 It'd be the best thing in the world.

561
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:47,860
 Like, hand feed it, baby bottle of whatever deers drink.

562
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:48,700
 Is deer even a word?

563
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:49,820
 Deer, not plural?

564
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:50,660
 Anyway.

565
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:54,380
 And yet it just runs away.

566
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:58,100
 And I think so often, God walks up to us,

567
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,660
 and we're in that cage of sin,

568
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:00,800
 and we're like, no, no, no.

569
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,800
 You're here to do something to me.

570
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,920
 You wanna take away my desire to date

571
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:07,480
 and my desire for marriage or my aspirations at work?

572
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,560
 I know what you're up to.

573
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,600
 I know what you're doing.

574
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,360
 You're here to take away.

575
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,080
 And he's like, no, I'm here to free you.

576
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,920
 And he gets us free, and we're like, see ya.

577
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,640
 Joke's on you.

578
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,600
 And the best thing in the world is that we'd be like,

579
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,680
 dude, you saved me?

580
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:26,360
 I'll surrender everything to you.

581
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,560
 I'm not going anywhere.

582
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,280
 I will be right here.

583
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:33,000
 If you're so good to put yourself at risk,

584
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,760
 walk up to me, set me free,

585
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,980
 why would I ever run away from you?

586
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:37,920
 And yet we do.

587
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,280
 We don't trust.

588
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:43,640
 It says in Romans chapter eight

589
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:47,160
 that life in accordance with the Spirit,

590
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,920
 the mind in accordance with the Spirit,

591
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,780
 is life and peace.

592
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:52,640
 Isn't that what all of us want?

593
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,660
 Just life and peace.

594
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:59,140
 That the anxiety, the worry, the fear, the doubt,

595
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:03,680
 the condemnation, the shame of the sexual sin,

596
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:08,520
 the chasing after money and status

597
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,060
 like I did for all my life,

598
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:14,280
 the haunting shame from maybe a past abortion,

599
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:17,960
 the condemnation you may feel from a divorce,

600
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:24,020
 the shame and even though it wasn't your fault,

601
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:25,620
 and I'm speaking first person

602
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:28,100
 of the sexual abuse I experienced as a kid

603
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,180
 that maybe you did also,

604
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:30,980
 like, well, I'm not gonna tell anybody.

605
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,060
 I won't be loved.

606
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:37,780
 The control and anxiety that's just got you wrecked.

607
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:42,900
 And we want Jesus to free us, give us salvation,

608
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,460
 and then we just bolt.

609
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:46,460
 Like, I'll just do it on my own.

610
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:50,220
 And here tonight, you can be saved and surrender.

611
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:53,820
 We don't have to run away.

612
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:57,300
 He's come to save us and he's come to keep us safe.

613
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:00,140
 That deer probably got eaten by a coyote

614
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:01,980
 or shot by a hunter.

615
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,740
 If it would've stayed with me,

616
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:06,120
 everything would've been fine.

617
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,900
 And so that we would not only be saved,

618
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:13,900
 but we would be safe by staying with the one who frees us.

619
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:21,440
 It goes on in Psalm 40, verse eight.

620
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,900
 So I talked about how he saves us

621
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,620
 and here it is, his surrendering.

622
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:27,300
 He says, "I delight to do your will."

623
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,220
 Oh my God.

624
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:30,940
 That there's now this delight of like,

625
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:34,620
 man, it is exhausting trying to live my life my way,

626
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:36,480
 that I would somehow have all the wisdom,

627
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,420
 all the power, all the charm, all the luck, all the,

628
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:42,540
 it's like, no, that's exhausting.

629
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:44,020
 Now it's your will.

630
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:46,580
 It's your will by your power for your glory.

631
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:48,220
 And so there's that surrendering

632
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:50,420
 that just like floods in peace tonight

633
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,780
 that can be for you.

634
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:55,860
 Because you are the lamb of Psalm 40

635
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:58,020
 and Christ is the bog rider.

636
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,580
 And you were saved to be surrendered

637
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:02,160
 and you were surrendered to be a sacrifice,

638
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,340
 not that would lead unto death like David's,

639
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:06,180
 but that we would be a living sacrifice.

640
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:09,700
 So you go to Romans 12, verse one,

641
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,740
 walks through the entirety of the gospel

642
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:13,580
 and you get to chapter 12, verse one,

643
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:16,740
 and he says, "Therefore," Paul, writing by the Spirit,

644
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:20,100
 "Therefore, in view of God's mercy,"

645
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:23,060
 and the mercy is that Christ entered

646
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:25,520
 into the bog of sin and death,

647
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:29,380
 that he left heaven, took on flesh,

648
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:32,100
 lived a sinless life, was persecuted,

649
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:35,100
 and hit, and scorned, and shamed,

650
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,500
 and beard torn out, and spit upon,

651
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:42,060
 and struck, and crown of thorns, and nailed to a cross.

652
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:44,820
 And it says, as if that wasn't enough physically,

653
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:48,780
 in Colossians chapter two, it says that the legal decree

654
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:51,900
 that stood opposed to us, this God set aside,

655
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:54,700
 nailing it to the cross.

656
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:57,860
 That not only did he take all of that physical suffering,

657
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:00,980
 that every single sin that you have committed,

658
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:03,820
 if you were in Christ, was spiritually that way.

659
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,060
 You know when you commit sin

660
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:07,460
 and you feel that guilt and condemnation?

661
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:10,100
 All of that was laid upon Jesus.

662
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:12,340
 The legal decree in which Satan said,

663
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:14,140
 "They're guilty, God, you know it.

664
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,140
 "Here it is.

665
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:17,420
 "Here's all their sin.

666
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:18,820
 "They're guilty."

667
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:25,220
 God said, "You're right, and I'm nailing it to the cross."

668
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:29,540
 And all of that was laid upon Jesus.

669
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:32,340
 He died the death that we deserved,

670
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:37,340
 was laid in the tomb, and three days later, rose again.

671
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:38,180
 - Amen.

672
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:43,180
 - He went in to the bog of sin and death for you.

673
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:47,940
 Hear me when I say it's not just that it's true,

674
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:52,580
 it is for you tonight, tonight.

675
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:55,620
 And it's not just that you might be saved,

676
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:59,140
 but that you would also be surrendered

677
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:00,820
 and quit living a double life.

678
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:02,900
 Jesus said, "You can't serve two masters.

679
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:04,300
 "You know it experientially."

680
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,500
 Like, this is exhausting,

681
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:09,780
 trying to live the Dallas life and the Christ life.

682
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:13,140
 And I can't enjoy either one.

683
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,300
 'Cause I'm convicted when I'm here,

684
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:21,900
 and I feel like I'm maybe missing out when I'm here.

685
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:26,900
 And so, put to death the desires of the flesh by the Spirit.

686
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,460
 Live a surrendered life,

687
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:32,820
 and tonight, you can choose, you get it all.

688
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,820
 You saved me from all, you get it all.

689
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:37,380
 And not only to be surrendered,

690
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:39,080
 but that you would speak about it.

691
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:42,540
 That's the outline of Psalm 40.

692
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:45,820
 You've been saved, you surrender,

693
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:47,780
 and then you speak about it.

694
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:49,540
 And why would you speak about it?

695
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:53,300
 'Cause there's 3,000 people here,

696
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,220
 there's however many viewing in Fort Worth,

697
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:57,980
 Indianapolis, Tulsa, and all beyond.

698
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:00,940
 And so, great, you're here, you're hearing about it.

699
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:02,820
 Good news for you.

700
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:03,980
 Well, you're gonna go to work,

701
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,260
 you're gonna go to your internship,

702
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:06,380
 you're gonna go back to your roommates,

703
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:09,500
 you're gonna go back to your family on summer vacation,

704
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:12,500
 you're gonna be interacting with a waitress at a restaurant,

705
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:17,820
 and they have sin, you can be sure of it.

706
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:20,180
 But maybe they don't have a Savior.

707
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:22,820
 And so, you can tell 'em about the great bog rider.

708
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:25,700
 Just like my grandfather told about me,

709
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,140
 and I got to tell about him.

710
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:33,920
 Because Laura and I had been saved,

711
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,940
 we then lived to speak about him to others.

712
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:39,880
 And so, there we are, now on my knees again,

713
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,860
 but this time with my dying grandfather

714
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:44,440
 sitting in a easy chair.

715
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,980
 And he would never leave that easy chair

716
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:49,780
 until he went to his bed in which he would die in.

717
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:51,980
 And we're sitting there,

718
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:56,900
 and we're saying, hey, it's about to get dark.

719
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,460
 You're going to die.

720
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:00,360
 And when you do, you'll face judgment.

721
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:04,600
 And you will spend eternity in heaven or hell.

722
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,440
 Are you ready?

723
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,400
 Is there anything keeping you

724
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,000
 from placing your faith in Jesus?

725
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 And he resisted and resisted and resisted,

726
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,160
 and we persisted and persisted and persisted.

727
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:26,080
 And I said, before you die, and you will,

728
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:32,760
 just say, Jesus, I'm a sinner, save me.

729
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,120
 That's all you have to say.

730
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,280
 You just cry out from the barn, that's it.

731
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:40,320
 Waited patiently for the Lord,

732
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,560
 he inclined and heard my cry,

733
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:44,120
 just say, Jesus, I'm a sinner, save me.

734
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:48,720
 And my grandfather looked at me,

735
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:52,160
 and he said, Jesus, I'm a sinner, save me.

736
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:55,440
 It's the first time he'd ever said

737
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,400
 anything close to Christianity.

738
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:02,240
 And I said, dawg, are you just saying that to me,

739
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,320
 or are you praying a prayer?

740
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,840
 'Cause I can have an atheist say those words.

741
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:11,360
 And he said, Jesus, I'm a sinner, save me.

742
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:14,520
 And I said, would you like for me

743
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,600
 to lead you in a prayer right now,

744
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:21,080
 to receive the free gift of salvation in Jesus Christ,

745
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,800
 to receive the forgiveness of sins,

746
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,680
 to receive the Holy Spirit, to be born again,

747
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,840
 and to go to heaven when you die.

748
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:31,480
 And he reached out these decaying, feeble,

749
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:36,440
 cancer-filled body hands, and said, I'm ready.

750
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:41,680
 And I just pray, and we've been praying all day,

751
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:47,160
 that you're ready, that you're ready tonight.

752
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:50,800
 Don't delay.

753
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:55,400
 There's a whole world of temptation

754
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,000
 and deception out there waiting.

755
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,680
 So some need to trust in Jesus tonight

756
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,880
 for the forgiveness of sins,

757
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:06,800
 and others need to be like, I'm done serving two masters.

758
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,680
 Tonight's your night.

759
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:12,160
 I surrender all to be saved and surrender,

760
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,680
 and then to speak out for others.

761
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:19,280
 He trusted in Jesus, and in the midst of that,

762
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,480
 my wife was going through breast cancer.

763
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,120
 She's okay now, but in the midst of it,

764
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,800
 we didn't know what was gonna happen.

765
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,640
 And in the midst of that breast cancer journey,

766
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:29,360
 this is two years ago, I'm just like,

767
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,120
 okay, God, could you speak to me?

768
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,360
 Like, I see, you know, people are bringing meals.

769
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,400
 That's nice.

770
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,960
 I need a little more than food right now.

771
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,880
 I could use a word from you, and I'm reading your word,

772
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,000
 I'm searching the scriptures,

773
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
 and if you could just say something,

774
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,080
 like the silence is painful.

775
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,960
 And you said, the Holy Spirit's the comforter

776
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:50,280
 and the counselor, and I'm not hearing anything,

777
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,560
 and this would be a really good time to speak,

778
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,800
 'cause my wife has breast cancer,

779
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,920
 and I got three little kids,

780
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,040
 and I don't wanna be single dad,

781
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,680
 and could you just say something?

782
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,400
 And there was silence.

783
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:04,720
 And I shared the story about the bog rider in church,

784
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,880
 and then I got this text of a picture.

785
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:12,040
 And I was like, the second I looked at it,

786
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:17,200
 I heard, not audibly, but in my mind,

787
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:20,520
 God say, I'm carrying Laura.

788
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:24,280
 I'm carrying Laura.

789
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:29,720
 And I have, in a sense, that picture here for you tonight,

790
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:33,200
 because what you may not have known or realized,

791
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,200
 and likely don't, is that this whole time tonight,

792
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:39,800
 someone's been at work.

793
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,640
 They've been at work very intentionally,

794
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:44,440
 very purposefully, making something,

795
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:48,400
 creating something to portray the gospel.

796
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:55,200
 Just like tonight, in your hearing,

797
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:58,480
 all your life, from birth until this point tonight,

798
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:02,680
 on June 13th, God has been at work.

799
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,120
 He has been at work in all the design,

800
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:08,200
 in all the detail, in all the redemption,

801
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,800
 in all the pain, in all the difficulty.

802
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:15,600
 He has been working unto tonight

803
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,160
 that you would be saved or surrendered.

804
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,080
 And so I want to now show you,

805
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:26,960
 and introduce to you, a friend, a brother in Christ.

806
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,080
 And what's been happening this entire time,

807
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:31,200
 as we've been talking about the Bog Rider,

808
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:39,840
 is there's been this sketch.

809
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:44,520
 And this sketch, by our friend

810
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,880
 and brother in Christ right here, John Fleming,

811
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,360
 that was the gift someone gave to me.

812
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,160
 You're gonna see it on the screen, the completion.

813
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,160
 This is a print.

814
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,080
 And I'm gonna let him tell you what the name of it is

815
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,440
 and why he created it.

816
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:59,640
 John doesn't want me to say this,

817
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:03,040
 but I want you to know that he's a world-renowned artist,

818
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,120
 and he's a brother in Christ.

819
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:07,800
 And this work has great spiritual meaning.

820
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,880
 When I saw this picture on my phone,

821
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:13,040
 I was like, I heard God say, "I'm carrying Laura."

822
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,600
 And then somebody gave me this.

823
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,840
 If you come into my office ever,

824
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:20,440
 you're gonna see that print in that frame on my wall,

825
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,720
 because I want everyone to know

826
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:24,080
 about Christ the great Bog Rider,

827
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,960
 and that he saved us and he'll keep us safe.

828
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:28,400
 And so I asked John, I said, "Will you come?

829
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,280
 "And would you do this?"

830
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:34,640
 And he's like, "Man, I don't want it to be about me."

831
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:37,080
 And I was like, "It won't be, it's about Jesus.

832
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:39,720
 "That's why you painted it in the first place."

833
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:42,800
 And so I want John to now share what he shared with me.

834
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,880
 - Thanks, John.

835
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:49,560
 So John and I have been having some conversations

836
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:52,160
 over the last several weeks,

837
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,960
 but we had a conversation yesterday

838
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:58,960
 and he just asked me to share with him

839
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,520
 what this piece means.

840
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,520
 And I just said, "Hey, John."

841
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:07,440
 I said, "Savior is based on a photo I saw

842
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:12,000
 "of a cowboy or Bog Rider carrying a calf.

843
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:17,280
 "The added symbolism tells the story of trouble all around.

844
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:24,440
 "You've got obvious signs,

845
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:29,280
 "cactus, rough terrain, storms.

846
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:39,120
 "The added symbolism tells the story of trouble all around.

847
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:44,120
 "Some that we even tangle with and get caught up in.

848
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:48,320
 "But the Father is there to save, forgive,

849
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:51,360
 "and reconcile us to him.

850
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:57,840
 "It is never too late to come to him and be forgiven,

851
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:02,400
 "restored, renewed, whether you're a believer

852
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:06,400
 "who has strayed," and there's another picture

853
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:11,400
 of a cow or a calf running away from the cowboy,

854
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:17,960
 "whether you're a believer who has strayed

855
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:22,160
 "or rebelled or an unbeliever coming to Jesus

856
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,360
 "for the first time."

857
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:28,560
 And then in Psalm 40, verses 12 and 13,

858
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:32,880
 I just shared this, or I added this to my text to John.

859
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,720
 I just said, because this really spoke to me.

860
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:40,560
 I said, "For troubles without numbers surround me.

861
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:44,880
 "My sins have overtaken me and I cannot see.

862
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,640
 "They are more than the hairs of my head

863
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:51,080
 "and my heart fails within me.

864
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:53,800
 "Be pleased to save me, Lord.

865
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,680
 "Come quickly, Lord, to help me."

866
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,960
 And the reason those verses spoke to me

867
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:03,960
 and just 100% transparency here is because

868
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:08,400
 I came to Jesus as a boy of eight years old,

869
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:15,000
 but this season of life, I've really been struggling

870
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,560
 with pride and selfishness,

871
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:22,400
 and that's just real transparent.

872
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:27,400
 And so I just want you guys to know that,

873
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:34,280
 as John has already shared, that surrender is key,

874
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:38,360
 and I think that that's something,

875
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:42,000
 as a believer for many years,

876
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:47,320
 I have been that stray and I have wandered,

877
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:51,720
 and God is reconciling me to him,

878
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:56,000
 and it's a painful process, but it's, like I mentioned,

879
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:56,880
 it's never too late.

880
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,120
 So John, thanks for letting me be here.

881
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:00,960
 - Thank you, John.

882
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:01,800
 Glory to brother.

883
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:04,960
 (audience applauding)

884
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:16,140
 - So it says in Psalm 40,

885
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:20,680
 we can be saved to surrender and then to speak.

886
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:23,080
 I wanna read to you now the ones about speaking.

887
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:28,880
 David says, "Having been saved by Christ,

888
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:31,200
 "I will proclaim and tell them,

889
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:34,360
 "yet there are more that can be told."

890
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:37,640
 That's of God's wondrous deeds and thoughts towards us.

891
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:40,060
 "I will proclaim and tell of them,

892
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:42,520
 "yet there are more than can be told."

893
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:43,480
 And then in verse nine, he says,

894
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:47,140
 "I have told the glad news of deliverance

895
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:49,080
 "in the great congregation.

896
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:52,580
 "Behold, I have not restrained my lips,

897
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:53,900
 "as you know, O Lord.

898
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:56,300
 "I have not hidden your deliverance within my heart.

899
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:59,720
 "I have spoken of your faithfulness and your salvation.

900
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:02,340
 "I have not concealed your steadfast love

901
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:05,760
 "and your faithfulness from the great congregation."

902
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,640
 And then the title of the Psalm,

903
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:08,980
 you find in the very last line,

904
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:11,600
 "As for me, I am poor and needy."

905
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:13,860
 It's like he never forgot.

906
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:17,400
 Man, I surrendered once and for all, and I surrender daily.

907
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:18,480
 I need the gospel daily.

908
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,920
 "As for me, I am poor and needy,

909
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:22,760
 "but the Lord takes thought of me.

910
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:27,300
 "You are my help and my deliverer.

911
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:29,440
 "Do not delay, O my God."

912
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:36,680
 And I would say, "Do not delay tonight."

913
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:39,480
 The band's gonna come back up,

914
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:42,640
 and we're gonna sing a song in response

915
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:45,940
 to the great Bog Rider, Jesus Christ, our Lord.

916
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:48,800
 And I wanna invite some of you,

917
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,800
 and I don't care if you're in the last row of the balcony,

918
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,000
 it'll only take a few seconds,

919
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,940
 but there's gonna be a team up front here,

920
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:58,140
 and they can come forward now to receive you,

921
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:01,160
 that you might receive Christ.

922
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:04,600
 So tonight, if you wanna come forward and be like,

923
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:07,880
 I wanna place my faith in Jesus,

924
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:10,640
 and I wanna be forgiven of my sins,

925
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:13,800
 and come forward tonight as this song plays.

926
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,160
 And if you're like, I need to surrender,

927
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:17,320
 I've been saved, but I've been living the double life.

928
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:19,120
 I've been living with two masters,

929
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:22,520
 and now I want to surrender tonight, June 13th.

930
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:26,840
 I wanna surrender all, Him not just be Savior, but be Lord.

931
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:28,760
 And I don't wanna just be free,

932
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:32,880
 I wanna stay by my Savior, and come forward too.

933
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,760
 As they bring down the lights and the band goes on,

934
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:40,760
 this place is open, and this time is yours, do not delay.

935
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:43,560
 Let's stand now and sing to Jesus.

936
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:53,560
